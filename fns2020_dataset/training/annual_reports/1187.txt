Annual Report and Accounts 2010
In my rst year as Chairman, I am pleased to be able to report 
growth in the underlying performance of our racecourse 
operations. We have outperformed the market in growth in 
average attendances, opened a new hotel, made signi cant 
progress on our Folkestone Racecourse development plan, 
continued the success of our catering operation and At The 
Races ( ATR’) has taken a ma or step forward in its pro t 
contribution. From 2012, the new media rights agreement 
with Satellite Information Services Ltd (‘SIS’) will increase 
income from media rights by an estimated £10.0m per 
annum and remains the obvious focus of the Group’s growth 
story. In addition, recent major capital investments, further 
operational improvements and an increased return from the 
distribution of international media rights through ATR will 
provide further sustainable growth. Following the year-end 
we announced our rst major external catering contract as 
provider of catering services at both the Eton Dorney and 
the Greenwich Park venues for the Olympic and Paralympic 
Games in 2012.
As a backdrop to Arena’s performance and prospects, 
the horseracing industry has recently experienced a major 
reduction in the level of funding received from the Levy on 
bookmakers which, when coupled with conditions in the UK 
economy, has exerted considerable nancial pressures on  
all of racing. The yield from the Levy is estimated to fall to 
£64.8m in 2010/11 as a result of the movement of internet 
and telephone betting ‘offshore’, the impact of overseas 
betting operators and betting exchanges. The Levy is 
fundamental to the support of horse racing in the UK and 
it is our belief that all parties should seek to maintain it in a 
modernised and restructured form. The recent determination 
by Government of the basis of the 2011/12 scheme to deliver 
a yield of £73.7m to £80.8m is encouraging in that it provides 
stability for funding at least at the current level. In the longer 
term, it will be important for the sustainability of the Levy for 
a future solution to encompass offshore operators and 
betting exchanges and their customers. 
The Group’s seven racecourses staged a total of 352 
 xtures in the year to 31 December 2010 (2009: 370) with 
the average attendance increasing by an industry-leading 
4.2% to 1,800 (2009: 1,727). Total attendance was 634,000 
(2009: 639,000) including 60,000 people (2009: 53,000) 
attending the Ladbrokes St Leger festival at Doncaster 
Racecourse. Hospitality attendance in 2010 increased 
by 17.1% to 45,200 (2009: 38,600) which is encouraging. 
The UK racing industry reported total attendance across 
all racecourses of 5.8 million, up from 5.7 million in 2009, 
with average attendances up by 3.4% (2009: 0.0%).

Annual Report and Accounts 2010
In October, Arena submitted its masterplan proposal for the 
redevelopment of Folkestone Racecourse to Shepway District 
Council (‘SDC’) as part of SDC’s process for drawing up its 
new Local Development Framework. The proposal is designed 
to safeguard the long-term future of Folkestone Racecourse 
and entails a complete rebuild of the Racecourse and the 
introduction of approximately 800 residential units. SDC is 
likely to report in the middle of 2011, after which there will  
be an examination-in-public, which is likely to conclude in 
Spring 2012.
On 1 March 2010, Arena’s 45.85% af liate, ATR, commenced 
its joint venture, GBI Racing, which provides a uni ed service 
for the international distribution of media rights from all UK 
and Irish racecourses. Cost savings from this combined 
operation, together with associated income growth and 
improved performance in ATR’s website and TV channel 
businesses, resulted in Arena’s share of ATR’s earnings 
increasing by 163% to £1.4m (2009: £0.5m). The royalty 
payments made directly to the Group’s racecourses by ATR 
under the terms of the media rights agreement increased 
by over 40% to £2.0m (2009: £1.4m).
The Board is pleased to announce that it is proposing 
a maintained nal dividend for 2010 of 0.38p per share  
(2009: 0.38p per share). In line with our stated policy, 
no interim dividend was paid during the year (2009: none).
I was appointed to the Board as Chairman on 19 May 2010. 
My predecessor, Raymond Mould, had been Chairman of 
Arena for four years, during which time the Group initiated 
its exciting real estate strategy, established a successful 
in-house catering function and secured a transformational 
agreement with SIS for the supply of media rights post-2011. 
On behalf of the Board, I would like to thank Raymond for 
his outstanding contribution to the development of Arena. 
There were no other changes to the Board during the year.
Since my appointment, I have come to appreciate even more 
the exceptional dedication and professionalism of Arena’s 
employees. In my opinion, they are second to none in their 
commitment to delivering an excellent product and service 
and I would like to convey the thanks of the Board to each  
of them.
Looking forward, 2011 will be another challenging year 
primarily as a result of the impact of the already announced 
reductions in Levy funding. As a result, our expectation is that 
Group pro tability is unlikely to see a material uplift from 
2010. I have highlighted the strengths of the Arena business 
and my belief is that the Group is extremely well placed to 
capitalise on future growth through media rights, operational 
performance and further estate development opportunities; 
2012 will be an exciting year in this respect.
David Thorpe 
Chairman 
7 March 2011
For the full year, Arena’s adjusted pro t before interest and 
tax was £5.4m, an increase of 10.4% from £4.9m in 2009 
(before a £0.4m gain on asset disposals). Arena’s total 
revenue for 2010 was £64.0m, down £1.2m (2009: £65.2m) 
following a £3.8m reduction in funding from the Levy which 
predominantly impacted prize money in the year. Income from 
media rights provided into licensed betting of ces (‘LBOs’) 
was consistent at £11.6m (2009: £11.6m), despite fewer 
 xtures being staged. Non-racing income has grown and more 
than half of the growth was generated by the Ling eld Park 
Marriott Hotel, bringing the share of revenue from activities 
not directly related to horseracing to 11.9% (2009: 8.7%).
Pro t before tax was £3.6m (2009: £4.1m, including a £0.4m 
gain on asset disposals). Within this, the net nance expense 
was £1.8m (2009: £1.2m), the increase of £0.6m being due 
predominantly to the funding costs of the Ling eld Park 
Marriott Hotel development no longer being capitalised as 
part of the cost of construction following its opening in May. 
Basic earnings per share were 1.02p (2009: 1.16p), down 
12.1%, principally as a result of this increased nance cost.
The rst customers of the newly constructed Ling eld Park 
Marriott Hotel and Country Club were welcomed in mid-May.  
The hotel is the centrepiece of the £30.0m redevelopment of 
Ling eld Park that creates the UK’s rst integrated hotel, golf, 
leisure and racing complex. We are delighted with the physical 
product, service levels and overall quality of this addition 
to our portfolio and are excited by the prospects of this 
complementary asset, which we expect to reach maturity 
through 2012 and into 2013. Pre-opening costs in the year 
were £0.5m (2009: £0.2m), in-line with our expectations.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Building operational excellence
In 2010 we continued to make 
good progress in all areas of 
our strategy whilst maintaining 
our focus on racing operations 
and further expanding our other 
income sources.
Operating overview
Operating results for the year ended 31 December 2010  
were encouraging in an environment that was heavily 
in uenced by external factors, including the continued 
challenging economic conditions; the pressures on funding 
caused by the reduced Levy yield from bookmakers; and the 
extreme weather conditions in both the early and later parts 
of the year. Despite these challenges, we have been able to 
increase underlying adjusted pro t before interest and tax*  
by 10.4% to £5.4m (2009: £4.9m). In so doing, we have 
increased the pro t contribution from racecourse operations 
by 3.8% to £7.2m (2009: £7.0m)**. ATR has shown excellent 
growth and contributed £1.4m to Arena through our 45.85% 
equity share (2009: £0.5m).
We have been able to improve average attendances, 
hospitality revenues and catering pro ts in 2010. The 
raceday experience that we offer continues to evolve with our 
high-quality catering offering proving an ever more important 
element in differentiating our raceday customer experience. 
Themed racedays, whether the more traditional ‘Ladies Day’  
or newer ‘Racing and Music’ nights, ‘Family Fundays’ or  
other speci c events, have proved increasingly popular.  
These events not only provide a broader appeal for the 
race-goer but also allow us to target our marketing activities 
in a consumer-speci c way. We have further plans for 2011 
to build on this success with additional themed days and an 
evolution of our marketing approach, including online through 
our website and social media channels, as well as with 
greater customer relationship management.
Arena’s racing operations are recognised for their quality 
and for the professionalism and dedication of our racing 
staff. These strengths, combined with the exibility of our 
three all-weather racecourses, enabled the Group to stage 
352 xtures in the year across our seven racecourses, 
including during periods of severe adverse weather. During 
December 2010, 48% of scheduled UK racing was lost to 
the weather conditions. However, Arena staged the expected 
number of xtures with six abandonments being replaced with 
six extra xtures at short notice. In total, we lost 18 xtures 
in the year (2009: eight) and staged 14 extra xtures at short 
notice (2009: four). The net impact of December’s weather 
conditions on Arena’s pro t was a £0.3m reduction as a result 
of a 14,000 fall in total attendance compared to the prior year 
and a number of cancelled non-racing meetings and events.
Our in-house catering operation is fully integrated into each 
racecourse, allowing us to utilise synergies across each site 
and align revenue generation. On a Group-wide basis we are 
able to leverage expertise through shared resources and 
purchasing power through national supplier contracts. Quality 
of product and service, one of the key drivers of our in-house 
strategy, has continued to improve from an already high level. 
On 10 February 2011, we announced that Arena had 
successfully tendered to The London Organising Committee  
of The Olympic Games and Paralympic Games (‘LOCOG’) and 
had been awarded the contract to provide catering services at 
both the Eton Dorney and the Greenwich Park venues as part 
of the Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012. Eton Dorney 
will be home to the sprint canoeing and rowing events and 
Greenwich Park will be home to the equestrian and modern 
pentathlon events. The contract contains elements of both 
 xed income and variable income that is dependent upon the 
numbers of attendees and spend per head and the Board

This rst phase project is expected to cost £1.0m and

Industry funding
Reductions in funding from the Levy are having a major impact 
on racecourses and all participants in the racing industry. The 
yield from the Levy on bookmakers has fallen from £75.4m 
in 2009/10 to an estimated £64.8m in 2010/11, with a 
consequent impact on the funds distributed to racing. Arena 
suffered a reduction in funding for 2010 which had a £0.3m 
pro t impact through reduced direct incentive payments and 
prize money contributions, which were then supplemented 
by Arena. As previously announced, the impact on 2011 is 
more signi cant, with further reductions to xture incentive 
payments of £0.8m and reductions in payments to support 
operational running costs of £0.7m, both of which will directly 
impact pro t. The Levy Board has also taken the unusual step 
of making certain xtures available with either no or partial 
funding for prize money. Arena has secured 48 partially funded 
 xtures and 36 xtures with no funding for prize money which, 
whilst each of these will still be pro table and are important in 
maintaining our xture list, will be consequently less pro table 
than fully funded xtures.
The racing industry and bookmakers failed to reach agreement 
on the form of the Levy scheme for 2011/12 and so it was 
referred to Government for ‘determination’. On 16 February 
2011, a statement from the Minister responsible set out the 
new terms. These are estimated to deliver a yield of £73.7m 
to £80.8m, which would be above the level of the current 
2011 budgeted Levy expenditure of £60.0m. Our expectation 
is that this uplift will predominantly bene t prize money, which 
will assist in improving race programmes and/or Levy Board 
reserves, and will therefore have minimal short-term impact 
on racecourse pro tability. Over the medium term it will help 
to protect growth. Maintenance of the Levy in a revised form 
is considered important by the Arena Board and in the medium 
term we will seek a solution that addresses offshore operators 
and betting exchanges and their customers that have so far 
not been addressed by the current ‘determination’.
Outlook
Despite a challenging trading environment, Arena’s core 
business moved forward successfully in 2010. Improved 
average racecourse attendances, together with good 
development of ATR’s international media rights business, 
have helped to mitigate the continuing pressure on hospitality 
spend and the impact of reduced industry funding. The 
Review of Operations on page 19 provides further details. 
Arena remains well placed with its increasingly diversi ed 
income streams, notably through in-house catering, ATR 
media distribution and the Ling eld Park Marriott Hotel. 
However, due to the signi cant reduction in Levy yield we 
expect another challenging year and, on that basis, we do 
not anticipate material overall growth in 2011. Trading in 
the current year to date is in line with these expectations. 
With the signi cant successes achieved over the last few 
years, the prospects for 2012 are signi cantly brighter.
Mark Elliott 
Chief Executive 
7 March 2011
currently estimates that Arena’s 2012 net pro t contribution 
from the contract will be in the range of £0.5m to £1.0m.
Media rights
Arena licenses the right to use the media content of racing 
from its racecourses through two main channels: to LBOs 
in the UK and Ireland and internationally, online and via 
non-terrestrial TV, through ATR. Revenue from these rights 
amounted to £13.6m (2009: £13.0m) and represents 21.3% 
of total revenue (2009: 19.9%). 
The Group has secured 353 scheduled xtures for 2011  
and we have a reasonable expectation that we will be able 
to secure a similar xture list for 2012 and beyond. Each 
of these xtures will generate income from the LBO market 
which, from 1 January 2012, will arise pursuant to a new 
 ve-year contract with SIS. The Board has estimated that this 
new contract will have a total value of £106.0m over its term, 
which compares to the current ve-year contract that will have 
delivered an estimated £55.6m of income to Arena between 
2007 and 2011. Advanced payments of £12.5m were 
received by Arena on both 22 July 2009 and 22 July 2010.  
A third payment of £7.0m is due on 22 July 2011. The balance 
of the estimated revenue is due over the ve-year term and 
is linked to the number of races run at Arena’s racecourses.
Real estate development
Arena has been successful in achieving planning permissions 
and executing developments that both enhance racecourse 
assets and create value from surplus land. During 2010, the 
most recent of these developments was completed and the 
Ling eld Park Marriott Hotel and Country Club opened in May 
after a £30.0m investment.
Arena is also pursuing development projects at four  
other racecourses: 
  In October 2010, Arena submitted its masterplan for 
the redevelopment of Folkestone Racecourse as part of 
SDC’s process for drawing up its new Local Development 
Framework. The proposal safeguards the future of the 
Racecourse via a complete rebuild, funded by the 
introduction of approximately 800 residential units. SDC 
is likely to report in the middle of 2011, after which there 
will be an examination-in-public, which is likely to conclude 
in Spring 2012;
  Wolverhampton Racecourse has planning consent for a 
combined hotel and casino development that extends the 
existing hotel from 54 to 170 bedrooms. This project is 
dependent upon the grant of a small casino licence from 
Wolverhampton City Council. It is anticipated that tender 
applications will be invited for this licence in August 2011, 
with the nal award expected in Summer 2012. We will 
participate in the tender and our belief is that the mixed-use 
scheme of casino, racecourse and an extension to the 
existing hotel will provide a compelling proposition;
  Doncaster Racecourse has planning consent for a 
120-bedroom hotel and 34 residential units. This consent 
was recently extended until mid-2013. The Board remains 
con dent of the commercial viability of this scheme and 
of its complementary nature to the existing facilities; and
  At Royal Windsor Racecourse the rst part of a medium-
term redevelopment programme was commenced with the 
construction of a new entrance building housing of ces 
and a food outlet. There will also be an expansion and 
Chief Executive’s Statement 08 Arena Leisure Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Consumer demand/economic conditions
Whilst the UK has technically been out of recession throughout 
2010, any recovery in demand and consumer spend levels 
has been slow to materialise. Arena’s racecourses tend 
to operate in predominantly local markets with individual 
characteristics of demand. Across the Group we have seen 
some improvement in business levels but this remains fragile 
and hence we remain cautious on signi cant growth for 2011.
Outside our core racing business there has been some 
improvement in demand for conference and events business. 
Although, in the later part of the year, occupancy levels at 
the Ling eld Park Marriott Hotel were depressed, in keeping 
with market conditions at other UK provincial hotels, with the 
freezing weather also causing a number of conference and 
event cancellations. Looking forward, we have experienced 
some good levels of enquiries for events business in the early 
part of 2011, but lead times remain very short and visibility 
of bookings for later in the year is limited.
Racecourses and attendances
The pro le of racecourses in 2010 remained unchanged from 
that in 2009 with 60 racecourses in operation. More than half 
of these racecourses are owned or managed by one of the three 
main racing groups, Arena, Northern Racing and Jockey Club 
Racecourses. The remaining independent racecourses have a 
mixture of public and private ownership structures. Across the 
60 racecourses a total of 1,392 xtures were staged in 2010 
(2009: 1,427 xtures) of which Arena hosted 352 (2009: 370), 
representing 25% (2009: 26%). Arena’s unique portfolio 
includes three of the four all-weather racetracks in the UK, 
enabling it to race many more times each week, through all 
weeks of the year and, at Wolverhampton, in the evenings 
under oodlights. In 2011 the industry has scheduled 
a total of 1,480 xtures, of which Arena will stage 353.

Total UK racecourses 60 1,392 (100%)
* Including Ffos Las under management.
Total attendance across all UK racecourses was 5.8 million, 
slightly ahead of 2009 (5.7 million). Historic trends have 
shown that public attendance at racecourses is relatively 
resilient to the economic cycle and this has continued to be 
the case in recent times. Average attendance grew by 3.4% 
to 4,145 (2009: 4,008) and would have been higher without 
the major impact of December’s freezing weather, when 
nearly a half of all UK race meetings were abandoned. The 
racing industry launched its ‘Racing for Change’ initiative with 
the speci c intention of improving the quality and perception 
of racing and broadening its appeal. A free racing week in April 
generated over 40,000 in attendance and included meetings at 
Arena’s Wolverhampton and Doncaster Racecourses. Market 
statistics on hospitality trends are not readily available; 
however taking Arena’s performance as an indication, 
we have seen some moderate recovery in business levels 
in 2010. With consumers seeking value for money, however, 
admissions-related revenues are only moderately higher. 
Market Overview
Despite economic conditions remaining dif cult, 
the racing industry has seen an overall increase in 
attendances in 2010. Arena’s seven racecourses have 
again hosted more than a quarter of all UK racing with 
above average attendance growth in the year.
Banqueting 
All of Arena’s 
racecourses offer 
conference and 
banqueting facilities 
on and off racedays.
Hospitality 
Arena’s team of 
chefs serve up to 
85,000 people in 
hospitality suites and 
restaurants each year. Strategy

Industry funding
A critical issue facing the racing industry through 2010 and 
2011 is the signi cant decline in the yield of the Levy. The Levy 
on bookmakers’ pro ts from UK horseracing has provided 
signi cant funds to racing for nearly 50 years. The largest 
proportion provides for prize money, followed by contributions 
to the costs of running racing and to central and administrative 
functions. In the past the Levy reached a peak of £115.3m, 
and for the current scheme that runs until the end of March 
2011, the expected yield is £64.8m. This substantial fall is 
largely the result of the movement offshore of previously 
UK-domiciled telephone and internet betting, the growth of 
offshore online bookmakers, the advent of betting exchanges 
and the increasing number of high street betting shops falling 
outside the full Levy charge. Reductions in funding levels have 
substantially impacted prize money levels and in 2011 will 
have an impact on racecourse pro tability through reductions 
in race meeting cost contributions. In addition, some xtures 
in 2011 will not receive any or will receive only partial prize 
money funding with racecourses choosing to self-fund these 
meetings at consequently reduced pro t levels.
Following the failure to agree the mechanism for the calculation 
of the Levy for the period 2011/12, that scheme was referred to 
Government for ‘determination’. In February 2011, the 
determination was announced with an estimated yield of 
£73.7m to £80.8m. The scheme will be based on an increased 
headline rate of 10.75% of UK horseracing gross pro ts 
(2010/11: 10.0%), with a reduction in the pro t threshold below 
which LBOs pay a reduced rate, to £50,000 (2010/11: £89,000).

Strategy
Strategy and Business Model
Our portfolio of racecourse 
assets provides a solid base for 
future development of the Group 
into a range of complementary,  
income-generating activities.
The key aspects of Arena’s strategy are 
encompassed in the following themes: 
  Continuing to capitalise on the 
intellectual property value of the 
rights to racing content that can be 
sold through intermediaries in the 
UK and in international markets
   Investing in major developments 
that allow continued diversi cation 
of racecourse earning streams
   Leveraging the core fundamentals 
of our operating business through:
 – Racing operations;
 –  Catering in-house and for third  
parties; and
 – Venue and facilities management
   Acquisitions that build on our core 
skills and operations. These are likely 
to be opportunistic in nature
Arena has been successful in exploiting the value of its racing 
media rights via licence to bookmakers for use in LBOs and 
internationally through ATR. This product is unique in UK racing, 
with our seven racecourses accounting for over one-quarter 
of all UK horseracing and the ability to supply live content 
throughout the year during the day and into the evening.
The Group has secured planning consents and managed 
the subsequent development of leisure assets on our 
racecourses; Doncaster Racecourse was redeveloped and 
reopened in 2007 and the Ling eld Park Marriott Hotel 
and leisure development completed in 2010. Future major 
projects include the Wolverhampton ‘racino’ and the 
Doncaster hotel and residential scheme, which both have 
planning consent. We are progressing, and remain hopeful 
of, a successful residential planning application at Folkestone 
Racecourse allowing the complete redevelopment of that site 
and securing the future of the Racecourse.
The cash-generative operational business has remained 
consistently pro table through a dif cult trading market and 
has continued to develop in terms of both operating margins 
and the quality and variety of product that we are able to 
offer customers. Having established our in-house catering 
operation in 2007, we have now been able to secure our rst 
major outside contract with the provision of catering services 
to two London Olympic venues in 2012. 
Arena is not dependent on any single revenue stream or 
revenue driver, with almost 50% of the Company’s revenues 
derived from long-term, contracted sources, such as the Levy 
and media rights income. Combined with additional hotel, golf 
and events revenues, Arena has positioned itself to ensure 
that the Company is not dependent on revenues generated 
purely by attendance.

Resources
The Group achieves its strategic and business objectives 
through the deployment of key resources including the people  
it employs, relationships with customers and suppliers and 
intellectual property inherent in the business.
People
The skills and dedication of our employees are key to the 
success of Arena’s business. Recognising this, the Group 
devotes itself to the recruitment, training and retention of 
the highest calibre employees. 
Employees are rewarded according to their contribution and 
capability and to incentivise them to support the Group’s 
activities and strategies. Arena’s reward framework takes into 
account incentives, bene ts, share schemes and Long Term 
Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) awards, as well as base pay.
Emphasis is placed on the training and development of staff to 
maintain high morale and motivation. Arena employs a Group 
Training Of cer who is responsible for overseeing the training 
and development of all staff. Regular training is provided for 
racecourse management teams, and they are tasked with 
ensuring the development of their staff. A regular review 
process is in place to monitor these procedures, ensuring 
that the development motivates staff, as evidenced by the 
low staff turnover rate across the Group.
On racedays Arena relies on a casual workforce for whom 
the Group is responsible for training and development. The 
Group aims to provide a high-level of training to encourage 
individuals to work for Arena regularly, enabling the Group 
to develop them further, thus meeting Arena’s objective 
of providing quality service to all customers.
Customers
The Group has multiple customers across distinct areas of  
the business. 
  Rac e c our s e xtures attract attendance from both the general 
public and hospitality clients. Our relationships with these 
customers are managed on a local basis with increasing focus 
on relationship management procedures to enhance value 
and frequency of attendance.
We maintain strong connections with bookmakers, with 
whom we have both direct and indirect relationships. They 
are a key corporate customer at race meetings, providing 
hospitality, sponsorship and, in the case of the on-course 
gaming, can also be considered a supplier of services to 
our other customers. We manage these relationships on 
both a local and central basis.
   Indirect relationships with bookmakers are core to our 
business through our distribution of media rights, both in 
the UK and Ireland via licence to bookmakers for use in LBOs 
and on an international basis through ATR. These ‘rights’ are 
contracted for long-term periods, typically ve years, and are 
negotiated in advance.
  The Group receives income from the Levy on bookmakers 
which is controlled by the Levy board. Arena manages this 
relationship through its af liation with trade associations and 
through direct relationships with the of cers and members 
of the Levy Board.
  The Group is increasing its diversity of income streams, 
in particular through the addition of complementary assets 
on racecourses. Hotels, golf and leisure, conference and 
events are the main areas and each has customers that 
are managed locally on each racecourse. In some areas we 
utilise agencies and, in the case of our two hotels, we have 
considerable support from Marriott and Holiday Inn under 
franchise agreements, thus bene tting from their sales 
and marketing infrastructure.
Suppliers
Arena has relationships with suppliers for goods and services 
that are utilised in the execution of our business model. 
The key supplier relationships are managed across the Group 
both locally and centrally, whichever is considered appropriate 
in each instance. Whilst the Group has signi cant internal 
resources, some areas of expertise are out-sourced to third 
parties, for example, in the case of real estate, for expert 
planning advice or design. 
Procedures and policies exist for the contracting and 
management of these supplier relationships. The Group’s 
policy is to x payment terms when agreeing business 
transactions, to ensure that suppliers are aware of such terms 
and abide by the agreed terms of payment. The number of 
days’ purchases that were represented by year-end Group 
trade creditors was 33 (Company: 39).
Intellectual property
Each racecourse has inherent value in its racing content and 
is able to realise this value through the sale of rights to third 
parties either directly or through intermediaries.
The Group’s racecourses own 268 racing xtures and have 
been able to successfully gain additional short-term xtures, 
enabling a total xture list in excess of 350 race meetings in 
a typical year. These short-term xtures are held on interests 
of between one and three-year tenures. 
The Group has built up and continues to expand ‘know-how’ 
in key areas, with recognised experience in racing operations, 
catering, venue and facilities management, construction 
project management and planning, as well as having 
implemented procedures and supporting IT systems that 
facilitate the successful delivery of its business model  
and strategy.

Key Performance Indicators
The Group monitors a number of key performance indicators  
that are both nancial and operational. These indicators  
are considered either to be the key drivers of the business  
or to represent the key metrics by which the performance  
of the business is measured.
Why these key performance indicators  
are important: 
On this page and the facing page are 
shown the key performance indicators 
that are considered relevant in measuring 
the performance of the business.
The operational drivers of these indicators  
and their impact on the business are 
considered on page 11 with the resulting 
revenue segmentation shown opposite. 
The primary driver of performance is the 
number of xtures hosted and then the total 
attendance, particularly the private and 
corporate hospitality element. Attendance 
is expressed in aggregate for the year 
and as an average per xture. Hospitality 
attendance is shown in aggregate and is 
important as the highest pro t-contributing 
customer segment.

particular year, with additional unscheduled xtures typically 
generating lower attendances than scheduled xtures. In 2010

Each of Arena’s seven racecourses owns the rights  
to host certain race meetings into perpetuity. In addition  
to these ‘owned’ meetings, totalling 268 across the Group, 
further meetings are acquired on arrangements lasting from 
one to three years. In 2011 we expect to stage 353 xtures, 
having secured 85 additional short-term xtures.

non-racing business. Over time, we expect the share of 
non-racing-related revenues to increase as we diversify  
our racecourse business. From 2012, the proportion of  
media rights income will be impacted positively by the 
enhanced agreement with SIS. 16 Arena Leisure Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Principal Risks
Arena regularly reviews on-going and potential risks which 
may impact upon the execution of strategy and operational 
performance with a consequential impact on value. In so doing, 
management and the Board ensure that appropriate systems, 
procedures and controls are in place to mitigate the occurrence  
and impact of such risks.
Risk type and impact Mitigation
Commercial and operational risk
Arena’s business is exposed to weaknesses in consumer 
spend, particularly in the private hospitality segment.  
A reduction in the contribution from this segment has a 
consequent reduction in pro tability. Current trading levels 
are considered moderate and hence operational risk is less 
than in previous years.
Adverse economic conditions can cause a reduction in the 
levels of customer spend per head at racecourses and can 
impact the Group’s non-racing business streams, notably 
through conference, events and hotel revenues.
Poor weather conditions can impact income, both 
attendance-related and, in extreme cases, the hosting 
of xtures, resulting in a loss of pro tability. 
 
Management has taken mitigating actions to protect Arena 
from current and potential operational risks:
  The operating cost base has been aligned with reduced 
customer revenue and the operating synergies arising  
from bringing our catering operation in-house have  
protected pro ts; 
  The Group has appointed suitably experienced and  
quali ed senior management to oversee and direct the 
operation and standards of performance across all of 
Arena’s racecourses;
  Appropriate systems and structures are in place to ensure 
proper training and supervision of staff, and management 
information systems monitor performance on a regular 
basis against predetermined targets;
  Arena has made a signi cant investment in information 
technology, covering key business areas and, in particular, 
reservations, ticketing and points of sale and customer 
relationship management. These systems are substantially 
embedded assets with a consequent improvement in the 
control environment of the Group; and
  The Group’s three all-weather tracks provide signi cant 
protection against the loss of xtures due to bad weather.  
In extreme weather conditions xtures can be lost, although 
it is often the case that additional xtures can be staged at 
short notice, thereby mitigating the potential loss. 
Industry funding risk
A signi cant proportion of the Group‘s annual income  
is derived from the statutory Levy on bookmakers’ pro ts  
from UK horseracing. The scheme has suffered signi cant 
reductions in yield with a consequent reduction in funding 
levels. Further reductions could be possible if a higher 
proportion of betting on UK racing moves to betting 
exchanges or offshore, with a reduced or no capture of 
revenue by the Levy. There is a risk that a replacement  
for the Levy, or further reductions in the amount generated, 
may have a detrimental impact on income.
A signi cant proportion of the Group’s annual income is 
derived from its contract for the supply of racing content to 
LBOs. These contracts are linked to the numbers of races  
that are staged.
As mitigation to these risks:
  2011 funding levels have been set at a relative  
minimum level and the downside risk is considered low. 
The 2011/12 scheme is forecast at a level that is above the 
current budgeted level. The Government has expressed its 
intention to reform the Levy to avoid future determinations 
and provide a long-term sustainable mechanism. There  
is a high level of involvement of Arena management in  
the key industry bodies; and
  Arena enters into long-term contracts for the provision  
of racing content and has entered into an early agreement 
for the period from 2012 to 2016, thereby securing this 
income for the medium term. Arena has historically 
been able to secure over 350 xtures a year and has 
a reasonable expectation of continuing at this level. Strategy
Arena Leisure Plc 17 
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Risk type and impact Mitigation
Development risk
Arena has a strategy for the creation of value through 
maximising the utilisation of real estate and land assets. 
Central to this strategy are a number of planned and active 
development projects. 
The new Marriott Hotel and leisure facility at Ling eld Park 
is now complete and no other on-going major projects are 
currently in their construction phase. 
The future major developments are: 
  A new hotel extension and casino (subject to securing  
a licence) at Wolverhampton Racecourse; 
  A new hotel and residential development at  
Doncaster Racecourse;
  Improved racecourse facilities, including a new entrance 
building, at Royal Windsor Racecourse; and
  A planning application for a residential development  
and the redevelopment of Folkestone Racecourse. 
 
In order to mitigate the risks in its development programme, 
Arena has or will: 
  Undertake detailed feasibility studies in respect of  
the new developments using highly quali ed and 
experienced consultants to assess the business potential 
in each location;
  Choose to work with internationally recognised hotel  
brands with signi cant experience and market presence 
based upon established management contract and 
franchise models;
  Employ suitably experienced and quali ed project managers 
for each construction project who are dedicated to 
delivering the development from planning through  
to completion; and
  Enter into xed-price contracts with suitably experienced 
and established building contractors. 
Strategic risk
Arena manages a number of strategic risks related to  
the delivery of value through exploiting its multiple sources  
of value creation:
  The current credit markets have reduced the availability and 
increased the cost of additional debt funding, which has a 
potential impact on the Group’s ability to source acceptable 
funding for future development projects; and
  Potential failure to achieve acceptable planning consents 
for the surplus land holdings, of which the most signi cant 
is that at Folkestone Racecourse, is mitigated by appropriate 
management actions.  
 
To mitigate this risk Arena has taken the following actions:
  Maintaining a close relationship with our current lender, 
as well as building and maintaining relationships with other 
potential lenders. In addition, management and the Board 
continue to consider other alternative sources of 
investment capital; and
  Detailed planning strategies have been developed in 
conjunction with a suitably quali ed property consultant. 
Regular meetings are held with local council executives 
and planning departments and representations have been 
made through the Local Development Framework process.
Health and safety risk
Arena must ensure it satis es all health and safety standards 
and complies with Disability Discrimination Act legislation.
 
Arena takes the following actions to ensure the health and 
safety of its employees and customers: 
  The Group has employed suitably quali ed and experienced 
health and safety managers to ensure that the Group’s 
industry-leading health and safety policies are 
communicated and complied with; 
  Each racecourse employs an on-site food safety specialist 
whose training is overseen by the Group’s Health and Safety 
Manager. These on-site employees are, in turn, responsible 
for ensuring all racecourse catering staff receive food 
hygiene training;
  From a racing perspective, Arena’s Health and Safety 
Manager is responsible for communicating controls and 
procedures across the Group. She is a member of the 
Racecourse Association’s Safety Advisory Group and 
ensures that industry best practice is implemented across 
all seven racecourses; and 
  Arena’s Health and Safety Manager oversees the Group’s 
all-areas access programme, which has been successful in 
making its venues accessible to visitors with mobility, sight 
and hearing dif culties, particularly at Wolverhampton, 
Worcester and Southwell, which remain Disability Symbol 
holders, and at Ling eld Park, where accessibility was 
integral to the recent redevelopment work.   18 Arena Leisure Plc

Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Overview
Some recovery in market conditions and a continued focus 
on the customer offering and marketing of lead promotions 
resulted in improvements in attendances. Average attendance 
across all seven racecourses increased by 4.2% to 1,800 
(2009: 1,727) and total hospitality attendance increased 
by 17.1% to 45,200 (2009: 38,600). Total attendance was 
634,000, which is slightly less than the 639,000 in 2009 as a 
result of fewer xtures being held. A total of 352 xtures were 
staged in 2010, which was 18 less than in 2009 when the 
closure of Great Leighs Racecourse resulted in additional 
 xtures being transferred to Arena courses at short notice. 
Arena has again staged over one-quarter of all UK racing 
 xtures (2010: 25%, 2009: 26%).
Of Arena’s scheduled xtures, 18 were abandoned during 
the year (2009: eight, 2008: seven) which represents an 
unusually high number and was a result of the severe weather 
conditions during both the early part of the year and the last 
 ve weeks of 2010, during which time, respectively, 11 and 
seven race meetings were lost. Due to the capacity of our 
all-weather tracks and the dedication of our staff we are able 
to stage extra xtures at short notice and, in 2010, 14 extra 
 xtures were hosted (2009: four), of which six were in 
December. Attendances throughout December, at both the 
extra and the scheduled xtures, were 14,000 less than 
in 2009 and the resulting adverse impact on pro t was 
approximately £0.3m.
As has already been described, the Levy yield suffered 
a signi cant reduction in the year resulting in cuts to the 
distributions to racecourses. The overall contribution 
to Arena’s racecourses reduced by £3.8m to £17.7m 
(2009: £21.5m), which resulted in a £0.3m negative impact 
on pro tability (2009: £nil). Income from LBO-related media 
rights of £11.6m remained at the same level as the prior 
year (2009: £11.6m). Whilst the LBO contract bene ts from 
an in ationary adjustment, the number of xtures, and hence 
races staged, were less than in 2009, resulting in no 
net increase.
In May, the Ling eld Park Marriott Hotel and Country Club 
opened for business. The hotel operation is integrated with 
the Racecourse with a long-term business plan that is based 
on mixed leisure, corporate and events-based incomes. 
Initial trading through the summer months was in line with 
our expectations, with good golf and racing-related business. 
The last quarter proved more challenging, due principally to 
market conditions. Pre-opening costs of the hotel operation 
were £0.5m (2009: 0.2m), as expected.
Arena’s racecourse operation delivered an operating pro t of 
£6.7m in the year (2009: £6.8m), after the impact of the hotel 
pre-opening costs. Excluding these costs, the racecourse 
contribution has increased by 3.8% to £7.2m (2009: £7.0m). 
Within this, the impact of reduced Levy funding and the 
December weather-affected trading was a cumulative 
negative £0.6m. Admissions-related incomes, royalties from 
international media rights and the rst trading period of the 
new hotel together produced a net increase in pro t of £0.8m.
Racecourses
Racecourse performance has continued to show resilience to 
economic conditions with good increases in attendance levels, 
maintained public spend per head and hospitality volumes 
increasing, albeit from what was a relatively low base.
Arena’s largest event of the year, the Ladbrokes St Leger 
festival at Doncaster Racecourse, was again successful. 
The total crowd over the four days in September was 60,000 
(2009: 53,000) and Ladbrokes St Leger day itself attracted 
30,000 (2009: 27,000). Hospitality attendance over the four 
days was 6,400 (2009: 5,500) up by 16.4% in line with trends 
in the rest of the business, but some way short of the 2008 
level of 10,000. Overall attendance at Doncaster has been 
encouraging and showing a trend of growth, which indicates 
that the Racecourse is becoming re-established after its 
closure for redevelopment prior to August 2007. The course 
staged 29 xtures in 2010 (2009: 31) and continued the 
programme of themed events with racing and music nights in 
May and August, featuring ‘ -Factor’ nalists and ‘Scouting for 
Girls’, both of which attracted good crowds, and a non-racing 
Halloween event which started a new concept that we will 
build on in 2011. The cold weather at the beginning and end 
of the year caused the abandonment of four race meetings 
(2009: none). The weather also had an impact on the last 
quarter conference and events business, although the year 
saw an improvement in this business stream as we gain 
greater utilisation from the extensive conference and  
meeting facilities.
Review of Operations
During 2010 Arena has been able to grow its 
operating business, open a new hotel and leisure 
development, further establish its in-house catering 
operation and seen good progress from ATR, 
particularly in international media distribution. 20 Arena Leisure Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Royal Windsor Racecourse recorded good public attendances 
at the popular summer-season Monday nights, which form the 
mainstay of the course’s 26- xture programme (2009: 27). 
A number of these nights are themed and have allowed us to 
target our marketing successfully as well as to broaden the 
appeal of each event. The World Cup in June and July would 
typically reduce attendances at these evening xtures but we 
were able to mitigate most of any shortfall, keeping it below 
10% on days with matches. In the past, corporate hospitality 
levels at Royal Windsor were approximately double current 
levels with large reductions in levels of entertaining by 
 nancial institutions having a major impact since 2008. 
The opening of the Marriott Hotel at Ling eld Park Racecourse 
is a major transformation for this venue. The operation across 
hotel, leisure and racecourse facilities is fully integrated, 
realising bene ts from operational synergies and revenue 
generation. A franchise agreement with Marriott International 
provides for brand standards and sales, marketing, reservations 
and revenue management capabilities. Refurbishment work on 
the Racecourse’s function rooms now allow these to be sold as 
an integral part of conference, event and residential offerings 
that are combined with the hotel facilities. Ling eld Park is now 
the UK’s rst integrated ‘racing country club’ offering racing, 
golf, spa and leisure facilities, conferences, meetings and 
events in a location that is both picturesque and close to 
London, Gatwick and major road and rail links. Initial trading 
patterns have seen good business from leisure-related stays, 
with guests taking advantage of the golf course facilities or 
choosing to combine weekend racing with an overnight hotel 
stay. Residential conferences and meetings form a long-term 
core business segment for Ling eld Park, with an expectation 
that this will build over time as we are able to establish and 
gain reputation.
The Group’s three racecourses with all-weather tracks 
continue to provide the majority of Arena’s xtures and in 2010 
Wolverhampton, Southwell and Ling eld Park Racecourses 
staged 96, 76 and 90 xtures, respectively (2009: 98, 78 and 
98). Fixture levels were lower than in 2009 when the closure 
of Great Leighs Racecourse in January of that year resulted in 
the transfer of its xtures, with Arena’s courses picking up 38. 
In 2010, many of these equivalent xtures were included in 
the BHA xture scheduling and spread over more courses. 
The all-weather courses are also able to stage xtures at short 
notice and, often in periods of bad weather when racing is lost 
at turf tracks, additional xtures will be raced at all-weather 
courses. In 2010, Arena staged 14 of these additional 
 xtures (2009: four). At many of the all-weather meetings the 
attendance levels are comparatively low; however these are 
important xtures in the generation of racing content for media 
distribution to bookmakers. In turn, they are therefore important 
for the generation of Levy through betting turnover and produce 
a signi cant net positive contribution to Levy funds. 
Worcester Racecourse staged 17 xtures in the year 
(2009: 16) and was able to race a full xture list without 
disruption from the bad weather and ooding that has 
hampered past years. Attendances were close to 40,000 
people over the year, with major event days proving 
successful in attracting up to 4,000 people to what is a 
relatively small course. Similarly, Folkestone Racecourse is 
a relatively small operation and raced 18 times during 2010 
(2009: 22). Unfortunately this course was badly impacted by 
weather conditions and abandoned its rst three meetings 
of the year and its last meeting in November. Excellent efforts 
in the local market, based on targeted sales initiatives, have 
seen good improvements in hospitality at Folkestone and 
a commensurate increase in race sponsorship, but these 
successes were not able to make up for the impact of the four 
lost xtures. The long-term future of Folkestone Racecourse is 
linked to the redevelopment of the site as part of our application 
for a mixed-use leisure and residential development. 
The Group’s catering operations were brought in-house in 
early 2007 and since that time have achieved recognised 
improvements in service delivery and product quality as well 
as pro tability. We have highlighted before the importance of 
the catering operation in helping to sustain operating margins 
and drive promotional sales and this continued through 2010. 
As the catering business matures, we have been able to apply 
best practice across our racecourses and in 2010 have made 
good progress in standardising concepts of restaurant and 
retail offering, where appropriate. The catering operations 
form an integral part of each racecourse operation and 
centrally we are able to manage purchasing contracts, 
operational procedures and performance through Arena’s 
Catering Operations Director. The catering operation is able 
to deliver a diverse product offering, from smaller raceday 
food and drink retail to the larger event days of over 30,000 
people at the Ladbrokes St Leger and the high-end catering 
demanded at Royal Windsor in the summer season. 
After the year end, in February 2011, Arena announced that  
it had been successful in tendering to LOCOG and had been 
awarded the contract to provide catering services at both the 
Eton Dorney and the Greenwich Park venues as part of the 
Olympic and Paralympic Games in 2012. The Board currently 
estimates that the net pro t contribution from the contract 
in 2012 will be in the range of £0.5m to £1.0m.
Review of Operations continued At The Races
Arena’s 45.85% af liate generates  
income from its website, TV channel  
and its international media distribution  
joint venture, GBI Racing.
ATR is currently able to distribute racing content through 
its GBI Racing joint venture to a total of: 
 25 countries
At The Races
Arena’s 45.85% af liate company, ATR, is a media distribution 
business with income streams generated from a website, 
a television channel and through distributing content 
internationally. The other main stakeholder is BSkyB, with 
Ascot and certain other racecourses, including those owned 
by Northern Racing, having a non-controlling interest.
ATR is the UK and Ireland’s most watched, dedicated 
horseracing channel and is available in 14 million homes. 
The channel can reach up to 2.0 million individuals each 
month with a regular daily audience of over 400,000 and 
a peak of 560,000 that was recorded in November 2010 
during the Breeders’ Cup coverage. The demographic pro le 
of audience is attractive to both advertisers and sponsors. 
Advertising revenues from television have again performed 
well in 2010, thanks to the strong fundamentals behind 
ATR’s audience pro le. 
The website ‘attheraces.com’ is the premier racing and 
betting website in the UK and Ireland. During 2010 it has 
achieved signi cant uplifts in its monthly usage, reaching a 
peak of 975,000 unique users in October (2009: 650,000). 
Users are attracted to the wealth of information on the site 
including racecards, tipping and video content. The expansion 
of the business segment has seen ATR develop ‘Bet  Watch’ 
technology that allows race streams to be viewed live on 
bookmaker websites as well as a live channel available via 
annual subscription. Through 3G technology, ATR is available 
across all major mobile phone platforms in the UK and Ireland.
In March 2010, ATR commenced its joint venture with 
Racecourse Media Group for the international distribution 
of all UK and Irish racing. This joint venture, GBI Racing, 
pools the respective rights of the two entities and provides 
a uni ed broadcast service for British and Irish racing in 
important pari-mutuel markets such as Italy, France, South 
Africa, Turkey and Australia, as well as further developing 
opportunities in newer markets such as Singapore, Malaysia 
and Hong Kong. In 2010, the joint venture delivered better 
than expected cost savings of £0.6m for ATR and increased 
revenues, thereby contributing to the overall excellent result 
of ATR in the year.
In the year to 31 December 2010, ATR generated an 
operating pro t of £2.5m (2009: £1.4m) from revenue 
of £19.2m (2009: £16.1m) and a gross pro t of £11.8m 
(2009: £10.2m). Operating pro t was recorded after 
payments to racecourses of £4.2m (2009: £3.1m). 
Arena’s share of post-tax pro t was £1.4m (2009: £0.5m).

Managing Responsibly
The Directors recognise the importance of monitoring 
Arena’s performance relating to environment, employee 
and social and community issues and have policies and 
procedures to enable them to do so.
Environmental matters
The Group operates a Health, Safety and Environmental 
Policy that sets out the responsibilities of the Directors, 
management and employees in relation to all health and 
safety and environmental matters, as well as the procedures to 
be followed. The Group Health and Safety Manager oversees 
the implementation of the policy. Specially trained employees 
have been given responsibility for communicating speci c 
areas of the policy across the Group. 
Recycling processes are in place at all seven racecourse venues 
that allow for the separation and recycling of cardboard and 
paper, glass, ink cartridges, uorescent tubes and waste oil. 
We handle and recycle 120 tonnes of glass waste per annum 
and are now introducing plastic recycling. Food and stable 
waste recycling are being targeted as areas for improvement 
and we are trialling the production of biodiesel from used 
cooking oil. For each recycling process we have introduced 
waste monitor responsibilities to nominated operational 
staff members.
To minimise the risk of environmental damage from major 
developments, Arena employs environmental consultants 
and service consultants to carry out assessments in respect 
of each project and to report to the respective local planning 
authorities. The Environment Agency (‘EA’) is also consulted 
at all stages of the proposals. Measures will be agreed 
with the contractors to comply with local authority and 
EA requirements. The designs of all developments also 
include energy ef ciency measures.
Employee matters
The recruitment and retention of the highest calibre 
employees is of the utmost importance. Policies and 
procedures, including details on the employee appraisal 
process, are provided to all employees. 
The Group is committed to a policy of recruitment and 
promotion on the basis of aptitude and ability without 
discrimination of any kind. All employees and potential 
employees will be regarded equally and given equal 
opportunities regardless of their age, gender, race, colour, 
sexual orientation, religion or belief, ethnic origin, nationality, 
marital status or disability. Management actively pursue both 
the employment of disabled persons whenever a suitable 
vacancy arises and the continued employment and retraining 
of employees who become disabled whilst employed by the 
Group. Particular attention is given to the training, career 
development and promotion of disabled employees with 
a view to encouraging them to play an active role in the 
development of Arena. 
Arena also runs an apprenticeship programme offering training 
to 16-18 year olds across a range of disciplines. Two of our 
racecourses, Wolverhampton and Southwell, continue to hold 
the Investors in People accreditation standard. 
Employee communications are a high priority and staff 
members are kept informed through regular management 
meetings at a national, regional and local level, with staff 
brie ngs and notices as appropriate. Each year, employees 
have the opportunity to meet with their line manager to 
discuss formally their performance and communicate their 
views; however more frequent discussions are encouraged.
Further information on staff training and remuneration is 
provided in the Resources section on page 13.
Social and community issues
Arena recognises that gambling is closely associated with 
horseracing and is a popular raceday activity. The Group has 
taken steps to encourage responsible gambling and to meet 
the objectives of the Gambling Act 2005, which are:
  Preventing gambling from being a source of crime or disorder , 
being associated with crime or disorder or being used to 
support crime;
  Ensuring that gambling is conducted in a fair and open way; 
and
  Protecting children and other vulnerable persons from  
being harmed or exploited by gambling.
In this respect, all of Arena’s racecourses fully support all 
on-course bookmakers and betting operators in the policies 
that they have. Arena is supportive of GamCare’s work in 
association with the Administration of Gambling on Tracks 
Ltd in producing a standard policy on behalf of on-course 
bookmakers. Arena ensures that information regarding 
assistance for problem gambling is available at its 
racecourses, and that all racecourse staff and on-course 
bookmakers are able to provide this information to race-goers 
upon request.
Arena recognises that the consumption of alcohol is also 
associated with a day at the races and has taken steps to 
encourage responsible drinking through the implementation 
of a Group-wide, zero-tolerance policy. This policy requires all 
staff who serve alcohol to receive appropriate training, verify 
photo identi cation if age is in doubt and turn away customers 
who are below the legal drinking age or who appear to have 
had too much to drink. Catering bar staff, area managers and 
supervisors work in conjunction with the racecourse stewards 
to monitor the crowds for underage drinkers. Arena Leisure Plc 23 
Annual Report and Accounts 2010
Performance
Arena has continued to generate good operating cash ows 
that have allowed it to complete elements of its investment 
programme and to reduce net borrowings. Pro t before 
interest and tax has shown a good increase and Arena was 
able to pay a dividend to shareholders in the year.
Results overview
Revenue in the year to 31 December 2010 decreased by 
1.9% to £64.0m (2010: £65.2m). Pro t before interest and 
tax increased by 1.7% to £5.4m (2009: £5.3m). In 2009, the 
disposal of certain non-core assets resulted in a gain of 
£0.4m and, before this gain, pro t before interest and tax 
increased by 10.4% to £5.4m from £4.9m. Pro t before and 
after tax decreased by 12.1% to £3.6m (2009: £4.1m). 
Earnings per share were 1.02p (2009: 1.16p).
The £1.2m decrease in revenue was mainly driven by the 
shortfalls in Levy funding, which were £3.8m less at £17.7m 
for the year (2009: £21.5m). This shortfall has predominantly 
impacted prize money and is also a result of fewer xtures in 
the year. The income from LBO media rights has remained 
constant at £11.6m (2009: £11.6m), despite fewer xtures 
in the year, as a result of an in ationary uplift on this contract 
and slightly better numbers of races per xture. The new hotel 
and leisure development at Ling eld Park accounted for 
an additional £1.5m of revenue in the year. All other net 
revenues have seen a slight net increase over 2009.
Pro t from racecourse operations (before the gain on disposal 
of assets in 2009) was £6.7m (2009: £6.8m). The impact of 
the pre-opening costs of the hotel development at Ling eld 
Park was £0.5m in the year (2009: £0.2m) and before these 
costs, the underlying racecourse pro t contribution has 
increased by £0.2m to £7.2m (2009: £7.0m). The negative 
impact of Levy funding cuts (£0.3m) and the impact of the 
freezing weather on trading in the last ve weeks of 2010 
(£0.3m) have collectively reduced pro ts by £0.6m. The total 
number of hospitality customers increased by 17.1% to 45,200 
(2009: 38,600) and, whilst total attendance was slightly down 
on 2009 at 634,000 (2009: 639,000), the average attendance 
increased by 4.2% to 1,800 (2009: 1,727). 
Pro t before interest and tax increased by £0.1m to £5.4m 
from the £5.3m in 2009 that included the £0.4m gain on the 
disposal. Pro t before interest and tax for the year, adjusting 
for these items, increased by £0.5m (2010: £5.4m, 2009: 
£4.9m). Pro t before tax decreased by £0.5m to £3.6m 
(2009: £4.1m), largely as a result of the impact of nance 
expenses in 2010 due to the interest on the nancing of 
the Ling eld Park development, which was capitalised 
in the period prior to the hotel becoming fully operational 
in May 2010. During May to December in 2009, a total of 
£0.4m of interest relating to the hotel development was 
capitalised (2010: £nil). A non-cash gain of £0.1m (2009: 
£nil) was recognised in 2010 relating to the movement in 
the valuation of interest rate derivatives.
Central costs
Central costs were £2.7m (2009: £2.4m) and include a 
share-based payment expense in respect of the amortisation 
of share options and LTIP awards of £0.3m (2009: £nil). 
Capital expenditure
During the year, £9.1m was invested in capital assets (2009: 
£19.2m). Of this, £7.6m (2009: £17.6m) was incurred on the 
Ling eld Park Marriott Hotel and leisure scheme, bringing 
the total completed spend to £30.0m. The remaining £1.5m 
included £0.4m related to the commencement of a £1.0m 
project at Royal Windsor Racecourse that will improve 
racecourse facilities and provide a new entrance building 
with of ce and retail space. Capital additions include 
£0.8m (2009: £0.7m) of interest costs related to development 
projects during the planning and construction phases. 
Having completed the Ling eld Park Marriott Hotel project 
and pending the commencement of construction on the other 
major development schemes, Arena will utilise operating cash 
 ows in 2011 to substantially reduce net borrowings.
Treasury report
In February 2010, Arena signed new banking facilities with its 
relationship bank, Lloyds Banking Group (‘LBG’), which were 
put in place and partially drawn in March 2010 replacing all 
existing facilities. The new facilities are committed until 
31 December 2013 and are composed of a term loan of 
£35.0m that will amortise evenly over the period to its 
maturity on 31 October 2013 and a £20.0m revolving credit 
facility that is committed until 31 December 2013. Of the term 
loan, £5.0m was repaid on 31 July 2010 and a further £5.0m 
repaid after the year end on 31 January 2011. The interest

Annual Report and Accounts 2010
margin on the facilities is variable between 2.0% and 3.25% 
over LIBOR, dependent on the leverage of the Group at the 
beginning of each quarter. As part of this restructuring, Arena 
was able to release assets previously secured to bank loans 
that are now provided as security to SIS in respect of the 
second and third advanced media rights payments of 
£12.5m and £7.0m, received on 22 July 2010 and due on 
22 July 2011, respectively. This security remains until the 
commencement of the new media rights agreement with SIS 
on 1 January 2012. The advanced payments are included 
within deferred income, with the £7.0m also shown as a 
receivable, at 31 December 2010. 
Hedging of interest rate risk is considered on a regular 
basis to ensure that it is appropriate for the level of debt 
within the Group. A previously held interest rate cap and 
collar arrangement in respect of £12.0m of debt, which 
was effective from 1 October 2007 to 30 September 2012, 
has now been replaced with a £15.0m amortising xed 
swap at 4.77%. This new instrument was effective from 
1 April 2010 and reduces to £10.0m from 1 April 2011 
and then to £5.0m from 1 April 2012, until its maturity 
on 31 December 2013. Effective from 2 October 2008 to 
31 December 2012, a further £10.0m of interest rate hedging 
remained in place and unchanged with a 75/25 mix of xed 
and capped contracts, for which the effective LIBOR rate is 
a maximum of 5.27%.
Bank loans are secured by a xed and oating charge on the 
assets and undertakings of Arena companies, and a rst legal 
charge on all the freehold properties. The security is subject 
to deeds of priority and permitted charges in favour of the 
Horserace Betting Levy Board (‘HBLB’) in respect of security 
for interest-free loans provided to the Group, which had 
a balance outstanding of £3.2m at 31 December 2010 
(2009: £4.8m).
Under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement’, the Group is required to value the interest 
rate swap contract at its fair value, with the gain or loss 
being shown in the statement of comprehensive income as 
an ‘other nance gain or loss’. The valuation at 31 December 
2010 has resulted in a liability of £1.3m (2009: £1.5m) being 
recorded on the balance sheet and a gain of £0.1m (2009: 
£nil) to the statement of comprehensive income. The contract 
will be revalued at each subsequent reporting date and the 
resulting gain or loss arising from the valuation will be taken 
to the statement of comprehensive income.
Arena continues to utilise interest-free loans made available 
by the HBLB in respect of speci ed capital projects. Under IAS 
39, interest-free loans are valued on a discounted cash ow 
basis on initial recognition, with the gain being taken to the 
statement of comprehensive income. In subsequent years, 
the loan is accreted back up to its book value, with the 
corresponding charge being taken to the statement of 
comprehensive income. As a consequence, the Group 
has made a charge of £0.3m (2009: £0.4m), re ecting 
the notional interest charge on outstanding HBLB loans 
received in previous periods. This accounting for the interest-
free loans under IAS 39 has no ‘cash’ consequences.
Going concern
Arena’s business activities, together with the factors likely 
to affect its future development, performance and position are 
set out in the Business Review on pages 1 to 22. The nancial 
position of the Group, its cash ows, liquidity position and 
borrowing facilities are described in the Financial Review 
on pages 23 to 24. In addition, Note 26 to the nancial 
statements includes the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its nancial risk 
management objectives; details of its nancial instruments 
and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and 
liquidity risk. 
Although the current economic conditions create uncertainty, 
particularly over funding levels from the Levy on bookmakers, 
the Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance, together 
with mitigating actions that are within management’s control, 
show that the Group is expected to be able to operate within 
the level and covenant conditions of its new debt facilities. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the annual nancial statements.
Taxation
There is no current year tax charge due to Arena’s continued 
use of HBLB capital credits in respect of racecourse capital 
projects and the availability of brought forward tax losses. 
At 31 December 2010, corporation tax losses representing 
trade and non-trade losses of £64.4m (2009: £64.0m) were 
available for utilisation in future years, subject to agreement 
with HM Revenue  Customs.
We have recognised a deferred tax liability on temporary 
differences of £13.3m (2009: £12.7m). In addition, we have 
also recognised a deferred tax asset for losses of £13.3m 
(2009: £12.7m). 
Dividends
The Board is pleased to announce that it is proposing a nal 
dividend for 2010 of 0.38p per share totalling £1,384,000 
(2009: 0.38p per ordinary share totalling £1,384,000). In line 
with Arena’s stated policy, no interim dividend was paid during 
the year (2009: none).

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Corporate Governance
Arena has maintained its commitment to high standards of 
corporate governance during the year. The principles and 
provisions of the Combined Code have been considered by 
the Board. The Board con rms that throughout the year ended 
31 December 2010 the Group has complied with the main 
and supporting principles as set out in the Combined Code 
issued by the Financial Reporting Council in June 2008, 
except for Code Provision A.7.2, in that non-executives have 
not been appointed for speci ed periods, and Code Provision 
A.6.1, in that the Board has not undertaken a formal annual 
evaluation of its performance and that of its Committees 
and individual Directors. This latter point is discussed further 
below. The Board will report in the 2011 Annual Report on its 
compliance with the Corporate Governance Code issued by 
the Financial Reporting Council in June 2010.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for 
good governance and the statement set out below describes 
how the principles identi ed in the Combined Code (appended 
to the Listing Rules) are applied by the Group.
Directors
The Company is controlled through its Board of Directors. 
The Directors who held of ce during the year to 31 December 
2010 were as follows:
David Thorpe Non-Executive Chairman 
(appointed 19 May 2010)
Raymond Mould Non-Executive Chairman 
(resigned 19 May 2010)
Mark Elliott Chief Executive Of cer
Ian Renton Executive Director
Tony Harris Executive Director
Andrew Parker Bowles OBE Non-Executive Director
Andrew Page Non-Executive Director
Biographies of the Board members appear on page 25 of this 
report. These indicate the high levels and range of business 
experience which are essential to manage effectively a 
business of the size and complexity of Arena. 
In accordance with the Articles of Association (‘the Articles’), 
David Thorpe, having been appointed during the year, will 
retire and Mark Elliott will retire by rotation at this year’s 
Annual General Meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves 
for re-election.
The Directors are responsible for managing the business of 
the Company. The Articles contain certain provisions relating 
to the powers of the Directors, including the power to appoint 
Directors until they are reappointed by shareholders at the 
next Annual General Meeting. The Articles do not give the 
Directors the power to remove another Director. Any alteration 
by the Directors to the Company’s share capital is governed by 
the Articles, although the Company’s powers to issue and buy 
back its shares require shareholder approval.
Amendments to the Articles may be made by special resolution 
of the shareholders.
The Board meets at least six times each year and has  
a schedule of matters reserved to it for decision.  
The requirement for Board approval on these matters is 
communicated widely throughout the senior management  
of Arena. This includes matters such as determining the 
strategy of the Group, approval of nancial reporting and 
controls, oversight of the Group’s internal controls, material 
capital commitments, commencing or settling major litigation, 
business acquisitions and disposals, Board membership and 
appointments, approval of remuneration of Directors and 
certain senior management, corporate governance matters, 
approval of Group policies and risk management strategies, 
amendments to the structure and nancing arrangements of 
the Group and appointments to subsidiary company boards.
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring Board 
procedures are followed, including the formal minuting of any 
unresolved concerns that Directors may have in connection 
with the operation of the Company. During the year, there 
were no such unresolved issues.
The Board has delegated authority to the Committees of 
the Board on speci c matters. Details of the Nomination 
and Audit Committees are given within this Statement and 
details of the Remuneration Committee are given in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 31 to 36. 
Full details of Directors’ remuneration and a statement  
of the Company’s remuneration policy are set out in the 
Remuneration Report. Executive Directors abstain from any 
discussion or voting at full Board meetings on Remuneration 
Committee recommendations where the recommendations 
have a direct bearing on their own remuneration package.  
The details of each Executive Director’s individual package 
are xed by the Committee in line with the policy adopted 
by the full Board.
The differing roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are 
acknowledged and de ned in separate statements approved 
by the Board. The key functions of the Chairman are to 
conduct Board meetings and meetings of shareholders and to 
ensure that all Directors are properly briefed in order to take  
a full and constructive part in Board discussions. The Chief 
Executive is required to develop and lead business strategies 
and processes to enable the Group’s business to meet the 
requirements of its shareholders.
26 Arena Leisure Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Details of the Chairman’s other signi cant commitments are 
given in his biography on page 25. The Board is satis ed that 
these do not interfere with the performance of his duties as 
Chairman of the Company.
All of the Non-Executive Directors are considered by the 
Board to be independent of management and free of any 
relationship which could materially interfere with the exercise 
of their independent judgement. The senior Non-Executive 
Director is Andrew Page and any concerns relating to the 
executive management of the Company, or the performance 
of the other Non-Executive Directors, can be raised with him. 
The service agreements of the Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered of ce 
and will be available at the Annual General Meeting. 
Any Director appointed during the year is required, under 
the provisions of the Articles, to retire and seek election 
by shareholders at the next Annual General Meeting. The 
Articles also require that one-third of the Directors retire by 
rotation each year and seek re-election at the Annual General 
Meeting. The Directors required to retire will be those in of ce 
longest since their previous re-election and this will usually 
mean that each Director retires at least every three years, 
although there is no absolute requirement to this effect. 
In order to comply with the Combined Code, but avoid the 
expense of amending the Articles to deal with this single 
point, the Board has resolved that each Director will retire 
at least every three years, even if this is not strictly required 
by application of the provisions of the Articles.
There is an agreed procedure for Directors to take 
independent professional advice if necessary and at  
the Company’s expense. This is in addition to the access 
which every Director has to the Company Secretary.  
No such advice was sought during the year. The Company  
has appropriate insurance cover in respect of legal actions 
against its Directors and the level of cover is  
regularly reviewed. 
Nomination Committee
The members of the Nomination Committee are David Thorpe 
(Chairman, appointed 19 May 2010), Andrew Parker Bowles 
and Andrew Page. The Committee meets as required, but not 
less than once a year. Its responsibilities include reviewing 
the Board structure, size and composition, nominating 
candidates to the Board to ll Board vacancies when they 
arise and recommending Directors who are retiring by rotation 
to be put forward for re-election. The Committee also ensures 
that all Board appointees undergo training, as appropriate.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee operates under written Terms  
of Reference to assist the Board in the discharge of its  
duties with regard to the Group’s accounts, the review of 
internal controls and risk management systems and the 
external audit.
The Audit Committee is scheduled to meet at least three 
times a year. It is comprised of Andrew Page (Chairman), 
Andrew Parker Bowles and David Thorpe (appointed 19 May 
2010). Andrew Page is a Chartered Accountant with extensive 
experience in senior nancial positions in listed companies in 
the leisure and hospitality sector.
Senior representatives of the Group’s external auditors and 
appropriate members of senior management are normally 
invited to attend the meetings. The Chairman of the 
Committee also meets with the external auditors without 
management present.
The Committee has met its responsibilities by:
 Monitoring the integrity of the nancial statements  
of the Company and the formal announcements relating  
to the Company’s nancial performance, and reviewing  
the signi cant nancial reporting judgements  
contained therein;
 Reviewing the Group’s internal nancial controls and the 
Group’s internal control and risk management systems 
(see further discussion on internal controls and  
risk management);
 Approving the remuneration and terms of engagement 
of the external auditors; and
 Agreeing the scope of the statutory audit with the external 
auditors prior to the commencement of their work and 
considering their ndings prior to the approval of the 
 nancial statements.
The Audit Committee keeps the scope and cost effectiveness 
of both internal controls and the external audit under review. 
The independence and objectivity of the external auditors 
are also considered on a regular basis, with particular regard 
to the level of non-audit fees. In order to safeguard auditor 
independence and objectivity, the Committee uses its 
judgement in the approval of non-audit services provided by 
the external auditors to ensure both the nature of the work 
and the level of fees paid are reasonable. The split between 
audit and non-audit fees for the year under review appears  
on page 50.

Board, Committee and individual performance
Although a formal annual evaluation is not currently in place, a continuous process of evaluation of the Board, its Committees 
and the individual Directors exists. The composition of the Board is also regularly considered. 
Internal control
The respective responsibilities of the Directors and the auditors in connection with the accounts are explained on page 37 and 
page 38 in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities and Independent Auditors’ Report. The Directors’ statement on going 
concern appears on page 24, with further information given in Note 2 to the IFRS nancial statements.
The Board of Directors is responsible for the Company’s system of internal control, including the Company’s reporting process 
and the Group’s process for the preparation of consolidated accounts, and it is the role of management to implement the 
Board’s policies on risk and control. The system of internal control is designed to manage and mitigate, rather than eliminate, 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. In pursuing these objectives, risk management and internal nancial, 
operational and compliance controls can only provide reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of internal controls during the year.
The Board con rms that there is an on-going process for identifying, evaluating and managing the signi cant risks faced by 
the Group, which complies with the guidance ‘Internal Control: Guidance for directors on the Combined Code’. This process has 
been in place throughout the current period and up to the date of approval of the nancial statements. The process is regularly 
reviewed by the Board.
The key elements of the control framework and review processes across the Group are as follows:
 Financial reporting: a detailed formal budgeting process for all Group businesses culminates in an annual Group budget 
which is approved by the Board. Results for the Company and for its main constituent businesses are reported monthly 
against the budget to the Board;
 Financial and accounting principles: comprehensive nancial and accounting controls are required by the Board for effective 
 nancial control. Where areas for improvement in the system of internal controls are identi ed, the Board considers the 
recommendations made by the Audit Committee and the external auditors;
 Capital investment: the Company has clearly de ned guidelines for capital expenditure. These include annual budgets, 
detailed appraisal and review procedures, levels of authority and due diligence requirements where businesses are being 
acquired; and
 Treasury: the treasury position of the Group is managed centrally and monitored by the Finance Director.
There are policies and procedures in place for the reporting by employees and the resolution of suspected fraudulent activities. 
It is the policy of the Group to employ staff and management of high integrity, to train them appropriately and to require compliance 
with all regular laws, regulations and internal policies.
28 Arena Leisure Plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Arena does not have an internal audit function. Following the 
necessary evaluation, the Board has concluded that due to 
the modest size of the Group a formal internal audit function 
is not required. Appropriate internal audit work is, however, 
carried out by the Group nance department.
Two of the Directors of the Group are on the board of the 
Group’s joint venture, At The Races. At least one of the 
Group’s Directors will attend all signi cant meetings of the 
joint venture, where they will use their in uence to ensure 
that the highest standards of internal control are maintained.
Risk management
Following publication of guidance for directors on internal 
control (The Turnbull Guidance), the Board con rms its 
commitment to the management of risk within the organisation. 
During the period under review, a risk review has been 
overseen by the Finance Director. The purpose of the risk 
review is to identify, evaluate and report formally to the 
Board on signi cant risk issues.
Information provided by the risk review, internal management 
reporting, external auditors and industry sources provides the 
basis on which the Board carries out its assessment of risk; 
to identify, evaluate and manage any risk deemed signi cant 
to the achievement of the Company’s strategic objectives. 
The risk management process involves the maintenance 
of a risk register which identi es signi cant risks and the 
controls in place to manage these risks. Any control or other 
weaknesses are noti ed to the Board and the appropriate 
action to be taken by management is identi ed and  
followed up. 
There is a continued emphasis on risks affecting the  
health and safety of the Group’s customers, employees and 
racing participants, with the Group employing a quali ed 
Health and Safety Manager, whose responsibilities include 
food safety, and 15 other full-time quali ed employees 
to oversee these matters on behalf of the Board. Their 
responsibilities include the communication of controls and 
best practice across the Group, staff training and building 
upon existing policies. Any issues are communicated to  
the Directors.
Communication
The Company places a great deal of importance on 
communication with its shareholders. The full report and 
accounts are made available to all shareholders and, on 
request, to any other party when it has an interest in the 
Group’s performance. Shareholders also have direct access 
to the Company and the Company responds to numerous 
letters and enquiries from shareholders on a wide range of 
issues. There is regular dialogue with individual institutional 
shareholders and the views of the shareholders are 
communicated to the Board after such discussions. 
Presentations to major shareholders are made at least twice 
yearly, after the announcement of the interim and nal 
results, details of which, together with the Group’s nancial 
reports and other announcements, can be accessed via the 
Group’s website: www.arenaleisureplc.com.
All shareholders have the opportunity to question the 
Directors at the Company’s Annual General Meeting, at 
which the Board highlights key business developments.

Other Statutory Information

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Remuneration Report
Governance
As well as complying with the provisions of the Combined 
Code as disclosed in the Corporate Governance Statement, 
the Company has applied the principles relating to Directors’ 
remuneration as described below.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of Andrew Parker 
Bowles (Chairman), Andrew Page and David Thorpe (appointed 
19 May 2010). The Committee determines the remuneration 
of the Executive Directors and of certain other senior 
executives within the Company. The Committee also 
determines the Chairman’s fee: the Chairman does not 
participate in discussions of his own fee. The Chief Executive 
may, at the Committee’s invitation, attend meetings except 
when his own remuneration is discussed.
The Remuneration Committee has appointed independent 
remuneration consultants, Aon Hewitt Ltd, to advise on all 
aspects of senior executive remuneration. Aon Hewitt Ltd 
continues to act as consultant to the Company and has no 
other connection with the Company other than in the 
provision of advice on executive and employee remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Company’s remuneration policy is to pay individual 
Directors a salary or fee at market levels for comparable jobs, 
recognising the size of the Company and the business sector 
in which it operates.
The following comprised the principal elements of Executive 
Directors’ remuneration:
 Basic salary and bene ts;
 Annual performance bonus;
 Long-term incentives; and
 Pension contributions into a de ned contribution pension 
scheme.
It is the Group’s policy to ensure that there is a strong link 
between the level of Directors’ remuneration and the 
performance of Arena. Consequently, only basic salaries and 
bene ts are xed. These xed elements are recognised as 
being comparable with other companies. The Remuneration 
Committee recognises that the long-term success of Arena 
is largely dependent on attracting executives of the highest 
quality. Therefore, each Director can signi cantly augment 
their salary through annual bonuses and long-term incentives. 
The Group’s contributions to a de ned contribution pension 
scheme are based on basic salary levels only. 
In addition to the statutory vote to be held on this 
Remuneration Report, shareholders will be given the 
opportunity to ask the Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee, Andrew Parker Bowles, questions on any 
aspect of the Group’s remuneration policy at the 2011 
Annual General Meeting.
The remuneration for Non-Executive Directors consists of 
salary or fees for their services in connection with the Board 
and Board Committee meetings. They are not eligible for 
pension scheme membership. Their fees are determined 
by the Executive Directors who have regard to the level of 
salary or fees paid to the non-executive directors of similar 
companies and the time commitment required of each 
Non-Executive Director.
Each element of remuneration payable to Executive Directors 
is discussed in more detail below.
In addition, Ian Renton received £10,000 (2009: £10,000) as 
remuneration for his non-executive directorship of the British 
Horseracing Authority, the term of which expired in July 2010.

Basic salaries for all Executive Directors are reviewed (but 
not necessarily increased) annually by the Committee. In 
determining the level of basic salaries, the Committee will 
give consideration to the Government’s published in ation 
statistics, salaries for comparable positions in similar sized 
companies and any signi cant change in the role performed 
by the Director. The Committee also makes use of benchmark 
data provided by external remuneration consultants but is 
mindful of the potential ratcheting effect that such data 
can produce.
In addition to basic salaries, each Executive Director is 
entitled to the following main bene ts:
 In addition to normal bank and public holidays:  
Chief Executive – 29 working days’ holiday per annum, 
Finance Director – 26 working days’ holiday per annum 
and Racing Director – 25 working days’ holiday per annum;
 A fully expensed company car or cash equivalent; and
 Private health insurance for themselves, their spouse  
and children.
Arena Leisure Plc 31 
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Bonus
In addition to a basic salary, the Executive Directors are 
entitled to an annual performance-related bonus.
Speci c performance criteria are set by the Remuneration 
Committee at the commencement of the year following 
approval of the Group’s budgets and are primarily related 
to de ned strategic and nancial objectives of the Group. 
The bonus payments that relate to the year under review 
were 27% of salary for the Chief Executive, 22% of salary 
for the Finance Director and 23% for the Racing Director. 
The maximum aggregate bonus potential for 2010 of 
the Chief Executive was 100% of salary (2009: 100%), 
the Finance Director’s was 75% of salary (2009: 75%) 
and the Racing Director’s was 75% of salary (2009: 75%). 
Long-term incentives
The Committee believes that share ownership and the 
granting of share awards strengthen the link between 
executives’ personal interests and those of shareholders. 
Share options
In October 2006, nal grants of share options were made to 
the Executive Directors under the Arena Leisure Discretionary 
Share Option Scheme, which expired in June 2007. 
Long-term incentive plan
With the expiration of the share option scheme in June 2007, 
shareholder approval was obtained for a new long-term 
incentive plan (‘LTIP’) at the 2007 Annual General Meeting. 
The LTIP provides for annual conditional awards of equity-
settled shares to be made subject to the achievement 
of challenging performance conditions. The key features 
are set out below.
Maximum award level
The normal maximum annual award is set at 100% of base 
salary. In exceptional circumstances, such as recruitment or 
retention, awards may be made up to 200% of base salary. 
The annual LTIP award can be replaced by an additional 
performance-related bonus of up to a maximum of 50% 
of the normal annual bonus award.
Performance conditions
For the initial awards made in 2007, the performance 
conditions were structured using absolute adjusted earnings 
per share (‘EPS’) growth targets. This approach enabled the 
conditions to be tailored to the speci c circumstances of the 
Company at the time and its prospects for the next three-year 
period. For the purposes of the initial awards, as well as for 
awards made in future years, adjusted EPS is de ned as basic 
EPS adjusted for certain one-off events. For awards made 
in 2008 and future years the performance conditions are 
to achieve adjusted EPS growth in excess of in ation (‘RPI’) 
targets over the performance period.
The awards made in 2007 and 2008 have not vested 
because the performance conditions have not been met.
The 2009 awards were made later than normal in the year,

Notes Forming Part of the Financial Statements
for the year ended 31 December 2010
1 Reporting entity
Arena Leisure Plc (‘the Company’) is a company domiciled 
in the UK. The address of the Company’s registered of ce is 
408 Strand, London WC2R 0NE. The consolidated nancial 
statements of the Company as at and for the year ended 
31 December 2010 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as ‘the Group’) and the Group’s interest 
in jointly controlled entities. The Group is primarily involved 
in the ownership and operation of racecourses, and the 
worldwide broadcast and exploitation of racecourse media 
rights via the Group’s shareholding in its At The Races (‘ATR’) 
joint venture.
2 Basis of preparation
Statement of compliance
The Group nancial statements have been prepared and 
approved by the Directors in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (‘Adopted 
IFRSs’). The Company has elected to prepare its parent 
company nancial statements in accordance with UK GAAP; 
these are presented on pages 72 to 78.
The nancial statements were approved by the Board of 
Directors on 7 March 2011.
Basis of measurement
The nancial statements have been prepared on the historical 
cost basis except for the following:
 Derivative nancial instruments are measured at fair 
value;
 Financial instruments at fair value through the pro t 
or loss are measured at fair value; and 
 Liabilities for equity-settled share-based payment 
arrangements are measured at fair value.
The methods used to measure fair values are discussed 
further in Note 4.
Functional and presentation currency
These nancial statements are presented in sterling, which 
is the Company’s functional currency. All nancial information 
is presented in sterling and has been rounded to the 
nearest thousand.
Use of estimates and judgements
The preparation of nancial statements in conformity with 
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that affect the application of accounting 
policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenditure. Estimates and underlying 
assumptions are reviewed on an on-going basis and are 
based on management’s best knowledge of the amounts, 
events or actions at 31 December 2010. Actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
The key estimates and judgements made by management 
during the year relate to the carrying value of the racecourse 
development projects held within assets under construction 
(Note 16): an assessment is made concerning the projections 
of future cash ows from the development projects, which are 
dependent on, amongst other factors, planning consent, the 
award of a casino licence and estimated construction costs.
Information about other signi cant areas of estimation and 
judgements in applying accounting policies is included in the 
following notes:
 Note 17 – provisions for impairment: assumptions are 
made each year concerning the projections of future 
cash ows arising from the racecourses when reviewing 
the carrying value of goodwill and property, plant 
and equipment;
 Note 16 – residual values: an assessment is made of 
the estimated residual values of property, plant and 
equipment. Residual values are reviewed annually;
 Note 27 – recognition and measurement of deferred 
tax assets and liabilities: judgements are required in 
determining the amounts to be recognised, in particular, 
when assessing the extent to which deferred tax assets 
should be recognised, with consideration given to the 
timing and level of future taxable income; and
 Note 32 – measurement of share-based payment: 
assumptions are made each year concerning the 
projections of future pro ts of the Group in assessing 
the likelihood of performance criteria being met.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Review of Operations on pages 
19 to 21. The nancial position of the Group, its cash ows, 
liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described in 
the Financial Review on pages 23 to 24. In addition, Note 26 
to the nancial statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its nancial 
risk management objectives; details of its nancial 
instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to 
credit risk and liquidity risk. Further disclosures relating 
to liquidity risk are included within Notes 11 and 25.
The Group continues to be a cash-generative operational 
business with good-quality assets. Revenues are generated 
from a variety of sources including industry funding through 
the Horserace Betting Levy Board (‘HBLB’) and income from 
its ve-year (to 31 December 2011) media rights contract to 
provide live racing pictures to UK licensed betting of ces. In 
addition, on 22 July 2009, the Group signed a new ve-year 
agreement commencing on 1 January 2012 for the provision 
of media rights with Satellite Information Services Ltd (‘SIS’) 
that provides for £32.0m in advance payments, of which 
£25.0m has already been received, and the balance of 
which is secured by letter of credit. 
Arena Leisure Plc 43 
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 2 Basis of preparation continued
In March 2010, the Group agreed new banking facilities 
with its relationship lender, Lloyds Banking Group Plc (‘LBG’), 
totalling £55.0m, which replaced all previous bank facilities 
and which are committed until, and amortise to maturity on, 
31 December 2013 (see Financial Review on pages 23 to 24). 
Although the current economic conditions create uncertainty, 
particularly over funding levels from the Levy on bookmakers, 
the Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance, together 
with mitigating actions that are within management’s control, 
the Group is expected to be able to operate within the level 
and covenant conditions of its new debt facilities.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the annual report and accounts.
3 Accounting policies
The following new standards, interpretations and 
amendments, effective for the rst time from 1 January 2010, 
have not had a material effect on the nancial statements:
 Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’;
 Revised IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’;
 Amendments to IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate 
Financial Statements’;
 Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments’;
 Amendments to IAS 39 and IFRIC 9 ‘Embedded 
Derivatives’;
 Improvements to IFRS (issued by IASB April 2009);
 IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Arrangements’;
 IFRIC 15 ‘Agreements for the Construction of Real Estate’; 
 IFRIC 16 ‘Hedges of Net Investment in a Foreign 
Operation’;
 IFRIC 17 ‘Distribution of Non-cash Assets to Owners’; and
 IFRIC 18 ‘Transfer of Assets from Customers’.
From 1 January 2010 the Group has applied Improvements to 
IFRS (issued by IASB April 2009), which includes amendments 
to IAS 17 ‘Leases’. The change in accounting policy (see 
below) has been applied retrospectively and has had no 
material impact on earnings per share. See Note 15 for 
further information.
The principal accounting policies adopted in the preparation 
of the nancial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been applied to all the years presented in the nancial 
statements and have been applied consistently by Group 
entities, unless otherwise stated.
Revenue
Revenue principally relates to income derived directly from 
the holding of horserace meetings, including industry-related 
income from the HBLB, and the non-raceday use of the 
racecourse facilities. The Group also derives income from 
the operation of two hotels located at Ling eld Park and 
Wolverhampton Racecourses and two golf courses located 
at Ling eld Park and Southwell Racecourses.
Media rights
Income received from license to bookmakers for use in LBOs 
and from ATR in respect of media rights over the broadcasts 
from the Group’s racecourses is recognised within revenue 
in the period in which the relevant race meetings are held.
At 29 March 2004, the Group held within accruals and 
deferred income the sum of £3.2m in respect of deferred 
media rights income received under a previous ATR contract. 
This income has been released to revenue on a straight-line 
basis over a ve-year period ending in June 2009.
Horserace Betting Levy Board revenue
The HBLB provides revenue to racecourses to support the holding 
of race meetings, particularly through prize money and integrity 
cost funding. For taxation purposes, this revenue can be waived 
by racecourses, with HBLB approval, and transferred to ‘capital 
credits’, which is a tax-ef cient scheme operated by the HBLB. 
These capital credits may be claimed by racecourses against 
expenditure on HBLB approved capital projects and, as a result, 
are not assessable to tax. It is the Group’s policy that, as they are 
derived from, and are dependent upon, trading activities, capital 
credit receipts are recognised within revenue when the race 
meeting to which they relate is held. A corresponding receivable 
is recognised until the cash is received.
Admissions revenue and other racing income
Admissions revenue, which includes ticket and hospitality 
sales, and other racing income, which includes sponsorship, 
on-course betting commission, racecards and advertising, 
is recognised in pro t or loss once a race meeting has been 
held. Income from the sale of annual badges is released to 
revenue on a straight-line basis over the number of race 
meetings the annual badge covers.
Revenue from the utilisation of racecourse facilities
The Group’s racecourses receive income for the use of the 
racecourse facilities for conferencing, banqueting, exhibitions, 
weddings and other events. This income is recognised in pro t 
or loss once an event has taken place.
Catering income
Revenue is received from food and beverage provided by 
the Group’s in-house catering and sold through retail units, 
restaurant dining, hospitality packages and non-raceday 
event packages. Income is also received though commissions 
payable from external mobile retail units. This income is 
recognised in pro t or loss once a race meeting or non-
raceday event has been held.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financial Statements
Other leisure
The Group operates two hotels, at Ling eld Park Racecourse and 
Wolverhampton Racecourse, two golf courses, at Ling eld Park 
Racecourse and Southwell Racecourse, and a health club and 
spa at Ling eld Park Racecourse. Revenue from these operations 
is recognised when goods or services have been provided  
(e.g. – hotel stay, golf pay and play, golf pro-shop sales, spa 
usage, monthly health club memberships), with the exception  
of income from golf club memberships, which is recognised  
on a straight-line basis over the period of membership.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Where the Company has the power, either directly or 
indirectly, to govern the nancial and operating policies 
of another entity or business so as to obtain bene ts from 
its activities, it is classi ed as a subsidiary. Subsidiaries 
are consolidated from the date control commences until the 
date control ceases. The consolidated nancial statements 
present the results of the Group as if they formed a single 
entity. Intercompany transactions and balances between 
Group companies are eliminated in full.
Associates and joint ventures
Associate undertakings are entities in which the Group holds 
a long-term non-controlling interest and has the power to 
in uence (but not control) the nancial and operating policy 
decisions of the entity. Joint ventures are entities in which 
the Group holds a long-term interest and has joint control 
under a contractual arrangement for strategic nancial and 
operating decisions. 
From 1 January 2010, acquisitions of non-controlling interests 
are accounted for as transactions with owners in their capacity 
as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result 
of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling 
interests are based on a proportionate amount of the net 
assets of the subsidiary.
Prior to 1 January 2010, goodwill was recognised on the 
acquisition of non-controlling interests in a subsidiary, 
which represented the excess of the cost of the additional 
investment over the carrying amount of the interest in the 
net assets acquired at the date of the transaction.
Business combinations
Business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the 
date on which control is transferred to the Group. Control is 
the power to govern the nancial and operating policies of an 
entity so as to obtain bene ts from its activities. In assessing 
control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting 
rights that currently are exercisable.
For acquisitions on or after 1 January 2010, the Group 
measures goodwill at the acquisition date as the fair value 
of the consideration transferred; plus the recognised amount 
of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus, if the 
business combination is achieved in stages, the fair value 
of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less the net 
recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identi able 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed.
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is 
recognised immediately in pro t or loss.
The consideration transferred does not include amounts 
related to the settlement of pre-existing relationships. 
Such amounts are generally recognised in pro t or loss. 
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated 
with the issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group 
incurs in connection with a business combination are 
expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair 
value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration 
is classi ed as equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is 
accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes 
to the fair value of the contingent consideration are 
recognised in pro t or loss.
When share-based payment awards (replacement awards) 
are required to be exchanged for awards held by the acquiree’s 
employees (acquiree’s awards) and relate to past services, 
then all or a portion of the amount of the acquirer’s replacement 
awards is included in measuring the consideration transferred 
in the business combination. This determination is based on 
the market-based value of the replacement awards compared 
with the market-based value of the acquiree’s awards and the 
extent to which the replacement awards relate to past and/or 
future service.
For acquisitions between 1 January 2004 and 1 January 
2010, goodwill represents the excess of the cost of the 
acquisition over the Group’s interest in the recognised amount 
(generally fair value) of the identi able assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities of the acquiree. When the excess was 
negative, a bargain purchase gain was recognised immediately 
in pro t or loss.
Transaction costs, other than those associated with the 
issue of debt or equity securities, that the Group incurred 
in connection with business combinations were capitalised 
as part of the cost of the acquisition.
As part of its transition to IFRSs, the Group elected to restate 
only those business combinations that occurred on or after 
1 January 2003. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 
2003, goodwill represents the amount recognised under 
the Group’s previous accounting framework, UK GAAP.
Goodwill
Goodwill that arises upon the acquisition of subsidiaries is 
included in intangible assets. For the measurement of goodwill 
at initial recognition see the Business Combinations policy.
Other intangible assets
Directly attributable incremental costs associated with 
contracts are capitalised as intangible assets. These are 
measured initially at cost and are amortised over their useful 
economic lives.

Financial instruments

Non-derivative nancial instruments comprise trade and other 
receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and borrowings 
and trade and other payables. Non-derivative nancial 
instruments are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent 
to initial recognition, non-derivative nancial instruments are 
measured as described below. 
Cash and cash equivalents: This category comprises cash 
balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are 
repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s 
cash management are included as a component of cash and 
cash equivalents.
Other: These are non-derivative nancial instruments with 
 xed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an 
active market. They are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method, less any provision for impairment. 
Other nancial liabilities include the following items:
 Bank borrowings, which are recognised at the outstanding 
amount advanced less issue costs which are accreted to 
the income statement over the life of the borrowing facility. 
Interest expense on outstanding borrowings is charged to 
the income statement as incurred; and
 Interest-free loans, which are initially recognised at the 
present value of the amount advanced. These loans are 
subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest rate method, which ensures that any 
interest expense over the period to repayment is at a 
constant rate on the balance of the liability in the  
balance sheet.

The Group holds derivative nancial instruments to hedge 
its interest rate risk exposures. Derivatives are recognised 
initially at fair value; attributable transaction costs are 
recognised in pro t or loss when incurred. Subsequent to 
initial recognition, derivatives are measured at fair value 
and changes therein are accounted for in pro t or loss.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classi ed as equity. Incremental costs 
directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share 
options are recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any 
tax effects.

Contributions to the Group’s de ned contribution pension 
scheme are recognised as an employee bene t expense 
in pro t or loss when they are due.
Share-based payments
Where share options or conditional shares are awarded to 
employees, the fair value of the instruments at the date of 
grant is charged to the statement of comprehensive income 
over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are 
taken into account by adjusting the number of equity 
instruments expected to vest at each balance sheet date  
so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over 
the vesting period is based on the number of options that 
eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into  
the fair value of the options granted. As long as all other 
vesting conditions are satis ed, a charge is made irrespective 
of whether the market vesting conditions are satis ed.  
The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve 
a market vesting condition.
Leased assets
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental 
to ownership of a leased asset have been transferred to 
the Group (a ‘ nance lease’), the asset is treated as if it had 
been purchased outright. The amount initially recognised as 
an asset is the lower of fair value and present value of the 
minimum lease payments payable over the term of the lease. 
The corresponding lease commitment is shown as a liability. 
Lease payments are analysed between capital and interest. 
The interest element is charged to the statement of 
comprehensive income over the period of the lease and  
is calculated so that it represents a constant proportion of  
the lease liability. The capital element reduces the balance 
owed to the lessor.
Where substantially all of the risks and rewards incidental 
to ownership are retained by the lessor (an ‘operating lease’), 
the total rentals payable under the lease are charged to the 
statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
The land and buildings elements of property leases are 
considered separately for the purposes of lease classi cation. 
The lease in respect of Worcester Racecourse has been 
classi ed as a nance lease. The lease in respect of Doncaster 
Racecourse was previously split into an operating element, 
in respect of the land, and a nance element, in respect of the 
buildings. Under the new accounting policy, the land has been 
reclassi ed as a nance lease. This reclassi cation has been 
applied retrospectively. See Note 15 for further information.
3 Accounting policies continued

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financial Statements
Income tax
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. 
Income tax expense is recognised in pro t or loss except to 
the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, 
in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the tax payable on the taxable income for the 
year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the 
reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect 
of previous years.
Deferred tax is recognised using the balance sheet method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for nancial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes, 
except for differences arising on:
 The initial recognition of goodwill;
 Goodwill for which amortisation is not tax deductible;
 The initial recognition of an asset or liability in a 
transaction which is not a business combination and at 
the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor 
taxable pro t; and
 Investments in subsidiaries and jointly controlled entities 
where the Group is able to control the timing of the 
reversal of the difference and it is probable that the 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected 
to be applied to the temporary differences when they reverse, 
based on the laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the reporting date. Deferred tax balances are  
not discounted. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset if there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax liabilities and 
assets, and they relate to income tax levied by the same 
authority on the same taxable entity, or on different tax 
entities, but they intend to settle current tax liabilities and 
assets on a net basis or their tax assets and liabilities will 
be realised simultaneously.
Recognition of deferred tax assets is restricted to those 
instances where it is probable that taxable pro ts will 
be available against which the temporary difference can 
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each  
reporting date.
Earnings per share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share 
(‘EPS’) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS are calculated 
by dividing the pro t or loss attributable to ordinary 
shareholders of the Company by the weighted average 
number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. 
Diluted EPS are determined by adjusting the pro t or loss 
attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects 
of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share 
options granted to employees.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised when they become legally payable. 
In the case of interim dividends to equity shareholders, this 
is when paid by the Company. In the case of nal dividends, 
this is when approved by the shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are recognised at cost 
less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment 
losses.
Cost includes expenditure that is directly attributable to the 
acquisition of the asset. Purchased software that is integral 
to the functionality of the related equipment is capitalised 
as part of that equipment. Borrowing costs related to the 
acquisition or construction of qualifying assets are capitalised 
as part of the acquisition or construction cost.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have 
different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate 
items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Gains and losses on disposal of an item of property, plant 
and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds 
from disposal with the carrying amount of property, plant 
and equipment and are recognised net within ‘other income’ 
in pro t or loss. 
The cost of replacing part of an item of property, plant and 
equipment is recognised in the carrying amount of the item 
if it is probable that the future economic bene ts embodied 
within the part will ow to the Group and its cost can be 
measured reliably. The carrying amount of the replaced 
part is derecognised. The costs of the day-to-day servicing 
of property, plant and equipment are recognised in pro t 
or loss as incurred.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Depreciation is recognised 
in pro t or loss on all other items of property, plant and 
equipment to write off the cost, less estimated residual 
values of items, over their expected useful economic lives. 
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis at the 
following rates:
Freehold buildings 2% per annum
Leasehold land and buildings Over the length of lease 
to residual value
All-weather tracks Surface 5% to 10% per 
annum
Base 2.5% to 3.3% per 
annum
Plant and machinery 2.5% to 33% per annum
Fixtures and ttings 5% to 25% per annum
Motor vehicles 25% per annum
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are 
reviewed at each reporting date.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes Forming Part of the Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2010
Impairment 
Financial assets
A nancial asset is assessed at each reporting date to 
determine whether there is any objective evidence that it 
is impaired. A nancial asset is considered to be impaired 
if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have 
had a negative effect on the estimated future cash ows of 
that asset. An impairment loss in respect of a nancial asset 
measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference 
between its carrying amount and the present value of the 
estimated future cash ows discounted at the original 
effective interest rate. 
Individually signi cant nancial assets are tested for 
impairment on an individual basis. The remaining nancial 
assets are assessed collectively in groups that share similar 
credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in pro t or loss. An 
impairment loss is reversed if the reversal can be related 
objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss 
was recognised. 

Impairment tests in respect of goodwill are undertaken 
annually on 31 December. Where it is not possible to estimate 
the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the impairment 
test is carried out on the asset’s cash-generating unit, in this 
case being the individual racecourses. Where the carrying 
value of a racecourse exceeds its recoverable amount  
(i.e. the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell), 
the asset is written down accordingly. In assessing value in 
use, the estimated future cash ows are discounted to their 
present value using a pre-tax discount rate that re ects 
current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks speci c to the asset. Impairment losses are 
recognised in pro t or loss. An impairment loss in respect 
of goodwill is not reversed.
Other non- nancial assets are subject to impairment tests 
whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that 
their carrying value may not be recoverable. If any such 
indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is 
estimated with the impairment recognised in pro t or loss. 
Impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed 
at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has 
decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed 
if there has been a change in the estimates used to 
determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is 
reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount 
does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no 
impairment loss had been recognised.
3 Accounting policies continued Finance income and expenses
Finance income comprises interest income on funds  
invested, changes in the fair value of nancial assets at fair 
value through pro t or loss and gains on hedging instruments 
that are recognised in pro t or loss. Interest income is 
recognised as it accrues in pro t or loss, using the effective 
interest method. 
Finance expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, 
changes in the fair value of nancial assets at fair value 
through pro t or loss, impairment losses recognised on 
 nancial assets, losses on hedging instruments that are 
recognised in pro t or loss and nance lease interest.  
All borrowing costs, with the exception of those described 
above, are recognised in pro t or loss using the effective 
interest method.
Inventories
Inventories are recognised at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the 
 rst-in rst-out principle. Net realisable value is the  
estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business.
Government grants
Government grants received on capital expenditure are 
initially recognised on receipt as deferred income. The 
deferred income balance is recognised in pro t or loss 
proportionally over the period in which the depreciation 
on those assets is charged.
Operating segments
The operating segment is reported in a manner consistent 
with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating 
decision-maker. The chief operating decision-maker has 
been identi ed as the Board of Directors.
Separately disclosed items
These are items which, in management’s judgement,  
need to be disclosed by virtue of their size or incident in

New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The International Accounting Standards Board and the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee have issued 
the following standards and interpretations which are not yet effective for the year ended 31 December 2010 and have not yet 
been applied in preparing these consolidated nancial statements, but which are to be applied to nancial statements with 
periods commencing on or after the following dates: 
International Accounting Standards (IAS/IFRS) EU-endorsed effective date
Amendments to IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ 1 February 2010
Improvements to IFRS (issued May 2010) 1 January 2011
Revised IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ 1 January 2011
Amendments to IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ 1 July 2011
International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) EU-endorsed effective date
IFRIC 19 ‘Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity Instruments’ 1 July 2010
Amendments to IFRIC 14 ‘The Limit on a De ned Bene t’ 1 January 2011
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the 
Group’s nancial statements in the period of application and all relevant aspects of Improvements to IFRS will be applied.
4 Determination of fair values
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the determination of fair value, for both nancial and 
non- nancial assets and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/or disclosure purposes based 
on the following methods. When applicable, further information about the assumptions made in determining fair values is 
disclosed in the notes speci c to that asset or liability.
Derivatives
The fair value of interest rate hedging agreements is based on bank valuations. 

Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated based on the present value of future principal and interest 
cash ows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. 
Share-based payment transactions
The fair value of employee stock options is measured using the Black-Scholes Pricing Analysis. Measurement inputs include 
share price on measurement date, exercise price of the instrument, expected volatility (based on weighted average historic 
volatility adjusted for changes expected due to publicly available information), weighted average expected life of the 
instruments (based on historical experience and general option holder behaviour), expected dividends and the risk-free interest 
rate (based on government bonds). Service and non-market performance conditions attached to the transactions are not taken 
into account in determining fair value.
The fair value of employee LTIP shares is based upon the market value at the time of grant, adjusted for management’s 
assessment of the probability of the scheme criteria being met at the vesting dates in respect of service and non-market 
performance conditions.
Trade receivables and payables
For trade receivables and payables the carrying amount is a reasonable approximation of fair value.

Certain employee options have not been included in the calculation of diluted EPS because their exercise is contingent on the 
satisfaction of speci c criteria that had not been met at the end of the year. In addition, certain employee options have also 
been excluded from the calculation of diluted EPS as their exercise price is greater than the weighted average share price 
during the year (i.e. they are out-of-the-money) and therefore would not be dilutive. The total number of share options and LTIP 
shares excluded in 2010 and 2009 are disclosed in Note 32.
The average market value of the Company’s shares for the purposes of calculating the dilutive effect of share options was 
based on quoted market prices for the period that the options were outstanding.

15 Change in accounting policy: leased assets
The 99 year lease in respect of Doncaster Racecourse was previously split into an operating element, in respect of the land, 
and a nance element, in respect of the buildings. Under the new accounting policy, the land has been reclassi ed as a nance 
lease. This reclassi cation has been applied retrospectively and, in accordance with IAS 8, the prior year balance sheet gures 
have been restated, with the net effect recognised in equity. In the opinion of the Directors, the impact of the change is not 
material and therefore a third balance sheet has not been presented.

Security in relation to the Group’s freehold land and buildings in disclosed in Note 25.
Assets under construction consist of expenditure in respect of proposed developments at Wolverhampton, Royal Windsor, 
Folkestone and Doncaster Racecourses. These costs will be depreciated once the developments are complete and available 
for use. The expenditure includes a variety of professional fees incurred in the design and planning process for the individual 
developments, such as building architects, engineers, surveyors, cost consultants, planning consultants, legal fees and 
specialist reports.
Certain capitalised costs have been reclassi ed after the completion of development projects following advice from quantity 
surveyors. The Directors allocate costs based on their best estimate, and appropriate reclassi cations are made following the 
quantity surveyor’s report.
Additions include £844,000 (2009: £735,000) relating to interest capitalised in relation to the development projects in 
progress at Doncaster, Ling eld Park, Wolverhampton and Royal Windsor. Interest was capitalised at LIBOR plus 1%, LIBOR 
plus 2.5% or LIBOR plus 2.0% to 3.25%, as applicable. There is no resulting impact on the tax charge for the year (2009: none).
The land and buildings and xtures and ttings associated with the Ling eld Park leisure club were sold for £615,000 in 
November 2009, resulting in a pro t on disposal of £418,000.

The additions to intangible assets in 2009 and 2010 represent costs incurred speci cally in relation to the Group’s new media 
rights agreement. The costs will be amortised on a straight-line basis over the ve-year term of the agreement, which 
commences on 1 January 2012.
A review of the carrying value of goodwill arising from the acquisition of the Group’s racecourses was undertaken at 
31 December 2010. The Board has conducted its review by comparing the carrying value of each racecourse with its 
recoverable amount. The recoverable amount of each racecourse was based on value in use. 
Value in use was determined by discounting the expected future pre-tax cash ows generated from the continuing use of 
each racecourse using the following key assumptions:
 Cash ows were projected based on management’s approved budgets and forecasts for a ve-year period;
 A terminal value was based on an extrapolation of the estimate of the future cash ows beyond the ve-year period into 
perpetuity and a pre-tax discount rate. No growth was assumed in the terminal value (2009: none);
 For the purpose of this impairment review only, the estimated pre-tax cash ows assume a standard growth rate of 5.0% per 
annum (2009: 5.0%), on top of which the new terms of the media rights agreement with SIS have been overlaid, except that 
the projections for Doncaster Racecourse have been moderated to re ect earnings reaching stabilisation following its 
redevelopment; and
 A pre-tax discount rate of 8.0% (2009: 8.0%) was applied in determining the terminal value and the recoverable amounts 
of the racecourses. The discount rate was based on an adjusted estimated weighted average cost of capital.

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financial Statements
17 Intangible assets continued
The resultant net present values were compared to the carrying values of each racecourse and were found to exceed the asset 
value of each racecourse plus the goodwill value. As a result of this review, the Board does not consider that any impairment 
provision is necessary.
The Directors have considered the sensitivity of the cash ow projections to the key assumptions (based on adjusted discount 
rates and growth rate) and have concluded, given the headroom in the projections, that there would be no signi cant change 
to the carrying value of the assets.
The Directors have identi ed two key assumptions for which there could be a reasonably possible change that could cause the 
carrying amount to exceed the recoverable amount. A reduction in projected cash ows of more than 20.0% (2009: 25.0%) or 
a change in the assumed discount rate to more than 10.0% (2009: 11.0%) would be required before the estimated recoverable 
amount of any single asset becomes equal to its carrying value.

Arena Leisure Plc and BSkyB, as part of their shareholders’ agreement, have a commitment to fund ATR by way of loans 
up to an amount not exceeding £10,000,000 pro rata to shareholding. Arena Leisure is therefore committed to fund up to 
£5,000,000, of which £4,308,000 has been provided by way of loans at 31 December 2010 (2009: £4,754,000). These loans 
are considered, in substance, to form part of the Company’s net investment in ATR. Settlement of these loans in full is neither 
planned nor expected to occur in the foreseeable future.

Risk management
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s risk management framework. The Finance Director is responsible for 
developing and monitoring the Group’s risk management policies and reporting to the Board.
The Group’s risk management policies are established to identify and analyse the risks faced by the Group, to set appropriate 
controls and to monitor risks and adherence to controls. Risk management policies and systems are reviewed regularly to 
re ect changes in market conditions and the Group’s activities. The Board oversees how management monitors compliance 
with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures. 
The Group is exposed through its use of nancial instruments to one or more of the following nancial risks:
 Interest rate risk;
 Liquidity risk; and
 Credit risk.
Arena Leisure Plc 61 
Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Notes Forming Part of the Financial Statements continued
for the year ended 31 December 2010
26 Financial instruments continued
The policy for each of the above risks is described in more detail below.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that changes in interest rates will affect the Group’s pro ts. The objective of management is to 
control interest rate risk exposures. 
With the exception of interest-free borrowing from the HBLB, the Group’s bank borrowings are at oating interest rates.  
All of the Group’s borrowings are in sterling. 
In 2010, the Group entered into an interest rate swap arrangement in respect of £15.0m of debt at 4.77% which became 
effective on 31 March 2010. The amount hedged under this instrument reduces to £10.0m from 1 April 2011 and to £5.0m 
from 1 April 2012. This swap replaced the Group’s cap and collar arrangement that had been effective from 1 October 2007. 
In 2008, the Group entered into an interest rate swap arrangement in respect of £7.5m of debt and an interest rate cap 
arrangement in respect of £2.5m of debt, both of which became effective on 2 October 2008, and for which the effective 
LIBOR rate is a maximum of 5.27%. As at 31 December 2010, the Group was exposed to interest rate risk on debt above these 
amounts. The Board constantly monitors the nancial markets and the Group’s future borrowing requirements to ensure that 
this policy remains in the Group’s interest.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its nancial obligations as they fall due. Liquidity risk is managed 
centrally on a group basis to ensure the Group will have suf cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when they fall due. 
Bank facilities are agreed at appropriate levels having regard to the Group’s forecast operating cash ows and future capital 
expenditure requirements. In March 2010, the Group agreed £55.0m of committed banking facilities with its relationship bank 
(LBG), which replaced all previous bank facilities, as outlined in the Financial Review on pages 23 to 24.
At 31 December 2010, the Group maintained the following lines of credit, both of which are with LBG:
 £20.0m Group secured revolving credit loan which can be drawn for working capital and general corporate use. Interest is 
payable at between LIBOR plus 2.0% and LIBOR plus 3.25%; and
 £30.0m Group secured term loan which can be drawn for working capital and general corporate use. Interest is payable 
at between LIBOR plus 2.0% and LIBOR plus 3.25%. This loan reduces by £5.0m at 31 January and 31 July each year until 
31 January 2012, at which point it reduces by £2.5m each quarter.
It is the Group’s policy not to commence construction on development projects until funding has been secured.
Further details on the loan terms, repayments and committed borrowing facilities of the Group at 31 December 2010 are 
disclosed in Note 25.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of nancial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a nancial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations. The Group has limited exposure to credit risk. Income derived from much of the Group’s raceday 
activity is paid on the day of the event or is invoiced and paid in advance of the event. With the exception of a small number 
of signi cant centrally negotiated transactions, credit control is managed on a local basis.
Although the Group is exposed through the derivation of a high proportion of its income from a small number of sources, these 
sources are: the HBLB, which is operated under Government statute; bookmakers, for which a central contract exists for fees 
payable in return for transmission of pictures of live racing into LBOs across the UK and Ireland; and the Group’s 45.85% joint 
venture company, ATR, to which the Group sells its media rights. It is therefore the view of the Board that credit risk is minimal. 
The Group has established an allowance for impairment, representing its estimate of incurred losses in respect of trade and 
other receivables. This allowance relates to speci c individual exposures.

Capital management
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market con dence and to sustain 
future development of the business. The Company’s objective for managing its capital is to ensure that Group entities will be 
able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to shareholders, as well as sustaining the future development 
of its business. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, Arena may alter the total amount of dividends paid to 
shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares, draw down additional debt or sell assets to reduce debt. It is 
the Group’s policy to look for a return of in excess of 10% on net cash cost when evaluating development projects. The Board 
monitors the level of dividends to ordinary shareholders. 
It is the Board’s policy to ensure there is a strong link between the remuneration of the Directors and other key employees and 
the performance of the Group. Final grants under the Arena Leisure Discretionary Share Option Scheme were made in 2006 
and shareholder approval was obtained in April 2007 for a new long-term incentive plan (‘LTIP’), with initial awards being made 
in 2007 and further awards made each year thereafter.
Arena’s capital structure consists of debt, which includes the loans and borrowings disclosed in Note 25, cash and cash equivalents 
(Note 23) and equity attributable to the parent, comprising share capital, reserves and retained earnings, as disclosed in Notes 28 
and 29. The Group seeks to maintain a balance between the higher returns that might be possible with higher levels of borrowings 
and the advantages and security afforded by a sound capital position.
Neither the Company nor any of its subsidiaries are subject to externally imposed capital requirements.

Interest on the secured loans has been estimated using 12-month LIBOR at 31 December 2010 (2009: 12-month LIBOR at 
31 December 2009).
The carrying amount of nancial derivatives is based on the market valuation as at 31 December provided by LBG. The 
contractual cash ows of nancial derivatives are made by reference to the differential between the nominal rate of the 
instrument and the forward swap rate over the period of the instrument. For cap instruments, the rate is below the contracted 
rate and, as a result, no cash ow is projected.

The rate at which interest is payable on hedged oating liabilities is 4.77% to 5.27% (2009: 4.76% to 5.50%). The rate at which 
interest is payable on un-hedged oating liabilities is 2.0% to 3.25% above LIBOR (2009: 1.0% above Bank of Scotland base 
rate or LIBOR, or 2.5% above LIBOR).
The rate at which interest is receivable on cash balances is 0.25% (2009: 0.25%).
In respect of the oating rate liabilities, a change of 100 basis points in interest rates at the reporting date would result in the

 Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
 Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).

The Group has not provided for the deferred tax assets on the above losses as it is not probable that taxable pro ts in the short 
term will be available against which the Group can utilise the associated tax bene ts.
The UK Government announced a phased reduction in the main UK corporation tax rate from 28% to 24%, with the rst 1% 
reduction taking effect from 1 April 2011 (and substantively enacted on 20 July 1010). Deferred tax assets and liabilities are 
measured at the tax rate that is expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is settled, based on 
the rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date. Therefore, at 31 December 2010, 
deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated based on a rate of 27%, where the temporary difference is expected 
to reverse after 1 April 2011. The effect of the remeasurement has had no impact on the pro t for the year.
No account will been taken of the further 3% reduction in tax rates until substantive enactment of these changes, however it 
is estimated that this will not have a material impact on the Group.

The following describes the nature and purpose of each reserve within shareholders’ equity:
Reserve Description and purpose
Share premium Amount subscribed for share capital in excess of nominal value.
Merger reserve The merger reserve arose due to the availability of merger relief in connection 
with the acquisitions of RAM Racing Leisure Ltd (Wolverhampton and Southwell 
Racecourses) and Royal Windsor Racecourse, partly paid by a share for share 
exchange, and represents the difference between the fair value of the consideration 
given for the shares issued and the nominal value of those instruments.
Retained earnings Cumulative net gains and losses attributable to the equity shareholders of the 
parent company recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Non-controlling interest Cumulative net gains and losses attributable to Doncaster Metropolitan Borough 
Council in respect of their non-controlling interest in The Doncaster Racecourse 
Management Company Ltd.

32 Share-based payment
The Company operates a long-term incentive scheme and two share option schemes for employees: an HM Revenue  Customs 
approved share option scheme and an unapproved discretionary share option scheme. Final grants were made under the share 
option schemes in 2006.
Share option schemes
Performance criteria based upon the future market price of the Company’s shares or growth in adjusted earnings per share are 
attached to each grant of options which must be met prior to exercise. In normal circumstances, employees will forfeit rights 
over share options six months after leaving the Company’s employment, although Directors have discretionary power to extend 
this to one year following cessation of employment or three and a half years from the date of grant.

Of the total number of options outstanding at the end of the year, 3,592,743 (2009: 3,854,373) had vested and were 
exercisable at the end of the year. There were no options exercised in 2010 (2009: none). 
The following information is relevant in the determination of the fair value of options granted under the equity-settled share-
based remuneration schemes operated by the Group: 
2006
Equity-settled
Option pricing model used Black-Scholes
Share price at grant date 39.50p
Exercise price 39.50p
Estimated period to exercise of options 5 years
Expected volatility 16%
Risk-free interest rate 4.75%
The nal grants under the share option schemes were in October 2006. The weighted average fair value of each option granted 
in 2006 was 9.17p. The valuation performed at the grant date used a volatility assumption based on statistical analysis of daily 
share prices over a period of 90 days. A period of 90 days was deemed by the Board to be a more appropriate basis for analysis 
than a three-year period owing to the distorting effect of the Group’s former technology-based subsidiary and the original 
attheraces business model. The average share price over the three-year period to 31 December 2006 was therefore not 
representative of the Group’s business model going forward.

Long-term incentive scheme
In April 2007, shareholder approval was obtained for a long-term incentive plan (‘LTIP’). The LTIP provides for annual conditional 
awards of shares to be made, subject to performance criteria. The rst awards under the scheme were made in 2007 and are 
subject to absolute adjusted EPS growth targets over a three-year period. Further awards were made in 2009 and 2010 and 
are subject to relative adjusted EPS growth targets over a three-year period (see page 35 of the Remuneration Report for the 
speci c criteria attached to the awards). In certain circumstances of cessation of employment (e.g. death, injury or disability, 
retirement, redundancy, employment being with a company which ceases to be a Group member or for other reasons as the 
Remuneration Committee so decides), an employee will be considered a good leaver and the shares will vest on either the 
date of departure or the normal vesting date, subject, in both circumstances, to a pro-rata reduction for the time served; such 
reduction can be waived at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. In any other circumstance, the awards will lapse 
immediately upon the employee leaving the Company’s employment.

The weighted average fair value of each share awarded during the year was 34.95p (2009: 26.55p).
The volatility assumption is based on management’s assessment of the amount of shares that will vest.

At 31 December 2010 the Directors reviewed the probability of the LTIP scheme criteria being met at the vesting dates, and 
a reduction in the cumulative expense in relation to the 2009 LTIP shares has been made to re ect current expectations.
The cumulative entries in respect of the share options granted in 2005 and 2006 and the LTIP shares awarded in 2007 and

Annual Report and Accounts 2010 Financial Statements

for the year ended 31 December 2010
1 Accounting policies
The nancial statements of the Company have been 
prepared under UK GAAP using the historical cost convention 
and are in accordance with applicable accounting standards 
and the Companies Act 2006.
The following principal accounting policies have been 
applied on a basis consistent with the International Financial 
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) nancial statements and are 
explained in Note 3 to the IFRS nancial statements:
 Depreciation;
 Dividends; and
 Pension costs.
The following accounting policies differ from the IFRS 
accounting policies: 
Financial assets and liabilities
All nancial assets and liabilities are accounted for 
consistently with the IFRS nancial statements with the 
exception of investments in subsidiaries which are held 
at cost less provisions for impairment. 
Investments in joint ventures
Investments in joint ventures are stated at cost less 
provisions for impairment.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax assets and liabilities arise from timing 
differences between the recognition of gains and losses 
in the nancial statements and their recognition in a tax 
computation. In accordance with FRS 19, deferred tax 
is provided in respect of all timing differences that have 
originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date that 
may give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the 
future. The recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to 
the extent that the Company anticipates making suf cient 
taxable pro ts in the future to absorb the reversal of 
underlying timing differences. Deferred tax is measured 
on a non-discounted basis.
Share-based payment
Where share options are awarded to employees, the fair value 
of options granted is recognised as an employee expense with 
a corresponding increase in equity. The fair value is measured 
at grant date and spread over the period during which the 
employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. The 
fair value of the options granted is measured using an option 
pricing model, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the options were granted. The amount recognised 
as an expense is adjusted to re ect the actual number of 
share options that vest except where forfeiture is only due 
to share prices not achieving the threshold for vesting.
Where the Company grants options over its own shares to 
the employees of its subsidiaries it recognises an increase 
in the cost of investment in its subsidiaries equivalent to the 
equity-settled share-based payment charge recognised in 
its subsidiary’s nancial statements with the corresponding 
credit being recognised directly in equity. 
Financial guarantees
Where the Company enters into nancial guarantee contracts 
and guarantees the indebtedness of other companies within 
the Group, the Company considers these to be insurance 
arrangements and accounts for them as such. In this 
respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a 
contingent liability until such time that it becomes probable 
that the Company will be required to make a payment under 
the guarantee.

The Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash 
 ow statement on the grounds that the Company is included in 
its own published consolidated nancial statements.
2 Result for the period
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption 
allowed under Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 
and has not presented its own pro t and loss account in 
these nancial statements.
Pro t after tax for the Company was £3,851,000 for the 
period (2009: £1,042,000).

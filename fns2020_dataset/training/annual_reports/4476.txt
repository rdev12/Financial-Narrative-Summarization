takes advantage of the synergies within the
operating divisions optimizing the value of
current and future intellectual property
rights through its distribution arm.
DCD Media has shifted the weight of the
business towards higher-margin production
(now 75% of total revenues) rather than
distribution, to maximize revenues from the
opening up of the market for independent
producers.
The broader base of production and
distribution both spreads risks and creates
business opportunities.
how the structure works
The group sells rights of both DCD and third-party producers
via its wholly owned international distribution arm.  The
division markets not only to television and DVD but also to
emerging new media platforms. DCD also exploits ancillary
rights such as book publishing tie-ins, newspaper spin-off
features, interactive opportunities and advertiser funding.

74578 DCD PRE 1  15/11/07  15:32  Page 4 Letter from our Chairman
During 2006/7 DCD has fulfilled the board’s
expectations in terms of turnover and profit growth, and
shown that our acquisition and consolidation strategy
is soundly based. We are probably now the most broadly
based of all the UK quoted independent TV companies,
we have an exciting creative core and a strengthened
management team, who together make DCD Media a
key player in the TV production and distribution sector .
The current trading year should show further progress,
with the latest acquisitions bearing fruit.   
On behalf of the board, I am pleased to present the
annual results for the group for the year ended
June 30 2007.
During this financial year, DCD Media has set itself
two key targets: integration of the acquisitions
made in the previous year and preparation for
further enlargement of the group within a rapidly
consolidating sector.
Turnover in 2006/7 was more than double the
previous year, which in turn had seen a significant
increase on 2004/5. What was until recently a
£3.1m per annum turnover company is now a £26.8m
turnover company, and this is before any contribution
from the acquisitions made in the summer .
Each of the production entities within the
group has made significant contributions to
our outcome, and the distribution division has
capitalized on the availability of dramas delivered
by Box, such as The Wind In The Willows, 
Bon Voyage and The Last Enemy, as well as
documentaries from Iambic on Abba, The Beatles
and Boy Bands. Done and Dusted, which
specializes in filming live events, is also
generating opportunities for the distribution
division, with programmes such as T4 on the
Beach. The results reported here embrace the
results of Iambic, Done and Dusted, Box, our 
DVD label and the distribution specialist NBD TV.
Financial Review
With turnover doubling (from £13.3m in 2005/6
to £26.8m in 2006/7), the various measures of
profit reflected the enlarged scale of the business.
Gross profit increased from £3.1m (2005/6) to
£5.8m (2006/7), operating profit from a loss of
£1.0m (2005/6) to a positive figure of £0.4m before
an exceptional item, and adjusted profit before tax
from a loss of £0.3m (2005/6) to a profit of £1.36m
(2006/7). This outcome demonstrates our ability to
absorb new businesses, and encourages us to
continue on this track.
There were a number of one-off costs during
the year, such as moving all operating companies
into one office in order to rationalise the group.
This was also a period when we took a full year of
goodwill amortization from previous acquisitions
(£1.2m charge, compared with £0.7m in the
previous year).
Outlook
As the core of production entities within the
group enlarges, so the benefits of shared
overheads and creative synergy come to the fore.
Further acquisitions, made during August 2007
and described below, will accentuate these trends,
and place DCD Media firmly in the front rank of
listed production and distribution companies.
The UK production industry is a leading player
internationally, and the strategy of steadily
broadening our base whilst carefully controlling
central costs looks increasingly attractive. We
therefore expect to make further progress, on
all key metrics, during the 2007/8 trading year.
I would like to thank all my board colleagues for
their efforts, particularly the executive management
team led by CEO Chris Hunt and CFO John McIntosh.

74578 DCD PRE 1  19/11/07  22:11  Page 7 Chief Executive’s Review
For the financial year to June 2008 the
group is planning to continue its strong growth.
I am delighted with the early performance
of the three companies which DCD acquired
in August 2007, and I am confident that they
are on the road to deliver the added value
to shareholders that we had anticipated.
DCD has developed a stronger stable of top
class producers of content across a wide
range of genres and with a large and growing
number of clients, with extra benefit through
the vertical integration provided by our
in-house distributor.
The group is now recognised as a significant
independent media producer spanning the
entertainment, factual, drama, arts and media
event management sectors. In addition to
continuing organic growth, it remains part of 
the group’s strategy to continue to make further
acquisitions within other genres where it believes
commercial synergies will result.
DCD is strengthened by the acquisition of three
new businesses in August 2007, Prospect Pictures,
September Films and West Park Pictures, which
are all established in their respective production
genres – Prospect in lifestyle programmes,
September in factual entertainment and West 
Park in documentaries. DCD recognises that 
the industry is consolidating but its own rate of
growth means it will now be ranked within the
UK’s top ten independent producers by turnover.
This strengthens the ability of the group to drive
new revenue opportunities through:
● economies of scale through operating synergies
across the group
● recognition gained across a wide range of
television production genres
● new relationships being developed both in 
the UK and abroad from the contacts of the
acquired companies – the opening of the door 
to US broadcasters via September Films is
considered one of the most important factors 
in that acquisition
● maximisation of the benefits from vertical
integration by pushing more product through 
an expanded distribution division.
DCD has the capacity to sell its programmes to
online distributors and more such opportunities
will open up. It has a pool of talent which bears
comparison with the best any independent
8
74578 DCD PRE 1  15/11/07  15:33  Page 8 producer can offer, and will establish an
organisational structure to allow the creative
heads to think outside their normal remits to
develop new ideas and products.
Deal structure of acquisitions announced 
in August 2007
The group has acquired the entire issued share
capital of each of Prospect Pictures Limited,
September Holdings Limited and West Park
Pictures Limited. These companies operate in 
the areas of lifestyle TV, factual entertainment 
and international documentary TV production.
Completion of the acquisitions took place on 
7 August 2007.
In each case the vendors were the company’s
management, who all agreed to accept new
service agreements lasting at least three years,
and who all received half their consideration in
cash and half in DCD Media shares which were
locked in for two years (plus a third year through
an orderly market agreement with the group’s
brokers). The new subsidiaries are therefore run
by a highly incentivised management congruent
with DCD Media plc objectives to help it grow 
and prosper.
Funding of Acquisitions
Similar to the previous trio of acquisitions, each of
the companies acquired was bought on a multiple
of earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and
amortisation of nine times or less, based on
current and historic performance, with a forward
multiple of seven.
The aggregate consideration amounted to
approximately £19.1 million, comprising 
£9.37 million in cash, £0.18 million in loan notes
and £9.55 million in new Ordinary Shares. DCD
raised £8.5 million before expenses via a placing 
of 10,625,000 new Ordinary Shares with certain
institutional investors at 80 pence per share
following a planned 100 for 1 share consolidation.
In addition, the group raised £4 million of
convertible loan from institutional investors.
The board believes the acquisitions meet the
group’s criteria for growth by acquisition and will
help to capitalise on the opportunities becoming
available as the market consolidates.
● September Holdings Ltd
The total consideration for the acquisition was
£9.06 million, comprising £4.53 million in cash
and £4.53 million satisfied by 5,662,152 new
Ordinary Shares.
● Prospect Pictures Ltd
The total consideration for the acquisition was
£7.05 million, comprising £3.35 million in cash,
£0.18 million in loan notes and £3.52 million
satisfied by 4,406,250 new Ordinary Shares.
● West Park Pictures Ltd
The total consideration for the acquisition was
£2.96 million, comprising £1.48 million in cash
and £1.48 million satisfied by 1,850,391 new
Ordinary Shares.
Outlook
The outlook for the group is positive for a number
of reasons. It has acquired three new production
companies with only a minimal increase in central
costs, so that nearly all their contribution to cash
earnings flows through to the Operating Profit.
Each of these companies is growing in line with
expectations, and synergies are emerging.
The Directors are comfortable with the
performance of the pre-existing production 
and distribution divisions, which continue to 
deliver as anticipated. These have all been
successfully assimilated into the DCD group, 
and the seamless way in which this occurred 
has more recently been mirrored by the
consolidation of the new acquisitions.
9
74578 DCD PRE 1  15/11/07  15:33  Page 9 Chief Executive’s Review continued
The group is now a widely diversified entity, with a
number of successful brands but no over-reliance
on any one, and with a very wide client base in 
the UK and abroad. In the period under review 
no single client represented more than 10% of
turnover, and DCD had over 200 clients. With the
three acquisitions then joining, the list of clients
has broadened further.
A simple, vertically-integrated structure; 
the best talent locked in and incentivised; a 
diversified client base; the ability to create 
and own content across all media; and an
acquisition strategy built on immediate earnings
enhancement and the addition of shareholder
value: these are the watchwords by which DCD
Media is continuing to grow, and which will ensure
that the outlook remains favourable for some
distance into the future.
Despite recent industry hiccoughs at the BBC 
and ITV, the outlook for DCD is favourable as the
BBC has announced that it will focus on areas 
in which DCD is strong and is formalising 
WOCC (The Window of Creative Competition) 
which may lead to an expansion of the 
potential independent market of £250m, 
and ITV has pledged to continue to seek the 
best programming from whatsoever source.
The net effect of the changes that have ensued
there makes the prospects for DCD no less
favourable than before. DCD has remained 
unaffected by the recent ethics and phone
revenue problems at the BBC and ITV.
Further growth is anticipated, organically and by
acquisition. DCD Media plc is a work in progress,
but one which is already demonstrating the
benefits of its strategy.
Financial Overview 
Trading Results
Group turnover grew by 101% to £26.8m (2006:
£13.3m) with the group’s three acquisitions from
2006 contributing a full year of consolidated
contribution for the first time. In the prior year
these three acquisitions contributed to turnover 
for approximately six months out of that year 
of trading.
Gross profit increased by 88% to £5.8m (2006:
£3.1m). The gross margin has remained steady 
at 22% (2006: 23%), a slight decrease on the 
prior year due to the higher costs of set up and
manning a presence in the U.S.
The full year of additional contribution of new
businesses has driven central, administration,
sales and distribution costs to £5.4m up from
£4.1m in 2006. Consequently, administrative costs
now represent 20% of turnover, a significantly
reduced proportion compared with 31% in 2006.
This measure represents a significant indicator 
in driving efficiencies across the overall group.
Operating profit increased by £1.4m to £0.4m
before exceptional item (2006: Loss £1.0m)
reflecting the contribution of prior year
acquisitions, after an amortization charge 
on goodwill of £1.2m (2006: £0.7m).
The group’s management believes that a better
representation of earnings is by reference to
Adjusted Profit before Tax, taking account of 
non-cash deductions against operating profit.
Adjusted Profit before Tax stood at £1.36m up 
from a loss of £0.3m in 2006. 
10
74578 DCD PRE 1  15/11/07  15:33  Page 10 The board previously considered the alternative
measure of Earnings Before Interest Depreciation
and Amortisation (EBITDA). However, this measure
does not provide a satisfactory reflection of 
non-cash related normalised operating income
and expenditure. For information only, during 
the period of review, reported EBITDA rose to
£8.0m (2006: £2.2m).
Earnings per share is disclosed in note 2 below.
Balance Sheet
Net current assets increased to £2.0m (2006:
£1.4m) reflecting the delivery of programmes
during the period allowing a production loan to 
be repaid, and the value of new productions in
progress at the period end.
Net funds stand at £1.0m (2006: £1.5m) reflecting
increased net interest payments in the period of
£0.5m (2006: £0.2m) and timing differences due 
to funding of programme production towards the
end of the period.
Interest cost arises from the full year cost of 
long term debt, which at the year end, stood at
£7.3m (2006: £7.7m) and reflects a Convertible
Loan raised during the prior year to finance 
earlier acquisitions. 
Shareholder funds remain steady at £21.3m 
(2006: £21.3m) reflecting the result for the period.

Founded in 2000 by award-winning producer Gub Neal,
formerly Head of Drama at Channel 4 and Controller of
Drama at Granada Television, Box TV produces event-drama
for film and television. In its first six years, the division has
overseen more than £50m of production. Box TV became part
of DCD Media in December 2005.
This division continued to grow its reputation in the large scale
drama sector. It delivered the BBC One Christmas hit ‘The
Wind In The Willows’ starring Matt Lucas and Bob Hoskins 
and award-winning mini-series ‘Bon Voyage’ for ITV1 both 
of which achieved high ratings and acclaim.
Its most recent addition to the creative department, executive
producer Adrian Bate, contributed a major ITV1 drama entitled
‘Affinity’, from the novel by the writer of ‘Tipping The Velvet’
and ‘Fingersmith’, while founder creative head Gub Neal won
Box TV’s biggest ever commission, for a 5 part thriller series
‘The Last Enemy’ for BBC One.
Box TV is expected to conclude ‘Affinity’ during the coming
period, with the premiere of the completed ‘The Last Enemy’
due to be announced shortly for primetime BBC airing. The
productions continue to derive sales in both UK and foreign
markets, and there is reason to anticipate further profits from
them, as well as the previous successes completed in the 
prior year. 
Box TV has a strong outlook, with a number of projects 
in development.

Iambic has successfully produced a long string of major
documentaries and concerts, winning four Emmys and 
over fifty nominations and awards in most of the major 
TV festivals. Iambic Productions became part of the

The group’s original production unit has maintained a high
margin and consolidated its worldwide reputation for high
quality entertainment documentaries, with a mini-series for
ITV1 called ‘The Truth About Boy Bands’ and films about The
Beatles, Abba and Michael Jackson being aired on BBC One
and ITV1 respectively. Its arts output was maintained by two
classical music-based programmes, and it has a healthy

programmes featuring cookery and other lifestyle subjects. 
It has a high volume of low cost productions and recurring
output contracts, which provide stable and visible earnings.
Founded in 1988, Prospect Pictures (Prospect) joined DCD
Media in August 2007.
For the domestic market, Prospect specialises in live,
interactive lifestyle programming such as ‘The Cooks!’ series,
but it is also developing factual entertainment formats and
documentaries for the international market. A subsidiary of
Prospect Pictures, Cardiff-based Prospect Cymru Wales,
specialises in the creation and production of English and Welsh
language television programmes for Welsh based broadcasters
(such as BBC Wales and S4C). Among independent producers
Prospect is one of the largest suppliers, making over 500 hours
of television for UK broadcasters in 2006.
The company’s long standing specialism in food programming
persuaded ITV to contract Prospect for a two year period
to supply the channel with daytime food output. As a
consequence of this Prospect recently created its own
website, www.cooksforcooks.com, to exploit its extensive
archive in this genre.
Prospect Pictures has a healthy outlook, with a fourth series of
ITV’s ‘Daily Cooks!’ commissioned, ‘Saturday Cooks!’ currently
airing on ITV1 and a second series of ‘Christmas Cooks!’ due
to transmit on the same channel daily over the festive period.

reality and formats for media channels worldwide and is
headed by David Green, an internationally renowned
producer and director. An important part of the business 
of September Films is in the US, with a full time operating
office in Los Angeles. Founded in 1992, September Films
became part of DCD Media in August 2007.
Its credits include ‘Bridezillas’ soon to broadcast its fifth
season on the Women’s Entertainment channel in the US, 
and the ‘Hollywood’ brand recently transmitting its thirteenth
series for ITV1 and others. The company has produced
over 1,000 hours of primetime television during the last
fifteen years.
Following the engagement of an additional creative executive,
September Films has recently announced a double commission
for Five’s ‘Extraordinary People’ strand and has further
factual-based projects in the pipeline, all of which are in line
with the group’s expectations.
September Films retains the international rights to its
programmes; these are exploited through its dedicated sales
arm, September International, which has now been
consolidated into DCD’s distribution arm NBD Television.

with an international flavour; it has established links with
well known UK presenter personalities and also produces
works with Prince Charles’ artistic foundation. The company
was founded in 2000 by one of the UK’s most highly respected
film makers, Andre Singer and became part of DCD Media in
August 2007.
West Park Pictures has also made many of Werner Herzog’s
films including the 2005 sci-fi release The Wild Blue Yonder,
awarded the Critics Prize at the Venice Film Festival. 
Its recent broadcasts on BBC2, ‘Stephen Fry: HIV & Me’, which
attracted sizeable audiences and acclaim, will for instance be
followed by two more series presented by the same person:
‘Last Chance To See’, and ‘Stephen Fry’s In America’ which 
is currently being filmed.

The group sells rights of both DCD and third-party producers
via its wholly owned international distribution arm NBD
Television (NBD). Its portfolio covers the broad range of
genres from drama, music and entertainment to documentary
programming and formats. Founded in 1983, NBD joined 
DCD Media in December 2005.
During the period the distribution division recorded its highest-
ever sales at the world’s biggest television market, MIPTV in
Cannes, France, in April. NBD has successfully distributed
programmes produced by the group’s production divisions,
such as Done and Dusted’s ‘T4 On The Beach’, Box TV’s ‘The
Last Enemy’ and Iambic’s ‘The Beatles In LOVE’, and has
already made inroads into distributing the output of the new
acquisitions (the benefit of which will come into the results 
for 2008), including significant pre-sales for West Park
Pictures’ new documentary series with Stephen Fry. The
outlook for NBD includes increasing sales to new media.
Television sales in the group’s classical catalogue remain
steady. It is managed under the distribution arm and is
well-suited for exploitation in on-demand and broadband
delivery systems, which are in various stages of development
around the world.
The division markets not only to television and DVD but also 
to emerging new media platforms. DCD also exploits ancillary
rights such as book publishing tie-ins, newspaper spin-off
features, interactive opportunities and advertiser funding.

documentaries, drama and classic British comedy both from
group companies and external clients.
The DVD label has exceeded expectations. While the titles sold
via the DC DVD website and retail are relatively small, a major
deal was achieved to boost the division, taking its content to
a wider audience through a deal with a major record company.
To further this objective the company has earmarked a
substantial number of additional comedy titles for distribution
which it is anticipated will broaden its appeal and generate
further regular revenue streams.

74578 DCD PRE 1  15/11/07  15:36  Page 25 Report of the Directors
for the year ended 30 June 2007
The directors present their report together with the audited financial statements for the year ended 30 June 2007.
Principal Activity
The main activities of the group continued to be the production and distribution of programmes, through its subsidiary companies
Iambic Productions Limited, Box TV Limited, NBD Television Limited, Done and Dusted Group Limited and Digital Classics 
DVD Limited.
Since the year end, the group acquired three production companies, Prospect Pictures Limited, September Holdings Limited and
West Park Pictures Limited. The details of these acquisitions are covered in the Chief Executive’s review. 
A detailed review of the group’s business is contained in the Chairman’s letter and Chief Executive’s review on pages 5 to 11.
Results
There was a loss for the year after taxation amounting to £384,177 (2006: loss restated £1,238,829) that has been carried forward in
reserves. The directors do not propose to recommend the payment of a dividend.
Business Review
The group has indicated previously that growth in turnover is a significant indicator of performance as is the number of programmes
produced and distributed. Turnover has improved in the period due to the successful integration of the three companies acquired
during the prior year, namely Box TV Limited, NBD Television Limited and Done and Dusted Group Limited, which has increased the
number of programmes undertaken by the group. Year on year the group has seen 103% increase in turnover in line with the group
strategy. The remaining key indicators are group operating profit, which has increased by £1.1m to £0.1m (2006: loss restated £1.0m)
and normalised profit before tax as highlighted in the Chairman’s statement. 
Risks and uncertainties
In a rapidly consolidating market opportunities can appear quickly and be subject to frequent change. In order to be successful the
group’s management aims to minimise risk by developing a broad, balanced stable of production and distribution activity. Clear risk
assessment and strong financial management is essential to control and manage the group’s existing business and future growth.  
Acquisition Activity
It is a stated aim of the group to continue to look for suitable acquisition targets which will add value and enhance earnings. The
known risks of such a strategy can be summarized as: finding appropriate targets, integration risk of acquiring multiple targets, 
and, failure to achieve financial/operational synergies from those targets.
To minimize risk, the group uses its successful financial and operational diligence process, backed by an efficient legal diligence.
The group has already successfully integrated its three prior period acquisitions, which are regularly monitored through the group’s
internal control function. 
Production and distribution revenue
The group revenue tends to be seasonally cyclical with a significant element occurring in the second half of the year. Group revenue
arises from a number of broadcasters and distributors across the world. No single production or distribution sale which represents
more than 10% of group revenue. The group is continually looking to broaden its customer base to minimise any cyclical impact of
production on the group revenues.
Funding and Liquidity
Costs incurred during production are usually funded by the commissioning broadcaster. It is inherent in the production process that,
in the short term cash flows on productions can sometimes be negative initially. This is due to costs incurred, before contracted
sales have been received, in order to meet delivery and transmission dates. The group funds these initial outflows, when they occur,
in two ways: internally, ensuring that overall exposure is minimized; or, through a short term advance from a bank or finance house,
which will be underwritten by the contracted sale. The group regularly reviews the cost/benefit of such decisions in order to obtain
the optimum use from its working capital. The group’s cash at the end of the year was £1.0m (2006: £1.5m). The group has no debt
aside from a Convertible Loan used as part payment for the prior period acquisitions. Any advances received during the period for
the purpose of funding production activity were repaid during the period. Details of the Interest payable and a Convertible Loan are
disclosed in note 6 and note 16 to the financial statements, respectively.

Capital Structure
The level of group gearing is under periodic review. Following this detailed assessment, the group was able to undertake its most
recent acquisitions having determined that the level of net debt could comfortably be serviced from operating cash flow.

Employment Involvement
The group’s policy is to encourage employee involvement at all levels as it believes this is essential for the success of the business.
There is significant competition for experienced and skilled creative staff and administrators. The directors are aware of this and
have looked to encourage and develop internal resources and to put in place succession plans. In addition, the group has adopted 
an open management style to encourage communication and give employees the opportunity to contribute on business issues.
74578 DCD PRE 2  15/11/07  17:41  Page 27 Report of the Directors continued
for the year ended 30 June 2007 
The group does not discriminate against anyone on any grounds. Criteria for selection and promotion are based on suitability 
of an applicant for the job. Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully considered, bearing in mind the
respective aptitudes of the applicants concerned. In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort will be made 
to ensure that their employment with the group continues and that appropriate training is arranged. It is the policy of the group 
that the training, career development and promotion of disabled persons should, as far as possible, be at least comparable with 
that of other employees.
Financial Instruments
Details of the use of financial instruments by the company are contained in notes 1, 16 and 17 of the financial statements.
Going Concern
The directors confirm that they have every expectation that the group will have adequate resources to continue in operational
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to use the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Creditor Payment Policy
The group’s current policy and practice concerning the payment of suppliers is to agree terms of payment when agreeing the terms
of the transactions, varying them as may be agreed from time to time, and to ensure that the suppliers are aware of the terms and 
to abide by the agreed or varied terms. The company’s ‘creditor days’ at 30 June 2007 was 36 days (2006: 78 days).
Directors’ Responsibilities for the Financial Statements
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the
state of affairs of the group and company and of the profit or loss of the group for that year. In preparing those financial statements,
the directors are required to:
– select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
– state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
– prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume the group will continue 
in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
The Group is required to adopt IFRS in the year ending 30 June 2008. Accordingly the first set of statements to be issued under IFRS
will be the interim results for the six month period ending 31 December 2007. The intention is to adopt IFRS at group level only.
Auditors
All of the current directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any information
needed by the company’s auditors for the purposes of their audit and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information. 
The directors are not aware of any relevant audit information of which the auditors are unaware.
A resolution to reappoint BDO Stoy Hayward LLP as auditors will be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.

1 Principal accounting policies
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention and applicable accounting
standards, and on a going concern basis. Except for the adoption of FRS 20 noted below, the principal accounting policies 
have remained consistent with those adopted in the previous year. Consideration has been given to the principal accounting 
policies in the light of Financial Reporting Standard 18 “Accounting Policies” and no changes have been made.
Adoption of FRS 20
During the year the company adopted FRS 20 in accounting for its share options, and the new accounting policy is reflected below.
The effect of such adoption resulted in the increase in the prior year loss for the year of £44,000. The change in accounting policy
has no effect on the results for the current year.
Basis of Consolidation
The group financial statements consolidate those of the company and of its subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 30 June 2007.
Profits or losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated in full.
Turnover and attributable profit
Production turnover represents work carried out and amounts receivable in producing content and is recognised over the period 
of the production. Gross profit on production is recognised over the period of the production and in accordance with the underlying
contract. Recognition of turnover takes place when the contractual terms have been agreed, and when the substantive elements of
the production have taken place, including pre-production stage completion, shoot stage completion, post-production, availability 
for exploitation and delivery. Attributable profit is calculated by amortising programme costs in the proportion that actual revenue
recognised in the current period bears to estimated ultimate revenue, subject to an impairment review. Distribution turnover arises
from the distribution and exploitation of programme rights obtained from external parties or from within the group, as well as
external distribution programme rights held within the group. Distribution turnover is the amounts receivable from licence contracts
signed during the year. Turnover from sales of DVDs and other sales is the amounts receivable from invoiced sales during the year. All
turnover excludes value added tax.
Goodwill
Goodwill on consolidation, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration paid over the fair value of the identifiable 
net assets of subsidiary undertakings at the date of acquisition, is capitalised. Goodwill is amortised on a straight line basis over 
its useful life which is estimated to be 20 years and is subject to an impairment review by the directors when considered necessary.
Research and development
Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when recoverability can be assessed with reasonable certainty and
amortised in line with expected sales. All other development costs are written off in the year of expenditure.
Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write off the cost or valuation of fixed assets, less their estimated residual value, over
the expected useful economic lives on the following bases:
Short leasehold property straight line over the life of the lease
Office and technical equipment 25-33% straight line
Motor vehicles 20% straight line
Programme rights 
Programme rights are stated at the lower of cost, less accumulated amortisation, or net realisable value. Cost comprises the cost of
production and all other directly attributable costs incurred up to completion of the programme and all programme development costs.
Where programmes in development are not expected to proceed, the related costs are written off to the profit and loss account.
Amortisation of programme costs is charged in the ratio that actual revenue recognised in the current period bears to estimated
ultimate revenue, after making provision for anticipated losses. Programme costs of purchased catalogues are amortised on a straight
line basis over an appropriate period of the estimated useful economic life of the programmes, such period not to exceed 20 years.
At each balance sheet date, the directors review the carrying value of programme rights and consider whether a provision is
required to reduce the carrying value of the investment in programmes to net realisable value. Amortisation and any charge in
respect of writing down to net realisable value during the period is included in the profit and loss account as part of cost of sales.
Programme costs in respect of incomplete programmes are separately classified as work in progress.
Work in progress 
Work in progress has been valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value.

for the year ended 30 June 2007
1 Principal accounting policies (continued)
Programme distribution advances 
Advances paid in order to secure distribution rights on third party catalogues or programmes are included within current assets.
Distribution rights entitle the company to license the programmes to broadcasters and DVD labels for a sales commission, 
whilst the underlying rights continue to be held by the programme owner. The advances are stated at the lower of the amounts
advanced to the rights’ owners less actual sales income to date, and the value of likely future sales income to be received against
those advances.
Financial instruments 
Financial assets are recognised in the balance sheet at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Provision is made for diminution
in value where appropriate. Income and expenditure arising on financial instruments is recognised on the accruals basis, and
credited or charged to the profit and loss account in the financial period to which it relates.
Deferred taxation 
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the group an obligation to pay more
tax in the future, or right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax assets are recognised
when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Leasing 
Tangible fixed assets acquired under finance leases or hire purchase contracts are capitalised and depreciated in the same manner
as other tangible fixed assets. The related obligations, net of  future finance charges, are included in creditors. Rentals payable
under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Pension costs 
The group operates pension schemes for the benefit of a number of its directors. The schemes are defined contribution schemes
and the contributions are charged against profits as they accrue.
Foreign currency 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets 
and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Any differences are
taken to the profit and loss account.
Convertible debt 
The proceeds received on issue of the group’s convertible debt are allocated into their liability and equity components and presented
separately in the balance sheet.
The amount initially attributed to the debt component equals the discounted cash flows using a market rate of interest that would 
be payable on a similar debt instrument that did not include an option to convert.
The difference between the net proceeds of the convertible debt and the amount allocated to the debt component is credited direct
to equity and not subsequently remeasured. On conversion, the debt and equity elements are credited to share capital and share
premium as appropriate.
Transaction costs that relate to the issue of the instrument are allocated to the liability and equity components of the instrument in
proportion to the allocation of proceeds.
Share based payments 
When share options are awarded to employees, the fair value of the options at the date of grant is charged to the income statement
over the vesting period. Non-market vesting conditions are taken into account by adjusting the number of equity instruments
expected to vest at each balance sheet date so that, ultimately, the cumulative amount recognised over the vesting period is based
on the number of options that eventually vest. Market vesting conditions are factored into the fair value of the options granted. 
As long as all other vesting conditions are satisfied, a charge is made irrespective of whether the market vesting conditions are
satisfied. The cumulative expense is not adjusted for failure to achieve a market vesting condition.
Where the terms and conditions of options are modified before they vest, the increase in fair value of the options, measured
immediately before and after the modification, is also charged to the income statement over the remaining vesting period.
Where equity instruments are granted to persons other than employees, the income statement is charged with the fair value of
goods and services received.
The share options are exercisable from the grant date.

A deferred tax asset of £3,348,401, arising principally from losses in the group, has not been recognised (2006: £3,040,917). 
These losses can be offset against future trading profits generated. The directors believe at this stage that it is prudent not to
recognise the deferred tax asset within the financial statements.

8 Profit for the financial year
DCD Media plc has taken advantage of section 230 Companies Act 1985 and has not included its own profit and loss account 
in these financial statements. The company’s profit for the year after tax was £121,899 (2006: loss restated £1,191.633).
9 Dividends
No dividends have been paid or proposed in the year (2006: nil).
10 Loss per share
The calculation of the basic loss per share is based on the loss attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the average 
number of shares in issue during the year. The calculation of diluted loss per share is based on the basic loss per share, adjusted 
to allow for the issue of shares and the post tax effect of dividends and interest, on the assumed conversion of all other dilutive
options and other potential ordinary shares.

Share options outstanding at the year-end totalled 466,944 ordinary shares, and if the convertible loan was converted into ordinary
shares at 78p per share (the last conversion rate), the number of shares issued from the exercise of the loan conversion would be
9,368,859. However, the above figures have not been adjusted for such conversion as the effects would be anti-dilutive.
The calculation above is based on the number of ordinary shares in issue after the share consolidation into ordinary shares 
of 10 pence. As stated in Note 30 Post balance sheet events, the ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each were consolidated into new
ordinary shares of 10 pence each on 6 August 2007.

The net book value of goodwill at 30 June 2007 represents goodwill on the acquisitions of Iambic Productions Limited, NBD Television
Holdings Limited, Box TV Limited and Done and Dusted Group Limited. This is being amortised over its estimated useful economic
life, which the directors consider to be 20 years. 
The additions to goodwill represent adjustments to the fair value of the acquisitions made in the previous year.
As stated in Note 30, Post balance sheet events, since 30 June 2007 the company acquired three television production companies for
a total cost of approximately £20.3 million. This will give rise to goodwill of approximately £19 million.

On 16 December 2005, the company entered into a convertible loan facility totalling £8,000,000, secured on the group’s assets. 
The loan is repayable by 14 December 2009, unless any of the conversion rights have been exercised prior to that date. Interest 
is chargeable at a variable rate based on 6 month sterling LIBOR, and was 7.24% as at 30 June 2007.
The company has drawn down the full facility, but the loan amount outstanding has been reduced by the exercise of conversion
rights on £692,290 of the loan. The basic conversion price is 90p, which is subject to adjustment under certain circumstances.
As detailed in Note 30 Post balance sheet events, the company issued a new long-term convertible loan of £4,000,000 after the 
year-end to assist with the purchase of three new subsidiary companies.
17 Financial instruments and risk management
The group’s financial instruments comprise cash, including short term deposits, trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly
from its operations, and loan notes. The main risks arising from the group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity
risk, and currency risk. The Board has reviewed and agreed  policies for managing each of these risks and they are summarised
below. Short-term debtors and creditors have been excluded from all the following disclosures, other than the currency risk
disclosure. The group has no financial assets other than debtors and cash at bank. The Balance Sheet values for the financial
assets and liabilities are not materially different from their fair values.
Interest rate risk
The group finances its operations at present through funds raised on the share placings, its convertible loan note and production
loan facilities provided by banks. The group manages its exposure to interest rate fluctuations by mixing the duration of its deposits
and borrowings to reduce the impact of interest rate fluctuations. The interest rate on the convertible loan referred to in Note 16 is
variable and is based on 6 month sterling LIBOR.
Liquidity risk
The group seeks to manage financial risk to ensure sufficient liquidity is available to meet forseeable needs and to invest cash
assets safely and profitably. The group’s policy throughout the year has been to ensure the continuity of funding. Short term
flexibility is provided through the availability of bank overdraft facilities.
Currency risk
The group operates in overseas markets and is subject to exposures on transactions undertaken during the year. The group’s
exposure to exchange rate fluctuations is small based on its revenue and cost base and its policy is not to hedge against foreign
currency transactions.
The sterling equivalent of the group’s net assets denominated in foreign currencies at 30 June 2007 was as follows:
2007 2006
£ £
US dollar 1,519,922 740,021
Euros 528,147 285,896
Other 239,240 82,286
Net assets 2,287,309 1,108,203
Credit risk
The group operates to ensure that the payment terms of customers are matched to the group’s own contractual obligations in terms
of delivery of programmes and rights. For new customers the group will check credit references.

shares have received £100,000 for each ordinary share.
As detailed in Note 30 Post balance sheet events, on 6 August 2007 the ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each were consolidated into
new ordinary shares of 10 pence each, a conversion rate of 100:1. At the same time, the company raised £8,500,000 through a
placing of 10,625,000 of the new ordinary shares of 10 pence each, for the purpose of acquiring three companies.
Under the terms of a convertible loan agreement (see Note 16), 44,282,051 ordinary shares were issued during the year at an
average price of 0.78p per share, raising a total consideration of £344,645 by way of conversion of long-term loan into share capital,
resulting in a premium on issue of £300,364 which has been credited to the share premium account. There were no expenses in
connection with the share issues.

21 Sale and leaseback agreements
One subsidiary company has a liability to pay annual rentals under a sale and leaseback agreement until 2015. This obligation 
has not been recognised in the financial statements because at 30 June 2007 an amount of £565,997 (2006: £621,197) is held in 
a bank deposit account which may only be used to settle those rental obligations. The deposit is held with the same bank to whom
the rentals are paid, and full set-off is applicable in the event of the failure of the bank.
Other subsidiary companies have entered into sale and leaseback agreements where the obligations to pay rentals are guaranteed
by amounts payable from bank deposits. These obligations have not been recognised in the financial statements because the
contingent liability would only crystallise upon the failure of the bank holding the deposit. The liabilities from these agreements 
are as follows:

23 Share based payment
The company operates two equity-settled share based remuneration schemes for employees: a long term incentive scheme and an
unapproved scheme for non-executive directors and certain senior management. The options are awarded by the Board and are
governed by written rules.
Details of the company’s share options based on the ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each are as follows:
At Granted Exercised Lapsed At Exercise Date from
1 July during the during the during the 30 June price which Expiry
2006 year year year 2007 (pence) exercisable date

46,694,444 – – – 46,694,444
The company has determined the fair value of the the options as required by FRS 20, in order to establish the financial effect of
making these share based payments. As a result of the adoption of this accounting standard, an adjustment has been made to the
profit and loss account in the prior period when the options were granted.
As detailed in Note 30 Post balance sheet events, on 6 August 2007 the ordinary shares of 0.1 pence each were consolidated into
new ordinary shares of 10 pence each.
24 Transactions with directors and other related parties

Notice of Annual General Meeting
74578 DCD NOTES  15/11/07  17:39  Page 51 Notice of Annual General Meeting continued
Notes
1. Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at the
meeting. A proxy need not be a shareholder of the company. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the
Annual General Meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by
that shareholder. Should you wish to appoint more than one proxy please return this form and attach to it a schedule detailing the
names of the proxies you wish to appoint, the number of shares each proxy will represent and the way in which you wish them to
vote on the resolutions that are to be proposed.
2. To be valid, the form of proxy and the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a certified copy of such
power or authority must be lodged at the offices of the company’s Registrars, Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road,
Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU by hand, or sent by post, so as to be received not less than 48 hours before the time fixed for 
the holding of the meeting or any adjournment thereof (as the case may be).
3. The completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude a member from attending in person at the meeting and voting 
should he wish to do so.
4. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the company has specified that only those members
entered on the register of members at 6 pm on 15 December 2007 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of
the number of ordinary shares of £0.10 each in the capital of the company held in their name at that time. Changes to the register
after 6 pm on 15 December 2007 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.
5. Resolutions 2 - 4 – Article 82 of the Company’s Articles of Association require that one third of the directors of the company, who have
held office since the last Annual General Meeting, must retire and, if they are eligible, may offer themselves for re-appointment.
6. Resolution 6 – The Company’s Articles of Association provide that the company is permitted to communicate with shareholders
using electronic means, provided that individual shareholders give their specific consent. This regime has been enhanced and
revised through Schedule 5 of the Companies Act 2006 (‘Schedule 5’), which came into force earlier this year, and by amendments 
to the Disclosure Rules and Transparency Rules of the Financial Services Authority made in December 2006. Previously,
shareholders had to ask for information to be communicated to them electronically. The new regime makes it possible for 
electronic communication to become the default method of communication, so shareholders must then specify if they wish to
receive communications in paper form (hard copy). To enable the company to benefit from this opportunity to provide for electronic
communication as the default method of communication, the company is proposing resolution 6 to authorise the use of its website
as a means of communicating with shareholders who do not request documentation in paper form. If approved by shareholders, the
new regime will require that the company consult with its shareholders individually as to whether they wish to receive information
through the company’s website. If deemed appropriate the company will consult shareholders in due course. If a shareholder
agrees, then future communications with that shareholder will be by electronic means. If a shareholder fails to respond to the
consultation within 28 days, then such a shareholder is deemed to have agreed to receive communications by electronic means.
Notwithstanding any prior request or deemed consent to receive communications electronically, a shareholder may at any time tell
the company that he or she wishes to receive all or specific information in paper form (hard copy). In addition, the company has to
notify shareholders who receive information in electronic form when certain key information is available on the company’s website.
This notification will, typically, be sent around the time of the company’s Annual General Meeting. The overall effect of resolution 6
will be to allow the company to increase its use of electronic communications with shareholders. However, as indicated above, the
rights of those shareholders who wish to receive documents in paper form (hard copy) will be fully protected. The company sees 
a positive benefit in the increase in electronic communications, in terms of the saving of paper and production expenses.
7. Resolution 7 – As required by the Companies Act 1985, this resolution, to be proposed as an Ordinary Resolution, relates to the
grant to the directors of authority to allot unissued Ordinary Shares until the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be 
held in 2008, unless the authority is renewed or revoked prior to such time. This authority is limited to a maximum of 27,688,160
Ordinary Shares.
8. Resolution 8 – Section 89(1) of the Companies Act 1985 requires that if the directors decide to allot unissued Ordinary Shares 
in the company the shares proposed to be issued be first offered to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings.
This is known as shareholders’ pre-emption rights. However, to act in the best interests of the company the directors may require
flexibility to allot shares for cash without regard to the provisions of Section 89(1). Therefore this resolution, to be proposed as 
a Special Resolution seeks authority to enable the directors to allot equity securities up to a maximum of 15,306,450 Ordinary
Shares. This authority expires at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2008.

Notes
1. Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of their rights to attend and to speak and vote on their behalf at the meeting. A proxy
need not be a shareholder of the company. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that
each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that shareholder. Should you wish to appoint more than
one proxy please return this form and attach to it a schedule detailing the names of the proxies you wish to appoint, the number of shares each proxy
will represent and the way in which you wish them to vote on the resolutions that are to be proposed.
2. To be valid, the form of proxy and the power of attorney or other authority (if any) under which it is signed or a certified copy of such power or authority
must be lodged at the offices of the company’s Registrars, Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU by
hand, or sent by post, so as to be received not less than 48 hours before the time fixed for the holding of the meeting or any adjournment thereof 
(as the case may be).
3. The completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude a member from attending in person at the meeting and voting should he wish to do so.
4. In the case of a corporation, the form of proxy must be executed under its common seal or the hand of an officer or attorney duly authorised.
5. A member may appoint a proxy of its own choice. If the name of the member’s choice is not entered in the space provided on the form of proxy, the
return of the form of proxy duly signed will authorise the Chairman of the meeting to act as that member’s proxy.
6. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001, the company has specified that only those members entered on the
register of members at 6 pm on 15 December 2007 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting in respect of the number of ordinary shares 
of £0.10 each in the capital of the company held in their name at that time. Changes to the register after 6 pm on 15 December 2007 shall be
disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.

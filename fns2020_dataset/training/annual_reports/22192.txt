CATTLES PLC — WHAT WE DO
Our philosophy is to
‘lend short and borrow
long’, ensuring we have
funding headroom,
secured ahead of need
and hedged against
interest rate volatility.
We have refined our
credit scoring and
underwriting processes
over many years, so our
acceptance of credit risk
is rigorously controlled. 
Knowing customers
personally is what our
community branches
are for. They help us to
build relationships 
and manage arrears 
if customers’
circumstances change.
We reach our
customers through 
our network of brokers,
strategic partners 
and introducers, our
nationwide branches
and online.
We have consistently
benefited from
investment in our
people: their skills 
and experience enable
us to manage risk
successfully while
providing excellent
customer service.
High quality IT helps 
us recruit and select
customers, matching
their credit status and
needs to our products.
Our scalable systems
will grow with our
customer base.
O OU UR R  P PL LA AT TF FO OR RM M  F FO OR R  G GR RO OW WT TH H
We have been able to sustain strong income and profit growth because 
our experience, commitment, people and infrastructure enable us to benefit
from market opportunities in both buoyant and tough economic conditions.
We aim to increase shareholder value significantly by becoming the UK’s leading
non-standard financial services group.

Welcome Financial Services comprises three
businesses:
– Welcome Finance
– Shopacheck
– Welcome Car Finance
Welcome Finance, the principal lending business,
serves more than 500,000 customers, providing
direct repayment loans from 183 branches across
the UK. Its product range includes unsecured
personal loans, second charge secured loans and
hire purchase for cars. Details on its business
model are set out on the opposite page.
Shopacheck provides short-term home collected
loans to some 260,000 customers through 52
branches.
Welcome Car Finance sells around 14,000 used cars
a year from 12 sites and is the largest introducer of
hire purchase business to Welcome Finance.
The Lewis Group is a UK leader in debt recovery and
investigation services, serving both external clients
and Welcome Financial Services. It is one of the
UK’s largest buyers of non-performing debt.
Cattles Invoice Finance provides working capital
finance to small and medium-sized businesses. It
operates through six regional offices in England
and Scotland.
O OU UR R  C CU US ST TO OM ME ER RS S
The great majority of our customers (over 500,000)
have loans from Welcome Finance. We only
advance these direct repayment loans to
customers who are in employment, have a bank
account and can repay by direct debit. Most are in
socio-economic groups C and D, but a significant
proportion come from higher categories.
These are some typical customer scenarios:
W We el lc co om me e  F Fi in na an nc ce e
Unsecured personal loan
Mr A, 25, is a mechanic who is single and lives with
his parents in Manchester. He earns £17,500 and
borrowed £2,000 over three years to pay for a
holiday and repay an existing loan. He applied
online after being rejected by his bank.
Second charge secured loan
Mr B, 46, is a fireman and his wife, 42, is a part-time
teacher. They live in Norwich and have a joint
income of £30,000. They borrowed £9,000 over 
10 years for home improvements. They applied
through a broker, who referred them to Welcome
Finance as they had limited equity in their home.
Hire purchase
Mr C, 38, is an office manager in Watford earning
£25,000. He borrowed £6,000 over four years to
buy a car from Welcome Car Finance. He applied
direct to Welcome Car Finance after seeing an
advert on TV.

Mrs D, 36, is an administrator and single. She
bought her East London council house. She earns
£300 a week, paid into her bank account. She
borrowed £200 over 30 weeks to fund Christmas
shopping.
T Th he e  L Le ew wi is s  G Gr ro ou up p
Credit card company, E plc, has several million
customers and each month it sells accounts which
are in default.  Lewis buys these, at a discount, and
collects the sums outstanding.
Bank F plc also has customers in default but it
prefers to outsource the collection of overdue
accounts.  Lewis carries out this work and charges
the bank a commission on the amounts it collects.
C Ca at tt tl le es s  I In nv vo oi ic ce e  F Fi in na an nc ce e
G Ltd specialises in wholesale organic food
products, turning over £1.5 million a year. Its
business was growing and the company had to
take on 12 additional employees to meet demand,
but wholesalers were requiring extended credit
and G Ltd needed access to extra capital. Cattles
Invoice Finance provided flexible finance, securing
advances against invoices.
AT A GLANCE
C CA AT TT TL LE ES S  P PL LC C
Cattles plc is a financial services group
specialising in providing consumer
credit to non-standard customers in
the UK. We also provide debt recovery
services to external clients and our
consumer credit business, and working
capital finance for small and medium-
sized businesses. We also have a car
retail operation, which is the largest
introducer of hire purchase customers
to our consumer credit business.
In the consumer credit market, 
non-standard refers to customers who
may currently not have access to
mainstream facilities – typically due to
perceived shortcomings in their
employment, residency or credit
histories. We give them an opportunity
to build or repair their credit profile.
Effective risk management is
paramount in all our markets, and
underpins our strategy for continued
strong growth.

Relationships are managed as follows:
• Branches employ local people with good communication skills, 
who understand local conditions
• Once a loan has been advanced, customers are contacted by a
customer account manager to begin establishing a close working
relationship
• This ensures a prompt response if they experience difficulty 
with repayments and enables a practical plan to be agreed to help
them avoid arrears
At the LMBs, specialist account managers 
work with customers to ensure regular
payments resume. This enables the accounts 
to be transferred back to the Branch Network
and prevents them from falling into more
serious arrears.

We have refined our credit scoring and underwriting processes over many years 
to give us rigorous control of credit risk. The same applies when we buy debt
portfolios in The Lewis Group, where we have developed sophisticated and 
robust portfolio valuation models.
T Th he e  b be en ne ef fi it ts s  i it t b br ri in ng gs s
Robust underwriting is part of our ‘Risk. Managed.’ approach, helping us maintain
consistent credit quality and keep arrears within our target range. It also helps us 
to be a responsible lender: we would not benefit our customers or ourselves by
lending them more than they can afford.

By acting quickly and constructively, perhaps by rescheduling repayments, we can
often prevent a temporary setback escalating into arrears. Our loan can be repaid in

“Our underwriting is tightly controlled. Scorecards are regularly

we allocate the customer to their nearest branch.
Within 24 hours the customer receives a call from their branch

they’re comfortable with everything – and check that they know

“Welcome is well down the road of investing in new IT systems.
Now we’ve begun the journey of completely re-engineering our
systems in Lewis. We’re re-designing our whole collection
process so we can adapt faster and more flexibly to market,
economic and regulatory changes.
Speed and flexibility are also crucial when we’re acquiring debt
portfolios. When attractive opportunities arise, we need to be
able to act fast. In today’s market, having funding in place gives
us a vital competitive advantage.”
Before we take on debt, 
we make sure we can handle it.

Investment in scalable systems is ensuring that our growth will not be held back

“The majority of our business comes from intermediaries

reaching an increasing number of business owners directly

intermediaries think highly of us because we’re independent,
responsive and flexible. 
Clients say they’re impressed by the way we understand their
needs and issues. And that’s down to the quality of our 
people. We have good communications so that knowledge 
and experience are shared, and a strong training culture. 
I’m halfway through a 12-month management and leadership

Last year we set new records for colleague training, continued to improve colleague

The breadth of our distribution channels helps to reduce our reliance on any one

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
P PE EO OP PL LE E
Seán Mahon retired as Chief Executive 
on 30 September 2007. On behalf of the
Board I thank him for his outstanding
leadership over the past seven years and
wish him the best for the future. He was
succeeded by David Postings, previously
Managing Director of Lloyds TSB
Commercial, who joined the Board on 
1 September 2007. David’s experience in
senior roles at both Lloyds TSB and
Barclays will be invaluable as the Group
pursues further profitable growth.
The quality of our people, and the strength
and stability of the management team,
have been critical to our success. T o
continue to grow the business we have
increased our investment in training and
development. Our positive, performance-
oriented culture is reflected in the
continued rise in colleagues’ satisfaction
and pride in working for the Group. On
behalf of the Board, I thank them for their
contribution to another year’s strong
performance.
O OU UT TL LO OO OK K
I believe our strategy for enhancing
shareholder value through disciplined
lending growth, robust credit quality and
improving operational and financial
efficiency remains sound and appropriate
to current market conditions. T ogether
with my fellow directors, I look forward to
another successful year in 2008.
Norman Broadhurst
Chairman
28 February 2008
‘It gives me great pleasure to report
an excellent performance by 
the Group in 2007, building on our
success of previous years. Pre-tax
profit increased by 24.9% to £165.2
million and basic earnings per share
increased by 15.3% to 32.30p.’
D DI IV VI ID DE EN ND D
The Board recommends an increased final
dividend of 13.10p per share, payable on
13 May 2008. T ogether with the interim
dividend of 6.20p per share, this gives a
total dividend for the year of 19.30p – an
increase of 10.3% over the previous year.
As an alternative to receiving the cash
dividend, shareholders in the UK,
excluding the Channel Islands, will again
have the opportunity to reinvest their
dividends in the Company’s shares
through our Dividend Reinvestment Plan.
NORMAN BROADHURST

Our positive, performance-oriented culture is reflected

The average cost of borrowing was

stable medium-term funding costs to

Group year-end gearing improved to 
4.6 times shareholders’ funds (2006: 
5.1 times), and is well within our covenant
of 6.0 times.
The Group raised £533 million from a
share placing and bond issue, and agreed 
a further £150 million unsecured bilateral
bank facility in December.
Year-end funding headroom was 
£226.0 million (2006: £348.5 million), 
with the only facility maturing in 2008
being a US $40 million private placing
(2007: £125 million). The £150 million
bilateral facility we announced in
December 2007 has recently been
increased to £250 million. We are
confident that we will be able to raise 
debt funding to support our planned
growth while maintaining a highly
attractive net interest margin.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Our Markets
During 2007 there has been a reduction 
in competitor capacity and credit risk
appetite. Welcome Finance presently 
has a share of around 8% of its growing
addressable market – and management
expects it to gain further market share
through ongoing development in its
systems, products and customer and
intermediary service.
Unsecured lending, Welcome Finance’s
main activity, faces varying degrees of
competition. New entrants come into the
market from time to time, particularly
during credit boom periods when prime
lenders soften their lending criteria to
extend into the non-standard sector of the
consumer lending market. However, there
are significant barriers to maintaining a
successful presence in this market. One is
the need to build a substantial knowledge
base: while credit history data is available
from credit reference agencies, Welcome
Finance benefits from its accumulated
knowledge of customer behaviour in
identifying profitable lending
opportunities and screening loan
applications. This proprietary knowledge is
difficult to accumulate quickly. New
entrants also need the expertise and
resources to deal with customers face-to-
face through a well-developed multi-
branch infrastructure.
Against the trend in the financial services
industry, Welcome Finance continues to
invest in its branch network. It views its
local branch presence as a significant
strength – research shows that many
customers prefer to discuss their payment
arrangements, when their personal
circumstances have changed, on a face-to-
face basis – and Welcome Finance has made
it a central part of the way it manages
both customer relationships and risk.
S Sh ho op pa ac ch he ec ck k
The home collected credit market is
mature. Datamonitor, a leading market
research agency, forecasts a modest
increase in advances each year from 
£1.6 billion to £1.8 billion between 2007
and 2011. Shopacheck remains the second
largest player in this market. However, the
number of its customers is reducing, 
down 15% in 2007 to 266,000, as it
continues to disengage from sectors of the
market which are considered uneconomic
to serve. At 31 December 2007 home
collected loans represented less than 
4% of the Group’s total receivables at
£102 million. Typical Shopacheck advances
are around £300 and repayments are
collected weekly by local agents.

Welcome Financial Services (WFS) is one of
the UK’s leading players in non-standard
consumer finance. It comprises Welcome
Finance and Shopacheck, its lending
businesses, and Welcome Car Finance, 
its car retail operation. Competition for 
its principal business, Welcome Finance,
primarily comes from specialist
subsidiaries of major banks. The
opportunity for WFS continues to grow 
as the banks progressively tighten their
lending criteria as they find it difficult
to lend economically to borrowers with
non-standard credit profiles.
WFS lends to individuals with non-standard
credit profiles – people who may not have
access to mainstream lending, typically
because of perceived shortcomings in their
employment, residency or credit histories.
It gives customers an opportunity to build
or repair their credit profiles.
WFS’s credit assessment processes are
designed to ensure that customers’
repayment commitments are manageable
and that they are not over-committed.

Welcome Finance provides unsecured and
secured personal loans, and hire purchase
for cars. The sums involved are relatively
modest: typical advances are £2,100 for
unsecured loans, £9,300 for second charge
secured loans and £6,000 for car hire
purchase loans.
Welcome Finance has over 500,000
customers and repayments are mainly
collected monthly by direct debit.
Outstanding loans of this type at the end
of 2007 totalled over £3 billion, before
allowance for loan loss provisions,
accounting for over 85% of the Group’s
total receivables.
Welcome Finance’s customers are
primarily in socio-economic groups C and
D, which make up some 65% of the UK
adult population. However, its market also
includes people in the higher categories
who may have irregular earnings patterns
or need to repair their credit history.
Welcome Finance’s market is dynamic, 
and independent research estimates the
total size to be approximately 13 million

potential addressable market of 7.1 million

The non-standard motor finance sector is
predicted to grow modestly over the next
few years, despite the market remaining
flat during 2007. Non-standard lending
accounts for about 20% of the total asset
financed car market. Welcome Car Finance
has experienced strong growth in 2007,
despite softening in the UK market overall,
and is the Group’s largest introducer of
hire purchase customers.

Demand in the UK non-standard
consumer lending market has been
growing strongly in recent years. However,
as credit markets have tightened, a number
of mainstream lenders who had entered
the non-standard market have begun to
withdraw from segments of it. As this
trend continues, increasing demand is
likely to remain – fed not only by existing
non-standard borrowers but also by a
tightening of credit qualification criteria
by mainstream lenders, which will squeeze
some customers out of the prime segment
into the non-standard sector.
This is expected to create further
opportunities for Welcome Finance, which
has robust expertise in pricing risk and
managing collections. Welcome Finance
typically lends smaller amounts than the
companies that are withdrawing from the
sector, at interest rates priced to reflect the
risk. It also has systems and infrastructure to
provide close relationship management and
support for customers – key elements in its
model for maintaining robust credit quality.

Government regularly reviews regulation
and legislation to ensure a robust and fair
consumer finance market. The significant
strengthening of regulation in recent years
favours responsible, well-managed
businesses: Cattles welcomes the
reassurance that it provides to customers
and investors alike. Cattles’ corporate
values require the Company to be a
responsible lender and the Group has
always seen treating customers fairly 
and responsibly as an essential part of
how it operates and how it manages risk.
The Group’s consumer lending businesses
are licensed under the Consumer Credit
Act 2006. T o maintain high standards of
integrity and honesty among lenders, all
providers of consumer credit must have 
a licence of fitness to trade from the Office
of Fair Trading, which they must renew
every five years. The sale of general
insurance products by Welcome Finance 
is regulated by the Financial Services
Authority (FSA). All relevant Welcome
Finance employees receive prescribed
training and accreditation to maintain the

required standards of customer care and
compliance. Cattles fully supports the FSA ’s
Treating Customers Fairly principles which
have been embedded in Welcome
Finance’s culture and values training, and
in its operating policies and procedures.
The Competition Commission inquiry into the
sale of Payment Protection Insurance (PPI)
began in February 2007 and is currently in
the information gathering stage. Cattles
has provided all the requested information
and attended a Private Hearing in June
2007 to provide further evidence to the
Commission. The sale of PPI has been
regulated by the FSA since January 2005
and continues to contribute around 10% 
of the Group’s revenues. The Commission
produced its Emerging Thinking document
in November 2007 and advised that its
Provisional Findings Report would be
published in May 2008. The Inquiry has 
to provide a Final Report by its statutory
end date of February 2009.

The Lewis Group (Lewis) is a UK leader in
debt recovery and investigation services,
serving both external clients and WFS. Its
external clients are mainly large issuers of
credit cards and unsecured loans – as well
as both central and local government
departments, insurance companies,
catalogue retailers, utilities,
telecommunications businesses and
educational institutions. Lewis has a
reputation for quality and ethical
collection practices, and subscribes to 
the Credit Services Association’s code of
conduct. This provides comfort to blue-
chip clients concerned to manage risk to
their own reputations.
Debt collection and recovery is a diverse
and competitive market with over 500
firms operating in the UK. Consolidation 
is expected and the market is becoming
more sophisticated as buyers and sellers 
of debt obtain better data and develop
enhanced models that enable them to
price debt more accurately.
Some 74% of Lewis’ income comes from
purchasing and recovering portfolios of
non-performing debt. It buys these from
credit providers, at a discount to their face
value, and then recovers the outstanding
amounts. Lewis helped to establish the
purchased debt market in the UK with a
ground-breaking transaction in 1998. It is
one of the top three players in this fast-
growing market segment – which grew by 14

Cattles Invoice Finance (CIF) provides
working capital finance to small and
medium-sized businesses throughout
the UK. It has a broadly spread portfolio 
of 725 clients. It reaches clients through
three main channels: intermediaries,
corporate partnerships and direct
marketing, such as internet and
telemarketing. Direct marketing generated
almost 10% of new clients in 2007.
Like WFS, CIF manages risk through its
underwriting processes and by
maintaining exceptionally close personal
contact with clients. Its client managers
generally handle around 25-30 clients
each – about a third of the typical industry
level – to ensure high quality client service
and a thorough understanding of clients’
financial position.
Around 60 companies operate in the UK
invoice financing market. The clearing
banks dominate, with a combined share of
about 60%. A number of overseas banks
and larger independent lenders, such as
CIF, operate nationwide and there are also
a large number of smaller regional players.
Consolidation of the sector has been
under way in recent years.
The UK invoice financing market has
grown strongly in recent years. The
average annual growth rate has been 8%
for client numbers and 18% for advances,
which indicates that more larger
businesses are now using invoice finance.
Historically CIF has served smaller
companies with turnover up to £5 million,
where the annual growth in advances has
been slower at around 10%.
The UK market currently comprises
approximately 3.7 million small and
medium-sized businesses with 250,000
suitable for invoice finance. Less than 20%
are using invoice financing services,
indicating significant potential for
increased penetration across the
marketplace. CIF has an immediate
addressable market (excluding borrowing
over £5 million and the market share of
the Big 4 banks) of approximately 16,500
businesses (40% of the total). CIF currently
funds approximately 700 businesses,
giving it an addressable market share of
around 4% in terms of client numbers.

around 40% a year between 2004 and
2006, compared with growth of around
15% between 1998 and 2006 for the
contingent debt collection market.
Most single portfolios coming to market
now realise around £0.5-1.0 million apiece,
but there is a trend to selling larger
parcels. Lewis is well-placed to bid on
much larger transactions and is
particularly interested in longer-term
forward flow deals.
Market growth accelerated strongly in
2007, and an estimated £8-10 billion of 
face value debt was sold during the year,
according to the Debt Buyers & Sellers
Group of the Credit Services Association.
Lewis continued to take advantage of 
the opportunities provided by its strong
market position, spending some 
£74 million on debt purchases during the
year (2006: £70 million). Investment in
debt purchase is central to Lewis’ growth,
and any economic slowdown is likely to
increase the availability of debt on
attractive terms.
Lewis is also a significant re-seller of debt,
which has completed its progress through
the company’s collection strategies.
The balance of Lewis’ business comes 
from recovering debts for clients on 
a commission basis and supplying
investigation services, such as customer
care visits for insurance companies and
arrears and pre-litigation visits for
creditors. Lewis operates one of the largest
self-employed field collection teams in 
its sector.
I Im mp pa ac ct t o of f  t th he e  c cr re ed di it t c cr ru un nc ch h
The purchased debt market is expected 
to continue growing faster than
commissioned debt collection – driven by
liquidity pressures on banks, which are the
largest debt vendors, and their need to
free-up capital by reducing the amount of
debt on their own books. There is room for
further growth among smaller businesses
and the public sector, which are relatively
under-penetrated and may also face
pressure to recover capital faster. Prices 
for purchased debt are likely to soften if, 
as expected, private equity-backed 
debt collection agencies face increased
funding pressures.

Our Objectives and Strategies
C Co or rp po or ra at te e  R Re es sp po on ns si ib bi il li it ty y
Cattles aims to retain the confidence of all
stakeholders and to maintain their trust in
its businesses. The Group will continue to
demonstrate a responsible approach to
customers, colleagues, local communities
and the environment.
Corporate Responsibility (CR) is about
managing risks to the confidence and
trust placed in Cattles’ businesses by
customers, colleagues and other
stakeholders. If the Group fails to
recognise its responsibilities or
underestimates their importance, it risks
damaging its reputation and ultimately 
its business.
Cattles has a straightforward CR strategy
based on three cornerstones:
• • B Be ei in ng g  a a  r re es sp po on ns si ib bl le e  f fi in na an nc ci ia al l  s se er rv vi ic ce es s
o or rg ga an ni is sa at ti io on n
The Group’s businesses treat their
customers fairly and with respect. They
lend carefully, making sure customers’
financial circumstances are understood 
to ensure the right products are offered.
Open and honest relationships are sought
with customers and constructive support
is offered to customers if they encounter
difficulties.
• B Be ei in ng g  a a  g go oo od d  p pe eo op pl le e  b bu us si in ne es ss s
The Group’s success depends on the skills
and professionalism of its employees. The
Group aims to create an environment that
is motivating and stimulating and to treat
its employees with fairness and respect.
Listening to what employees have to say,
helping them to fulfil their career
aspirations and offering them equal
opportunities to progress are important
priorities. The Group seeks to build strong
bonds with the communities in which 
it operates because these are where its
customers and employees live and work.
• B Be ei in ng g  e en nv vi ir ro on nm me en nt ta al ll ly y  r re es sp po on ns si ib bl le e
As a growing business the Group
recognises its impact on the environment.
It has a duty to manage this impact
and minimise it where it can, and to raise
awareness of environmental issues among
colleagues. Stakeholders expect the 
Group to do this, and using resources more
efficiently will also help to reduce costs.
G GR RO OU UP P  S ST TR RA AT TE EG GY Y
The overall objective of Cattles is to
increase shareholder value significantly by
becoming the UK’s leading non-standard
financial services group.
The Group intends to achieve this
objective by:
• Continuing to focus on non-standard
consumer lending; and
• Supplementing this with a broadening
range of complementary financial
services and distribution channels for
non-standard consumers.
The Key Performance Indicators (KPIs) to
measure the Group’s progress are:
• Income growth
• Earnings per share growth
• Return on equity
The Group’s investment over recent
years has built a strong, scalable business
in three complementary markets:
non-standard consumer finance, debt
recovery and SME invoice finance. The
Group intends to continue growing in all
three areas.
There is a great opportunity to leverage
the Group’s expertise, track record and
leadership skills in non-standard
consumer finance. The recent contraction
in this market has been due to a reduction
in supply as lenders have withdrawn from
sectors of this market or have tightened
their underwriting criteria, rather than to
any softening in demand: demand has in
fact continued to grow. The Group will
continue to invest in building upon its
strong position in this sector, without
compromising underwriting criteria,
through organic development of Welcome
Finance and through the acquisition of
complementary non-standard consumer
finance businesses.
The Group will also continue to invest in
growing Lewis and to develop CIF.
Investment in infrastructure and IT systems
has already enabled the Group to
accelerate its growth. This investment is
enabling loans to be approved more
efficiently, improving the effectiveness of
collection processes, enhancing
customers’ experience and making it easier
for brokers and dealers to promote the
Group’s products. These new systems are
scalable. The Group will continue to invest
in its branch network, processes and IT to
support further growth.
The quality and motivation of the Group’s
people is a clear strength, both in gaining
new business and in maintaining robust
credit quality. The Group will continue 
to focus on employee engagement linked
to reward and to develop a shared culture
across the organisation which involves and
energises all employees to grow the
business and enhance the quality of
customer service.

Risks
Over many years the Group has
built a unique understanding of 
its markets – and developed a
thorough, methodical approach
that is called ‘Risk. Managed.’This
requires unrelenting awareness 
and control of risk in everything 
the Group does. It ensures that
risks are accurately identified and
managed conservatively .
R RI IS SK K  M MA AN NA AG GE EM ME EN NT T  I IN N  T TH HE E
N NO ON N- -S ST TA AN ND DA AR RD D  S SE EC CT TO OR R
The Group’s appetite for risk is a carefully
calibrated part of the business model,
aligned to strategic and corporate
objectives. The aim is not to avoid or
eliminate risk, it is to do business
successfully. The markets in which the
Group operates potentially expose it to
higher credit risk than those faced by the
financial services industry generally. The
relatively narrow range of the Group’s
products and services – primarily lending
and the selling of general insurance – also
means that the Group is more exposed to
certain external factors.
The Board accepts these risks on the
condition that they are controlled in a way
that enables the Group to price its
products commensurately.
Providing non-standard credit is not a
business for the uncommitted. It requires
deep knowledge of the market and a 
very robust and iterative approach to risk
management and regulatory compliance.
Underpinning the Group’s long-term
commitment to the non-standard sector 
is a Group-wide approach to the
management of risk of all types. It is
hands-on, not just involving dedicated
specialist teams, but forming part of the
organisations culture: the Group’s risk
programme is embedded into all processes.

Each part of the Group has a defined risk
matrix indicating how risks are rated and
outlining the management and approval
arrangements for each level of risk. Risks
are rated in terms of impact, likelihood and
control effectiveness, and the prioritisation
scales defining the risk assessment
are updated annually. Compliance 
and internal audit reviews include
assessments of the effectiveness of the
controls for all risks in the risk registers.
The Group aims to keep risk identification
and management processes as
straightforward as possible to maximise
the engagement and understanding of all
colleagues.
Risk registers are presented in a consistent
and uniform manner across the Group,
with risks arranged in residual risk priority
order. Considerable effort is put into visual
presentation, using risk maps and
dashboards to help managers see the risk
picture more clearly. These visualisations
also help to show how the pattern of risk
evolves over time, as risks are modified 
by external events or the Group’s actions
to control them. The risk maps and
prioritisations for the Group, WFS, Lewis
and CIF are independently validated by 
the Deloitte internal audit team.

The Group’s risk identification process is
outlined in Fig 1.
When new potential or emerging risks are
identified, they are referred either directly
to the Risk Management team or through
the Risk Forum, which brings together
around 12 colleagues, referred to as risk
champions, who represent all functions in
the business. New risks are added to the
central risk register, which is reviewed at
each meeting of the Risk Management
Committee. This committee, comprising
directors and heads of all functions,
debates each new risk and votes (within
clear terms of reference) on which are
sufficiently material to warrant being
escalated to the WFS board. If the risk
affects the Group as a whole, it is further
debated at the WFS board to decide
whether escalation to the Risk
Management Group is required.
The Group maintains risk registers and risk
maps for the following parts of the
business: Cattles plc, CIF, Lewis and WFS
(which include functional risk registers for
Financial Control, Human Resources,
Health & Safety, Information Security
Management, Fraud Risk Management,
Credit Quality and Credit Risk, Regulatory
Risk, Shopacheck, Operational Risk –
Customer Sales and Service Centres,
Operational Risk – Branch Operations,
Welcome Car Finance – Retail and
Welcome Car Finance – Procurement).
In addition to these permanent risk
registers, ad hoc registers are maintained
for all key projects and initiatives, such as
the current implementation of the new
back office IT systems. About half a dozen
project risk registers are currently in
operation.
The Cattles risk register is reviewed twice a
year by the Risk Management Group,
which reports to the Audit Committee. The
risk registers for WFS, Lewis and CIF are
formally updated three times a year and
presented to the relevant subsidiary board.
Functional registers are updated quarterly
with the senior management of the
relevant function and agreed with the
relevant board director. Project registers
are updated according to the nature of 
the project, generally no less than once 
a quarter.

Assesses recommendations 
from the Risk Forum and 
reviews the WFS Register The Group Board sets standards for credit
risk management throughout the Group.
This is achieved through a combination 
of governance structures, credit risk
policies and credit systems and processes.
It delegates authority for credit policy 
to the subsidiary boards.
• Welcome Financial Services
The WFS board determines credit policy 
by considering and authorising
recommendations proposed by a sub-
committee responsible for evaluating
credit policy and product profitability.
WFS has a credit quality department
responsible for ensuring that asset quality
is maintained within specified parameters.
The department is independent of
operational management and has no
responsibility for income generation. The
department is subject to internal audit
review on a regular basis. This review
covers areas such as integrity of scorecards
and the quality of the department’s
reporting.
In Welcome Finance, the principal
protections against credit risk are the
effectiveness of its bespoke credit scoring
and underwriting processes, and the way
in which it maintains close customer
relationships through its national network
of local community branches.
Applications for advances come from a
variety of channels, including national
brokers and dealers, and Welcome Finance
ensures consistency of credit quality by
scoring and underwriting applications
centrally. No one has the authority to
overwrite a credit score.
Before a new loan is approved, an
appropriate credit risk assessment of the
customer is made. This includes using
bespoke scorecards tailored to the 
non-standard market based on Welcome
Finance’s own data, ensuring compliance
with affordability tests and obtaining
satisfactory proofs of both income and
identity. The applicant’s risk rating is
assessed by a combination of the
scorecard and policy rules and a product
is allocated according to that risk. All key
data – such as income and identity – is
validated through documented proof,
supplemented with electronic checking.
The comprehensive fraud checks use the
latest fraud prevention technology and 
a national fraud-sharing database. The
introduction of DETECT software designed
to mitigate the risk of application fraud
has been a great success in identifying and
eliminating a significant volume of
applicant fraud.
Through dashboards, risks are monitored
against pre-set tolerances. These
tolerances are set by functional
management and agreed with Risk
Management. Where tolerances are
exceeded, appropriate risk treatment plans
are invoked. The Group uses the TERRA risk
methodology for risk treatment: Transfer,
Exploit, Reduce, Retain, Avoid.
Risks and the Group’s actions to mitigate
them are scored subjectively. Ultimately,
these can only be determined using
judgement. However, technology provides
the opportunity to make judgements more
systematic, objective, robust and
consistent. The Group is currently
implementing and testing bespoke
enterprise risk management software to
help the risk champions throughout the
business to identify potential risks, then
log, mitigate and track them as they
emerge and develop. The system balances
materiality of risks, and therefore the scale
of controls, against commercial
considerations. It provides a highly visible
and iterative approach, and should further
increase the consistency and
responsiveness of the Group’s risk
management.

The Group has identified the key risks that

below.
C Cr re ed di it t r ri is sk k
This is the risk to earnings or capital
arising from a counterparty’s failure to
meet the terms of a contract with one 
of the Group’s businesses where funds
have been advanced to them. The main
exposure to credit risk relates to the
Group’s portfolios of loans and receivables.
The Group acknowledges that the risk
arising from changes in credit quality 
and the recoverability of loans is inherent
in the nature of its business. Adverse
changes in customers’ credit quality
arising from a general deterioration 
in economic conditions in the UK, such 
as higher interest rates, higher
unemployment levels or house price
reductions, could affect the recoverability
and value of the Group’s loans and
receivables.
The objective of credit risk management
is to enable the Group to achieve
appropriate reward while keeping this 
risk exposure in line with its declared risk
appetite.

additional credit, that the loan is
considered to be impaired and subject
to an appropriate level of provision.
The Group’s long-established target is 
to maintain Welcome Finance instalment
arrears at 8-10% of receivables and it
has consistently operated within or
slightly below this range for many years. 
At 31 December 2007 the level was 
7.0% (2006: 7.4%). Data from Welcome
Finance’s bespoke scorecards continues 
to confirm the belief that the 8-10% target
is appropriate for the risk appetite. Over
time, as previously reported, the Group
expects instalment arrears to return
gradually to within the target range
because of a change in product mix
towards unsecured personal loans.
Credit risk in Shopacheck is managed
through regular analysis of customers’
ability to make repayments, and their
credit limits are amended accordingly.
• The Lewis Group
Lewis was one of the founders of the debt
purchase industry in the UK and recorded
the industry’s first ever £10 million plus
acquisition in the late 1990s. This
experience of the debt purchase market,
together with the business’ long history 
in contingent debt collecting, has provided
senior management with significant
knowledge and data with which to price
portfolios offered for sale.
Lewis has an established and experienced
Risk team, responsible for performing the
detailed analytical work needed to
segment and value portfolios. The pricing
models used have evolved over time and are
capable of performing multi-dimensional
analysis of very large portfolios in 
a sophisticated, yet efficient way.
The Risk team works under the close
supervision of the Lewis board and
submits draft bids to the Pricing
Committee, comprising the Lewis directors
and the head of risk, for consideration and
approval. Any bids which exceed the
Committee’s mandate are subject to the
approval by the Group Board.
Customers’ ability to afford their loan
repayments is assessed during the sales
process, taking into account their level of
income in comparison to their outgoings.
Secured loans are underwritten on the
same basis as unsecured loans, with
emphasis placed on assessing and
verifying a customer’s ability to repay and
not on the equity in their property. A legal
charge is nevertheless registered on the
customer’s property as experience shows
that this leads to customers placing a
higher priority on meeting their loan
repayments. At the time a loan is paid out,
all Welcome Finance customers must be in
employment and have set up a direct debit
from a bank account to repay the loan.
The majority of customers are managed 
by the extensive branch network and
collections units. After loans are paid out,
customers are assigned to a customer
account manager in their nearest
community branch. Establishing and
maintaining close personal relationships
with customers is a fundamental strength
in Welcome Finance’s ability to achieve
robust credit quality, because it enables
them to help customers promptly 
should they encounter difficulties with
their repayments.
The customer account managers in the
Operational Branches are responsible for
managing a customer’s schedule of
repayments. The performance of customer
account managers, and each branch as a
whole, is specifically measured in terms 
of the level of customers’ arrears, and
relevant management information is
available on a daily basis in each branch.
Summary information is available to
senior operational management to
monitor collections performance 
and arrears at both a branch and 
portfolio level.
In addition, the credit quality and finance
teams continuously review and analyse
arrears statistics in order that any
corrective steps can be identified and
implemented should any adverse trends 
in either a particular location or product
line develop.
The Operational Branches manage
customers’ accounts whilst they are up-to-
date or experiencing early, casual arrears.
If an account misses two payments, it is
passed to a Local Management Branch.
These branches comprise specialist
collectors who work with customers to
ensure regular payments resume so as to
enable the account to be transferred back
to the Operational Branch and to prevent
the account from falling into more serious
arrears.
The performance of branches is closely managed 
to ensure that the level of customers’ arrears is 
well-controlled.
Maintaining close customer
relationships is central to
Welcome Finance achieving 
robust credit quality . 21

Financial Statements 2007
After the operations team have established
collection targets at an individual collector
level, the Risk team is also responsible for
monitoring collections performance post-
acquisition. A suite of reports has been
developed to assist in this monitoring
process. The performance of each portfolio
is monitored and reported on a monthly
basis with major portfolios being subject
to additional formal review meetings on a
quarterly basis. Data from actual
collections is fed back into the valuation
models as appropriate.
• Cattles Invoice Finance
CIF benefits from a well-diversified
portfolio and robust underwriting criteria.
It has a defined process, contained within
its credit policy, for the approval of invoice
financing facilities to prospective clients. 
A prospective client is assessed in relation
to the suitability of the security offered
(supported by professional valuations
where necessary), the robustness of their
systems to provide all the information
necessary to establish and maintain a
facility, and the availability and content of
financial information detailing their
current trading position and future
projections. In addition, information from
external credit reference agencies in
relation to the directors and contracting
parties of the prospective client is also
obtained.
As well as establishing appropriate
underwriting criteria and systems,
providing personal attention to clients is
key to controlling arrears. CIF has
structured itself in order to provide
exceptionally high levels of client contact
and service, with each client manager
handling only 25-30 client relationships. In
addition, the business has a dedicated
team of auditors performing site reviews
at clients to ensure there is ongoing
adequacy in the clients’ systems and that
the business of the client has remained
consistent with that indicated at the
commencement of the facility. However,
these precautions cannot eliminate all risk
of default or fraud: in 2007, the Group
judged it prudent to provide for defaults
on three accounts, increasing the loan loss
ratio to 2.2% (2006: 1.2%).
T Tr re ea as su ur ry y  r ri is sk k
The Group has categorised treasury risk
into its constituent elements – liquidity
risk, interest rate and currency risks (being
market risks), counterparty credit risk,
concentration risk and capital risk – each
of which is discussed below:
• Liquidity risk
This is the risk to earnings or capital
arising from an inability to meet
obligations when they become due,
without incurring unexpected or
unacceptable losses. It includes the risk of
inability to manage unplanned decreases
or changes in funding sources and also any
failure to recognise and address changes
in market conditions that could affect the
Group’s ability to liquidate assets quickly,
with minimum value loss, if necessary.
There is a risk that funding for expansion
may not be available or may prove
expensive – particularly when the Group’s
lending business is growing particularly
strongly. Failures in the Group’s capital
planning framework could result in the
Group lacking sufficient capital to support
current and anticipated business activity
and impact adversely on capital
repayment and dividend payment. T o
manage these risks, the Treasury & Risk
Director and his team continuously
forecast funding headroom, monitor the
funding markets and seek to increase
headroom well ahead of need.
The Group funds its businesses through
syndicated and bilateral facilities with
major UK and international banks and
through private and public debt offerings.
The current syndicated and bilateral
facilities have original maturities of up to
six years. In order to continue to fund the
expected growth in the Group’s
receivables these facilities will typically be
renewed and/or increased on their
termination.
The Group has a successful track record in
fundraising activity, which has continued
during 2007. Equity placement activity in
2007 has helped to reduce the Group’s
gearing to 4.6 times tangible net assets at
the year-end, comfortably within the
Company’s covenant limit of six times; and
by increasing shareholders’ funds, the
equity placement increased the Group’s
total borrowing capacity by some
£773 million.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Risks continued
At 31 December 2007, around 85% 
(2006: 80%) of the Group’s borrowings
were protected against future interest
rate volatility, either through fixed rate
borrowing (in the case of public bonds,
private placement loan notes, debentures,
finance leases, hire purchase and some
other loans) or by using interest rate swaps
to protect floating rate bank borrowings.
As a result, based on borrowings at
31 December 2007, a hypothetical 
1% change in the three-month LIBOR
would only change the Group’s annual
interest expense (after taking account
of any hedge ineffectiveness) by around
£1.9 million (2006: £2.4 million).
This long-standing treasury strategy to
limit exposure to interest rate movements
has helped to provide the Group with a
stable funding platform and greater
certainty and control over future funding
costs. It is not the policy of the Group to
trade in such financial hedging
instruments. The level of protection
contracted for at any particular time
would not exceed the Group’s exposure to
actual or projected borrowings, except in
the event of short-term timing differences.
• Currency risk
Certain funding received from banks or
other sources may not be in sterling. This
creates a potential exposure to the risk of
adverse foreign exchange rate movements.
At 31 December 2007 the Group had a 
US $110 million unsecured loan note due
for redemption at par in two parts in 2008
and 2011, a further US $75 million
unsecured loan note due for redemption
at par in two parts in 2011 and 2013 and 
a €6 million unsecured loan note due for
redemption at par in 2013.
It is the policy of the Group to manage 
the risk of exposure to adverse foreign
exchange rate movements by the use of
financial hedging instruments. In order 
to achieve this, all foreign currency
denominated borrowings are immediately
swapped into sterling at the start of the
related facility agreement for the term of
the borrowings.
• Counterparty credit risk
At any point in time, Cattles has an
exposure to its counterparties arising from
treasury activities. Management of
counterparty credit risk is assisted by
ensuring that derivative counterparties
and other counterparties that hold the
Group’s funds on deposit or credit
balances on bank accounts should carry a
long-term credit rating of higher than BBB,
or equivalent.
The Group maintains a mixture of long-
term and short-term committed facilities
that are designed to ensure that the Group
has sufficient available funds for current
operations and planned growth.
Details of current bank facilities and 
their maturity dates are set out in Fig 12
on page 39.
The Group’s funding includes:
• Syndicated and bilateral bank facilities
• Public bond issues
• US private placements
• Overdraft facilities
The Group has a long-standing and
conservative approach to funding and
liquidity. The average maturity of the
Group’s total borrowing facilities is around
five years, whilst the average maturity of
the receivables book is shorter, at
approximately three years.
Existing and forecast headroom levels are
reported and reviewed at each Board
meeting. Whilst there is no set minimum
level of headroom, under normal
circumstances the intention would be to
maintain a minimum of around six
months’ headroom.
The Group’s risk management programme
aims to limit adverse external impacts on
financial performance by using financial
instruments such as interest rate and
cross-currency swaps to fix interest rates
and hedge foreign currency denominated
borrowings. The Board has delegated
responsibility for the Group’s treasury risk
management policies, within limits, to the
Treasury & Risk Director. These policies are
implemented directly by the treasury team
on the Group’s behalf. The team has a risk
management policy setting out specific
guidelines for managing interest rate,
foreign exchange and credit risks and 
the use of financial instruments in relation 
to these.
• Interest rate risk
The Group has minimal risk to income
from changes in market interest rates as
almost all customer lending is at rates of
interest which are fixed over the term of
the contract.
Facilities provided by banks and other
investors are a mixture of fixed rate and
floating rate funding. Floating rate
borrowings are exposed to the risk of
rising interest rates which the Group
manages by the use of appropriate
financial hedging instruments, primarily
interest rate swaps. As a result, the Group
has a relatively low risk to changes in
market interest rates for current
borrowings.
The Group has a long-standing
and consistent approach 
to funding and liquidity – the
average maturity of borrowing
facilities is around five years,
compared to three years 
for the receivables book. 23
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2007
In addition, interest rate and
cross-currency derivatives with any single
counterparty would not, under normal
circumstances, be allowed to exceed 25%
of the Group’s total interest rate
derivatives.
• Concentration risk
The Group is careful to avoid building a
concentration of facilities with a relatively
small group of funding partners. In order
to avoid such a concentration the Group
has established funding in the bank,
public bond and US private placement
markets. Bank facilities currently include a
syndicate of over 30 banking partners. It is
the Group’s intention that funding with
any individual counterparty should not
normally exceed 20% of total Group
funding.
The risk from a concentration of customer
credit risk is limited due to the relatively
low value of each customer’s debt and to
the Group’s large and unrelated customer
base.
• Capital risk
The Group’s objective in managing capital
is to maintain a strong capital base to
support current operations and planned
growth and to provide for an appropriate
level of dividend payment to shareholders.
The Group is not subject to external
regulatory capital requirements. It is,
however, required under certain of its
funding agreements, to ensure that its
gearing ratio does not exceed six times.
For this purpose gearing is calculated as
the ratio of consolidated borrowings to
tangible net assets. The precise definition
of borrowings used in the calculation
varies according to the funding
agreement, but is broadly consistent with
that disclosed in the consolidated balance
sheet. Adjustment is made to exclude
items such as accrued interest,
unamortised discount and fees, and net
off certain bank deposits. Tangible net
assets are based on net assets (equivalent
to total shareholders’ equity) less goodwill
and other intangible assets.
The calculation of the gearing ratio at
31 December 2007 and 2006 is shown 
in Fig 2. 
Throughout 2007, the Company complied
with the gearing covenant and the
reduction in the ratio is attributable to 
the equity placing in March 2007 which
strengthened the Group’s capital base.
Depending on the specific funding
agreement, reporting against this
covenant is carried out on a quarterly,
semi-annual or annual basis. In addition,
the gearing level is monitored internally
on a monthly basis and is included in the
Group’s forecasts.
The Group aims to maintain the capital
base (which includes share capital, share
premium, other reserves and retained
earnings) so that, at all times, the gearing
level is below the covenant limit. In doing
so, due regard is given to relevant forecast
information.
S St tr ra at te eg gi ic c  r ri is sk k
This is the risk to earnings or capital
arising from adverse business decisions, or
improper or inadequate implementation
of those decisions. This risk is a function 
of the Group’s corporate strategic goals,
the business strategies developed 
to achieve those goals, the resource
deployed against them and the quality 
of the implementation. The resource
considerations should include operations,
support and communications.
T o mitigate the risks relating to specific
strategic projects the Group has a range of
project risk registers, and members of the
Risk Management department are closely
involved in the project teams and/or
steering committees for any such
developments. For example, the current
project to replace the back office IT
systems in WFS has a very robust
governance structure including its own
risk committee reporting directly to the
board. The output of this committee feeds
directly into the strategic and commercial
decisions around the programme’s ‘go/no-
go’ review by the WFS board.
O Op pe er ra at ti io on na al l/ /t tr ra an ns sa ac ct ti io on na al l  r ri is sk k
This is the risk to earnings or capital
arising from problems with service or
product delivery. It can stem from failures
of process, systems and people. This risk is
a function of internal controls, information
systems, employee integrity and operating
processes. It affects all products and
services.
The Group’s approach to managing
operational risk is a highly proactive and
iterative one. For example, each function
within WFS has a dedicated risk manager,
who works closely with the senior
management team in identifying,
assessing and monitoring risks at a
functional level. Colleagues within HR,
finance, credit quality and branch
operations have their own bespoke risk
registers that are reviewed quarterly with
their risk manager. Each functional risk
register is formally presented to, and
approved by, the relevant board director.

Reputation risk is inherent throughout the
business and includes a responsibility to
exercise appropriate caution when dealing
with customers, shareholders, markets
and the community.
Cattles guards its reputation jealously and
trains customer-facing colleagues to
protect it. For example, in WFS the FSA’s
Treating Customers Fairly (TCF) initiative is
supported. WFS has established a
Customer Experience Group, chaired by its
director of customer experience. This
group of senior managers is responsible
for promoting a customer-focused culture
within the business, and ensuring that the
principles and expectations are firmly
embedded into the corporate culture.
WFS has established principles in relation
to TCF, so as to ensure it considers the
needs of customers when products are
developed and sold, when after sales
service processes, complaint handling
procedures and marketing materials 
are designed and when colleague
remuneration policies are set.
In each of the Group’s businesses,
well-developed procedures for resolving
customer complaints and queries are 
in place.
In the debt recovery commission market
there are published league tables of debt
collection performance: Lewis’ high
ranking in these tables confirms that
its collection strategies are effective. 
T o protect its own reputation and those 
of its clients it has a strict policy of using
only ethical collection methods, and as a
member of the Credit Services Association
it adheres to the Association’s code of
conduct.
The Group’s Corporate Responsibility (CR)
programme also plays an important role in
how the Group effectively manages
reputation risk. It generates the most
value for business performance and
reputation by being commercially and
operationally aligned to business strategy.
The Group’s CR activities are focused on
the three cornerstones of the CR strategy 
– being a responsible financial services
organisation, a good people business 
and environmentally responsible. At
the same time the Group recognises its
commitment to engage with stakeholders
across a wide range of issues and to 
meet their needs and expectations as 
well as possible.
• Business Continuity Risk
Loss of information and communications
technology (ICT) infrastructure or key
business premises would adversely impact
the Group’s ability to do business, and is a
risk that is taken extremely seriously. T o
mitigate it the Group has a business
continuity management (BCM) system.
This is endorsed by the Group Board and
underpinned by a clear BCM policy signed-
off by the Treasury & Risk Director, who is
the BCM sponsor on the Group Board. The
policy states that the industry-recognised
good practice guidelines set out by the
Business Continuity Institute are followed,
and that the Group aligns itself to the
British Standard for Business Continuity
Management, BS25999.
Recognising the Group’s increasing
reliance on telephony and computer
systems, the significant resources of
third-party specialists under formal ICT
disaster recovery arrangements are used.
Third-party specialists are also contracted
to cover the loss of any key business
premises.
• Compliance and legal risk
Failure or inability to comply with the laws,
regulations or codes relating to the
financial services industry can lead to
fines, public reprimands and enforced
suspension of operations – and in extreme
cases, withdrawal of authorisation to
operate. The Group’s dedicated
compliance function has implemented
controls and systems to monitor and
manage these risks. These include
monitoring regulatory and legal changes,
advising on implications and setting
compliance policies and strategy. The
Group identifies and manages legal risk
through effective use of its internal and
external legal advisers. The Company
Secretary and Legal Counsel is responsible
for providing the support necessary to
identify, manage and control legal risk
across the Group.
The Group’s compliance monitoring
processes are designed to ensure that
operating licences are not put at risk 
and that insurance products are sold 
in accordance with FSA regulations.
Compliance is continually monitored,
reported to senior management and 
the WFS board, and improvements made
to processes where appropriate.

Key Resources
The Group has maintained its
long-established treasury strategy of
hedging exposure to interest rate volatility.
At the year-end, around 85% of the
Group’s £2.3 billion total borrowings were
protected against future interest rate
volatility, for an average period of around
four years. As a result, despite significant
increases in short-term LIBOR rates, the
Group’s average cost of funding rose only
marginally in 2007 to 6.9% (2006: 6.8%).
The Group’s funding covenant allows
borrowings up to six times the value of
shareholders’ funds. By increasing
shareholders’ funds, the March share
placing added some £773 million to the
amount the Group can potentially raise in
the debt markets to fund further growth
in lending. At the year-end the Group’s
gearing was 4.6 times (2006: 5.1 times)
shareholders’ funds, excluding goodwill
and other intangible assets. the Group’s
credit rating was reaffirmed as BBB in
October.
At the end of 2007 the Group had available
headroom of £226 million (2006: £349
million) within existing funding facilities,
which had an average maturity of around
five years. While this allows continued
strong growth into 2008, the scale of
opportunities open to the Group mean
that the Board will be looking to extend
the Group’s funding facilities further by
mid-2008.
The Group is well-placed to raise further
funds successfully, despite the current
more conservative lending climate. It has
an excellent track record, well-established
relationships with over 30 banks, and
continuing robust credit quality which
provides further comfort to lenders.
However, given current debt market
conditions the Board is also looking at a
range of actions that would broaden the
Group’s funding options.
Inevitably, there will be some increase in
the cost of funding. But as existing
borrowings are already substantially
hedged, any rise will impact mainly on
new borrowing. It is estimated that a 1%
change in the three-month LIBOR would
add only £1.9 million to the Group’s
annual interest expense, based on current
levels of borrowing.

2006: £1.8 billion
• Average cost of funding 6.9%
2006: 6.8%
• Headroom at year-end £226 million
2006: £349 million
The Group’s continuing strong growth
requires an increase in the amount of
funding needed, if it is to reap the benefit
of the opportunities open to it.
During 2007 the Group’s total receivables
increased by £739 million to £2.8 billion
and borrowings increased over the year by
£565 million to £2.3 billion. The Group has
continued to receive strong support from
equity and bond investors, and from its
banking relationships, despite greater risk
aversion in the markets.
In the first quarter of 2007 the Company
successfully placed 32,978,986 new
ordinary shares, which were admitted to
listing on the London Stock Exchange on
20 March 2007. This raised gross proceeds
of £133 million to refinance debt portfolios
acquired by Lewis in 2006 and to finance
organic growth.
In July 2007, the Group completed a new
£400 million 10-year sterling bond issue at
a fixed rate of 7.125%. This significantly
increased available headroom and
strengthened the average maturity profile.
The issue was placed in line with the
Group’s strategy of going to the markets
well ahead of need, and proved
particularly well timed: soon afterwards,
the corporate bond markets effectively
closed to new issues.
In December, the Group secured additional
headroom by arranging a new 18-month
unsecured facility of £150 million from the
Royal Bank of Scotland, priced at around
25bps above its current average rate for
bank funding. This facility has recently
been increased to £250 million. The Group
also redeemed its £125 million maiden
sterling bond, issued in 1999. It provides
some perspective on current economic
conditions to note that this bond carried a
fixed interest rate of 8.625% – significantly
higher than the average rates at which the
Group is borrowing today. Following this
transaction, with the sole exception of a
US $40 million tranche of private placing
funding which matures in December 2008,
none of the Group’s other facilities will
need refinancing until mid-2009.
The Group has continued to
receive strong support from 
equity and bond investors and
from its banking relationships. 27

• Welcome Finance loan loss ratio 8.6%
2006: 7.4%
• Welcome Finance instalment arrears 7.0%
2006: 7.4%
An essential element of the Group’s
consumer lending strategy and risk
management is maintaining robust credit
quality. The Group’s long-established
target has been to maintain instalment
arrears in Welcome Finance at 8-10% 
of receivables, and the business has
consistently operated at or slightly below
this level for many years.
Welcome Finance achieves controlled
levels of arrears through its bespoke 
credit scoring and underwriting process 
– supported by the close relationships 
that employees in its local community
branches maintain with customers so 
that account managers can provide timely
assistance to customers who experience
difficulties with their repayments.
Welcome Finance’s scorecards and credit
scoring methodology are bespoke, based
on its own data, developed with a leading
credit referencing agency, and refined over
many years of experience in non-standard
consumer lending. Management believes
they represent best practice in the sector.
Improved credit scorecards and other
enhancements to Welcome Finance’s
customer selection technology were
introduced in 2004, and the combined
effect of these has contributed to bringing
customers’ instalment arrears below 
the target range. At the end of 2007 the
level of instalment arrears in Welcome
Finance was 7.0% (2006: 7.4%). The Group
continually monitors the performance 
of the scorecards to ensure they continue
to support the strategy of robust
credit quality.
The Board continues to believe that the 
8-10% target constitutes an appropriate
risk appetite. Over time, as previously
reported, it is expected that instalment
arrears will gradually return to within the
target range because of changes in
product mix towards unsecured lending.
Each Welcome Finance applicant’s credit
risk rating is assessed using a combination
of scorecards and policy rules, and this
rating is used to determine which product
is appropriate. All key data – such as
income and identity – is validated through
documented proof, supplemented with
electronic checking and use of the latest
fraud prevention technology and a
national fraud sharing database.
During the sales process a customer’s
ability to afford their loan repayments,
balancing their proven income against
their outgoings, is assessed. At the time a
loan is paid out all Welcome Finance
customers are in employment and have a
direct debit set up from a bank account to
repay the loan.

management of credit risk. These
branches employ local people with good
communication skills, who understand
local conditions and help the business to
engage in the local community. Once a
Welcome Finance loan has been advanced
by one of the three Customer Sales and
Service Centres, customers are contacted
by a customer account manager from their
nearest branch to begin establishing a
close working relationship. Maintaining
these relationships is a key part of the
Group’s arrears management strategy and
is the major role of branch staff. It helps
the business to respond promptly when
customers experience difficulty with
repayments, agreeing a practical plan 
to help them avoid arrears.
In order to accommodate Welcome
Finance’s continuing growth,
management has been reviewing the role
of branches so that they can manage
larger numbers of customers successfully.
Their work in maintaining close personal
relationships with customers is
paramount, but it is recognised that there
is some scope for handling some aspects
of administration centrally rather than in
branches. Welcome Finance is currently
undertaking pilots of alternative models.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Key Resources continued
are continually reviewed: last year a
consistent approach to rewarding loyalty
across the Group was developed and a
flexible menu of benefits was introduced
so that colleagues can choose a personally
tailored package. The Group also
introduced the Colleague Assistance
Programme, which provides information
and counselling to help colleagues with
life’s ups and downs.
The Group has been working hard to
engage its people with the business goals
by improving internal communications.
Twice a year, elected colleague
representatives now meet with subsidiary
board directors and colleagues receive a
range of information on their subsidiary’s
performance.
The quality of people that can be attracted
as a result of this work is pleasing – and
has led to a further reduction in colleague
turnover to 30.5% (2006: 33.1%).
The response rate to the Group’s annual
Speak Up colleague survey grew to 87%
(2006: 84%). The survey recorded good
improvements in colleagues’ perceptions
of the Group’s financial strength, culture,
professionalism and customer focus. It
also acknowledged colleagues’ continuing
progress in helping local communities and
caring for the environment.
Key findings were as follows:
• Index rating increase of 0.6 to 78%
in relation to colleagues being proud 
to work for the Group
• Index rating increase of 0.1 to 82% in
relation to believing they worked for a
good employer
• 95% of colleagues feel they make 
a valuable contribution to the business
Cattles has also received external
professional recognition in 2007, with
awards for the Most Effective Employee
Benefits Programme in the 2007 HR
Excellence Awards and Best Employee
Benefits Communications in the DWF
Employer Awards.

With some 1,970 new joiners in 2007, and
growing numbers likely for the foreseeable
future, the Group has made additional
efforts to instil strong values across the
organisation and ensure that all colleagues
know what is expected of them. 
Being respectful of both colleagues and
customers is important and management
believes the way colleagues and customers
are treated is important to differentiate
the Group positively from competitors and
earn Cattles good standing with regulators
and commentators.

T o support the accelerating growth of the
business, the Group has stepped-up its
investment in people: in recruiting,
training, developing and motivating them,
and ensuring that they are well led by
appropriately skilled senior managers. The
Group has also increased its investment in
fostering a consistent, positive and ethical
culture across all its businesses. The
response has been encouraging: colleague
turnover is down, and colleagues are
increasingly engaged in the business and
committed to its success.

Employee numbers increased across the
Group last year, rising by 13% to just over
5,000. This compares with a 1% increase 
in 2006. These increases have supported 
a 44% increase in Welcome Finance’s
customer numbers over the two-year
period.
Coming on top of normal colleague
turnover, the staffing increase meant that
the Group had to attract some 1,970 new
people into the organisation during the
year. The quality of the Group’s people 
is essential to its success: their skills,
commitment and, in particular, their
understanding of the Group’s markets 
and customers are paramount.
The Group therefore recognises the
importance of being able to attract people
of the right calibre – and to train and
motivate them well. Developing talent
from within in order to grow internal
expertise in key areas, such as arrears
management, is also viewed highly.
On average the Group attracts about 10
applicants for each job, such that in 2007
19,000 applications were handled. The
Group has strengthened the recruitment
team, brought in additional specialist
skills, and supported them with new IT to
help them process applications efficiently.
T o attract and retain the best people the
Group needs to offer attractive benefits,
working conditions and career paths in all
areas of the business. The Group aims to
provide competitive salary and benefits
packages, and help colleagues to
participate in its success through a
Sharesave Scheme and the award of free
shares. The benefits offered to colleagues
The Group’s investment in building a strong 
culture and values has grown in 2007. 29
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2007
The Group fosters a culture that is both
performance-oriented and customer
sensitive: knowing and supporting
customers is the best way to maintain
strong growth in a range of economic
conditions. So, for example, bonus and
incentive schemes are designed to reward
responsible lending, compliant behaviour
and good customer service. For each of the
Group’s businesses, management has
worked with colleagues to establish clear
aims and values. In 2007 WFS defined its
purpose as ‘to set the standard in
non-standard consumer finance’ – in
relation to customers, people and profit.
Lewis and CIF have adopted similar
programmes to strengthen their culture
and values.
WFS, which is regulated by the FSA, has
embraced the FSA’s Treating Customers
Fairly (TCF) initiative. The business applies
the TCF principles in its business dealings
and training, and is embedding them in 
its approach to remuneration.

T o maintain the quality of leadership and
performance as the Group grows,
investment in training and management
development again increased in 2007.
Quality of leadership is crucial to
successful growth management, and in
2007 a head of leadership development
was appointed. During the year 116 of the
Group’s managers participated in the
leadership development programmes of
the Management Academy, and a further
231 colleagues attended other
development programmes covering topics
such as coaching, time management
and persuading and influencing. One 
of the Group’s leadership programmes, 
the Foundation Management Skills
programme, received external
accreditation from the Institute of
Leadership and Management, and means
managers are able to gain an externally
recognised qualification through the
Academy: a further incentive to high
calibre people to build their careers with
Cattles.
The Group is moving people more
frequently between and around its
businesses wherever possible to develop a
management team with broader
experience of the whole Group. At the
same time, bringing in talent and
experience from outside is considered
appropriate in order to introduce fresh
perspectives and new skills. A great
advantage of the Group’s continuing
expansion is that this can be done while
maintaining a strong programme of
internal development and promotion: in
2007, 189 colleagues were promoted from
one grade to another, and another 588
were promoted within their existing
grade.
The Group continues to invest in 
training at all levels, particularly for
customer-facing employees, to ensure 
that colleagues have the skills they need 
to meet regulatory requirements, deliver
the businesses’ strategies and develop
their careers.
Over 16,000 days of training were provided
in 2007, of which almost 6,500 were to
prepare colleagues for the introduction of
Welcome Finance’s new back office IT
systems in 2008. Other major training
programmes included training 175 people
to join Welcome Finance’s new sales
fulfilment team, and the Licensed to Sell
programme which ensures that every
colleague who gives advice on insurance
products meets regulatory requirements.
The Group has a clearly articulated equal
opportunities policy, and the workforce
tends to reflect the local environment and
community. Diversity training is
increasingly part of induction and
management development programmes.
H He ea al lt th h  a an nd d  s sa af fe et ty y
Although the great majority of employees
work in office environments, the Group is
not complacent about health and safety.
The well-being of all colleagues is regarded
as a primary responsibility.
In 2007 there were three accidents
reportable under RIDDOR (Reporting of
Injuries, Diseases and Dangerous
Occurances Regulations), compared with
two in 2006. The Group’s health and safety
policies are reviewed regularly to ensure
that significant hazards are managed
effectively, and fire risk assessments are
completed at all locations. The Group
stepped-up online health and safety
training for all colleagues during 2007,
such that 13,212 assessment modules
were completed.
The Group has substantial field forces
working in the community, some of whom
carry money as part of their job. These
colleagues are provided with personal
safety awareness training and support
using materials developed by the Suzy
Lamplugh Trust, of which Cattles is a
long-standing member.
With some 1,450 company cars, the Group
also recognises the risks to colleagues on
the road. Company car drivers are targeted
with driver training programmes and
safety awareness campaigns.

Welcome Finance continues to benefit
from its CRM system, implemented in
mid-2006, which has supported record
business volumes with highly reliable and
scalable technology for new business
acquisition. In 2008 the business
introduces the second major phase of this
investment programme, replacing the
systems handling of the back office
aspects of Welcome Finance’s lending
operations.
This will be highly integrated with the
CRM system to provide a single solution
handling all aspects of customer
acquisition, management and retention.
Simplified procedures will lead to greater
consistency and efficiencies in the way the
business deals with its customers. There
will also be further improvement in
management information through taking
a single view of customer data. At the
same time Welcome Finance will deploy a
comprehensive marketing solution to
support full life cycle marketing of its
products to new and existing customers.
This phase will complete the investment
to deliver foundation systems capable of
supporting both organic and acquisitive
growth. It will enable Welcome Finance to
pilot a number of new initiatives to
broaden the way in which its customers
and introducers work with them – and in
particular to create faster turnaround of
lending decisions. This should lead to
further improvement in new business
conversion rates.
The Group will also take advantage of
recent advances in telephony to support
more efficient routing of calls across its
customer management functions. This
will lead to a better customer service and
improve efficiency by routing calls
wherever skilled staff are available 
to respond.
In 2008 Lewis will begin implementing a
new core business system. This will
enhance the effectiveness of its debt
collection processes, for example, by better
matching collection strategies to types of
debt. It will be a fully scalable package
capable of supporting Lewis’ future
growth.
CIF introduced an industry-leading CRM
system in 2006. This has proved highly
successful in helping the company to
manage the sales process, make better
informed decisions and increase business
from introducers. Work is now under way
to link the system with CIF’s core
operational system to provide better
integrated management information.
B BR RE EA AD DT TH H  O OF F  D DI IS ST TR RI IB BU UT TI IO ON N  C CH HA AN NN NE EL LS S
A significant factor in Welcome Finance’s
sustained growth is the relationships it
has built with its external distribution
channels. These are mainly brokers and 
car dealerships who refer customers.
Welcome Finance centralised its
underwriting processes to ensure that it
can give these introducers an
exceptionally high quality, consistent
service. By demonstrating commitment to
them and the market, the business has
built a sound basis for long-term
relationships and trust. Its CRM system is
enabling the business to develop improved
access for introducers, so that they obtain
a faster response from Welcome Finance
than from other lenders and can in turn
deliver a better service to their customers.
Lewis has a number of large clients in the
public and private sectors, who either sell
portfolios of debt or use Lewis’ debt
collection services. Lewis sustains its
relationships with these blue-chip
organisations by offering competitive
prices for purchased debt, delivering
excellent service and taking care to ensure
that its approach does not put their
clients’ reputations, or its own, at risk.
Virtually all CIF’s business has traditionally
come through introducers such as banks
and accountancy firms. In 2007 it
appointed a corporate partnership director
to pursue relationships with larger
institutions and affinity groups as a
strategic partner or outsourced provider.
This work is already beginning to bear fruit
and the business expects to announce a
number of partnerships in 2008.
CIF also reaches potential customers
through direct marketing channels such as
internet and telemarketing. Marketing
investment in this area has resulted in
10% of new clients in 2007 coming from
these channels. 
Continuing investment in technology and process
development is resulting in productivity gains and
enhanced customer service. 31

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Performance Review
• Unsecured personal loans
Many mainstream lenders tightened their
underwriting criteria during 2007, or
withdrew from segments of the unsecured
personal loans market altogether, as they
continued to experience deteriorating
credit quality. This reduction in supply saw
the market decrease by 19.5%, according
to the Finance & Leasing Association (FLA).
The supply-led reduction does not equate
in Cattles’ experience to any such
reduction in consumer demand for these
products and the reduced competition
enabled Welcome Finance to take full
advantage of its extensive experience in
the sector. Applications rose significantly,
enabling the business to increase its
unsecured personal loan volumes by
56.7% to £558.8 million (2006: £356.7
million) without relaxing stringent credit
criteria, as a consistent proportion of
below-standard applications continued to
be rejected. See Fig 3
• Hire purchase
In hire purchase too, Welcome Finance’s
experience and long-term commitment to
the market enabled it to grow as the
market remained flat overall, as reported
by the FLA. Hire purchase volumes grew by
41.5% to £415.8 million (2006: £293.8
million). This performance demonstrated
the continuing success of the hire
purchase field sales team, supported by
the Hire Purchase Customer Sales and
Service Centre based in Hull, in building a
national distribution network of external
introducers for used car finance. See Fig 4
• Secured loans
Welcome Finance grew its secured lending
volumes by 28.5% to £434.0 million 
(2006: £337.8 million) during 2007, 
an outstanding performance in a UK
market which, according to FLA figures,
experienced a supply-led overall reduction
of 5.2% in 2007. The business has
maintained its strategy of not offering
large balance, low rate second charge
secured loans, as these do not meet its 
risk profile. See Fig 5

WFS grew significantly in 2007. Its pre-tax
profit increased by 21.0% to £164.8 million
(2006: £136.1 million), primarily as a result
of the growth achieved in loan volumes
and customer numbers by its principal
business, Welcome Finance.
W We el lc co om me e  F Fi in na an nc ce e
While some competitors continued to
withdraw from non-standard consumer
credit, particularly unsecured lending,
Welcome Finance passed two important
milestones during 2007: customer
numbers exceeded 500,000 in November
2007 and the year-end loan book passed
£2.5 billion.
A key factor in Welcome Finance’s
profitable growth was its CRM system,
implemented in mid-2006, alongside the
breadth and strength of its distribution
channels. These strengths enabled the
business to take advantage of the buoyant
demand for its products and the reduced
competition, while maintaining robust
control of credit quality.
The number of Welcome Finance’s
customers increased by 105,000 to
514,000 (2006: 409,000), representing
growth of 25.7% compared with 14.2% in
2006. The number of new agreements
written during 2007 increased by 65,000
to 208,000 (2006: 143,000) and resulted in
growth in total loan volumes of 42.5% to
£1.4 billion (2006: £988.3 million). See Fig 1
The business also achieved a reduction in
the number of its customers settling their
agreements early. This fell by 1,000 to
34,000 (2006: 35,000), reducing the early
settlement ratio to 8.3% (2006: 9.8%).
There has been no significant change in
the value of average advances to new
customers across each product: unsecured
personal loans £2,100 (2006: £1,900), hire
purchase for cars £6,000 (2006: £5,700)
and second charge secured loans £9,300
(2006: £8,700). See Fig 2

T TH HE E  L LE EW WI IS S  G GR RO OU UP P  
Lewis’ pre-tax profit more than doubled to
£10.2 million (2006: £4.9 million) during
2007, reflecting its strategy of increasing
investment in debt portfolios. While
liquidity pressures have caused some
competitors to limit their activity in the
debt purchase market, the quality of
accounts for sale has improved as lenders
are reducing the amount of debt they wish
to carry on their own books. This has
enabled Lewis to increase its share of the
purchased debt market while remaining
highly selective.
Debt purchases during the year totalled
£74.3 million (2006: £69.5 million),
reinforcing Lewis’ position as one of the
leading players in the UK market. By the
end of 2007 its receivables had grown by
46.0% to £132.9 million (2006: £91.0
million). See Fig 8
In September 2007, Lewis acquired a
portfolio of 32,000 UK credit card, loan
and overdraft accounts for £25 million. It
supplements the large portfolio acquired
in December 2006, which has performed
well and will continue to provide a weekly
flow of smaller tranches of debt until at
least the middle of 2009.
Lewis’ commission on third-party debt
collection generated increased income of
£7.2 million (2006: £6.6 million). See Fig 9
The net interest margin earned by Lewis
increased to 15.9% (2006: 15.4%) lagging
the growth in net interest income of 73.6%
to £17.2 million (2006: £9.9 million), due
to the significant growth in its receivables
during the year. This income growth
contributed to the improvement in Lewis’
cost income ratio to 39.2% (2006: 47.0%).
C CA AT TT TL LE ES S  I IN NV VO OI IC CE E  F FI IN NA AN NC CE E  
CIF increased its client base by 11.4% to
725 during 2007 (2006: 651) and its net
receivables by 23.9% to £99.4 million
(2006: £80.2 million). As a consequence, 
CIF delivered double-digit income growth of
15.6% to £16.9 million (2006: £14.6 million)
and improved its net interest margin 
to 4.3% (2006: 4.0%). See Fig 10
This strong income growth did not
translate into CIF’s pre-tax profit of 
£2.5 million (2006: £2.7 million), largely 
as a result of the quantum of provisions
taken on three specific accounts. The 
loan loss charge increased to £2.5 million
(2006: £1.0 million) and its loan loss ratio
rose to 2.2% (2006: 1.2%).
Welcome Finance does not write first
charge mortgages. Its second charge
secured loans are underwritten on the
same basis as an unsecured loan and the
focus is on assessing and verifying a
customer’s ability to repay rather than the
equity in their property. In Welcome
Finance’s experience, however, registering
a legal charge on the customer’s property
leads to the customer placing a higher
priority on meeting their loan repayments.
Welcome Finance’s loans and receivables
increased by 37.9% to £2.5 billion (2006:
£1.8 billion) at 31 December 2007, after
allowance for loan loss provisions.
The net interest margin earned by
Welcome Finance improved during 2007
to 19.8% (2006: 19.2%), and its loan loss
ratio was well within expectations and
target at 8.6% (2006: 7.4%) of receivables.
This arose from a change in the mix of the
business in the year and, in particular,
growth in its unsecured loan book which
delivers a higher interest yield.
Instalment arrears improved to 7.0% of
receivables (2006: 7.4%) and customer
balances in arrears remained stable at
29.2% (2006: 29.1%). This robust credit
quality is attributable to the business’ core
operating strengths: – its rigorous
approach to customer selection and
consistency of centralised underwriting,
its ability to establish and maintain close
relationships with customers through its
local branch network, and its ongoing
investment in its collections processes.

Welcome Car Finance remains the Group’s
largest introducer of hire purchase
customers. It increased its total unit sales
for the year by 53.0% to 13,763 (2006:

its performance were strong management

Cattles also worked with the Association
of British Credit Unions to highlight the
impact of financial exclusion on the
poorest in society and to promote
solutions to this problem.
Furthermore, the Group began a
long-term collaborative project with Credit
Action to distribute over 500,000 copies a
year of its ‘Moneymanual’ to improve the
financial awareness and money
management skills of young adults
entering university, and to research their
attitudes toward money management. 
• Being a good people business
Having the right people, with the right
skills and high levels of commitment, is
essential to the success of the Group. In
addition, contributing to the well-being of
the communities served by the Group
encourages customers to view the
business more positively and helps the
attraction and retention of good recruits.
The Group’s priorities are to develop
colleagues to maximise their talent and
equip them to address the business’ needs,
attract and retain the best people, recognise
and reward colleagues’ achievements,
create a working environment where
colleagues feel safe and valued, promote
effective communications, invest in the
communities where customers and
colleagues live and work, and encourage
colleague involvement in community
activities.
In 2007, the number of people working 
for the Group increased significantly to
5,008 (2006: 4,449). Colleague turnover
improved to 30.5% (2006: 33.1%),
supported by improved recruitment
and rewards, a strong training and
development culture, and effective two-
way communication across the business.
Participation in the Group’s annual
colleague attitude survey increased again
to 87% (2006: 84%) and, overall, 82% of
respondents gave positive answers to the
survey’s questions.
During 2007 the Group increased the
amount of training to enhance colleagues’
skills, introduce them to new systems and
processes, and enable them to meet
regulatory requirements. Over 16,000
(2006: 5,300) days training, equal to more
than three days for each colleague, were
delivered in the year. Even excluding the
training on Welcome Finance’s new CRM
system, the total was 9,575 days.
The Group’s benefits and rewards
programme won two awards in 2007: Best
Employer Benefits Communications
Award at the DWF Employer Awards and
Most Effective Benefits Programme at the
HR Excellence Awards.
The Group also invested £0.6 million
(2006: £0.7 million) in community
activities and initiatives. This includes
financial donations and the value of
donations of time. It equates to 0.4% of
pre-tax profits. Colleagues undertook
2,644 hours of volunteering (2006: 2,059),
a significant increase of 28.4%.
• Being environmentally responsible
Cattles believes it has a duty to manage its
impact on the environment and minimise
it wherever possible. The Group’s priorities
are to increase awareness of environmental
issues in the business, focus on high impact
areas, operate in an environmentally
efficient way, and improve its
environmental performance in order to
generate tangible business benefits.
In 2007, company car fuel consumption
decreased by 11%. In the Group’s list of
company cars available to colleagues,
hybrid cars were included for the first
time. During the year a teleconferencing
system to help reduce business travel was
also introduced.
Where the Group is able to measure
energy consumption 4.9 million kWh 
of electricity was used in the year –
unchanged from 2006, despite significant
growth in the business. This was equal 
to 2.7kg of CO2 per £1,000 of revenue. 
The Group is working to identify further
ways to reduce energy use.
Although in absolute terms the Group’s
use of paper increased by 10% during
2007, paper use per £1,000 of revenue
improved by 17% reflecting the more
efficient use of paper within the business.
The planned introduction of handheld
mobile technology in Shopacheck will
reduce paper use by over 16 million sheets
a year.
In 2007, the Group generated 1,077
tonnes of waste (2006: 927 tonnes). This
16% increase is considered largely due to
improved data collection. Almost half
(47%) of this waste was recycled.
The year ahead
The Group believes that further significant
progress in improving its reputation for CR
across all target audiences has been made
during 2007. In 2008, the main focus will
be to continue integrating the CR strategy
into the operational thinking of each of
the businesses.
Further information on the Group’s
approach to CR, its performance in 2007
and the plans for 2008 can be found in the
separate Corporate Responsibility Review
2007, published with this Annual Report
and available on the Group’s website,
www.cattles.co.uk.

As outlined on page 15 the Group’s
Corporate Responsibility (CR) strategy is
based on three cornerstones:
• Being a responsible financial services
organisation;
• Being a good people business; and
• Being environmentally responsible.
The Group continues to embed CR
thinking into its operational activities. In
2007, 24 CR roadshows were run across
the business to explain to colleagues how
they can apply the cornerstones in their
working roles. 
• Being a responsible financial services
organisation
As a non-standard lender Cattles faces
increasing scrutiny from stakeholders. The
Group must be seen to operate responsibly:
its success and reputation depend on
treating customers fairly and with respect.
The Group’s priorities are to maintain high
operational standards, meet regulatory
obligations, engage and influence
policymakers, ensure excellent customer
service and promote financial education.
During the year WFS established a
Customer Experience Group to support
the delivery of excellent customer service.

In order to allow a greater level of
comparability with other organisations in
the banking and financial services sector,
the Group has adopted a more
standardised banking style format to the
Group Income Statement for 2007. The
Group has also taken the opportunity to
provide an enhanced level of disclosure by
reporting two typical banking key
performance indicators (KPIs): net interest
margin and return on equity. Additionally,
a previously reported KPI, cost income
ratio, has been redefined in order to more
accurately reflect the new style Income
Statement and to enable the cost income
ratio to be more comparable in the Group’s
sector. Where appropriate, the previous
ratio has been provided for continuity.
Definitions used for each of the principal
KPIs used by the Group are provided in the
table on page 40.
T otal income grew by 32.7% in the year 
to £822.2 million (2006: £619.6 million),
resulting mainly from a continuation 
of the strong volumes and receivables
growth seen in Welcome Finance from 
the second half of 2006. This trend was
directly a consequence of the success 
of the CRM system, implemented in
mid-2006, enabling the business to
respond to an increasingly buoyant
demand and to match appropriate
products to individuals’ creditworthiness
and ability to repay. 2007 benefited from a
full year’s impact of these developments. 
Net interest income rose 31.3% to £567.4
million (2006: £432.3 million), driven
mainly by a 35.1% increase in the closing
receivables book and a stable average cost
of borrowing.
Non-interest income increased by 36.0% 
to £254.8 million (2006: £187.3 million).
This was largely due to revenue from the
sale of motor vehicles by the Group’s car
retail operation, Welcome Car Finance
(WCF), increasing by over 75% to £105.4
million.
Purchase of goods, primarily relating to the
cost of vehicles sold by WCF increased by
52.3% to £68.0 million (2006: £44.6 million).
The growing Welcome Finance receivables
book, together with a change in product
mix towards unsecured lending, was
reflected in an increase in the loan 
loss charge (including the gross-up
adjustment) to £296.9 million 
(2006: £191.4 million).
Similarly reflecting the larger book, 
and appropriate management of it,
operating expenses, including staff costs,
at £292.1 million, increased by 16.2%
(2006: £251.4 million).
Profit before tax, therefore, rose 24.9% 
to £165.2 million (2006: £132.2 million). As
a result, basic earnings per share increased 
by 15.3% to 32.30p (2006: 28.01p), based
on an effective tax rate of 30.6% 
(2006: 30.6%).
Return on equity (RoE), at 21.8% (2006:
24.0%), reflects the £128.9 million share
placing in March 2007, which increased
average shareholders’ funds in the year by
over 20%. If both 2007 and 2006 are
adjusted as if the additional equity had
been in place throughout the year, the
adjusted RoE, at 20.1% (2006: 19.0%),
shows an underlying improvement of over
one percentage point.
In view of the Group’s strong performance,
the Board has recommended a final
dividend of 13.10p per share. T ogether
with the interim dividend of 6.20p per
share, this gives a total dividend for the
year of 19.30p (2006: 17.50p) – an increase
of 10.3% over the previous year. Dividend
cover remains stable at around 1.7 times.

Welcome Finance again performed
strongly in 2007, with very good volume
growth, particularly in unsecured and 
hire purchase lending, and total customer
growth of 25.7%. Loan volumes in the first
half increased by 52.4% to £658.8 million
(H1 2006: £432.1 million) and the 
trend was maintained into the second 
half, delivering some £749.8 million 
(H2 2006: £556.2 million) of new business,
a 34.9% increase and, hence, a year-on-
year improvement of almost 43%. Interest
income rose accordingly by 33.6% in the
year to £568.9 million, driven principally 
by the growth in new business volumes
over the previous 18 months.
Interest income from the Group’s 
weekly home collected credit business,
Shopacheck, increased to £97.9 million
(2006: £83.4 million) despite the
continuing disengagement from
uneconomic sectors of the market
and the resultant reduction in the
receivables book.
In Lewis, the Group’s debt recovery
business, interest income rose by over 
80% to £23.5 million (2006: £13.0 million)
as a result of a 46.0% increase in
purchased debt portfolios, which at
31 December 2007 amounted to 
£132.9 million (2006: £91.0 million).

A 53% growth in unit sales volumes at
WCF, together with an improvement in 
the quality of cars sold, resulted in a 52.3%
increase in the cost of purchasing goods 
to £68.0 million.
L Lo oa an n  l lo os ss s  c ch ha ar rg ge e  See Fig 4
The Welcome Finance loan loss charge
increased by £83.8 million in the year and, as
a result, the loan loss ratio also increased,
as expected, to 8.6% (2006: 7.4%). As
previously reported, the Group anticipated
that the ratio would return to a level
within the established target range of 
8-9% during 2007, following the
significant uplift in new business volumes
and, hence, the receivables book during
the final quarter of 2006, which had the
effect of diluting the ratio at that time.
Notwithstanding the distortive impact of
the new business volumes achieved in the
final quarter of 2006 on the comparative
December 2006 ratio, the increase in the
2007 ratio also reflects the changed mix of
business this year towards unsecured
lending, which has a higher bad debt
incidence. However, this is reflected in the
product pricing, ensuring that unsecured
personal loans yield a higher interest
income margin.
Shopacheck’s loan loss charge, at
£22.3 million, remained stable
year-on-year, although with a gradually
reducing book the loan loss ratio increased
slightly from 15.0% last year to 17.0%.
However, at less than 4% of the Group’s
receivables book, the weekly home
collected credit loan loss performance has
little impact on the overall loan loss ratio
for WFS, which at 8.9% (excluding the
gross-up adjustment) was up on last year,
but remained within the expected range.
The loan loss charge (excluding the
gross-up adjustment) at CIF, at £2.2 million
(2006: £1.0 million), increased following a
decision to provide specifically for three
relatively large accounts. This caused the
loan loss ratio to rise disproportionately
from 1.2% to 2.2%.
The Group’s accounting policy in relation 
to loan loss provisioning is set out in the
notes to the accounts on pages 76 and 77.
Application of this policy is subject to the
estimation of future cash flows associated
with impaired loans as described in note 2
on page 80.
CIF generated a 44.8% increase in interest
income from £5.7 million to £8.3 million,
driven by a 11.4% increase in its client base
and a 23.9% increase in receivables.
Interest income (before interest expense)
for the Group as a whole, therefore, 
at £700.0 million, rose by 32.1% 
(2006: £529.9 million).
Net interest income (after deducting
£132.6 million interest expense) for the
Group, at £567.4 million, increased by 31.3%
from £432.3 million last year. The average
level of net receivables, at £2.5 billion
(2006: £1.9 billion), also grew by around
one third and, hence, the Group’s net
interest margin remained stable at 23.2%
(2006: 23.3%). This newly introduced
measure of the Group’s gross operating
margin generated from interest earning
assets reflects mainly the stability in 
the pricing of new business written by
Welcome Finance together with a slight
business mix change away from high
yielding home collected credit
(Shopacheck) to relatively lower yielding
debt purchase (Lewis). See Fig 3
The stability in margin was also supported
by the Group’s average cost of borrowing
being maintained at just below 7%. 
N No on n- -i in nt te er re es st t i in nc co om me e  See Fig 2 on page 35
Fee and related income, at £125.9 million
(2006: £103.9 million) increased by 21.2%
due principally to commission earnings on
general insurance products sold to the
Welcome Finance customer base including
for example, life and family health cover
and warranties on cars financed through
hire purchase credit facilities.
Revenue from sale of goods rose by 65.1%
to £110.5 million (2006: £66.9 million)
primarily as a result of the 75.8% increase
in revenue from the sale of vehicles by WCF
to £105.4 million (2006: £60.0 million). 
This increased level of sales was achieved
from a network of 12 sites (2006: 11). This
strong performance in like-for-like sales
reflects a very strong management focus,
close working with Welcome Finance
colleagues to allow in-house finance to 
be available for prospective customers 
and a substantial step-up in nationwide
marketing.
Commission earned by Lewis for collecting
other lenders’ debt and providing
investigation services, at £8.4 million
(2006: £8.2 million), remained flat as 
the business concentrated its resources in
the rapidly expanding and more profitable
purchased debt market.
The Group’s accounting policies relating 
to revenue recognition are set out in the
notes to the accounts on pages 75 and 76.

Tight control of costs remains a high
priority and total operating expenses,
including staff costs, accordingly, increased
by £40.7 million or 16.2% – less than half
the year-on-year percentage increase in
both income and receivables. As a result,
the Group cost income ratio continued 
to improve, falling to 31.4% (2006: 35.5%).
This redefined KPI measures the Group’s
overhead cost efficiency in relation to
lending income, net of interest expense,
and exclusive of car retail activity. The
previously reported cost income ratio,
which included both lending and car retail
activity and was based on total income
before interest expense, shows a similar
four percentage point improvement from
29.7% to 25.7%. The Group continues to
look for opportunities to improve
efficiency while maintaining the
investment necessary to support the
infrastructure required for its planned
growth.
Staff costs were 16.4% higher in 2007,
rising from £124.8 million to £145.3
million. The average monthly number of
people employed by the Group during the
year was 4,719 compared to 4,337 during
2006, an increase of 8.8%. A net 559
additional colleagues joined the Group in
the year, most of whom were recruited to
support the growth in customer numbers
and receivables at Welcome Finance.
Recruitment costs rose accordingly by
almost 50%.
General overheads increased by £16.0
million from £64.0 million to £80.0 million.
This cost category included year-on-year
increases for such items as secured loan
property valuations and credit referencing
costs (£2 million), other WCF vehicle cost
of sales (£6 million) and general
administrative overheads including legal
and professional fees (£3 million), IT costs
(£2 million) and, as referred to above,
higher recruitment costs (£1 million).
The planned reduction in Shopacheck led
directly to a 6.7% decrease in commission
paid to agents from £14.1 million in 2006
to £13.2 million.
B BA AL LA AN NC CE E  S SH HE EE ET T  See Fig 6
Net assets at the year-end stood at
£595.1 million (2006: £416.9 million) – an
increase of 42.7% on the previous year.
This was largely attributable to the growth
in the Group’s net receivables book of
£738.7 million (35.1%) to £2.8 billion, whilst
borrowings grew by £564.5 million (32.2%)
to £2.3 billion.  The £0.2 billion additional
investment in loan assets not funded 
by loan capital was funded by the issue 
of shares in March 2007 and the retention 
of post-dividend profits in the year.
A particular strength of the Group’s
balance sheet is its liquidity. The Group’s
current assets of £1.2 billion exceed
current liabilities by £976.4 million at the
end of 2007 (2006: £661.5 million). This
reflects the relatively short-term maturity
of much of the receivables book.
The increase in goodwill and intangibles of
£17.1 million (after amortisation) during
2007 is due entirely to further investments
made in IT systems during the year. The
investment is being amortised over a
period of seven years. Investment in IT for
2008 is expected to be around £22 million.
Investment in property, plant and
equipment during 2007 totalled 
£7.0 million (2006: £4.5 million), with 
2008 investment expected to be around
£3 million.
Other assets of £121.1 million at
31 December 2007 were £8.4 million
higher than 2006. The main reasons for 
this were an increase in bank deposits 
and other cash balances of £15.7 million,
together with increased vehicle stock of
£5.4 million, offset by a £6.2 million
reduction in insurance profit share
receivable and a £4.4 million reduction 
in deferred tax assets.
The reduction in the retirement benefit
obligation from £23.8 million to 
£14.1 million was due in equal measure 
to an improved performance of the
pension fund’s assets and a reduction 
in the value of the fund’s liabilities, driven
by an increase in corporate bond yields
(discount rate).
Other liabilities of £156.4 million at
31 December 2007 were £30.6 million
higher than 2006.  The main reasons for 
this were an £8.8 million decrease in the
fair value of some interest rate swaps, 
a £15.5 million increase in trade and other
payables and a £6.7 million increase in
current tax liabilities.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Financial Review continued
The Group has adopted IFRS 7 ‘Financial
instruments: Disclosures’ this year and
therefore provides various additional
disclosures on the management of risk,
including credit risk, in the notes to the
accounts on pages 93 to 97.
The IFRS 7 basis of arrears measurement
calculates the total value of loans with
contractual payments overdue at the
balance sheet date as a percentage of
closing customer balances. The resulting
overall level of arrears debt (both past due
and impaired debt) has similarly remained
consistent over the period at around 29%
of the book. More specifically, the growth
in the proportion of debt classified as ‘past
due but not impaired’ from 11.9% at
December 2006 to 14.9% at December
2007 reflects the introduction of Local
Management Branches (LMBs) in early
2006 in Welcome Finance. LMBs manage
accounts transferred from the main
Operational Branches once a customer has
missed two payments. LMB staff specialise
in working with customers to enable them
to resume regular monthly payments.
Specifically, the increase in the value of
debt in this category reflects the LMBs’
dedicated skilled collectors, processes 
and specific performance targets to 
focus on maximising cash collections 
and thus minimising the amount of debt
reaching the impairment point. This 
can be seen in the proportion of the debt
classified as ‘impaired’ falling to 14.3% 
at December 2007 (2006: 17.2%).

Group net loans and receivables increased
by 35.1% over the year from £2.1 billion to
£2.8 billion.
Welcome Finance, which accounts for
around 88% of Group receivables, made
further good progress with an increase of
37.9% to £2.5 billion (2006: £1.8 billion).
This was driven by a 25.7% growth in
customers, a 42.5% uplift in volumes
written and a modest uplift in the average
balance from £5,200 to £5,500.
Shopacheck reduced its book by almost
11% to £101.3 million (2006: £113.7
million) to less than 4% of Group
receivables, as the Group maintained its
strategy of disengaging from customers
that are considered uneconomic to serve.
Lewis grew its purchased debt book in the
year by 46.0% from £91.0 million to £132.9
million, reflecting the ongoing investment
in forward flow debt from existing
contracts and substantial additional
purchases of new debt portfolios. Debt
purchases in 2007 totalled £74.3 million
(2006: £69.5 million), including
increasingly better quality portfolios from
mainstream lenders.
CIF grew its receivables by 23.9% from
£80.2 million to £99.4 million in the year,
reflecting an 11.4% increase in client
numbers and a 28.4% increase in the value
of clients’ invoices factored.
C Cr re ed di it t q qu ua al li it ty y  See Fig 8
Our long-established measure used to
track instalment arrears in Welcome
Finance remained broadly stable during
the year, closing at 7.0% (2006: 7.4%). This
KPI measures the value of contractual
payments overdue at the balance sheet
date as a percentage of closing customer
balances. The stability reflected in this
traditional arrears measure is directly
attributable to Welcome Finance’s
rigorous approach to customer selection
and the consistency in its centralised
underwriting, the maintaining of close
relationships with customers through its
local branch network and the ongoing
investment in its collections process.

As a consequence of the equity placing,
the Group’s gearing ratio of borrowings 
to tangible net assets has reduced 
to 4.6 times at 31 December 2007 
(2006: 5.1 times), remaining comfortably 
within the covenant limit of six times.
The other key funding covenant, interest
cover, stands at 2.3 times for 2007 (2006:
2.3 times), against a minimum covenant
requirement of 1.75 times.
The Group’s credit rating remains BBB.
C Ca as sh h  f fl lo ow w  See Fig 10
The Group’s net operating cash outflow
during 2007 was £537.4 million, an
increase of £161.2 million (42.8%) on 
the previous year. This principally reflects
the additional investment in loans and
receivables of £738.7 million (35.1%)
during the year.
H He ea ad dr ro oo om m  See Fig 11
The Group maintains a mixture of long-
term and short-term committed facilities
that are designed to ensure that the Group
has sufficient available funds for current
operations and planned growth. The
Group had bank facilities of £1.6 billion 
at the end of 2007 and headroom of £226
million (2006: £1.4 billion of facilities and
£349 million of headroom respectively).
M Ma at tu ur ri it ty y  o of f  b ba an nk k  f fa ac ci il li it ti ie es s  See Fig 12
The average maturity of the Group’s total
borrowing facilities is around five years,
which gives a strong funding position,
with only a US $40 million tranche of
private placing funding maturing in 2008.
In comparison, the average maturity 
of the receivables book is shorter, at
approximately three years, highlighting
the Group’s conservative approach to
funding and liquidity.
B Bo or rr ro ow wi in ng gs s  See Fig 9
The Group continues to use the bank,
public bond and private placement
markets as its principal existing sources 
of funding. T otal borrowings increased 
by £564.5 million during the year 
to £2.3 billion at 31 December 2007.
In July 2007, the Group completed a new
£400 million 10-year sterling bond issue 
at a fixed coupon of 7.125%. This was
followed in December by an additional
£150 million unsecured bilateral bank
facility for a period of up to 18 months,
priced at approximately 25bps above the
Group’s existing average cost of bank
funding.
Also in December, the Group repaid a
maturing £125 million bond which had
carried a coupon of 8.625%.
In addition to these new borrowing
facilities, additional equity funding was
raised by the Group in March 2007 from
the successful placing of 32,978,986 new
ordinary shares, resulting in gross
proceeds of £133 million. These shares
were admitted to listing on the London
Stock Exchange on 20 March 2007.
The Group was delighted with the strong
support received from bank, bond and
equity supporters, particularly in the
context of the difficult market conditions
experienced in recent months.

Financial Review continued
The £800 million syndicated bank facility
established in 2006 contained an option
for the Company to request an extension
of the initial five-year term, for a further 
12 months, on both its first and second
anniversaries. This request was made 
on the first anniversary in 2007, and
agreement to the 12-month extension 
was received from banks representing
£785 million of the total facility.
C Co os st t o of f  b bo or rr ro ow wi in ng gs s
Funding received from banks and other
providers is a mixture of fixed rate and
floating rate facilities. At 31 December 2007,
around 85% of the Group’s borrowings
were protected against future interest
rate volatility for an average period of
approximately five and a half years (2006:
four and a half years), either through fixed
rate borrowing or by using interest rate
swaps to protect floating rate borrowings.
Further details of the Group’s interest rate
risk management policy are set out in the
section entitled ‘Interest rate risk’on page 22
of the Operating and Financial Review .
As a result of the proactive and consistently
applied hedging strategy, the Group’s
average cost of borrowings remained
stable throughout 2007, with an average
cost for the year of 6.86% (2006: 6.79%).

The Group’s 24.9% increase in profit before
tax to £165.2 million (2006: £132.2
million) can be analysed by operating
segment as follows:
The consumer credit division incorporating
the businesses of Welcome Finance,
Shopacheck, Welcome Car Finance,
Welcome Mortgages (prior to its closure 
at the end of 2007) and Progressive
Insurance contributed £164.8 million
(2006: £136.1 million) to the Group’s 
profit before tax. This represented a
combined growth of 21.0% with most
of the year-on-year improvement coming
from Welcome Finance.
The debt recovery division, comprising
Lewis, contributed £10.2 million (2006:
£4.9 million) to the Group’s profit before
tax, representing growth in excess of
100%. The main driver was increasing
investment in the purchased debt market
coupled with a continuing successful
collections strategy.
The corporate services division, 
comprising CIF, contributed £2.5 million
(2006: £2.7 million, before a £0.8 million
residual profit on disposal) to the Group’s
profit before tax, representing a reduction
of 6.9%. This was due to an exceptional
increase in CIF’s loan loss charge as
described earlier on page 36.
Central expenses remained flat at £12.3
million (2006: £12.3 million).

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
For the year ended 31 December 2007
The Board of Cattles plc aims to maintain the highest standards
of corporate governance in the belief that such standards are
essential to the process of delivering long-term growth in profits
and dividends. Throughout the year ended 31 December 2007, the
Company complied with the provisions of the 2006 FRC Combined
Code on Corporate Governance, except that in September 2007
the Company did not comply with Code provision A.3.2 (which
provides that at least half the Board, excluding the Chairman,
should comprise independent non-executive directors) because
during that month there were four independent non-executive
directors and five executive directors after D J Postings was
appointed as an executive director on 1 September 2007 
before becoming the Chief Executive on 1 October 2007 
following S P Mahon’s retirement.

• Approval of the Group’s overall business strategy, planning and
annual budgets;
• Assessment of internal controls and risk management;
• Senior management appointments;
• Approval of major contracts and significant acquisitions;
• Investment and capital expenditure decisions;
• Corporate governance practices; and
• Approval of the Group’s financing and dividend policies.

comparison of trading performance to date against the annual
budget and any other financial plan which has been previously
approved by the Board for that year. Each Board member receives a
comprehensive Board pack prior to each meeting, which incorporates
a formal agenda, separate reports from the Chief Executive and each

The Board considers all its other non-executive directors 
to be independent in character and judgement. No independent
non-executive director:
• Has been an employee of the Group within the last five years;
• Has, or has had within the last three years, a material business
relationship with the Group;
• Receives remuneration other than a director’s fee from the Group;
• Has close family ties with any of the Group’s advisers, directors
or senior employees;
• Holds cross-directorships or has significant links with other
directors through involvement in other companies or bodies;
• Represents a significant shareholder; or
• Has served on the Board for more than nine years.
D A Haxby will have served as a non-executive director for nine
years on 1 July 2008, but the other directors have determined
that in spite of this he will continue to be considered to be an
independent non-executive director because he continues to be
independent in character and judgement and none of the other
relationships or circumstances set out in provision A.3.1 of the
2006 FRC Combined Code on Corporate Governance apply to him.
meeting. Board papers are usually sent out one week before the
meeting to give the directors sufficient time to prepare for a
comprehensive review of the relevant issues at the meeting.
The Board has delegated the following responsibilities to the
executive directors:
• The development and recommendation of strategic plans for
consideration by the Board that reflect the longer-term
objectives and priorities established by the Board;
• Implementation of the strategies and policies of the Group as
determined by the Board;
• Monitoring of operating and financial results against plans 
and budgets;
• Monitoring the quality of the investment process against
objectives;
• Prioritising the allocation of capital, technical and human
resources; and
• Developing and implementing risk management systems.

The division of responsibilities between the non-executive
Chairman of the Board, N N Broadhurst, and the Chief Executive,
D J Postings, is clearly defined in writing and has been approved
by the Board.
The Chairman leads the Board in the determination of its strategy
and in the achievement of its objectives. The Chairman is
responsible for organising the business of the Board, ensuring its
effectiveness and setting its agenda. The Chairman has no
involvement in the day-to-day business of the Group.
The Chief Executive has direct charge of the Group on a day-to-
day basis and is accountable to the Board for the financial and
operational performance of the Group.

The Board currently comprises the Chairman, four executive
directors and four independent non-executive directors – see Fig 1.
The names of the directors together with their biographical
details are set out on pages 42 and 43 and Fig 2 shows the length
of tenure of the directors. All the directors served throughout the
period under review, except for D J Postings who was appointed
on 1 September 2007. The Board includes independent non-
executive directors who constructively challenge and help
develop proposals on strategy, and bring strong, independent
judgement, knowledge, and experience to the Board’s
deliberations. The independent directors are of sufficient calibre
and number that their views carry significant weight in the
Board’s decision making.
Independent professional advice is provided at the Company’s
expense, when the directors deem it necessary in order for them
to carry out their responsibilities.
Details of the Chairman’s professional commitments are included
in the Chairman’s biography. The Chairman holds the
chairmanship of one other listed company and one private
company and two other non-executive directorships, but the
Board is satisfied that these do not interfere with the
performance of his duties to the Company which are based
around a commitment of approximately 80 days per annum.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
For the year ended 31 December 2007 continued
Individual written personal objectives in relation to their
management roles are prepared at the beginning of the financial
year by each executive director. After agreement with the Chief
Executive, and in the case of the Chief Executive with the
Chairman, these objectives are submitted to the Remuneration
Committee for consideration and approval on behalf of the Board.
The Chief Executive conducts an annual appraisal of the
performance of the other executive directors which includes an
assessment of their individual performance against their
personal objectives and a formal interview. The same process is
conducted by the Chairman in respect of the Chief Executive. The
extent to which executive directors’ personal objectives have
been achieved is determined during this review process, the
results of which are submitted to, and taken into account by, the
Remuneration Committee in finalising the executive directors’
bonuses for the year.

Subject to the Company’s Articles of Association, the Companies
Acts and satisfactory performance evaluation, non-executive
directors are appointed for an initial period of three years, but
may be invited to serve one or two additional three year terms 
if the Nomination Committee believes this to be appropriate. 
The re-appointment of directors who have served for more 
than nine years is subject to annual review and re-election by 
the shareholders.

The Company Secretary is responsible for advising the Board
through the Chairman on all governance matters. The directors
have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.
The Company’s Articles of Association and the schedule of
matters reserved to the Board for decision provide that the
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter for the full Board.

The Board has established three standing Committees, each 
with formal terms of reference, being the Audit Committee, the
Remuneration Committee and the Nomination Committee. 
The terms of reference are published on the Company’s website,

On appointment, the directors take part in an induction
programme when they receive information about the Group, 
the role of the Board and the matters reserved for its decision, 
the terms of reference and membership of the principal Board
Committees, together with the powers delegated to those
Committees, the Group’s corporate governance practices and
procedures, and the latest financial information about the Group.
This is supplemented by visits to key locations and meetings 
with key senior executives. Throughout their period in office 
the directors are continually updated on the Group’s business, 
the competitive, legal and regulatory environment in which it
operates and other changes affecting the Group and the financial
services industry by written briefings and Board presentations by
senior executives. Directors are also updated on changes to their
legal and other duties and obligations as directors of a listed
company. At the November 2007 Board meeting the Company’s
legal advisers, Walker Morris, provided training to the directors 
on directors’ duties and derivative actions under the Companies
Act 2006.
P PE ER RF FO OR RM MA AN NC CE E  E EV VA AL LU UA AT TI IO ON N
The Board has established a formal process led by the Chairman
for the annual evaluation of the performance of the Board, its
principal Committees and the individual directors, with particular
attention being paid to those who are due for re-appointment.
The directors are made aware, on appointment, that their
performance will be subject to an evaluation.
In 2006, the directors completed a questionnaire which was
circulated by the Company Secretary and was designed to gain an
insight into how well the Board and its Committees were
meeting their objectives. The questionnaire included the former
Chairman’s summary of progress made during 2005 against the
matters identified for attention in the 2004 self-evaluation
process and asked the directors to state whether or not those
matters had been addressed. The Company Secretary then
collated the completed results from the questionnaires and
presented the consolidated results to the Chairman.
In 2007, the directors reviewed the consolidated results of the
2006 self-evaluation questionnaires and agreed that good
progress had been made in the various areas identified during the
2006 self-evaluation exercise. They also identified specific
matters where action would be taken during 2008.
The Chairman conducts the annual appraisals of the four
executive directors and the four non-executive directors in
relation to their duties as directors of the Company. These
appraisals are conducted in separate meetings between the
Chairman and each director, at which the director’s contribution
to Board proceedings is reviewed and the director’s views on his
or her own performance and the operation of the Board identified
in the self-evaluation exercise are discussed. The Chairman
reports to the Board on any issues requiring Board consideration.
Led by the Senior Independent Director, the non-executive
directors meet annually, without the presence of the Chairman,
to conduct a performance evaluation of the Chairman. The Senior
Independent Director subsequently has a meeting with the
Chairman on a similar basis as the Chairman’s meeting with 
each director. 47

The Board maintains a close relationship with the Company’s
major shareholders. The Chief Executive, Finance Director,
Treasury & Risk Director and Chief Operating Officer maintain
regular contact with major institutional shareholders, who are
offered a personal meeting with the Chief Executive and other
executive directors at least twice each year. The Chairman usually
attends the presentations to analysts of the Company’s Interim
and Final Results and all major shareholders are offered a
personal meeting with the Chairman and Senior Independent
Director, if they so require. Major shareholders are also given 
the opportunity to meet new non-executive directors on their
appointment and to provide non-attributed feedback to the
Board through discussions with the Company’s stockbrokers,
HSBC Bank plc and CitiGroup Global Markets Limited.
As required by the Combined Code, the Chairman relays 
to the Board any issues raised with him by shareholders. This is
supplemented by a report by the Chief Executive of shareholders’
views following the presentations of the Interim and Final
Results. The directors also receive reports from the Company’s
advisers on the market’s views of the Company both before and
after the announcement of the Interim and Final Results and
copies of analysts’ reports.
The Annual General Meeting is seen as an opportunity to
communicate with other shareholders and all directors are
expected to attend. The Chief Executive gives a presentation to
shareholders at the Annual General Meeting on the Group’s
results for the previous year. All shareholders have the
opportunity to put questions at the Annual General Meeting.
In addition to regular financial reporting, significant matters
relating to the trading or development of the Group are
disseminated to the market by way of Stock Exchange
announcements. The Company’s website, www.cattles.co.uk,
includes a section focusing specifically on investor relations. All
such announcements are accessible on the website once made.
In addition, the materials used in the presentations to analysts of
the Company’s Interim and Final Results and the webcasts of
these presentations are also available on the website after the
presentations have been made.

The directors believe that the Annual Report and Financial
Statements presents a balanced and understandable assessment
of the Group’s financial position and prospects. The Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review and the Operating and
Financial Review, which can be found on pages 8 to 40, together
provide a detailed assessment of the Group’s affairs. The
directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements are
described in the Directors’ Report on page 66. The Company’s
financial statements are reviewed by the Audit Committee prior
to being submitted to the Board for approval.

Welcome Financial Services (WFS), the Company’s largest
subsidiary and the owner of Welcome Finance, Welcome Car
Finance and Shopacheck Financial Services, is regulated by 
the Financial Services Authority (FSA) in relation to general
insurance business.
In 2007, following discussions with the FSA about WFS’s
corporate governance arrangements, the Company and WFS
established the Welcome Financial Services Regulatory Oversight
Committee.
The purpose of the Welcome Financial Services Regulatory
Oversight Committee, as set out in its terms of reference, 
is to provide oversight to the operation of WFS, including:
• Providing an independent challenge and support to the 
WFS board on the development of its strategic and operational
plans, policies, procedures and budgets in the light of the
board’s regulatory responsibilities and, in particular, to ensure
that the risk of customer detriment, financial loss or
mismanagement is minimised;
• Providing an independent assessment of WFS’s compliance
with FSA regulation, guidance and principles, as well as other
legal and statutory obligations, with particular regard to any
customer detriment; and
• Agreeing actions and monitoring performance against these
actions, in order to ensure that any issues that may arise are
appropriately dealt with by the WFS board.
The Welcome Financial Services Regulatory Oversight Committee
comprises A J McWalter, one of the independent non-executive
directors of the Company, who chairs the Committee,
M W G Collins, the Treasury & Risk Director, the managing
director, risk and compliance director and sales and marketing
director of WFS and one other WFS director on a rotating basis.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Committee.
The Committee held its inaugural meeting in September and met
again in December 2007. The Committee will meet quarterly in
2008. The chairman of the Committee reports to the Board and
the WFS board on its proceedings and minutes of meetings are
circulated to the directors of both companies.
At its inaugural meeting in September 2007 the Committee
approved its terms of reference and reviewed a report from WFS’s
risk and compliance department, WFS’s risk register and risk
maps, a progress report on WFS’s Treating Customers Fairly (TCF)
project, a report on WFS’s insurance sales process and relevant
sections of the internal audit plan for 2007/8.
At its December meeting the Committee reviewed the
discussions with WFS’s FSA supervisor about five complaints in
relation to payment protection insurance and considered reports
on WFS’s compliance with FSA regulation, guidance and
principles, complaints handling procedures and TCF initiative.

For the year ended 31 December 2007 continued
The Group is continuing to develop its risk management
framework further to ensure that risk monitoring and reporting
is embedded at all levels of management and throughout all
areas of the Group’s operations.
• Arrangements by which employees of the Group may raise
concerns in confidence about possible improprieties in matters
of financial reporting or other matters, together with
arrangements for the proportionate and independent
investigation of such matters and for appropriate follow-up
action and reporting to the Board.
• Operation of a comprehensive planning and financial reporting
system, which covers income, expenditure, cash flows and
balance sheets. Annual budgets and medium-term plans are
approved by the Board and monitored against actual
performance on a monthly basis to identify any significant
deviation from approved plans. The annual budget is reviewed
and reforecast on a regular basis.
• Adoption of a schedule of matters specifically reserved for 
the approval of the Board ensuring that it maintains full 
and effective control over appropriate financial, strategic,
organisational and compliance issues. As described on 
page 44, the Board has identified a number of key areas, 
which are subject to regular reporting to the Board.
• The Board also reviews the role of insurance in managing risks
across the Group.

Under company law, the directors are required to consider
whether it is appropriate to prepare financial statements on the
basis that the Company and the Group are going concerns. As
part of its normal business practices, the Group prepares annual
budgets and longer-term financial and business plans. In
reviewing this information, the directors are satisfied that the
Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in
business for the foreseeable future. For this reason, the directors
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
Group’s financial statements.

The Board of directors has overall responsibility for the Group’s
internal control system, which is designed to safeguard
shareholders’ investment and the Company’s assets, and
embraces all risks faced by the Group, including business,
financial, operational and compliance risks. The directors
recognise, however, that there are inherent limitations in any
system of internal control and as such the controls can provide
only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
The Group has complied with the guidance provided by the
Financial Reporting Council in a document entitled ‘Internal
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code
(October 2005)’ (Turnbull guidance), through an ongoing process
to identify and evaluate key areas of risk, both financial and 
non-financial, the Group’s perceived tolerance or commercial
appetite towards such risks and the policies and procedures
which should be adopted in order to manage the likely exposure
and to review the operation and effectiveness of the Group’s
internal control system. This process, which has been in place
throughout the year and up to the date of approval of this Annual
Report, is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with the
Turnbull guidance.
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing the operation
and effectiveness of the internal control system on at least a six
monthly basis and reporting to the Board thereon. Such reviews
have been conducted during the financial year. The principal
features of the Group’s internal control system can be
summarised as follows:
• Primary responsibility of the Board to ensure that the major
business risks facing the Group are identified and that
appropriate policies are developed for the management of
those risks. The Board, however, recognises that the internal
control system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the
risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
• A clearly defined organisational structure with lines of
responsibility and delegation of authority to divisional
executive management supported by established policies and
procedures.
• The engagement of a leading firm of professional advisers for
the provision of a complete range of internal audit services,
with a direct reporting link to the Audit Committee.
• A Risk Management Group, comprising the executive directors
and other key members of senior management including risk
specialists, reviews key Group risks together with the
effectiveness of the Group’s controls to manage and reduce the
impact of these risks. This review includes the adoption of
procedures which are designed to capture and evaluate any
failings or weaknesses in the internal control system. The Risk
Management Group meets twice yearly and reports to the
Audit Committee.
• Delegation of the responsibility for ongoing maintenance of the
system of internal control procedures to the executive
management, with specifically designated Risk Champions for
all business areas and appropriate working parties. The system
ensures that successive assurances are provided to ascending
levels of management and changes in the risk profiles for all
business areas are monitored and reported on a monthly basis. 49

The chairman of the Committee, M A Young, qualified and
practised as a Chartered Accountant (ACA) and has significant,
relevant and up-to-date financial and accounting knowledge 
and experience. M A Young was previously chairman of the audit
committee of Uniq plc (2003 to 2007) and a managing director 
of Donaldson Lufkin & Jenrette and then Credit Suisse First
Boston (1997 to 2000) and a director of NatWest Markets

of the Committee have a wide range of business experience
which is evidenced in their biographical details on page 43.

The Committee normally meets three times a year and did so 
in 2007. All members of the Audit Committee attended each 
of the three meetings held in 2007, except for D A Haxby who
missed one meeting due to illness. Both the external auditors 
and internal auditors and the Finance Director and the Treasury

Chairman of the Board, the other executive directors, the WFS
managing director and the WFS risk and compliance director
usually attend meetings of the Committee at the invitation of the

Tax compliance involves dealing with the Group’s corporation tax
returns and this work is carried out by PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP . Tax advisory services include tax planning and structuring
advice for direct and indirect taxes. The Group’s policy is for each
individual assignment to be assessed separately and awarded
depending on which professional services firm is considered best
suited to perform the relevant work.
O Ot th he er r  n no on n- -a au ud di it t s se er rv vi ic ce es s
This category includes work relating to due diligence and other
non-regulatory reporting. The Group’s normal policy is to appoint
the external auditors to undertake this work because of their
knowledge and experience of the business. However, the Board
reviews their independence and expertise on every assignment.
In 2007 and 2006 this category included work in connection with
the possible offer for London Scottish Bank plc.
The external auditors are not permitted to provide internal audit,
risk management, litigation support, remuneration advice and
legal advice services. The provision of other non-audit services 
is awarded on a case-by-case basis, depending on which
professional services firm is considered best suited to perform
the work. In 2007 the external auditors provided advisory services
in relation to the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme, the
Group’s share-based payment awards and the Group’s response
to the Competition Commission’s inquiry into the payment
protection insurance market.
These safeguards, which are monitored by the Audit Committee,
are regularly reviewed and updated to ensure they remain
appropriate. The appointment of the external auditors to provide
non-audit services requires Board approval for any assignments
with fees above a set financial limit.
The external auditors report to the Audit Committee each year on
the actions they have taken to comply with professional and
regulatory requirements and best practice designed to ensure
their independence, including the rotation of key members of the
external audit team. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have formally
confirmed their independence to the Board, in respect of the
period covered by these financial statements.
The disclosure of the non-audit fees paid to the external auditors
during the year is included in note 10 to the financial statements,
on page 87.

The Committee discharges its duties as follows:
• At its meetings in February and August, the Committee reviews
the Company’s preliminary announcement and Annual Report
and Financial Statements and interim announcement
respectively. At each of these meetings the Committee receives
a report from the external auditors setting out any accounting
or judgemental issues which require its attention.
• A report from the internal auditors is reviewed at the meetings
in February, August and December. The Committee considers
the internal auditors’ work plan for the following year at its
December meeting. With effect from 1 July 2007, the
Committee appointed Deloitte & T ouche LLP (Deloitte) as the
Company’s internal auditors in place of KPMG, although KPMG
continue to perform the internal audit function in relation to
the Siebel information technology programme implementation
because Deloitte advise the Group on this.
• The Committee considers the external auditors’ pre-year end
issues report at its December meeting and their audit plan at
its August meeting.
• At its August and December meetings the Committee reviews
the reports of the Risk Management Group, which comprises
the executive directors and other key members of senior
management including risk specialists and considers the key
risks facing the Group and the effectiveness of the Group’s
internal controls to manage and reduce the impact of those risks.
• At its February and August meetings the Committee considers
the annual and half-yearly risk and compliance reports
produced by the Treasury & Risk Director in relation to the
preceding year and half-year respectively.
• The Committee reviews the fees paid to the external auditors
for audit and non-audit services at all its meetings and 
at its February meeting it assesses the external auditors’
independence and makes a recommendation to the Board 
as to the appointment or re-appointment of the auditors 
at the Annual General Meeting.

The main work undertaken by the Committee during 2007 was
the process which culminated in the recommendation to the
Board that D J Postings should succeed S P Mahon as Chief
Executive following his retirement on 30 September 2007.
In anticipation of S P Mahon’s likely retirement at some point
during 2007, in the autumn of 2006 members of the Committee
agreed a description of the role and capabilities required for the
next Chief Executive and appointed an external search
consultancy to assist with the recruitment process. The
consultants then reviewed the description of the role and the
required capabilities and drew up a list of potential candidates.
This list was then reviewed by members of the Committee so as
to create a definitive list of internal and external candidates.
Members of the Committee and the external search consultants
interviewed various candidates in January and February 2007 
and then re-interviewed the shortlisted candidates in the spring
of 2007. S P Mahon’s retirement later in 2007 was announced 
on 1 May 2007 and, following the Board’s acceptance of the
Committee’s recommendation, D J Postings’ appointment
as a director on 1 September 2007 and as Chief Executive on 
1 October 2007 was announced on 25 May 2007.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
For the year ended 31 December 2007
D DE EA AR R  S SH HA AR RE EH HO OL LD DE ER R
I am pleased to introduce this report after succeeding David
Haxby as chairman of the Remuneration Committee in December
2007. I would like to thank David Haxby for his leadership in
chairing the Committee for the last six years.
The Remuneration Committee continues to review the
Company’s remuneration policy as it applies to executive
directors and other senior executives to ensure that it remains
appropriate for both the Company and shareholders. Executive
remuneration packages are designed to attract, motivate and
retain directors and other senior executives of the high calibre
necessary to maintain the Group’s strong financial performance
which should enhance value to shareholders.
The key principles of this policy are:
• T o pay around median salaries, while taking account of
individual performance and responsibilities;
• T o ensure that a substantial proportion of the remuneration 
of the executive directors and other senior executives is
performance-related; and
• T o encourage share ownership. The executive directors have
share ownership guidelines, participate in share-based
long-term incentive plans and can be required to defer a
portion of their annual bonus into shares. In addition, every
employee in the Group with at least 12 months’ service has the
opportunity to become a shareholder in the Company through
the Sharesave Scheme and the Share Incentive Plan.
Significant issues addressed during the year were:
• The remuneration package awarded to David Postings 
on his joining the Company to succeed Seán Mahon as 
Chief Executive; and
• The making of exceptional LTIP Performance Awards to the
three continuing executive directors and of awards under 
the Management Share Plan to nine senior non-main Board
executives after the announcement of David Postings’
appointment and following specific overtures being made to
certain Cattles senior executives by a competitor organisation.
The Remuneration Committee is entirely comfortable that
the approaches adopted were very much in the interests of
shareholders as they ensure that the entire highly regarded
Cattles executive team continues to remain fully committed 
to the generation of sustained long-term returns to shareholders.
I am keen to encourage an ongoing dialogue with shareholders.
Accordingly, please feel free to contact me, either by writing to
me at the Company’s head office or by email to

arising from this report or remuneration issues generally.

Executive remuneration packages are designed to attract,
motivate and retain directors of the high calibre necessary to
maintain the Group’s strong financial performance which should
enhance value to shareholders. The performance measurement
of the executive directors and the determination of their annual
remuneration packages are undertaken by the Committee.
There are four main elements of the remuneration packages of
executive directors:
• Basic salary and benefits;
• Annual bonus;
• Long-term incentives; and
• Pension and life assurance arrangements.
The Company’s policy is that a substantial proportion of the
remuneration of the executive directors should be performance-
related. As described below, each of the executive directors may
participate in both an annual bonus scheme and long-term
incentive arrangements.
When determining remuneration levels for the executive directors,
consideration is given to pay levels elsewhere in the Group.
When determining remuneration policy, the Committee takes
into account all factors which it deems necessary, including 
the Company’s performance on environmental, social and
governance issues. The Committee has ensured that the incentive
structure for senior management does not raise environmental,
social and governance risks by inadvertently motivating
irresponsible behaviour.
Fees paid to the Chairman of the Board are determined by 
the Remuneration Committee (excluding the Chairman) in
consultation with the Chief Executive. Fees paid to non-executive
directors, other than the Chairman, are determined by 
a sub-committee of the Board comprising the Chairman 
of the Board, the Chief Executive and the Finance Director.

The basic salaries of the executive directors are determined by
the Remuneration Committee, prior to the beginning of each
year, taking into account the responsibilities and performance 
of the individual director and having regard to market practice as
advised by NBSC. The Committee’s policy is to pay basic salaries
around the median while (as stated above) taking account of the
responsibilities and performance of each director.
Following the Committee’s review in December 2007 applying
this policy, the Board agreed the following changes to the annual
salaries of the executive directors with effect from 1 January 2008:
1 January 1 January
2008 2007

D J Postings’ salary is stated from his appointment as a director on 1 September 2007.
In making these recommendations to the Board, the Committee
also took account of the Company’s continued delivery of high
levels of year-on-year earnings growth, a main driver of which has
been the exceptional performance and commitment of the
Company’s executive directors.
In addition to basic salary, the executive directors receive certain
benefits in kind, being a car and fuel provision (or a cash allowance),
private medical insurance and permanent health insurance.

The Chairman, N N Broadhurst, and three of the independent
non-executive directors, D A Haxby, F Dee and A J McWalter, have
been members of the Committee throughout 2007. D A Haxby
was chairman of the Committee until December 2007 when 
he was succeeded by F Dee. M A Young (also an independent
non-executive director) was appointed as a member of the
Committee in December 2007 after the last meeting of the year.
All members of the Remuneration Committee attended each of
the six meetings held in 2007, except for D A Haxby who missed
one meeting due to illness. None of the Committee members 
has any personal financial interest in the Company other than 
as a shareholder, nor have they any day-to-day involvement in 
the running of the business or conflicts of interests arising from
cross-directorships.
One of the main duties of the Committee is to determine the
remuneration of the executive directors, the Chairman and the
Company Secretary and to monitor the level and structure of
remuneration for specified senior managers below Board level.
The Committee’s terms of reference, which can be found on the
Company’s website, are reviewed annually by the Committee and
any changes are approved by the Board.
The Committee has appointed New Bridge Street Consultants LLP
(NBSC) as its remuneration consultants. NBSC has no other
connection with the Company. NBSC advises the Committee
directly on matters within the Committee’s terms of reference on
which the Committee chooses to consult NBSC. NBSC may also
advise the Company generally on aspects of executive and
employee remuneration, typically on the implementation and
ongoing operation of executive remuneration schemes. NBSC
advises a sub-committee of the Board from time to time on the
remuneration of the non-executive directors, other than the
Chairman.
The Chairman does not participate in any discussions relating 
to his own remuneration and absents himself from the meeting
when his own remuneration is being considered. The Chief
Executive and the Treasury & Risk Director are consulted by 
the Committee but do not participate in any discussions relating
to their own remuneration.

Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2007
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
For the year ended 31 December 2007 continued
exercised in 2006 when awards of Performance Shares worth
115% of basic salary were made to the executive directors for the
reasons set out in last year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.
In September 2007, the Committee (after careful consideration
and fully mindful of the interests of shareholders) also decided 
to exercise the flexibility afforded to it under this provision and
made an Award of Performance Shares to D J Postings worth
200% of his basic salary. The Committee believes that this
approach was entirely appropriate because, in addition to his
‘normal’ 100% Performance Award, the extra 100% was required
to compensate D J Postings for the long-term incentive plan
awards and executive share option grants which lapsed when 
he left Lloyds TSB Bank plc to join the Company. The Committee
considered that the grant of performance-linked share-based
incentives of a value that took due account of the value of the
awards D J Postings was foregoing by joining Cattles was a 
more appropriate way to provide such compensation than an
unconditional cash payment.
In April 2007, ‘normal’ 100% Performance Awards were made to
M W G Collins, J J Corr and I S Cummine. However, following this
grant the Committee became aware that specific overtures had
been made to certain Cattles senior executives by a competitor
organisation. In addition, during meetings with the Company in
connection with the appointment of D J Postings, a number of
the Company’s major shareholders made it clear that they viewed
the retention of the Cattles’ senior executive team as crucial to
the Company’s continued success.
Therefore, in June 2007 the Committee (again after careful
consideration and fully mindful of the interests of shareholders)
decided to make additional Awards of Performance Shares to
M W G Collins, J J Corr and I S Cummine worth a further 100% of
basic salary. The Committee believes that this approach was
entirely appropriate and very much in the interests of
shareholders.
As described below, the Awards made in 2007 were subject to
more demanding (in absolute terms) real EPS growth targets
than those applied to Awards in 2006.
Awards of Matching Shares are granted to the extent that
participants acquire Cattles plc shares using their annual bonus
(Investment Shares). Under the Company’s annual bonus plan,
any annual bonus in excess of 75% of basic salary payable to an
executive director must be deferred into the Company’s shares.
These shares are treated as Investment Shares which will qualify
for the grant of Matching Shares. Participants are also allowed to
invest their cash bonus (but no other funds) on a voluntary basis
into Cattles plc shares and treat those shares as Investment
Shares. The maximum aggregate pre-tax value of bonus invested
on both a compulsory and voluntary basis per annum is 37.5% 
of the individual’s salary. Matching Shares can be awarded up 
to a maximum award ratio of 2:1 (free Matching Shares to
Investment Shares) on a gross basis. If a participant sells his
Investment Shares at any time during the three year performance
period, this will reduce (on a pro-rata basis) the number of
Matching Shares that may be transferable to him on vesting. 
In March 2007 all the then executive directors were awarded
deferred bonus shares and bought the maximum number of
permitted Investment Shares and the Committee made Awards
of Matching Shares on 2:1 ratio. No award of Matching Shares
was made to D J Postings in 2007.
The vesting of Awards depends on the Company’s performance
over a single fixed three year performance period (i.e. with no 
re-testing facility) which commences with the financial year 
in which the Awards are granted. Awards will (subject to the

The targets which trigger annual cash bonuses are set by the
Remuneration Committee. In 2007 these targets comprised the
following three measures of performance:
• The Group’s actual earnings per share (EPS) growth;
• Funds utilisation efficiency as measured against budget; and
• The achievement of each director’s personal objectives.
The maximum potential bonus payment to executive directors in
respect of the year ended 31 December 2007 was restricted to
100% of basic salary, with a maximum of 75% being payable in
respect of EPS growth, 15% in respect of funds utilisation
efficiency and 10% in respect of the achievement of personal
objectives. Any bonus earned over 75% of 2008 basic salary must
be deferred into shares which will not be received by the
executive directors for a further three years. Such deferred shares
count for the purposes of the Matching Shares element of the
Long-Term Incentive Plan described more fully below, but are not
subject to further performance conditions.
The Committee has retained this structure for the 2008 executive
directors’ annual cash bonuses except that the funds utilisation
efficiency as measured against budget element of the annual
bonus has been replaced by a profit to borrowings ratio.
Bonuses do not form part of pensionable earnings.

The Remuneration Committee believes that share ownership by
executive directors and senior executives strengthens the link
between their personal interests and those of shareholders, and
provides the opportunity for longer-term motivation and
retention. The Company’s policy is that the executive directors are
required to build up and retain a shareholding in the Company,
primarily from their long-term incentive arrangements,
equivalent to their annual salary. The Committee reviewed the
Company’s long-term incentive arrangements during 2007 in
respect of their operation, grant levels, performance criteria and
vesting schedules to ensure they remain appropriate to the
Company’s current circumstances and prospects and take due
account of market and best practice. Following this review, the
Committee exercised its discretion and made changes to the
operation of the Long-Term Incentive Plan as described below.
L LO ON NG G- -T TE ER RM M  I IN NC CE EN NT TI IV VE E  P PL LA AN N  ( (L LT TI IP P) )
The LTIP was adopted in May 2005 to replace the Restricted Share
Scheme, which expired in 2004. Participation is at the discretion
of the Committee and participants include the executive
directors and other members of the Company’s senior executive
team who are best placed to influence the performance 
of the Group.
The LTIP has two elements: an award of Performance Shares and
an award of Matching Shares linked to an investment in Cattles
plc shares (together Awards). Awards will normally vest following
the third anniversary of the date of grant provided that
challenging performance conditions have been satisfied and 
the participant remains in employment.
In normal circumstances Awards of Performance Shares may not
be granted to any participant in any financial year under the LTIP
if it would cause the aggregate market value of those shares to
exceed 100% of the participant’s basic salary. However, to provide
the Committee with a market standard degree of flexibility to
operate the LTIP in the best interests of shareholders and to take
account of particular circumstances as they may arise, in
exceptional circumstances Awards of Performance Shares worth
up to 200% of basic salary may be granted. This flexibility was 57

On 17 September 2007 the Company made a restricted share award
of 274,160 Cattles plc shares to D J Postings as an exceptional
award which the Committee considered necessary to recruit
D J Postings as successor to S P Mahon as Chief Executive and
which was therefore made under the exemption in paragraph 9.4.2
(2) of the UK Listing Authority’s Listing Rules which allows one-off
awards to be made following the recruitment of a director
without shareholder approval. 50% of the award will normally
vest on 9 October 2009 and the remaining 50% will normally vest
on 9 October 2011, provided that D J Postings continues to be
employed by a member of the Group. Vesting of the award (which
is not pensionable) is not subject to performance conditions. On
a change in control or the winding-up of the Company (except as
part of an internal reorganisation), the award will vest in full. On
cessation of employment for ‘good leaver’ reasons (which include
death), the award will vest on cessation and will be pro-rated on a
time basis unless the Committee, acting fairly and reasonably,
decides otherwise. On cessation of employment for other
reasons, or the transfer, assignment, charging or other disposal 
of the award, it will lapse. In the event of any variation in the
share capital of the Company or a demerger, special dividend or
other similar event which affects the market price of the
Company’s shares to a material extent, the Committee may make
such adjustments to the award as it considers appropriate to the
number of shares comprised in the award. No alteration shall be
made to the terms of the award to the advantage of D J Postings
without prior shareholder approval. The Committee made the
award on the same terms as, and in order to compensate
D J Postings for, the Lloyds TSB non-performance linked long-term
incentive plan award which lapsed when he left Lloyds TSB Bank
plc to join the Company. The Committee was satisfied that this
share-based award over shares of a similar value to the award 
D J Postings was foregoing when joining Cattles and which only
vests subject to continued employment, was a more appropriate
way of compensating D J Postings than a straight immediate
unconditional cash payment.
The Restricted Share Award operates in conjunction with the Trust
in the same way as the LTIP (i.e. no new issue shares are used).
M MA AN NA AG GE EM ME EN NT T  S SH HA AR RE E  P PL LA AN N
The Management Share Plan was adopted by the Board in June
2007. Participation is at the discretion of the Committee and
participants include senior executives who are best placed to
influence the performance of the Group but exclude the
executive directors. Participants are awarded shares in the
Company which will normally vest in the proportions and on 
the dates specified by the Committee at the time of making the
award, provided that the participant remains in employment. 
The vesting of awards is not subject to performance conditions.
In June 2007, for the reasons stated above in relation to the grant
of additional 100% Performance Awards under the LTIP to three
of the executive directors in June 2007, the Committee granted
awards worth 100% of their basic salary to nine senior non-main
Board executives, of which 50% will vest on 21 December 2008
and the remaining 50% will vest on 21 June 2010, subject to the
senior executives remaining in the employment of a member of
the Group.
The Management Share Plan operates in conjunction with the
T rust in the same way as the L TIP (i.e. no new issue shares are used).
‘adjuster’ referred to below) vest by reference to the Company’s
EPS growth in excess of the Retail Price Index (RPI) over the 
three year performance period, comparing the Company’s EPS 
in the financial year prior to grant with its EPS in the third year
following grant. For these purposes, EPS is calculated on the same
basis as stated in the Company’s Annual Report and Financial
Statements, subject to the Committee using its discretion to take
account of any material short-term effect arising from an
acquisition or any exceptional item of profit or loss in a particular
year, or to take account of changes in accounting standards.
Subject to the adjuster referred to below, the performance
conditions relating to Awards made in 2007 and 2005 are:
EPS growth of the Company over
Percentage of Award that vests
the 3 year performance period
Less than RPI +20% 0%
RPI +20% 30%
RPI +35% or more 100%
Between RPI +20% and RPI +35% Between 30% and 100% 
on a straight line basis
Subject to the adjuster referred to below, the performance
conditions relating to Awards made in 2006 are:
EPS growth of the Company over
Percentage of Award that vests
the 3 year performance period
Less than RPI +15% 0%
RPI +15% 30%
RPI +30% or more 100%
Between RPI +15% and RPI +30% Between 30% and 100% 
on a straight line basis
As can be seen from the tables above, the Committee applied
more demanding (in absolute terms) real EPS growth targets for
Awards made in 2007 than to those made in 2006, having taken
into account the Company’s projected EPS growth over the
relevant three year period.
In order to provide a comparative element to the performance
conditions, the performance conditions will be adjusted 
by reference to the Company’s EPS performance over the
performance period relative to an ‘average’ EPS growth 
of companies comprised in the FTSE 250 (the Index), calculated 
by dividing the Index by the price/earnings ratio of the Index.
If the Company’s EPS growth over the performance period is lower
than the average EPS growth of the Index, the level of vesting of
Awards will reduce by 1% for every 4% (subject to a maximum
reduction of 25%) that the Company’s EPS growth is lower than
the Index average. T o the extent that the Company’s EPS growth
is higher, the level of vesting of Awards will increase by 1% for
every 4% up to (but not exceeding) the maximum level of vesting.
After a review during 2007 the Committee continues to consider
that the use of EPS in the LTIP is appropriate as it encourages 
the Company’s senior management team to deliver sustained
exceptional EPS growth (and, therefore, returns to shareholders),
with EPS being a widely used statistic. Therefore, a similar
approach is currently intended to be adopted for awards 
made in 2008.
The LTIP operates in conjunction with an employee benefit trust
(Trust), the trustee of which is Cattles Trustee Limited, a wholly
owned subsidiary of Cattles plc. The directors of the trustee
Company are three of the members of the Committee, all of
whom are independent non-executive directors of the Company,
and none of whom is a beneficiary under the Trust or LTIP . On 
the grant or before the vesting of Awards, the Trust purchases
sufficient shares in the market to satisfy such awards, hence
there is no issue of new shares. On the vesting of Awards, 
the Trust transfers the appropriate number of shares to the
participants. The Trust will at no time hold more than 5% of

The timing of invitations under this scheme is determined by the
Board acting upon the recommendation of the Committee. For
the grant of options in 2007, the Committee decided both to
reduce the eligibility period which employees, including executive
directors, must serve before they are offered options from 18 to
12 months and to give eligible employees the choice to enter into
a three as well as a five year savings contract. These changes were
made to enable more employees to apply for options and to bring
the terms of the scheme more into line with other employers’
SAYE schemes following a study of their terms.

The Share Incentive Plan was introduced in 2003. It is open to all
eligible UK employees, including executive directors, and is an
HMRC-approved all employee share plan. Employees with at least
18 months’ service were entitled to participate in the 2007
appropriation but the Committee has decided that employees
with at least 12 months’ service should be entitled to participate
in 2008 and future appropriations to enable more employees to
participate and to bring the terms of the plan more into line with
the terms of other employers’ share incentive plans following a
study of their terms.
Each year a sum of money is set aside as determined by the 
Board acting upon the recommendation of the Committee. 
The amounts attributable to eligible employees are determined
by a formula linked to their salaries. The maximum award to any 
one employee during a year is £3,000. Participants may also use
their dividends to acquire further shares which are held within
the plan.

The Cattles Executive Share Option Scheme 1994 (the 1994
Scheme), an HMRC-approved scheme, and the Cattles Executive
Share Option Scheme 1996 (the 1996 Scheme) have both now
expired. Shareholder approval was obtained in 2005 
for the establishment of the Cattles Executive Share Option
Scheme 2005 (the 2005 Scheme) to replace the 1994 and the
1996 Scheme. The maximum award under the 2005 Scheme is
100% of salary.
Executive directors and senior executives have not participated 
in these Executive Share Option Schemes since being invited 
to participate in the LTIP and Restricted Share Scheme referred 
to above. Consequently, no executive director has options
outstanding or unexercised under any of the Executive Share
Option Schemes.
The Committee’s current policy will continue to be that the
executive directors and senior managers who participate in the
LTIP will not be granted options under the 2005 Scheme, save
where exceptional circumstances exist (such as senior
recruitment) which result in the Committee considering it
appropriate to grant both options under the 2005 Scheme and

This scheme was established in 1994 and expired in 2004. The
participants included the executive directors and some other key
senior executives. In relation to the awards made contingently
under the scheme, each participant was notionally awarded
shares up to one times basic annual salary each year.
The number of long-term incentive shares which a participant
ultimately received depended upon continued employment and
performance conditions.
More particularly, EPS had to grow by a minimum pre-determined
amount, set by the Committee at the time of the award, over a
three year performance period before participants became
entitled to any shares. The three year target earnings growth for
the last award made in January 2004, which vested on 10 April
2007, was 45% in excess of the increase in RPI to the extent that
it exceeded 5%.
The provisional award of shares was established by comparing
the actual earnings growth achieved by the Company against the
pre-determined target set for the relevant period. The maximum
award was made where the target had been met or exceeded. If
the earnings growth achieved by the Company was less than the
target, then the provisional award was reduced on a straight line
basis, such that where the earnings growth was less than 66.67%
of the target, no provisional award was made.
When the provisional award had been calculated, the earnings
growth achieved by the Company was then compared with the
average earnings growth achieved by the constituent companies
included in the FTSE All Share Index and the Speciality and Other
Financials Index. If the earnings growth achieved by the Company
was less than that achieved by the constituent companies of
either index, the provisional award was reduced by 1% for every
4% by which the earnings growth of the Company fell below that
of the constituent companies in either index. The provisional
award could have been reduced by a maximum of 25% as a result
of this comparison.
Equally, if the earnings growth achieved by the Company
exceeded that achieved by the constituent companies of either
index, then the provisional award was increased by 1% for every
4% by which the earnings growth of the Company exceeded 
that of either index, subject to the original notional award not
being exceeded.
The Restricted Share Scheme operated in conjunction with the T rust
in the same way as the LTIP (i.e. no new issue shares are used).

It is the Company’s policy that executive directors’ service
contracts should be rolling contracts requiring a notice period 
of one year to be given by the Company and usually six months 
to be given by each director. Each of the executive directors (apart
from D J Postings) entered into service contracts, including these
terms, on the date of their appointment to the Board. In order 
to reflect changes in other terms agreed since the original service
contracts were entered into and to incorporate changes in
employment legislation, the executive directors (apart from 
D J Postings) entered into new service contracts on 5 March 2003.
D J Postings entered into a service contract, including these terms
(except that he is required to give the Company 12 months’
notice), on 18 May 2007. 
The Company has the right to terminate a director’s employment
by paying to the director the remuneration which he would have
been entitled to receive from the Company in respect of the
relevant period of notice. If a director ceases to be employed, 
for any reason, by the Company before the end of the financial
year, any bonus payment will be at the sole discretion of the
Committee. It is the Committee’s policy that, when determining
the amount of any compensation paid to a departing director, 
the Committee will take into account the director’s obligation 
to mitigate his loss, to the extent it is possible to do so under 
the terms of the relevant contract. An executive director may not
become a director of another company without the prior written
consent of the Board. No executive director is a non-executive
director of any other company.

The Committee was mindful of the effect of the transition to
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) on the EPS-
based performance conditions used in the LTIP , the Restricted
Share Scheme and the Executive Share Option Schemes. At the
request of the Committee the Company’s auditors reviewed the
conversion of the EPS growth targets from UK GAAP to IFRS. In
addition, the Committee will (where it feels it appropriate to do
so) seek third-party verification of the extent to which the
performance conditions applying to share-based incentives 
are satisfied.

S P Mahon, J J Corr and I S Cummine have individual personal
pension plans into which the Company contributed 25% of 
basic salary in the case of S P Mahon up to his retirement on 
30 September 2007 and 20% of basic salary in the cases of J J Corr
and I S Cummine up to 31 December 2007. M W G Collins is 
a member of the Cattles Staff Pension Fund and is subject to 
the cap in the rules of the Fund which is based on the former
statutory pension cap. He therefore receives payments
representing 20% of the difference between his basic salary 
and that cap for contribution to additional pension schemes. 
No other payments to directors are pensionable.
Cattles Staff Pension Fund is a funded, HMRC-approved, final
salary occupational pension scheme with a contribution rate of
5% of pensionable salary from the employee. Its main features,
which apply to all members on the same terms, are:
• Pension is payable at normal pension age of 65 at 1/60th of
final pensionable salary for each year of pensionable service up
to a maximum of 40/60ths;
• Death-in-service life assurance cover is provided at four times
pensionable salary; and 
• Pension is payable in the event of early retirement due to ill
health and to spouse on death of member.
D J Postings receives a salary supplement of 25% of his basic
salary in lieu of a pension contribution because his pension plans
are already funded up to the HMRC maximum limit. This salary
supplement does not form part of D J Postings’ basic salary for
any purpose.
The directors are provided with death-in-service life assurance
cover of four times basic salary.

A J McWalter’s fee increased from £45,000 pa to £55,000 pa on 
1 September 2007 when he became chairman of the Welcome
Financial Services Regulatory Oversight Committee.
The bonuses earned by M W G Collins, J J Corr and I S Cummine 
in respect of 2007 were 85% out of a maximum of 100% of 2007
basic salary and reflected the partial achievement of the funds
utilisation efficiency measure, the EPS growth measure and
personal objectives. The bonuses earned in excess of 75% of 2008
basic salary will be deferred into shares and will not be received
by the relevant directors for a further three years.
The bonus earned by D J Postings in respect of 2007 was a
guaranteed £200,000 which was agreed by the Committee 
when he joined the Company and was a necessary element of
D J Postings’ recruitment arrangements in light of the potential
bonus he was foregoing from his previous employer by joining
Cattles plc.
The bonus earned by S P Mahon in respect of 2007 was 75% out
of a maximum of 100% of 2007 basic salary and reflected the
extent to which the Committee assessed the targets to have
been met as at 30 September 2007 and his overall contribution
during the course of the part of the year in which he was
employed.
The expense allowances received by D J Postings are comprised 
of his car and fuel allowance and relocation expenses.
The other remuneration received by D J Postings is comprised of 
a salary supplement of 25% of his basic salary in lieu of a pension
contribution and a cash sum which he received in compensation
for his awards of Lloyds TSB deferred shares, SAYE options 
and share incentive plan shares which lapsed when he joined 
the Company.

Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of
three years, although either the Company or the director may
terminate the appointment by giving six months’ written notice.
They are subject to re-election at an Annual General Meeting at
least every three years in common with all directors. They do not
have service contracts and may not participate in any bonus
scheme, share scheme, pension scheme, car scheme or
healthcare scheme operated by the Company. The dates of their
current letters of appointment are: D A Haxby 22 June 1999;
N N Broadhurst 23 March 2001; F Dee 30 June 2004; A J McWalter
6 September 2005; and M A Young 1 February 2006. In 2007 the
Chairman, N N Broadhurst, received a fee of £175,000 which was
determined by the Committee on the same basis as applied to
the determination of the basic salaries of the executive directors.
In 2007 the non-executive directors’ basic fee (calculated by
reference to practice adopted in the market generally and taking
account of the time commitment and the responsibilities of the
non-executive directors) was £45,000, with D A Haxby receiving
an extra £10,000 fee for his services as Senior Independent
Director and chairman of the Remuneration Committee, M A
Young receiving an extra £10,000 fee for her services as chairman
of the Audit Committee and A J McWalter receiving an extra
£10,000 fee for his services as chairman of the Welcome Financial
Services Regulatory Oversight Committee with effect from 
1 September 2007. Reasonable expenses that they may incur in
the furtherance of their duties are repaid by the Company.
Following the review by the Committee in December 2007, in
relation to the Chairman, and by the sub-committee of the Board,
comprising the Chairman of the Board, the Chief Executive and
the Finance Director, in December 2007, in relation to the other
non-executive directors, applying the above policy and reflecting
the fact that F Dee had succeeded D A Haxby as chairman of the
Remuneration Committee, the Board agreed the following
changes to the fees of the non-executive directors with effect
from 1 January 2008:

In respect of those shares notionally awarded on 1 January 2004 under the RSS, the EPS growth achieved by the Group during the
three years ended 31 December 2006 fell marginally short of the pre-determined target and was less than the average EPS growth
achieved by the constituent companies in the FTSE All Share Index and the Speciality and Other Financials Index and as a result 74% 
of the shares notionally awarded on 1 January 2004 vested in the executive directors and other senior executives on 10 April 2007.
In respect of those shares notionally awarded on 23 May 2005 under the LTIP , the EPS growth achieved by the Group during the 
three years ended 31 December 2007 exceeded the pre-determined target but was less than the average EPS growth achieved by the
constituent companies in the FTSE 250 Index and as a result 84% of the shares notionally awarded on 23 May 2005 will vest in three 
of the executive directors and other senior executives on 23 May 2008.
The figures for the executive directors’ notional awards comprise both their Performance and, where relevant, their Matching Awards.
The performance criteria attaching to the RSS are set out in the third to sixth paragraphs of the ‘Restricted Share Scheme’ section of
this report on page 58. The performance criteria attaching to the LTIP are set out in the ninth to fourteenth paragraphs of the ‘LTIP’
section of this report on pages 56 and 57.
As at 1 January 2007 the employee benefit trust owned 1,002,023 shares. On 10 April 2007 the employee benefit trust transferred
320,369 shares on the vesting of awards under the RSS. On 5 October 2007 the employee benefit trust transferred 399,913 shares on
the vesting of awards to S P Mahon on his retirement pursuant to the rules of the LTIP (i.e. taking account of performance and the time
elapsed since grant) and the DSBP . As at 31 December 2007 the employee benefit trust owned 281,741 shares.

S P Mahon did not exercise any of his options between 1 January 2007 and his retirement on 30 September 2007. Under the rules of the Sharesave Scheme S P Mahon must
exercise his options on or before 31 March 2008 or they will lapse. The number of options exercisable by S P Mahon will depend on whether, and, if so, for how long, he
continues to make payments under his SAYE savings plan but will be less than the 5,549 options originally granted to him because he will not have saved for the whole of the
five year savings contract.
No options have been exercised or have lapsed during the year. The mid-market price of the Company’s shares at 31 December 2007

(i) Under the Listing Rules disclosure requirements, additional accrued benefits earned in the year exclude inflation. Under the Companies Act disclosure requirements, inflation 
is included.
(ii) In light of new legislation, changes in market conditions and actuarial advice, the trustees of the Cattles Staff Pension Fund reviewed and amended the basis for the
calculation of cash equivalent transfer values in October 2007. This change in basis resulted in 18% out of the total 37% increase in M W G Collins’ transfer value as at
31 December 2007 compared with that at 31 December 2006. 63
Cattles plc
Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2007
The accrued pension entitlement shown in respect of M W G
Collins is the amount that would be paid each year to the director
in the form of a pension on retirement at age 65 in the event of
him having left service at the end of the year. The accrued
pension entitlement includes, where relevant, entitlements
earned as an employee, prior to becoming a director, as well as
those earned for qualifying services after becoming a director.
The increase in the accrued pension entitlement is the difference
between the accrued benefit at the year-end and that at the
previous year-end. Transfer values have been calculated on the
basis of actuarial advice in accordance with Actuarial Guidance
Note GN11.
The transfer values of the additional accrued benefits and of the
accrued pension entitlement in respect of qualifying services
represent the value of assets that the pension scheme would
need to transfer to another pension provider on transferring the
scheme’s liability in respect of the director’s pension benefits that
he has earned in respect of qualifying services. They do not
represent sums payable to the director and, therefore, cannot be
added meaningfully to annual remuneration.
The transfer value of the additional accrued benefits earned in
the year less director’s contribution is the transfer value of the
additional accrued benefits in respect of qualifying services
earned in the year after deducting the director’s personal
contribution to the scheme during the year.
The increase in the transfer value less director’s contribution is
the increase in the transfer value of the accrued benefits in
respect of qualifying services during the year after deducting the
director’s personal contributions to the scheme.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
For the year ended 31 December 2007
as between persons who were last elected on the same day those 
to retire shall (unless they otherwise agree among themselves) be
determined by lot. The directors retiring by rotation and, being
eligible, offering themselves for re-election at the Annual General
Meeting on 9 May 2008 are M W G Collins, who holds office as an
executive director and has a rolling service contract requiring a
period of 12 months notice from the Company or six months
from the director, and D A Haxby and M A Young, non-executive
directors, who do not have a service contract.
All directors are re-elected at intervals of not more than three
years, in accordance with the provisions of the Combined Code on
Corporate Governance issued by the Financial Reporting Council.
Details of the directors’ remuneration, share incentives and
options, and pension arrangements are set out in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on pages 54 to 63. Qualifying third party
indemnity provisions (as defined in Sections 232 to 239 of the
Companies Act 2006) have been made by the Company for the
benefit of all the directors indemnifying them to the maximum
extent permitted by law against liabilities attaching to them 
as directors of the Company and such provisions continue in 
force at the date of this report. No director has had a contract
of significance, other than a service contract and a qualifying
third-party indemnity provision, with the Company or any
subsidiary undertaking during the year.
The Company’s shareholders may by ordinary resolution appoint
any person to be a director and may by special resolution or by
ordinary resolution, of which special notice has been given,
remove any director before the expiration of his or her period of
office and may by ordinary resolution appoint another person in
his or her place. No person other than a director retiring at the
meeting shall, unless recommended by the Board, be appointed
as a director at any general meeting unless, not less than seven
and not more than 28 clear days before the date of the meeting,
there has been given to the Company Secretary written notice 
by a shareholder (not being the person proposed to be appointed 
as a director) who is entitled to attend and vote at the relevant
meeting of his or her intention to propose such person 
for appointment and also written notice signed by the person 
to be proposed of his or her willingness to be appointed.
The Board also has the power to appoint a person as a director,
although any such director shall only hold office until the 
next Annual General Meeting, at which he or she will be eligible
for re-appointment. A person will cease to be a director in various
circumstances, including if he or she is requested to resign by
written notice signed by all of the other directors.
The directors have general power to manage the Company’s
business and may exercise all such powers of the Company as are
not required by the Companies Acts or the Articles of Association
to be exercised by the shareholders in general meeting, subject
nevertheless to the provisions of the Companies Acts, the
Memorandum and Articles of Association and to any directions
given by the shareholders in general meeting by special resolution.
In particular, the directors have power to propose amendments 
to the Company’s Articles of Association but any such
amendments may only be made by a special resolution passed 
by the Company’s shareholders. In addition, the holders of 10% of
the issued share capital may requisition an Extraordinary General
Meeting for any purpose including amending the Articles.
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Acts and the Articles
of Association, the unissued shares of the Company are at the
disposal of the Board, which may offer, allot, grant options over or
otherwise dispose of them to any such persons, at such times
and for such consideration and upon such terms and conditions
as the Board may determine. Pursuant to resolutions passed 
The directors submit their Annual Report together with the
audited Financial Statements of the Company and the Group for
the year ended 31 December 2007.

Further details are set out in Shareholder Information on page 119.
The trustee of the Cattles employee benefit trust has agreed to
waive the right to receive dividends over and above 0.01p per
share on all shares it holds for the purpose of the Long-Term
Incentive Plan, the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, the Management
Share Plan and the Restricted Share Award. In respect of the total
dividend for 2007 of 19.30p per share, the trustee has waived
dividends of £0.1 million (2006: £0.2 million) on the shares held
during the year ended 31 December 2007.

Meeting on 9 May 2008. D J Postings holds office as an executive
director and has a rolling service contract requiring a period of 
12 months’ notice from the Company or the director.
The Company’s Articles of Association require that one third, or 
as near as possible but not less than one third, of the directors
(excluding, for this purpose, D J Postings) retire by rotation 
each year. Directors due to retire by rotation are those who have
been longest in office since they were last elected and so that

The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors
have prepared the Group and parent Company financial
statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The
financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair
view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of
the profit or loss of the Group for the period.
In preparing those financial statements, the directors are
required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
• State that the financial statements comply with IFRSs as
adopted by the European Union; and
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis,
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will
continue in business, in which case there should be supporting
assumptions or qualifications as necessary.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above
requirements in preparing the financial statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Group and the Company and enable
them to ensure that the financial statements and the Directors’
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 1985 and, 67

Accounting developments
The following new standards, interpretations and amendments
cannot be adopted until they have been endorsed by the EU.
–Interpretations effective in 2007 but which had no impact
The following interpretations to existing standards are
mandatory for accounting periods beginning on or after
1 March 2006 or later periods, but they have had no impact
on the Group or the Company:
– IFRIC 7 ‘ Applying the restatement approach under IAS 29,
Financial reporting in hyperinflationary economies’
– IFRIC 8 ‘Scope of IFRS2’
– IFRIC 9 ‘Reassessment of embedded derivatives’
– IFRIC 10 ‘Interim financial reporting and impairment’
– Standard, amendment and interpretation that are not yet
effective and have not been early adopted
The following standard, amendment and interpretation to
existing standards have been published and are mandatory for
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008 or
later periods, but which the Group and the Company have not
early adopted:
– IFRS 8 ‘Operating segments’ – it is not expected that this
standard, which is effective from 1 January 2009, will
significantly impact on the Group’s segmental disclosures.
– Amendment to IAS 23 ‘Borrowing costs’ – it is not expected
that this amendment, which is effective from 1 January 2009,
will have an impact on the Group or Company’s result as the
Group’s existing accounting policy requires that borrowing
costs relating to assets in the course of development are
capitalised as part of the asset’s costs rather than expensed.
– IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset,
minimum funding requirements’ – work is currently being
undertaken to establish how this interpretation, which is
effective from 1 January 2008, will impact on the value of the
Group and Company’s retirement benefit obligation going
forward. This assessment will take account of the latest
actuarial valuation and the new schedule of contributions to
be agreed in 2008, however it is expected that the adoption
of IFRIC 14 will have no material financial impact as at
1 January 2008.
– Interpretations that are not yet effective and have not been
early adopted, which are not expected to have an impact
The following interpretations to existing standards have been
published and are mandatory for accounting periods beginning
on or after 1 March 2007 or later periods, but are not expected
to have a material impact on the Group or the Company:
– IFRIC 11 ‘IFRS 2 – Group and treasury share transactions’
– IFRIC 12 ‘Service concession arrangements’
– IFRIC 13 ‘Customer loyalty programmes’
Consolidation
A business combination is recognised where separate entities
or businesses have been brought together within the Group.
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power
to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain
benefits from its activities, generally accompanying a
shareholding of more than 50% of the voting rights. Subsidiaries
are fully consolidated from the date on which control is
transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date
that control ceases. All subsidiaries share the same reporting
date, 31 December, as Cattles plc.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Cattles plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company domiciled
in the UK. Its shares are listed on the London Stock Exchange. The
consolidated financial statements of the Company for the year
ended 31 December 2007 comprise the Company and its
subsidiaries (together referred to as the ‘Group’).
Statement of compliance
These consolidated and Company financial statements have
been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRIC interpretations
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
These consolidated and Company financial statements have also
been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 as
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements are rounded to the nearest million to
one decimal place. They are prepared under the historical cost
convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial
instruments.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with
IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and
assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported
amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates
and associated assumptions are based on historical experience
and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable
under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of
making the judgements about the carrying values of assets and
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual
results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised
in the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision
affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future
periods if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements made by management in the application of IFRS
that have a significant effect on the financial statements and
estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the
next year are discussed in note 2 on page 80.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied
consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated and
Company financial statements, except for the two changes
described below. The accounting policies have been applied
consistently by all the Group’s entities.
Revised format of the income statement
The format of the income statement adopted by the Group
has been revised in order that it more appropriately reflects the
nature of the Group’s principal activity, that of lending. The
impact of this presentational change on the current and prior
year’s income statements is set out in note 3 on pages 81 and 82.
Adoption of IFRS 7
IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’ and the
complementary amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial
statements – Capital disclosures’ have been adopted from
1 January 2007. IFRS 7 and the amendment to IAS 1 have
introduced new quantitative and qualitative disclosures relating
to financial instruments and they do not have any impact on the
classification or valuation of financial instruments.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
For the year ended 31 December 2007 Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2007
75
Cattles plc
– Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
This category has two sub-categories: financial assets held for
trading; and those designated at fair value through profit or
loss at inception. A financial asset is classified as at fair value
through profit or loss if acquired principally for the purpose of
selling in the short-term or if so designated by management.
Derivatives (refer to the accounting policy entitled ‘Derivative
financial instruments and hedging activities’) are also
categorised as held for trading unless they are designated
as hedges.
– Held-to-maturity
Held-to-maturity investments are non-derivative financial
assets with fixed or determinable payments and fixed
maturities that the Group has a positive intention and ability to
hold to maturity. Were the Group to sell a significant amount of
held-to-maturity assets the entire category would be tainted
and reclassified as available-for-sale.
– Available-for-sale
Available-for-sale investments are those intended to be held for
an indefinite period of time, which may be sold in response to
needs for liquidity or changes in interest rates, exchange rates
or equity prices.
The Group has not held any held-to-maturity or available-for-sale
financial assets at any point during the period.
Loans and receivables are recognised when cash is advanced to
borrowers, or at the date of acquisition in respect of purchased
debt. These assets are initially recognised at fair value plus direct
and incremental transaction costs. Loans and receivables are
carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Purchases and sales of financial assets at fair value through profit
or loss are recognised on the date of trade, the date on which the
Group commits to purchase or sell the asset. Financial assets at
fair value through profit or loss are initially recognised, and
subsequently carried, at fair value. Gains and losses arising from
changes in the fair value of these financial assets are included in
the income statement in the period in which they arise. The
Group’s financial assets at fair value through profit or loss relate
solely to derivative instruments which cannot be designated as
hedges. Consequently, they are classified as derivative financial
instruments in the balance sheet within assets or liabilities
dependent on the individual instruments’ fair value at the
reporting date.
Financial assets are derecognised when the rights to receive
cash flows from the financial assets have expired or where the
Group has transferred substantially all the risks and rewards
of ownership.
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value receivable for the sale of goods
and services, net of value added tax, and is recognised as follows:
– Interest income
Interest income is recognised in the income statement for
all financial assets measured at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. The effective interest method is a
method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial asset
and allocating the interest income over the relevant period. The
effective interest rate (EIR) is the rate that exactly discounts
estimated future cash flows through the expected life, or 
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for
business combinations made by the Group. The cost of a
business combination is measured as the fair value of the assets
acquired, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or
assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs directly attributable
to the business combination.
Contingent consideration is included in the cost of a business at
the acquisition date only if the consideration is probable and can
be reliably measured, and is discounted using an appropriate
discount rate. If the future events upon which the contingent
consideration is based do not occur or the estimate needs to be
revised or if contingent consideration, which had not been
initially included, does become probable and can be reliably
measured, the cost of the business combination, and any
associated goodwill, is adjusted accordingly.
Identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired
in the business combination are measured initially at their fair
values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the
identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the
cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets
acquired, the difference is credited to the income statement
in the period of acquisition.
Inter-company income, expenses, balances and unrealised
gains or losses on transactions between Group companies are
eliminated on consolidation.
Segmental reporting
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged
in providing products or services that are subject to risks and
returns that are different from those of other business segments.
For management purposes, the Group is organised into three
operating divisions, consumer credit (principally Welcome
Financial Services), debt recovery (principally The Lewis Group)
and corporate services (principally Cattles Invoice Finance). These
divisions are, therefore, the basis on which the Group reports its
primary segments.
A geographical segment is a group of assets and operations
engaged in providing products or services within a particular
economic environment that are subject to risks and returns that
are different from those segments operating in other economic
environments. The Group’s operations are located only in the UK.
Management considers that all regions of the UK are subject to
the same risks and returns, such that no secondary geographic
segments exist.
Financial assets
Management determines the classification of the Group’s
financial assets at initial recognition into one of the following
categories and re-evaluates this designation at each reporting
date:
– Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with
fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active
market. They arise when the Group provides money directly 
to a customer with no intention of trading the receivable. 
This classification includes advances made to customers under
hire purchase agreements and purchased debt.

Financial Statements 2007

Cattles plc
– Revenue from sale of goods
Revenue from the sale of goods, principally vehicles, is
recognised when the Group entity has delivered the product
to the customer, the customer has accepted the product and
collectibility of the related receivable is reasonably assured.
– Other operating income
Other operating income primarily comprises commissions
charged to clients for the collection of debts and commissions
charged to third-party lenders for the introduction of new
customers. These commissions are credited to the income
statement when the collection or brokerage services
have been provided.
Impairment of loans and receivables
In respect of loans and receivables, including receivables under
hire purchase contracts, the Group assesses on an ongoing basis
whether there is objective evidence that a loan asset or a group
of loan assets is impaired. A loan asset or a group of loan assets
is impaired and impairment losses are incurred only if there is
objective evidence of impairment as a result of one or more
events that occurred after the initial recognition of the asset
(a ‘loss event’) and the loss event has an impact on the estimated
future cash flows of the loan asset or group of loan assets that
can be reliably estimated. The Group first assesses whether
objective evidence of impairment exists individually for loan
assets that are individually significant, and either individually or
collectively for loan assets that are not individually significant.
Welcome Financial Services determines that there is objective
evidence of an impairment loss at the point at which they are
not prepared to offer any further credit to a customer who has
encountered serious repayment difficulties. In Welcome Finance
this is assessed by reference to the number of days an account is
contractually in arrears. When an account has reached 120 days
in arrears, there is an acceptance that the original contractual
relationship has broken down. At this stage, specialist account
managers in Local Collection Units seek to establish a different
working relationship with the customer, focusing instead on
recovering part payments over a rescheduled repayment plan.
At this point, interest on the account is suspended and no longer
added to the outstanding balance. In Shopacheck, the point at
which no further credit will be offered is assessed by reference
to the value of contractual payments made in the preceding
13-week period. When an account has paid less than 50% of the
contractually agreed amounts over the previous 13 weeks, it is
considered impaired.
Cattles Invoice Finance determines that there is objective
evidence of an impairment loss as part of a process termed
‘collect out’. This process commences should a client have served
notice that they wish to end their facility or when management
become aware that the client is encountering trading difficulties.
At this point the client’s facilities are withdrawn, no further funds
are made available and client managers begin the process of
recovering the outstanding balance. Where, based upon an
individual assessment of each client in collect out, it is apparent
that there are no further routes to recovery and that as a
consequence funds will not be recovered in full, a provision is
made which is equivalent to the expected shortfall.
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss has
occurred, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference
between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of
estimated future cash flows, excluding future credit losses that
have not been incurred, discounted at the loan asset’s original
EIR. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use
of a loan loss provision. The amount of the loss is recognised in 
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
contractual term if shorter, of the financial asset to the net
carrying amount of the financial asset. When calculating the
EIR, the Group estimates cash flows considering all contractual
terms of the financial instruments, such as early settlement
options, but does not include an expectation for future credit
losses. The calculation includes all fees charged to customers,
such as acceptance or similar fees, and direct and incremental
transaction costs, such as broker commissions and certain
agents’ remuneration. All income relating to payment
protection insurance is regarded as being part of the Group’s
economic return on the loans, hence the commission element
is a constituent part of the EIR and is included within interest
income.
Renegotiated loans refers to circumstances under which an
existing Welcome Finance or Shopacheck loan agreement has
been formally rewritten. The rewrite of an agreement can only
occur where the customer has demonstrated a willingness
to pay but their circumstances have sufficiently changed from
the time at which the loan was originally issued. The debt is
rescheduled to an affordable payment, albeit still at a
commercial rate, under a new rewritten agreement. Interest
income on rewritten loans is recognised in the same way as
non-rewritten loans using the effective interest method. The
unamortised fees and costs relating to the first agreement
continue to be recognised over the original contractual term.
In respect of purchased debt, the EIR calculation is based on an
estimate of expected collections from the debt and takes
account of any initial costs, such as court fees.
Amounts due from lessees under finance leases and hire
purchase contracts are recorded as receivables at the amount
of the Group’s net investment in the lease. Finance income is
allocated to accounting periods so as to reflect a constant
periodic rate of return on the Group’s net investment (before
tax) outstanding in respect of the lease.
Interest income continues to be recognised at the EIR once a
financial asset or a group of similar financial assets has been
written down as a result of an impairment loss, irrespective
of the terms of the loan and whether interest has been
suspended on the customer’s account. This is referred to
as the ‘gross-up adjustment’ to income and is offset by a
corresponding ‘gross-up adjustment’ to the loan loss charge
(refer to the accounting policy entitled ‘Impairment of
loans and receivables’).
– Fee and related income
Welcome Finance offers payment protection and other
insurance products, such as health, life and mechanical
breakdown insurance, to its customers for which a commission
is received from third-party fronting insurers.
As set out in the accounting policy entitled ‘Interest income’,
commission received in relation to the sale of payment
protection insurance is included as part of the EIR of the
associated loans. Commission received for the brokering of the
sale of other insurance products, for which the Group does not
bear any underlying insurance risk, is recognised and credited
to the income statement when the brokerage service has been
provided.
Income from insurance profit share arrangements with the
fronting insurer is recognised on an effective interest method in
respect of payment protection insurance and is recognised in
line with the incidence of risk in respect of other insurance
products.
NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
For the year ended 31 December 2007 continued Annual Report and 
Financial Statements 2007

Cattles plc
Any impairment is recognised immediately through the income
statement and is not subsequently reversed.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of
goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss
on disposal.
Up to 31 December 1997 under previous accounting policies,
goodwill arising on acquisitions was recognised as a deduction
from equity. On the subsequent disposal of any business to
which goodwill had been recognised as a deduction from
equity, the goodwill remains within equity and is not
transferred to the income statement.
– Computer software
Acquired software licenses are capitalised as intangible assets
and amortised over their useful lives (3-7 years) on a straight
line basis.
Costs that are directly attributable to the creation of
identifiable software, which meet the development asset
recognition criteria as laid out in IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’, are
recognised as internally generated intangible assets. Direct
costs include the employment costs of internal software
developers, consultancy costs and borrowing costs. Borrowing
costs are capitalised until such time as the internally generated
software is substantially ready for its intended use.
All other software development and maintenance costs are
recognised as an expense as incurred.
Computer software development costs recognised as assets
are amortised over their estimated useful lives (5-7 years) on
a straight line basis. The assets’ residual values and useful lives
are reviewed, and adjusted if appropriate, at each balance
sheet date.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation. Cost represents expenditure that is directly
attributable to the purchase of the asset. Certain land and
buildings are held at previous revalued amounts less subsequent
accumulated depreciation as these amounts were taken as their
deemed cost as at the date of transition to IFRS (1 January 2004)
in accordance with the exemption under IFRS 1.
Land and buildings are not subject to revaluations.
Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or
recognised as a separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is
probable that future economic benefits associated with the
items will flow to the Group and the cost of the item can be
measured reliably.
Land is not depreciated. Depreciation on other assets is
calculated using the straight line method to allocate the costs to
their residual values over their estimated useful lives, as follows:
Freehold buildings 2% pa
Leasehold buildings 2% to 20% pa
Fixtures and equipment 10% to 33.33% pa
Motor vehicles 20% pa
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, and
adjusted if appropriate, at each balance sheet date.
An asset’s carrying amount is written down immediately to its
recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying value is greater than its
estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing
proceeds with carrying amounts and are included in the income
statement.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
the income statement as a loan loss charge, except in the case
of purchased debt, where any impairment adjustment is taken
to interest income.
For the purposes of a collective evaluation of impairment,
loan assets are grouped on the basis of similar credit risk
characteristics. Those characteristics are relevant to the
estimation of future cash flows for groups of such assets by
being indicative of the debtors’ ability to pay all amounts due
according to the contractual terms of the assets being evaluated.
Future cash flows for a group of loan assets that are collectively
evaluated for impairment are estimated on the basis of the
contractual cash flows of the assets and historical loss
experience for assets with credit risk characteristics similar to
those in the group. Historical loss experience is adjusted on the
basis of current observable data to reflect the effects of current
conditions that did not affect the period on which the historical
loss experience is based and to remove the effects of conditions
in the historical period that do not exist currently.
Where interest income continues to be recognised on
impaired loans, which cannot be collected from the customer
due to the interest being fixed at the outset or interest having
been suspended on the customer’s account, referred to as the
‘gross-up adjustment’ to income, a corresponding loan loss
charge is made. This is referred to as the ‘gross-up adjustment’
to the loan loss charge (refer to the revenue recognition
accounting policy entitled ‘Interest income’).
Loans and receivables (and the related loan loss provision) are
normally written off when there is no realistic prospect of
recovery of these amounts.
Interest expense
Interest expense primarily comprises the interest expense arising
on the Group’s borrowings, the ineffectiveness charge arising in
relation to the Group’s hedging instruments (refer to the
accounting policy entitled ‘Derivative financial instruments
and hedging activities’) and the cost of undrawn facilities.
Foreign currency translation
– Functional and presentational currency
The Group’s financial statements are presented in pounds
sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational
currency. All subsidiaries of the Group have pounds sterling as
their functional currency.
– Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from
the settlement of such transactions, and from the translation
at period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies, are recognised in the
income statement as part of interest expense in relation to
borrowings and as part of other operating expenses in relation
to other monetary assets and liabilities.
Intangible assets
– Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition represents the excess of
the cost of a business combination over the fair values
of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired.
Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed at least annually for
impairment. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill
is allocated to cash generating units (CGUs). Each CGU is
consistent with the Group’s primary reporting segments.

Cattles plc
The fair value of plan assets is based on bid prices at each
balance sheet date.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments
and changes in actuarial assumptions are immediately
recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense.
Past service costs are recognised immediately within the
income statement, unless the changes to the pension plan
are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a
specified period of time (the vesting period). In this case, past
service costs are amortised on a straight line basis over the
vesting period.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions
into privately administered pension plans on a contractual
basis. The contributions are recognised as a staff cost as they
fall due.
The Group provides no other post-retirement benefits to its
directors or other employees.
– Termination benefits
Termination benefits are payable when employment is
terminated before the normal retirement date, or when an
employee accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these
benefits. The Group recognises termination benefits when it is
demonstrably committed to either the termination of
employment or a voluntary redundancy offered.
– Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based
payment plans, including a Deferred Share Bonus Plan. In
respect of share awards granted after 7 November 2002
(and not vested by 1 January 2005), in accordance with IFRS 2
‘Share-based payment’, an expense is recognised in respect
of the fair value of employee services received in exchange for
the grant of shares or share options. A corresponding amount
is recorded as an increase in equity within retained earnings.
The expense is spread over any relevant vesting period and is
calculated by reference to the fair value of the shares or share
options granted, excluding the effect of any non-market
vesting conditions.
In respect of the Deferred Share Bonus Plan, the grant date is
the start of the year in which the performance to determine
the level of bonus to be awarded is measured.
In arriving at fair values, the Black-Scholes pricing model is used
and various assumptions are made, for example, on expected
forfeiture rates, dividend yields, share price volatility and risk
free rates. The estimate for the number of options that are
expected to become exercisable is revised at each balance
sheet date. Any impact from the revision of original estimates
is recognised in the income statement over the remaining
vesting period.
Share-based payment awards made by the Company to
employees of subsidiary companies are reflected in the
financial statements of the Company as an increase in the
investments in subsidiary undertakings with the corresponding
credit being made to equity. The Company does not make a
recharge to its subsidiary companies in respect of awards
granted to their employees.
On the exercise of share options any proceeds received, net of
any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share
capital (nominal value) with any surplus taken to the share
premium account.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Investments in subsidiary undertakings
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are initially recognised at
cost. The Company recognises income from the investment only
to the extent that it receives distributions from post-acquisition
accumulated profits. Distributions received in excess of such
profits are regarded as a recovery of investment and recognised
as a reduction in the cost of the investment.
At each reporting date, an assessment is made as to whether
there is any indication that the investment may be impaired.
If such an indication exists, the Company estimates the
investment’s recoverable amount. The investment is written
down to the recoverable amount if this is lower than its carrying
value. The impairment loss is recognised in the Company’s
income statement.
Inventories
Inventories comprise vehicles held for resale and are stated at the
lower of actual cost and net realisable value. Net realisable value
is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business
less variable selling expenses.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash
equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held with banks with
maturity dates of less than three months, and bank overdrafts.
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities
in the balance sheet.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or
constructive obligation as a result of past events; it is more likely
than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle
the obligation; and the amount has been reliably measured.
Staff costs
– Short-term benefits
Wages, salaries, commissions, bonuses, social security
contributions, paid annual leave and non-monetary benefits,
including the cost of providing company cars and death-in-
service premiums, are accrued in the period in which the
associated services are rendered by employees of the Group.
– Pension obligations
The Group has both a defined benefit and a number of defined
contribution pension plans. The assets of the defined benefit
pension plan are held in a separate trustee administered fund.
The present value of the defined benefit obligation less the fair
value of the plan assets is recognised in the balance sheet as
the retirement benefit obligation. This obligation is recognised
in the Company’s balance sheet since this entity is the plan’s
sponsoring employer and there is no formal agreement for
allocating the cost of pension contributions between the
subsidiary participating employers. The defined benefit
obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries
using the projected credit method. The present value of the
defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the
estimated future cash flows using interest rates of high quality
corporate bonds that have terms to maturity approximating to
the terms of the related pension liability. The defined benefit
obligation takes account of an allowance for the cash
commutation option that members have at retirement, but
does not include a reserve for death-in-service benefits or
non-investment related expenses.

Cattles plc
Where the Company purchases its own shares, being held by the
trustee of the employee benefit trust in respect of the various
long-term incentive plans, the consideration paid, including any
directly attributable incremental costs, is deducted from equity
on consolidation. Where such shares are subsequently sold or
reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly
attributable transaction costs, is also included in equity on
consolidation. These transactions are classified as ‘own shares
held’ within other reserves.
The consideration for the purchase of own shares paid by the
Company is recognised as a receivable due from the trust within
the Company’s trade and other receivables.
Dividend distribution
Final dividends payable to the Company’s shareholders are
recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in
which the dividends are approved by the Company’s
shareholders. Interim dividends payable are recognised in the
period in which the dividends are paid.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value on the date
the derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently
re-measured at fair value. The fair value of derivatives is
determined by using a valuation model and is primarily based on
observable market data. The method of recognising the resulting
gain or loss from the re-measurement depends on whether the
derivative is designated as a hedging instrument, and if so, the
nature of the item being hedged.
The Group’s policy is to designate on the date that the derivative
contract is committed to. The Group designates derivatives as:
– A hedge of the fair value of a liability (fair value hedging
instrument), or
– A hedge of the cost of a highly probable forecast transaction or
commitment (cash flow hedging instrument).
T o qualify for hedge accounting, the Group is required, at
inception, to document in advance the relationship between
the item being hedged and the hedging instrument. The Group is
also required to document and demonstrate an assessment of
the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging
instrument, which shows that the hedge will be highly effective
in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of the hedged
item on an ongoing basis. This effectiveness testing is
re-performed at each reporting date to ensure that the hedge
remains highly effective.
The effectiveness of hedging instruments is assessed using the
hypothetical derivative method. This involves the comparison
of the changes in fair value of the hedging instrument to a
hypothetical derivative which has critical terms that match the
hedged item.
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as highly
effective fair value hedging instruments are recorded in the
income statement within interest expense, together with the
change in the fair value of the hedged item attributable to
the hedged risk.
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives
designated as cash flow hedging instruments is recognised in
equity within the hedging reserve. The change in the fair value
relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately
in the income statement within interest expense.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Leasing – as lessee
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified
as finance leases. Assets held under finance leases or hire
purchase contracts are capitalised on inception of the agreement
at an amount equal to their fair value or, if lower, the present
value of the minimum lease payments. The interest element of
the lease cost is charged to the income statement, within other
operating expenses, over the lease period so as to produce a
constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the
liability for each period.
Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases or
hire purchase contracts are depreciated over the shorter of the
period of the agreement and the estimated useful lives of the
assets.
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and
rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases, net of any incentives
received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement,
within other operating expenses or staff costs (in the case of
company cars), on a straight line basis over the period of
the lease.
Borrowings
Borrowings include bank borrowings, debenture loans and other
borrowings, overdrafts and obligations under finance leases and
hire purchase contracts.
Bank borrowings, debenture loans and other borrowings are
recognised initially at fair value, being their issue proceeds
net of any transaction costs incurred. These borrowings are
subsequently stated at amortised cost. Any difference between
the proceeds, net of transaction costs, and the redemption value
is recognised in the income statement over the period of the
borrowings using the effective interest method.
Current tax
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the period
as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed.
It is calculated using rates of tax that have been enacted by the
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on
temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial
statements. Deferred tax is recognised in the income statement
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in
equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Deferred tax is determined using tax rates and laws that have
been enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to
apply when the related deferred tax asset is realised or the
deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profit will be available against
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity.
Shares are recorded at their nominal value with any surplus
received on their issue taken to the share premium account.
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares
are shown in equity as a deduction from the proceeds.
OVERVIEW 00––11 OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW 12––40 GOVERNANCE 41––68 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 69––118 SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION 119––120 NOTES TO THE ACCOUNTS
For the year ended 31 December 2007 continued
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income
statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit,
i.e. when the forecast interest payment that is hedged takes
place.
When a cash flow hedging instrument expires or is sold, or
when a cash flow hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge
accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that
time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast
transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the
cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is
immediately transferred to the income statement.
If a fair value hedging instrument no longer meets the
effectiveness criteria, the adjustment to the carrying value of
a hedged item, for which the effective interest method is used,
is amortised to income over the period to maturity.
2. KEY SOURCES OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY AND
JUDGEMENT
Loan loss provisioning
The Group reviews its loans and receivables on an ongoing basis
to assess the level of impairment. Future cash flows are
estimated on the basis of the contractual cash flows of the assets
and historical loss experience. Historical loss experience is
adjusted on the basis of current observable data to reflect the
effects of current conditions that did not affect the period on
which the historical loss experience is based and to remove the
effects of conditions in the historical period that do not exist
currently. T o the extent that the net present value of estimated
future cash flows differs by +/– 1%, the loan loss provision in the
balance sheet would be an estimated £28.4 million lower/higher
(2006: £21.1 million lower/higher).
Goodwill impairment reviews
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an
estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has
been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the entity to
estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGUs
and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value.
The carrying amount of goodwill at the balance sheet date was
£39.5 million (2006: £39.5 million). Details of the value in use
calculation are provided in note 14 on page 89.
Retirement benefit obligation
The valuation of the retirement benefit obligation is dependent
upon a series of assumptions, the key ones being mortality rates,
investment returns, salary inflation, the rate of pension increases
and the extent to which members take up the maximum tax free
commutation on retirement.
Mortality estimates are based on standard mortality tables,
adjusted where appropriate to reflect the Group’s own
experience. The returns on fixed interest investments are set to
market yields at the valuation date to ensure consistency with
the asset valuation. The returns on UK and overseas equities are
set by considering the long-term expected returns on these asset
classes using a combination of historical performance analysis,
the forward looking views of the financial markets (as suggested
by the yields available) and the views of investment
organisations. The salary inflation and pension increase
assumptions reflect the long-term expectations for both
earnings and retail price inflation. The assumption as to how
many members will take up the maximum tax free commutation
on retirement is based on the scheme’s own experience of
commutation levels.
The principal assumptions used in the valuation of the
retirement benefit obligation as at 31 December 2007 are set out
in note 31 on page 115.

3. REVISED FORMAT OF THE INCOME STATEMENT
The format of the income statement adopted by the Group has
been revised in order that it more appropriately reflects the
nature of the Group’s principal activity, that of lending, as
permitted by IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’ and
IFRS 7 ‘Financial instruments: Disclosures’.
The impact of this change on the Group’s income statement for
the year ended 31 December 2006 is that certain items of income
and expense are presented differently. These differences are
explained as follows, and illustrated in the restatement below.
– T otal revenue is analysed into four categories, being interest
income, fee and related income, revenue from sale of goods and
other operating income.
– The heading finance costs is replaced by interest expense and is
shown deducted from interest income to give net interest
income.
– The heading other cost of sales has been replaced. The cost for
the purchase of goods and the loan loss charge, previously
included in this heading, are now shown separately. Other
items previously included in this heading are included within
other operating expenses.
– Administrative expenses have been split into either staff costs or
other operating expenses.

The Group’s income statement for the year ended 31 December 2007 contains certain headings for income and expense which
are different from those that would have featured had the revision to the format not taken place. This impact is illustrated in the
table below.
The revision to the format of the income statement has had no impact on the Group’s profit after taxation for the years ended

£5.2 million (2006: £2.3 million) were awarded to key management under these schemes.
In addition, certain members of key management have interests in the Group’s executive share option schemes. At 31 December 2007
16,000 options previously granted to key management were outstanding (2006: 16,000) of which 16,000 (2006: 16,000) were
exercisable. No options in these schemes (2006: no options) were exercised by key management during the year.

appointment of auditors to the Group’s pension scheme, and the fees paid in respect of such of £8,780 (2006: £8,570), are agreed by
the trustees of the scheme, acting independently from the management of the Group.
In appointing the external auditors to carry out non-audit services, and in setting their fees for such work, the directors have due
regard to the Group’s policy in respect of non-audit services as set out in the Audit Committee Report on page 51 and the benefits,
financial and non-financial, expected to be obtained. In the opinion of the directors, these services should benefit the Group in the
future.
For the year ended 31 December 2007 all other services principally related to advisory work in relation to the Group’s response to the
Competition Commission’s inquiry into the payment protection insurance market, the Group’s defined benefit pension scheme and
the Group’s share-based payment awards, whereas in 2006 these services primarily related to distributable reserves planning work.
The charges for audit and non-audit services are included within other operating expenses. The Company is not required to disclose
details of its own non-audit services.

13. EARNINGS PER SHARE
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number
of ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding own shares held (note 29) which are treated, for this purpose, as being cancelled.
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all
dilutive potential ordinary shares.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

Goodwill relates entirely to the Group’s consumer credit division and the impairment review performed as at 31 December 2007
demonstrates significant headroom.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use calculations
are those regarding discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to loan loss rates and direct costs. Management estimates
discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the
consumer credit division. Changes in loan loss rates and direct costs are based on historic experience and expectations of short-term
future changes in the market. The Group prepares a cash flow forecast derived from the approved budget for the following year and
extrapolates this in line with historic long-term UK GDP growth. The cash flows are discounted using a pre-tax discount rate of 7.9%
(2006: 9.3%).
The Company has no goodwill.

The internally generated computer software principally relates to the cost of developing Welcome Finance’s customer relationship
management systems. The carrying value of these systems, which includes certain items of acquired software, amounts to 
£54.4 million (2006: £37.2 million). For the systems which have been commissioned, and hence where amortisation of the cost has
commenced, the remaining amortisation period is approximately five and a half years (2006: six and a half years).
Internally generated computer software additions include £2.3 million (2006: £2.2 million) in respect of capitalised borrowing costs.
All amortisation charges for the year have been charged to the income statement through other operating expenses. 91

Credit risk
Credit risk in relation to loans and receivables is the risk that financial loss arises from the failure of a customer to meet their
obligations under a loan agreement.
A description of the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing credit risk and how it is measured is set out in the
Operating and Financial Review on pages 19 to 21 in the section entitled ‘Credit risk’. Details are also given in relation to the
concentration risk associated with the Group’s receivables in the section entitled ‘Concentration risk’ on page 23.

T otal 532.1
Shopacheck receivables which are classified as past due but not impaired of £71.5 million (2006: £63.8 million) have not been
analysed into past due bandings since the collection performance of this type of loan is not managed with reference to the extent of
any contractual arrears arising during the entire period of the loan since its inception. Instead, performance is managed, and the need
for any loan loss provision considered, with reference to the value of contractual payments received in only the preceding 13-week
period. This approach prohibits any meaningful disclosure of the ageing of the debt by reference to its contractual past due status.
In addition, the directors consider that this disclosure of the Shopacheck receivables is not material in the context of the Group’s total
loans and receivables of £2.8 billion (2006: £2.1 billion).

Collateral
The Group holds collateral in relation to certain of its loans and receivables, further details of which are provided below:
• Welcome Finance
In accordance with IFRS 7 implementation guidance notes paragraph 36(b), Welcome Finance does not fair value the collateral held as
security in respect of its secured loan and hire purchase receivables on the basis that it would be impracticable to do so and instead
provided below is an explanation of the nature of the collateral held. It would be impracticable to fair value the collateral held because
information on the value of customers’ properties and first charge mortgage liabilities is not maintained. Additionally, the only way of
estimating the fair value of used motor vehicles on hire purchase would be on an aggregate basis, which may result in the collateral
disclosure being misleading when some loans in a portfolio are over-collateralised, and other loans have insufficient collateral. In
these circumstances, netting the fair value of the two types of collateral would under-report the amount of credit risk.
– Secured loans
Secured loans are not underwritten based on equity, but on the customer’s ability to afford the loan repayments, with the emphasis
placed on assessing and verifying the customer’s incomings and outgoings. A legal charge ranking second or third is registered
against the customer’s property, to ensure that the customer prioritises repayments of the secured loan.
– Hire purchase
Hire purchase loans are advanced to customers for the purchase of used motor vehicles. The terms of the hire purchase contract
allow the customer to voluntarily terminate and allow Welcome Finance to repossess the vehicle, both subject to meeting certain
criteria.
A customer may voluntarily terminate the hire purchase contract provided they have paid at least 50% of the contract and have not
received a notice of default. In this instance the vehicle is returned to Welcome Finance and disposed of, with the proceeds offset
against the customer’s outstanding balance. Any remaining balance is written off.
Legally, Welcome Finance may repossess a vehicle financed on a hire purchase contract, provided the customer has paid less than
one third of the contract and a notice of default has been issued. Welcome Finance endeavour to negotiate arrangements with the
customer to avoid the need for repossession. Vehicles that are repossessed are promptly disposed of at auction and the proceeds
offset against the customer’s outstanding balance. The customer is liable for any remaining balance.
• Cattles Invoice Finance
In addition to the value of the underlying assigned sales ledger balances, Cattles Invoice Finance will wherever possible obtain
additional security before offering invoice finance facilities to a client. These include limited personal guarantees from major
shareholders, charges over personal and other business property, cross guarantees from associated companies, and unlimited
warranties in the case of frauds. These additional forms of security are impracticable to fair value as valuations of the guarantees or
warranties are not capable of being accurately determined at any point during the agreement.

An analysis of the arrears status of the Group’s trade receivables and the Company’s loan to the employee benefit trust has not been
presented as the amounts concerned are not significant.
The Group and Company’s other receivables at 31 December 2007 and 2006 are considered neither past due nor impaired. The other
receivables of the Group principally relate to profit share debtors arising from the sale of insurance policies, which are due, in
accordance with the prescribed payment terms, from third-party insurers.
20. DEFERRED TAX
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary timing differences under the liability method using a tax rate of 28% (2006: 30%).
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary timing differences giving rise to deferred tax
assets because it is probable that these assets will be recovered.
All of the deferred tax liabilities are available for offset against deferred tax assets and hence the deferred tax asset at each balance
sheet date is shown net.
The movements in the deferred tax account are shown below:

Other timing differences principally relate to either timing differences arising from changes in accounting policies following the
transition to IFRS, actuarial gains and losses on the retirement benefit obligation, fair value gains and losses relating to cash flow
hedging instruments or share-based payments.
Of the Group and Company’s deferred tax balance at 31 December 2007, £9.8 million (2006: £14.7 million) and £10.3 million
(2006: £10.0 million) respectively is expected to be realised in more than one year.

23. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
A description of how the Group is exposed to interest rate and currency risk in relation to its borrowings, as well as details on the
Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing these risks and how they are measured, is set out in the Operating and
Financial Review on page 22 in the sections entitled ‘Interest rate risk’ and ‘Currency risk’. Details are also given in relation to the
counterparty credit risk associated with the Group’s derivative financial instruments in the section entitled ‘Counterparty credit risk’
on pages 22 and 23.
Interest rate risk
At 31 December 2007, the Group and the Company held interest rate swaps covering floating rate bank borrowings of £1.0 billion
(2006: £707.0 million), effectively fixing the associated cost of interest at rates between 4.01% and 5.72% (2006: 4.01% and 6.43%). In
addition, the Group and the Company held a collar covering a further £10.0 million (2006: £10.0 million), which is allowed to floatata
floor rate of 4.25% and a cap rate of 4.75% (2006: floor rate of 4.25% and a cap rate of 4.75%).
Except for the collar, all of the interest rate financial instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. The gains and losses deferred in
equity will be recorded in the income statement during the next ten years (2006: five years), being the remaining lives of the
instruments.
Foreign currency risk
All foreign currency denominated borrowings are immediately swapped into sterling at the commencement of the facility agreement
and, hence, the Group and the Company are not exposed to currency rate fluctuations.
Of the Group and the Company’s cross-currency swaps £75.5 million (2006: £75.5 million) are designated as fair value hedges and, as
a consequence, the change in the fair values of these swaps is recorded in the income statement within interest expense, together
with the change in the fair values of US Dollar denominated tranches of a private placing which the swaps have hedged.
The remaining £47.2 million (2006: £47.2 million) of cross-currency swaps are designated as cash flow hedges and were taken out to
hedge against the interest and currency risk associated with US Dollar and Euro denominated tranches of a private placing.
The following table shows the fair value of derivative financial instruments, as well as their notional amounts that equal the amount
of the associated borrowing:
2007 2006

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of the derivative assets in the balance sheet.
Neither the Group nor the Company holds any other derivatives and neither have they identified embedded derivatives which require
separate accounting for in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: Recognition & measurement’.

Sensitivity analysis
An increase in LIBOR by one percentage point would have an adverse impact on profit for the year of £1.9 million (2006: £2.4 million)
and a favourable impact on equity of £34.1 million (2006: £20.1 million).
The Group is not exposed to currency risk because all foreign currency denominated borrowings are immediately swapped into
sterling at the start of the related facility agreement for the term of the borrowings.
Fair values of non-derivative financial instruments
The following table summarises the carrying values and fair values of those financial instruments not recognised in the balance sheet
at fair value, except for those financial instruments (being loans and receivables, trade and other receivables, cash and cash
equivalents, bank overdrafts, trade and other payables, intra-group receivables and payables, and obligations under finance leases and
hire purchase contracts) whose carrying values approximate to their fair values.

Debenture loans and other borrowings (969.3) (976.9) (686.1) (692.0)
The fair values of bank borrowings, debenture loans and other borrowings are calculated by discounting expected future cash flows.
Expected future cash flows are derived using interest rates reflected in yield curves available at each balance sheet date and at
exchange rates prevailing at each balance sheet date.
Effective interest rates
The following profile of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities is stated after taking into account the effect of the interest rate
swaps discussed above.
2007 2006
Weighted average effective interest rates at year-end % %
Loans and receivables* 46.8 42.0
Cash equivalents* 5.9 5.2
Bank borrowings 5.6 5.4
Debenture loans and other borrowings* 7.1 7.3
Obligations under finance leases and hire purchase contracts* 6.6 6.4
*Individually these assets and liabilities bear interest at fixed rates
Interest on floating rate bank borrowings is based on a fixed margin over floating rate LIBOR, as pre-determined by each facility
agreement.
The weighted average effective interest rates on the Group’s cash and bank overdrafts are based on the prevailing UK base rate less
0.1% and plus 1.0% (2006: less 0.1% and plus 1.0%) respectively.
The weighted average effective interest rates in relation to the Company’s financial assets and liabilities are the same of those of the
Group, except for loans and receivables which was 6.9% at 31 December 2007 (2006: 6.8%). 105

Long-term incentives include the Long-Term Incentive Plan, the Management Share Plan, the Restricted Share Award and the Restricted Share Scheme.
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over an appropriate period, consistent with the assumed option life. The
expected life is the average expected period to exercise from the date of grant. The vesting period represents the contractual period to
the earliest vesting date. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the
assumed option life.

Hedging reserve
From 1 January 2005, the Group achieved hedge accounting such that the hedging reserve includes the effective portion of the
cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments relating to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
The reserve also includes the unamortised portion of a hedging reserve which arose, in the absence of hedge accounting under IAS 39
‘Financial instruments: Recognition & measurement’, on transition to IFRS of £0.4 million at 31 December 2007 (2006: £0.7 million).
This element of the hedging reserve is being amortised through the income statement in a way so as to reflect how the item that was
being hedge accounted under UK GAAP has affected profit or loss in the year.
Own shares held reserve
The own shares held reserve comprises the cost of the shares in Cattles plc held by the employee benefit trust to meet obligations
under the Group’s long-term incentive plans. The shares were acquired by the trust in the open market using funds provided by 
the Company.

The Group and Company operates a funded defined benefit scheme for certain employees, providing benefits based on final salary.
The assets of the scheme are held in a separate trustee-administered fund. Contributions to the scheme are assessed in accordance
with the advice of an independent qualified actuary using the projected unit method. The scheme was closed to new applicants
from 1998.
The retirement benefit obligation included in the balance sheet is analysed as:
2007 2006
£m £m
Present value of plan liabilities 72.9 78.1
Fair value of plan assets (58.8) (54.3)
Retirement benefit obligation 14.1 23.8
The amounts charged in the income statement in respect of the defined benefit plan are as follows:
2007 2006
£m £m
Current service cost (i) 1.4 1.5
Interest cost 3.9 3.8
Expected return on plan assets (3.8) (3.3)
Past service cost (ii) – (2.0)
T otal defined benefit pension expense (note 8) 1.5 –
(i) Current service cost is net of employee contributions.
(ii) The past service cost reflected the change in commutation benefits available to members following an amendment to the scheme
rules, which arose from the change in pension legislation effective from 6 April 2007 (A-Day).
The defined benefit pension expense is included in staff costs in the income statement.
The total return on plan assets was £4.3 million, £0.5 million in excess of that assumed (2006: the total return was £6.4 million,
£3.1 million in excess of that assumed).
The cumulative actuarial gains and losses (before deferred tax) recognised in the statement of recognised income and expense in
respect of the defined benefit plan are as follows:

each class.
Cash – Yield on long-term cash investments at the balance sheet date.

Members contribute at the rate of either 3% or 5% of pensionable salaries, depending on their membership status. The estimated
amount of employee contributions for 2008 is £0.3 million.
The participating employer companies make normal contributions of 3.4 times members’ contributions such that the estimated
amount of normal employer contributions for 2008 is £1.0 million. In addition, the Company has entered into an agreement with the
pension scheme whereby it will make additional shortfall contributions of £2.2 million per annum. Therefore, the estimated total
amount of employer contributions for 2008 is £3.2 million.
Work in respect of the actuarial valuation of the fund as at 31 March 2007 is currently in progress and the Company and trustees will
agree the funding target and contributions during 2008.
Impact of IFRIC 14
Work is currently being undertaken to establish how interpretation IFRIC 14 ‘IAS 19 – The limit on a defined benefit asset – minimum
funding requirements’, which is effective from 1 January 2008, will impact on the value of the Group and Company’s retirement
benefit obligation going forward. This assessment will take account of the latest actuarial valuation and the new schedule of
contributions to be agreed in 2008, however it is expected that the adoption of IFRIC 14 will have no material financial impact as at
1 January 2008. 117

The Plan is run and administered by the Company’s Registrars,

Welcome Financial Services comprises three
businesses:
– Welcome Finance
– Shopacheck
– Welcome Car Finance
Welcome Finance, the principal lending business,
serves more than 500,000 customers, providing
direct repayment loans from 183 branches across
the UK. Its product range includes unsecured
personal loans, second charge secured loans and
hire purchase for cars. Details on its business
model are set out on the opposite page.
Shopacheck provides short-term home collected
loans to some 260,000 customers through 52
branches.
Welcome Car Finance sells around 14,000 used cars
a year from 12 sites and is the largest introducer of
hire purchase business to Welcome Finance.
The Lewis Group is a UK leader in debt recovery and
investigation services, serving both external clients
and Welcome Financial Services. It is one of the
UK’s largest buyers of non-performing debt.
Cattles Invoice Finance provides working capital
finance to small and medium-sized businesses. It
operates through six regional offices in England
and Scotland.
O OU UR R  C CU US ST TO OM ME ER RS S
The great majority of our customers (over 500,000)
have loans from Welcome Finance. We only
advance these direct repayment loans to
customers who are in employment, have a bank
account and can repay by direct debit. Most are in
socio-economic groups C and D, but a significant
proportion come from higher categories.
These are some typical customer scenarios:
W We el lc co om me e  F Fi in na an nc ce e
Unsecured personal loan
Mr A, 25, is a mechanic who is single and lives with
his parents in Manchester. He earns £17,500 and
borrowed £2,000 over three years to pay for a
holiday and repay an existing loan. He applied
online after being rejected by his bank.
Second charge secured loan
Mr B, 46, is a fireman and his wife, 42, is a part-time
teacher. They live in Norwich and have a joint
income of £30,000. They borrowed £9,000 over 
10 years for home improvements. They applied
through a broker, who referred them to Welcome
Finance as they had limited equity in their home.
Hire purchase
Mr C, 38, is an office manager in Watford earning
£25,000. He borrowed £6,000 over four years to
buy a car from Welcome Car Finance. He applied
direct to Welcome Car Finance after seeing an
advert on TV.
S Sh ho op pa ac ch he ec ck k
Mrs D, 36, is an administrator and single. She
bought her East London council house. She earns
£300 a week, paid into her bank account. She
borrowed £200 over 30 weeks to fund Christmas
shopping.
T Th he e  L Le ew wi is s  G Gr ro ou up p
Credit card company, E plc, has several million
customers and each month it sells accounts which
are in default.  Lewis buys these, at a discount, and
collects the sums outstanding.
Bank F plc also has customers in default but it
prefers to outsource the collection of overdue
accounts.  Lewis carries out this work and charges
the bank a commission on the amounts it collects.
C Ca at tt tl le es s  I In nv vo oi ic ce e  F Fi in na an nc ce e
G Ltd specialises in wholesale organic food
products, turning over £1.5 million a year. Its
business was growing and the company had to
take on 12 additional employees to meet demand,
but wholesalers were requiring extended credit
and G Ltd needed access to extra capital. Cattles
Invoice Finance provided flexible finance, securing
advances against invoices.
AT A GLANCE
C CA AT TT TL LE ES S  P PL LC C
Cattles plc is a financial services group
specialising in providing consumer
credit to non-standard customers in
the UK. We also provide debt recovery
services to external clients and our
consumer credit business, and working
capital finance for small and medium-
sized businesses. We also have a car
retail operation, which is the largest
introducer of hire purchase customers
to our consumer credit business.
In the consumer credit market, 
non-standard refers to customers who
may currently not have access to
mainstream facilities – typically due to
perceived shortcomings in their
employment, residency or credit
histories. We give them an opportunity
to build or repair their credit profile.
Effective risk management is
paramount in all our markets, and
underpins our strategy for continued
strong growth.

Welcome Finance lends to individuals with non-standard
credit profiles – providing unsecured and secured personal
loans, and hire purchase for cars. Its interest rates are
priced to reflect the credit risk exposure. 
It has a well-developed national network of introducers.
Managing credit risk is integral to the business model –
principally through effective bespoke credit scoring and
centralised underwriting processes, and the close customer
relationships maintained by the national network of local
community branches.

• Affordability tests and proofs of both income and identity
• Policy rules
Once assessment is complete, products are allocated according 
to the applicant’s risk rating.

Relationships are managed as follows:
• Branches employ local people with good communication skills, 
who understand local conditions
• Once a loan has been advanced, customers are contacted by a
customer account manager to begin establishing a close working
relationship
• This ensures a prompt response if they experience difficulty 
with repayments and enables a practical plan to be agreed to help
them avoid arrears
At the LMBs, specialist account managers 
work with customers to ensure regular
payments resume. This enables the accounts 
to be transferred back to the Branch Network
and prevents them from falling into more
serious arrears.
L Lo oc ca al l  C Co ol ll le ec ct ti io on n  U Un ni it ts s  ( (L LC CU Us s) )
At the LCUs, account managers agree new
repayment plans with customers. At this stage
the business is focused on recovering the
outstanding balance and would no longer
consider these customers for additional credit.
If a customer’s financial difficulties prove to be
longer-term, the account is transferred to a Local
Collection Unit.
If a customer is unable to make a meaningful
payment at the LCU, their account is transferred
to The Lewis Group. 
T Th he e  L Le ew wi is s  G Gr ro ou up p
The Lewis Group is able to collect accounts
economically and manages any necessary 
legal action.
If an account misses two payments, it is passed to a Local Management Branch.

CATTLES PLC — WHAT WE DO
Our philosophy is to
‘lend short and borrow
long’, ensuring we have
funding headroom,
secured ahead of need
and hedged against
interest rate volatility.
We have refined our
credit scoring and
underwriting processes
over many years, so our
acceptance of credit risk
is rigorously controlled. 
Knowing customers
personally is what our
community branches
are for. They help us to
build relationships 
and manage arrears 
if customers’
circumstances change.
We reach our
customers through 
our network of brokers,
strategic partners 
and introducers, our
nationwide branches
and online.
We have consistently
benefited from
investment in our
people: their skills 
and experience enable
us to manage risk
successfully while
providing excellent
customer service.
High quality IT helps 
us recruit and select
customers, matching
their credit status and
needs to our products.
Our scalable systems
will grow with our
customer base.

We have been able to sustain strong income and profit growth because 
our experience, commitment, people and infrastructure enable us to benefit
from market opportunities in both buoyant and tough economic conditions.
We aim to increase shareholder value significantly by becoming the UK’s leading
non-standard financial services group.

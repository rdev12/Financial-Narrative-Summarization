Oxford BioMedica in brief 
Oxford BioMedica is one of the leading companies in gene therapy 
and immunotherapy with a platform of exclusive and pioneering 
technologies to design and develop unique gene-based medicines.  
Our pipeline addresses diseases for which there is currently  
no treatment or that are inadequately treated today, including 
cancer, neuro-degenerative and ocular diseases, and our product 
candidates have the potential to transform treatment landscapes. 
Through our in-house development programmes and our 
collaborations with leading industry partners, our goal is to improve 
the lives of patients with debilitating and life-threatening diseases.
Our core technology platforms are:
LentiVector
®
 platform
Our proprietary gene delivery system, called the LentiVector
®
 
platform technology, was invented through pioneering work 
initially at Oxford University and then through in-house 
development. The LentiVector
®
 platform is based on lentiviral-
derived vectors which can deliver a significant amount of genetic 
information into cells safely and very efficiently. The LentiVector
®
 
platform technology utilises “stripped-down” versions of 
lentiviruses. Technology highlights include:
—  Long-lasting delivery of genetic material into target cells
—  No toxicity or adverse immune reaction
—   Integration of genes into non-dividing cells  
(e.g. neurons in the brain, retinal cells in the eye)
—   Large capacity for multiple therapeutic genes  
(e.g. three genes in ProSavin
®
)
Oxford BioMedica’s pre-clinical and clinical studies suggest that  
a single administration of its LentiVector
®
 platform products can 
provide long-term, sustained or permanent gene expression.
5T4 tumour antigen platform
The 5T4 antigen was discovered by scientists at Cancer Research 
UK, a founding shareholder of Oxford BioMedica in 1996, who 
granted us exclusive rights to its intellectual property relating to 
the 5T4 antigen and antibody. The 5T4 tumour antigen is a unique 
protein found on most common types of solid cancer including 
prostate, colorectal, ovarian, breast, renal and non-small cell lung 
cancer. It is potentially a valuable target for novel anti-cancer 
interventions given:
—   Restricted expression in normal tissues
—   High prevalence on the surface of both primary  
 and metastatic cancerous cells 
The market opportunity for the 5T4 platform technology  
is, therefore, significant.
Our mission
…is to build a top-tier profitable biopharmaceutical company 
founded on the successful development and commercialisation  
of novel gene-based medicines. Oxford BioMedica plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2011 01
The novel treatments and medicines 
we are developing target high unmet 
needs, addressing chronic and inherited 
diseases. They have the potential to 
transform treatment prospects, thus 
improving the quality and duration  
of life for patients with debilitating  
and life-threatening diseases.
Reducing the social care burden
With the potential of a single administration  
providing long-term therapeutic benefit, our  
LentiVector
®
 platform products could significantly  
reduce the social care burden associated with  
neuro-degenerative or ocular diseases.
We are well-positioned to maximise  
the potential of our proprietary 
technologies through in-house 
development, collaborations and 
licensing. In doing so, we aim to retain 
long-term value from the successful 
development and commercialisation  
of our innovative product candidates.
Big Pharma’ needs robust pipelines
The fundamentals of the pharmaceutical industry  
model are undergoing significant change which  
we believe represents an opportunity for innovators  
such as Oxford BioMedica.

Chairman’s Message
 
Tough economic environment
The complexity of today’s global economic environment has affected all 
industries, not just the pharmaceutical and biotechnology sector. Cautious 
investors are steering clear of equity markets and non-profitable, “binary-risk” 
biotechnology companies no longer dominate the UK healthcare & life 
sciences sector. However, the fundamentals of the pharmaceutical industry 
model are undergoing significant change which we believe represents  
an opportunity for innovators such as Oxford BioMedica. 
Successful pharma-biotech alliances are essential
The pharmaceutical companies best equipped to deal with the challenges 
ahead are those with robust pipelines capable of offsetting the impact from 
expiring patents and cuts in R&D. Consolidation and alliances will continue  
to transform the market as companies adapt to changing conditions within 
the industry. Oxford BioMedica has innovative technology platforms, a diverse 
product portfolio and world-class industry collaborations with partners such 
as Sanofi and Pfizer. With one of the broadest patent estates in our chosen 
fields, we are well-positioned to leverage the value of our products and 
intellectual property through strategic partnerships.
Strong management team
Under the leadership of John Dawson, Chief Executive Officer, Oxford 
BioMedica has evolved from being a research-driven organisation into  
a more commercially-focused company. The management team has the 
breadth and depth of expertise necessary to manage the Company in today’s 
environment including R&D, clinical development, regulatory, intellectual 
property management, manufacturing, business development, due diligence 
and finance. With development risk now spread across the broadest  
clinical portfolio to date, the management team has strategically focused  
on key therapeutic areas of interest such as neuroscience, ocular disease  
and oncology.
Board changes
In May 2011, Dr Alan Kingsman left the Board of Oxford BioMedica and  
I stepped up from Deputy Chairman to become Chairman. I would like  
to express my sincere thanks to Alan for his invaluable contribution to the 
Company. Dr Alex Lewis was also appointed Director of Corporate Activities 
and Strategy in May 2011 and, as a result, stepped down from the Board. 
Andrew Wood stepped down as Chief Financial Officer in February 2012 
having made a substantial contribution to the Company since its IPO  
in 1996. We wish Andrew all the best for the future and welcome Tim Watts 
who has been appointed to the Board as Chief Financial Officer and  
Company Secretary.
Strategy commitment
Oxford BioMedica has clear strategic priorities ahead to secure corporate  
and commercial success. The Company’s growth and success will not  
only come from commercial partnerships but also future corporate activity.  
The Board is continuously monitoring expenditure and, having recently 
reduced the Company’s cost base, Oxford BioMedica has tight fiscal controls 
in place. As with all biotechnology companies, we continue to review our 
options in terms of how best to finance the Company to allow us to achieve 
our strategic aims.
In conclusion
The operational achievements in 2011 are a result of the sheer hard  
work and dedication of our staff, so I would like to thank everyone for their 
commitment over the past year. I would also like to thank our partners and 
shareholders for their long-term support, particularly given the volatile nature 
of the global biotechnology sector. We have challenges ahead; however  
with increasingly valuable assets I remain confident that the management 
team will continue to make progress towards a strong future.
Nick Rodgers
Chairman
Operationally, 2011 was a successful 
year for Oxford BioMedica resulting 
in substantial growth across the 
Company’s clinical portfolio, the 
strategic investment in proprietary 
manufacturing, multiple regulatory 
approvals and new industry 
collaborations. However, we are 
acutely aware that securing a 
commercial partner for ProSavin
®
 
has taken longer than anticipated. 
We have clear strategic priorities 
ahead and, with multiple initiatives 
ongoing, remain committed  
to securing a strong future for  
the Company.

Pursuing partners to help take  
programmes forward
With one of the broadest patent estates in our chosen 
fields, we are well-positioned to leverage the value of 
our products and intellectual property through strategic 
partnerships. We are actively pursuing multiple partnering 
initiatives with a primary focus on ProSavin
®
 and 
TroVax
®
. For TroVax
®
 in particular we are also exploring 
collaborations through clinical networks which provide 
significant leverage for our investment. With patience  
and tenacity, we believe that we can secure strong deals 
with the right partners for our innovative products.
As a biopharmaceutical company we continuously  
aim to enhance our assets to reinforce patent life, 
optimise cost of goods and increase the commercial 
opportunity at all levels of development. During 2011  
we improved elements for ProSavin
®
 and TroVax
®
 such 
as clinical analyses, regulatory pathways, future trial 
design and manufacturing. We are actively pursuing 
multiple initiatives to secure further funding for our  
core programmes and continue to evaluate development 
strategies in light of our financial resources.

Manage risks and resources
Realising the value of pioneering innovation within  
the field of biotechnology comes with inherent  
risk. Our strategy is to mitigate both technical and  
financial risk through partnerships that bring the  
clinical, regulatory and commercialisation capabilities 
required to maximise the market potential of our novel 
treatments. We take careful consideration in allocating 
resources and remain focused on developing our core 
products which we believe have the highest potential  
in the near-term.
Until we reach sustainable profitability we continue  
to strike a balance between growing the Company 
whilst also being careful with costs. During 2011  
we reviewed the Company’s business operations to 
implement a stronger emphasis on clinical development 
and commercialisation. Our aim is to ensure that  
Oxford BioMedica is an efficient, focused and resilient 
organisation. With multiple opportunities ahead, we 
remain confident in our ability to bring in future revenue 
and continue to run the business in order to deliver  
on our strategy.

Strategic objectives: Oxford BioMedica plc  Annual Report and Accounts 2011 07
Ensuring timely delivery  
of pipeline
There is a sense of urgency in what we do and timely 
delivery is a core component of Oxford BioMedica’s 
strategy. As one of the leading companies in the field  
of gene therapy and immunotherapy, we work 
closely with regulatory agencies to define appropriate 
development pathways. As with other biotechnology 
companies in the sector, forecasting product 
development timelines is particularly challenging, 
especially with our product candidates which are based 
on ground-breaking science and have the potential  
to offer new treatment paradigms. We endeavour  
to provide guidance on timelines based on our best 
assumptions and are committed to ensuring timely 
delivery of our goals and milestones.

Seizing opportunity
Oxford BioMedica has evolved from being a research-
driven organisation into a more commercially-focused 
company. The management team has the breadth  
and depth of expertise necessary to manage the  
Company in today’s environment and enables us to  
respond quickly to market conditions and opportunities. 
In February 2011 we acquired a UK manufacturing  
facility for £1.9 million which represents a fraction of  
the cost of a new build. This investment in our specialist 
manufacturing processes will address one of the  
main hurdles associated with the rapid progression  
of products through Phase II, Phase III and to market 
and, importantly, also provides the opportunity for  
us to become the LentiVector
®
 platform supplier  
of choice for current and future partners.
In addition to organic growth, we remain alert to 
external opportunities for strategic and well-conceived 
corporate activity as a means to accelerate profitability.
Key achievements 2011
—   Acquisition of UK manufacturing facility  
in February 2011
Focus 2012
—    Our growth and success will not only  
come from commercial partnerships but  
also future corporate activity Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 08
Portfolio progress
The initiation and development of three pioneering Phase I/II ocular  
gene therapy studies is not only a historic milestone for Oxford BioMedica,  
but is also of great significance to the field of ophthalmology – particularly  
in orphan indications such as Stargardt disease and Usher syndrome. 
ProSavin
®
 continues to generate positive data in the current Phase I/II study  
in Parkinson’s disease and further product optimisation provides significant 
potential to increase benefit for patients and reduce the development risk, 
thus enhancing the commercial opportunity. Whilst recruitment for our 
TroVax
®
 Phase II study in prostate cancer is challenging given the new 
treatment landscape in the US, the support and enthusiasm from the oncology 
community is encouraging and we are pleased to be working with multiple 
academic groups on the future development of this important asset. 
Alongside our core programmes, the new collaborations with Mayo Clinic, 
ImaginAb and our strengthened alliance with Pfizer further validate our 
innovative technology platforms.
Proprietary manufacturing
The new manufacturing facility is expected to deliver long-term operational 
and financial efficiencies and will support our products through Phase II, 
Phase III and to market. It also provides the opportunity for us to become the 
LentiVector
®
 platform supplier of choice for our current and future partners 
which could provide additional revenues. The successful commissioning of 
the manufacturing facility is a significant achievement for Oxford BioMedica 
and the hard work continues in preparation to secure our MHRA license  
to support clinical manufacturing and supply.
Partnering initiative
Building the value of novel products takes time. As a biopharmaceutical 
company we continuously aim to enhance our assets to reinforce patent 
protection, optimise cost of goods and increase the commercial opportunity 
at all levels of development. Whilst we cannot influence data, during 2011  
we improved elements within our control for ProSavin
®
 and TroVax
®
 such as 
clinical analyses, regulatory pathways, future trial design and manufacturing. 
We are actively pursuing multiple initiatives to secure further funding for  
our core programmes and continue to evaluate development strategies  
in light of our financial resources.
Financial management
Our cash position at 31 December 2011 was £14.3 million and we have 
sufficient financial resources to fund the business until Q1 2013. This does  
not take into account potential milestone payments should Sanofi elect 
to exercise its options for the ocular products during 2012, nor does it  
factor in potential revenue from partnering deals. However, until we reach 
sustainable profitability we continue to strike a balance between growing  
the Company whilst also being careful with costs. During 2011 we reviewed 
the Company’s business operations to implement a stronger emphasis  
on clinical development and commercialisation. Our aim is to ensure that 
Oxford BioMedica is an efficient, focused and resilient organisation. As a result, 
management has reduced the Company’s cost base, implemented a reduction 
in headcount of 16 staff and closed the US office in San Diego, California. 
Outlook
As I have said before, I believe Oxford BioMedica has strong fundamentals,  
an exciting development pipeline and a commercially-focused management 
team. Whilst securing further funding for ProSavin
®
 has taken longer than 
expected, our achievements during 2011 demonstrate our ability to deliver 
operational progress. With multiple opportunities ahead, we remain confident 
in our ability to bring in future revenue and continue to run the business  
in order to deliver on our strategy.
John Dawson
Chief Executive Officer 
Chief Executive’s  
Review
Following the £20 million 
fundraising at the start of 2011,  
we set ourselves multiple R&D and 
commercial milestones for the year. 
With three IND approvals from  
the US regulatory agencies within 
12 months, our ocular portfolio  
is progressing extremely well and 
we have successfully commissioned 
our new manufacturing facility. 
Whilst ProSavin
®
 has produced  
the most encouraging results to 
date, we are taking an appropriately 
prudent approach towards the  
next key stage of development. 
With further product optimisation, 
we will ensure the greatest chance 
of success in randomised studies. 
With careful consideration  
towards our financial resources,  
we continue to evaluate the most 
effective strategies to further 
advance our products towards 
commercialisation.

Our vision has always been clear.  
To find new ways and weapons with 
which we can fight debilitating and  
life-threatening diseases. It’s no small 
challenge.
Our hard work, determination and 
commitment drives each gradual step

 has generated to date 
demonstrate its potential to make  
a huge difference to those of us 
living with this terrible condition. 
For 40 years, people with 
Parkinson’s have struggled with  
the complexities and side-effects  
of oral L-DOPA. What we have  
seen with ProSavin

Examples
Parkinson’s disease
Results from the ongoing ProSavin
®
 
Phase I/II study are regularly reviewed 
by an independent Data Monitoring 
Committee (DMC); a multidisciplinary 
panel with expertise in Parkinson’s 
disease and virology. In December 
2011 Oxford BioMedica reported that, 
in addition to ProSavin
®
’s long-term 
safety profile, the DMC confirmed 
that the highest 5x dose shows most 
promising signs of efficacy to date.
We are pleased that ProSavin
®
  
and the enhanced administration 
technique continue to demonstrate  
a long-term safety profile. The 
signals of improvements in motor 
function with decreased oral 
dopaminergic therapy observed to 
date are encouraging, particularly  
at the 5x dose. Functional imaging 
data also suggest possible dopamine 
provision attributable to ProSavin

at this dose. We would support 
investigation of a further dose 
escalation for this novel product  
as part of a Phase II development 
programme.

Chair of the independent DMC
Ocular diseases
Our ocular programmes are monitored 
by an independent Data Safety 
Monitoring Board (DSMB), comprising 
a panel of specialists in the fields of 
ophthalmology, virology and vectoro-
logy. In January 2012, Oxford BioMedica 
received a positive interim review of 
the ongoing RetinoStat
®
 and StarGen
™
 
ocular programmes by the DSMB.
We work closely with the clinicians 
and Principal Investigators who lead 
our ocular clinical trials at:
—    The Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns 
Hopkins, Baltimore (USA)
—    The Oregon Health & Science 
University’s Casey Eye Institute, 
Portland, Oregon
—    The Centre Hospitalier National 
D’Opthalmologie des Quinze-
Vingts, Paris
We have a strong relationship with the 
Foundation Fighting Blindness, a US 
non-profit organisation that provided 
early funding for our pre-clinical ocular 
programme. Please see pages 30-31 
for a detailed summary of this alliance.
In addition, we are delighted to 
be collaborating with Mayo Clinic, 
Rochester (USA) to develop a novel 
gene therapy for the treatment of 
chronic glaucoma.
Cancer
We continue to receive interest from 
oncologists and clinicians regarding 
the future development of TroVax
®
, 
our cancer vaccine, in several cancer 
indications which have a clear unmet 
medical need and a lack of effective 
treatments. We are currently working 
with a number of UK collaborators 
and expect multiple sponsored Phase 
II studies to be initiated in 2012 by:
—    Cardiff University (targeting 
colorectal cancer)
—    Cardiff University and Velindre 
Cancer Centre (targeting 
mesothelioma)
—   UK National Cancer Research 
Network (targeting ovarian cancer) Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 12
Being part of the collective  
team involved in the pre-clinical 
development and eventual 
initiation of three Phase I/II ocular 
gene therapy studies has been  
a fantastic experience. These  
are the first US studies to directly 
administer lentiviral-derived vector 
treatments to patients – it is great  
to be at the forefront of such 
pioneering clinical development.

Seeing things  
through
Our regulatory success to date  
demonstrates our ability to bring  
pioneering therapies to patients.
With no gene therapy product 
approved in the EU or US, we work 
very closely with the regulatory 
agencies in order to define the 
development pathways for our 
novel gene therapies.
Our regulatory expertise
In December 2007, we received 
regulatory approval from the French 
regulatory agency, AFSSAPS, to 
start the first clinical trial using the

Case study
Successful acquisition of  
UK manufacturing facility  
in Cowley, Oxford
In February 2011, we acquired a UK 
manufacturing facility for £1.9 million 
which represents a fraction of the 
cost of a new build. The facility 
totals approximately 16,000 square 
feet, which includes c. 4,400 square 
feet in cleanrooms, and is situated 
less than three miles from our head 
office. An integrated team comprising 
manufacturing, development, quality 
control, quality assurance, engineering 
and logistics expertise have been 
engaged in commissioning the  
facility throughout 2011.

Operational Review
LentiVector
® 
Platform
The LentiVector
®
 Platform:
Oxford BioMedica’s proprietary 
LentiVector
®
 technology platform  
is a highly efficient system for the 
delivery of therapeutic genes to  
a wide range of tissues, and it has 
specific advantages for targeting 
diseases of the central nervous 
system and the eye. The Company’s 
most advanced LentiVector
®
 
platform candidate is ProSavin
®
 for 
Parkinson’s disease. In partnership 
with Sanofi, Oxford BioMedica  
is also developing four products  
for the treatment of ocular diseases. 
These five core LentiVector
®
 
platform candidates benefit from  
a common manufacturing platform 
and regulatory procedures. The 
Company is also working with 
leading scientific teams to address 
other unmet needs, such as the 
treatment of glaucoma and motor 
neuron disease.
ProSavin
®
 
Gene-based therapy for 
Parkinson’s disease (PD)
ProSavin
®
 is being evaluated in  
a Phase I/II trial to assess the safety, 
efficacy and dose evaluation in 
patients with mid-stage Parkinson’s 
disease who are experiencing 
reduced benefit on L-DOPA 
“equivalent” therapy. Three ascending 
dose levels (1x, 2x and 5x) have  
been evaluated in 15 patients  
to date. Six patients received the  
2x dose, three of which were treated 
using an enhanced administration 
procedure which facilitates higher 
dosing and reduces surgical delivery 
time of the 2x dose by approximately 
50%. The highest (5x) dose level  
of ProSavin
®
, which is the scaled 
equivalent to the optimal dose in 
pre-clinical studies, is being assessed 
in the most recent six-patient cohort. 
Patients have been treated at  
two centres of excellence for 
neurosurgery; the Henri Mondor 
Hospital in Paris, France with 
Professor Stéphane Palfi as Principal 
Investigator and Coordinating 
Investigator, and at Addenbrookes 
Hospital in Cambridge, UK with  
Dr Roger Barker as Principal 
Investigator.
Highlights 2011

  Phase I/II study in Parkinson’s 
  disease
—  DMC confirmed that highest 
  (5x) dose shows most promising 
  efficacy to date
—   Further product optimisation

increase in dopamine production
Positive data presented at largest 
scientific conference for genetic  
& cellular therapeutics
In May 2011, data from the Phase I/II 
study were presented at the American 
Society of Gene & Cell Therapy 
(ASGCT) 14th Annual Meeting held  
in Seattle, USA by Professor Stéphane 
Palfi. A six-month assessment of  
the third patient cohort, treated  
with a 2x dose of ProSavin
®
 using  
an enhanced administration method, 
revealed the highest efficacy results 
observed to date with 43% average 
motor function improvement and  
a maximum of 61% in one patient.  
In addition, patient diary measures 
such as increased functional “ON” 
time (when PD symptoms are not 
present), reduced “OFF” time (after 
withdrawal of PD medication) and 
improved quality of life also support 
the positive impact on patients’ lives; 
further underlining the potential  
for ProSavin
®
 to address the motor 
symptoms of PD.
Encouraging signs of clinical 
benefit for Parkinson’s patients
In August 2011, Oxford BioMedica 
reported a positive interim review  
of the fourth patient cohort, treated 
with the highest (5x) dose of 
ProSavin
®
, by the study’s independent 
Data Monitoring Committee (DMC). 
At the three-month time point,  
the highest average motor function 
improvement of 29% was observed, 
with a maximum of 49% improvement 
in one patient. Patients also reduced 
their average daily dose of L-DOPA 
“equivalent” therapy, whereas typically 
they would require an increase  
in dose given the nature of this 
inexorably degenerative disease. 
Importantly, the DMC acknowledged 
that the improvements in motor 
function with decreased oral 
dopaminergic therapy observed  
to date are encouraging and clinically 
relevant. If replicated in randomised 
studies, such levels of improvement 
would make a substantial difference 
to a patient’s life. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 19
Significant long-term 
improvements vs. progressively 
degenerating disease
As part of an interim review in 
December 2011, Oxford BioMedica 
and its clinical experts performed  
an efficacy analysis across all  
15 patients treated at the latest 
available assessment time points  
and concluded:
 —   Interim data show that ProSavin
®
 
mediates improvement in motor 
function in all cohorts at six-
month primary efficacy endpoint
—   Population analysis of first three 
cohorts (12 month data for n=9) 
shows ProSavin
®
 significantly 
improves motor function relative  
to baseline in progressively 
degenerating disease:
  —    Improvement remains 
statistically significant up  
to 12 months
  —    Improvement over baseline 
maintained up to 24 months 
(first two cohorts, n=6)
—   ProSavin
®
 demonstrates efficacy 
across range of disease severity − 
important in a disease such  
as PD where patient population  
is heterogeneous
—    Average reduction in L-DOPA 
“equivalent” therapy in all cohorts
In addition to the improvements 
observed across multiple endpoints, 
functional imaging data using 
Positron Emission Tomography (PET) 
scans to produce a detailed, three-
dimensional picture inside the body 
also suggest dopamine (DA) provision 
attributable to ProSavin
®
 at the 
highest (5x) dose.
 
Independent experts confirm  
5x dose shows most promising 
efficacy to date
In December 2011, Oxford BioMedica 
also announced a positive review of 
all four patient cohorts by the study’s 
independent DMC; a multidisciplinary 
panel with expertise in Parkinson’s 
disease and virology. In addition to 
ProSavin’s long-term safety profile, 
now up to 36 months post-treatment 
(1x dose), the DMC confirmed that the 
fourth patient cohort (5x dose) shows 
most promising signs of efficacy  
to date (see table below).
Support from DMC to investigate 
enhanced construct in Phase II 
programme
Oxford BioMedica and its clinical 
experts believe that the interim 
ProSavin
®
 data set continues  
to support planning for a sham-
controlled Phase II study. During  
2011, the Company identified and 
developed an enhanced product 
construct based on ProSavin’s
®
 
dopaminergic enzymes. The new 
construct can potentially provide  
up to a 10-fold increase in dopamine 
production capacity, allowing further 
dose escalation without impacting 
volume or rate of administration.  
In addition, the new construct offers 
extended patent protection and a 
relative reduction in cost of goods, 
thus increasing the commercial 
opportunity for ProSavin
®
. With  
the support of the study’s independent 
DMC, Oxford BioMedica is evaluating 
a strategy to move the new construct 
into development as part of a Phase  
II programme.

Operational Review
LentiVector
® 
Platform
Partnering initiative
As previously announced, partnering 
discussions for ProSavin
®
 have been 
influenced by: a potential partner’s 
view of the risk associated with the 
early stage of the product; the ability 
to control future manufacturing;  
and the regulatory path to registration 
given that ProSavin
®
 is an entirely 
novel product. Following the 
European Medicines Agency’s 
validation of the planned route  
to registration and the acquisition  
of a UK manufacturing facility,  
Oxford BioMedica has successfully 
addressed two of these key issues.
In terms of the risk associated  
with ProSavin
®
 as an early stage  
gene therapy for PD, moving into  
a randomised Phase II study will  
add significant value and further 
de-risk the product. Given the 
encouraging clinical results and 
positive analyses to date, Oxford 
BioMedica had anticipated that data 
from the highest (5x) dose cohort 
could crystallise a partnering deal  
in late 2011 or early 2012. However, 
whilst independent experts have 
confirmed that the 5x dose of 
ProSavin
®
 has indeed shown the  
most promising signs of efficacy  
to date, interested parties are keen  
for Oxford BioMedica to investigate 
the enhanced product construct  
as part of a Phase II programme to 
ensure the greatest chance of success 
in randomised studies. As a result, 
securing further funding via a 
development partnership for this  
core programme has taken longer 
than expected. With further product 
optimisation ongoing, a randomised 
Phase II study is unlikely to be 
initiated in 2012. Oxford BioMedica  
is focused on non-clinical bridging 
studies and preparing the regulatory 
pathway for future US and EU 
regulatory applications. 
Next milestones
The primary efficacy end-point  
of the current Phase I/II study  
is the six-month UPDRS assessment, 
allowing time for improvements  
in patients’ condition to stabilise 
including appropriate adjustments  
in background oral dopaminergic 
therapy. Results from all six patients  
in the fourth (5x dose) cohort  
are expected in H1 2012. In the 
meantime, the Company holds 
regular updates with interested 
parties and is evaluating the most 
effective strategy to advance 
ProSavin
®
 into its next stage  
of development.
Market opportunity
Parkinson’s disease affects 
approximately 1.5 million patients  
in the seven major markets  
(US, Japan, UK, France, Germany,  
Italy and Spain) which is projected  
to rise to 1.7 million by 2019. None  
of the current treatments provide 
long-term relief from symptoms,  
yet, by 2019, sales of these treatments 
could exceed US$2.8 billion in  
the seven major markets (source: 
Datamonitor, Dec-2010). ProSavin
®
 
has the potential to address a major 
unmet medical need in Parkinson’s 
disease, offering long-lasting benefit 
from a single administration with an 
excellent safety profile. The product 
could therefore also significantly 
reduce the social care burden  
that is associated with the mid  
to late-stage of disease.
Oxford BioMedica is focused  
on non-clinical bridging studies  
and preparing the regulatory 
pathway for future US and EU 
regulatory applications.

Ocular Portfolio
Gene-based therapies
In collaboration with Sanofi,  
Oxford BioMedica is developing  
four LentiVector
®
 platform product 
candidates for the treatment of  
ocular diseases: RetinoStat
®
 for “wet” 
age-related macular degeneration 
(AMD); StarGen
™ 
for Stargardt disease; 
UshStat
®
 for Usher syndrome type  
1B; and EncorStat
®
 for corneal graft 
rejection. This partnership is an 
endorsement of the Company’s 
LentiVector
®
 platform and, 
furthermore, Sanofi’s investment  
in the platform technology benefits 
Oxford BioMedica’s development 
programmes in other therapeutic 
areas. Oxford BioMedica is also 
privileged to be working with Mayo 
Clinic, Rochester (USA) to develop  
a novel gene therapy for the 
treatment of chronic glaucoma.

®
 
Phase I/IIa study
Landmark partnership  
with Sanofi
The ocular collaboration with Sanofi, 
signed in April 2009, included an 
upfront receipt of US$26 million and 
up to US$24 million in development 
funding over the initial phase of 
development. Following successful 
Phase I/II completion, Oxford 
BioMedica may receive further 
undisclosed license fees, milestone 
payments and royalties on product 
sales, the terms of which are 
consistent with other deals of this 
scope and size. Furthermore, there  
is considerable opportunity to expand 
the collaboration with the addition  
of other indications and related 
product candidates. For example, 
RetinoStat
®
 could be evaluated  
as a treatment for diabetic  
macular oedema.
Three ocular IND applications 
approved by FDA within 12 months
Oxford BioMedica works very closely 
with the regulatory agencies in order 
to define the development pathways 
for its novel gene therapies. In 
November 2010, the US Food and 
Drug Administration (FDA) approved 
Oxford BioMedica’s Investigational 
New Drug (IND) application for 
RetinoStat
®
, resulting in the initiation 
of the first US clinical study using  
the Company’s LentiVector
®
 platform 
technology in January 2011. This was 
a major event for Oxford BioMedica 
and would also support subsequent 
LentiVector
®
 platform regulatory 
submissions. Accordingly, the FDA 
approved the StarGen
™ 
and UshStat
®
 
IND applications in March and 
October 2011, respectively.  
Receiving three IND approvals from 
the US regulatory agencies within  
12 months represents an exceptional 
achievement for the Company’s  
R&D and regulatory teams. Oxford 
BioMedica also held a pre-IND 
meeting with the FDA in September 
2011 for EncorStat
®
 to discuss the 
proposed development strategy  
in preparation for a Phase I/II trial. 
Together with Sanofi, the Company 
continues to evaluate the optimal 
route for commercial development  
of this novel product.
Lead RetinoStat

 Phase I trial  
in “wet” AMD on track
Six patients have been treated with 
RetinoStat
®
 in the ongoing US Phase I 
study in neovascular “wet” age-
related macular degeneration (AMD). 
Three patients received the first dose 
level, three received the second dose 
level and the third patient cohort 
(dose level 3) is underway. The open 
label, dose escalation Phase I study 
will enrol 18 patients with “wet” AMD 
at the Wilmer Eye Institute at Johns 
Hopkins, Baltimore (USA). Led by 
Professor Peter Campochiaro, the 
study will evaluate three dose levels 
and assess safety and aspects of 
ocular physiology. Oxford BioMedica 
is on track to announce first results  
in H1 2012.
There is considerable opportunity  
to expand the Sanofi collaboration 
with the addition of other indications 
and related product candidates.

Platform
First gene therapy clinical  
trials in Stargardt disease and  
Usher syndrome underway
There are currently no approved 
treatments for Stargardt disease and 
Usher syndrome type 1B and other 
potential strategies do not target the 
root cause of the disease. As such, 
StarGen
™ 
and UshStat
®
 have received 
both European and US Orphan  
Drug Designation which brings 
development, regulatory and 
commercial benefits. 
In June 2011, the first patient in the 
StarGen
™ 
Phase I/IIa study in Stargardt 
disease was treated in the US. In July 
2011, the French regulatory agency 
(AFSSAPS) approved the opening of  
a second clinical site in France. In the 
US, the study is led by Professor David 
Wilson at the Oregon Health and 
Science University, Portland, Oregon. 
In France, Professor Jose-Alain  
Sahel leads the study at the Centre 
Hospitalier National D’Opthalmologie 
des Quinze-Vingts, Paris. Four patients 
have been treated to date at the first 
dose level and the second cohort 
using dose level 1 in earlier-stage 
patients is underway. The open label, 
dose escalation Phase I/IIa study  
will enrol up to 28 patients and will 
evaluate three dose levels for safety, 
tolerability and aspects of biological 
activity. First results are expected  
in H2 2012. 
In February 2012, the UshStat
®
 Phase 
I/IIa study in Usher syndrome type 1B 
commenced in the US at the Oregon 
Health & Science University’s Casey 
Eye Institute. Led by Professor Richard 
Weleber as Principal Investigator,  
the open label, dose escalation Phase 
I/IIa study will enrol up to 18 patients 
and will evaluate three dose levels  
for safety, tolerability and aspects  
of biological activity. Initial results  
are expected in H2 2012.
Positive reviews from independent 
Data Safety Monitoring Board
In June 2011, Oxford BioMedica 
reported a positive interim review  
of the first RetinoStat
®
 patient cohort 
by the study’s independent Data 
Safety Monitoring Board (DSMB);  
an independent panel of specialists  
in the fields of ophthalmology, 
virology and vectorology. RetinoStat
®
 
was safe and well-tolerated at one 
month following treatment with no 
signs of inflammation in the eye. 
In January 2012, the Company 
received its second positive DSMB 
review of the RetinoStat
®
 and 
StarGen
™ 
programmes. Both products 
demonstrated a favourable safety 
profile with no serious adverse events 
related to RetinoStat
®
, StarGen
™  
or the methods of administration. 
Importantly, RetinoStat
®
 and StarGen
™ 
demonstrate continued safety  
six months and one month post-
treatment, respectively. The DSMB 
gave its support to proceed to the 
final ascending dose patient cohort 
for RetinoStat
®
 (dose level 3) and  
the second StarGen
™ 
patient cohort, 
both of which are underway.
Market opportunity
AMD is a major cause of blindness 
affecting an estimated 25 million to 
30 million people worldwide and the 
incidence of AMD is expected to triple 
by the year 2025. Neovascular “wet” 
AMD accounts for 90% of all severe 
vision loss from the disease with  
up to 4.5 million patients worldwide 
(source: AMD Alliance International). 
The industry standard treatment for 
“wet” AMD and other related ocular 
conditions had global sales in excess 
of US$3.7 billion in 2011 (source: 
Novartis/Roche). On the basis of 
pre-clinical data, it is anticipated that 
RetinoStat
®
 may require only a single 
administration. If so, this would give 
the product a significant advantage  
in the market over currently available 
treatments that require frequent, 
repeated administration. There are 
currently no approved treatments  
for Stargardt disease, Usher syndrome 
type 1B and corneal graft rejection. 
StarGen
™
, UshStat
®
 and EncorStat
®
 
have a common technology platform, 
manufacturing technique and safety 
in toxicology studies and it is these 
sorts of niche indications that can 
build significant business value. 
Again, it is anticipated that a single 
application of Oxford BioMedica’s 
gene-based products could provide 
long-term or potentially permanent 
benefits for patients suffering from 
these debilitating diseases.

expected to begin in Q2 2012 to 
evaluate the lowering of intraocular 
pressure following administration  
of the collaboration’s Glaucoma-GT.
Market opportunity
Glaucoma is a group of eye  
diseases characterised by vision  
loss due to damage of the optic  
nerve affecting over 60 million  
people worldwide (source: Mayo 
Clinic). Glaucoma is the biggest 
ophthalmic market with global  
sales of over US$5 billion in 2008 
treating seven million cases in the 
seven major markets. The most 
common form of glaucoma  
is classed as primary open-angle 
glaucoma (also known as chronic 
glaucoma or chronic open-angle 
glaucoma) which accounts for 
75-95% of all glaucoma patients 
(source: Datamonitor 2010). 
Since the start of the chronic 
glaucoma collaboration with  
Mayo Clinic, we have successfully 
initiated the first pre-clinical study 
which aims to demonstrate gene 
transfer using Oxford BioMedica’s 
LentiVector
®
 platform technology.

Platform
MoNuDin
®
Motor neuron disease
The pre-clinical development of 
MoNuDin
®
 is supported by the UK 
Motor Neurone Disease Association 
(MNDA). MoNuDin
®
 has shown 
promising results in early pre-clinical 
studies and Oxford BioMedica is 
optimising the product for clinical 
trials. The Company’s LentiVector
®
 
platform technology has the ability  
to deliver genes safely and efficiently 
to the neuronal cells affected by 
motor neuron disease. Oxford 
BioMedica is working with non-profit 
research groups and organisations to 
explore novel therapeutic approaches 
to treat Amyotrophic Lateral Sclerosis 
(ALS), the most prevalent type  
of motor neuron disease.
Working together with leading 
academic organisations
Oxford BioMedica’s ongoing 
collaboration with VIB/University of 
Leuven, funded by a grant from the 
MNDA, is focused on the pre-clinical 
development of MoNuDin
®
 for the 
treatment of ALS. The collaboration 
builds on previous work funded  
by MNDA and will utilise Oxford 
BioMedica’s LentiVector
®
 platform 
technology to compare the 
therapeutic potential of two forms  
of vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF). Following successful gene 
expression studies in 2011 to evaluate 
the optimal delivery route for this 
approach, Oxford BioMedica has 
demonstrated VEGF expression using 
its LentiVector
®
 platform technology 
in cells and also in vivo using  
two different forms of the VEGF 
therapeutic gene. Further pre-clinical 
work to evaluate the efficacy  
of these VEGF forms is expected  
to start in Q2 2012.
During 2011, in collaboration with the 
University of Bristol, Oxford BioMedica 
also investigated the effects of 
MoNuDin
®
 in a pre-clinical model  
of ALS using a new route of delivery 
for administration directly into the 
cerebrospinal fluid bathing the spinal 
cord. The results of this study have 
demonstrated proof-of-concept  
for this intracerebroventricular 
delivery route.
One of the major hurdles to treating 
motor neurone disease is ensuring 
that therapeutic agents are delivered 
to the relevant site of action in the 
brain and spinal cord; therefore both 
collaborations continue to support 
Oxford BioMedica’s planning for  
the future clinical development  
of MoNuDin
®
.
Market opportunity
Despite being one of the most 
common neurodegenerative diseases 
of adult onset, motor neuron disease 
has a high unmet need. Amyotrophic 
lateral sclerosis (ALS), often referred  
to as Lou Gehrig’s disease, is the  
most prevalent type of motor neuron 
disease. In the US, there are an 
estimated 30,000 patients with  
ALS and nearly 6,000 new cases  
are diagnosed annually (source:  
ALS Association). Only one drug  
has been approved for the treatment 
of ALS and its benefit is a modest 
increase in survival time. If MoNuDin
®
 
proves to be an effective neuro-
protective treatment that can slow  
or arrest injury to patients’ motor 
neurons, it would have compelling 
competitive advantages.

Manufacturing
Historically, all of Oxford BioMedica’s 
manufacturing to Good Manufacturing 
Practice (GMP) standards has  
been outsourced to a contract 
manufacturing organisation. 
However, given the pivotal role  
of manufacturing in biological  
drug development and the planned 
growth of the Company’s clinical 
LentiVector
®
 platform portfolio during 
2011, Oxford BioMedica conducted a 
strategic review in 2010 to maximise 
control and minimise risks associated 
with manufacturing.
Highlights 2011
—   Successful acquisition of
  specialist manufacturing facility 
  to support core programmes
—   Commissioning pr ocess  
complete and on budget
—  Preparation for MHRA license  
  on track to enable GMP  
  manufacturing for clinical supply
Successful acquisition  
of UK manufacturing facility  
in Cowley, Oxford
In February 2011, Oxford BioMedica 
acquired a UK manufacturing facility 
for £1.9 million which represents a 
fraction of the cost of a new build. 
The facility totals approximately 
16,000 square feet, which includes  
c. 4,400 square feet in cleanrooms,  
and is situated less than three miles 
from the Company’s head office.  
This investment in the Company’s 
specialist manufacturing processes 
will address one of the main hurdles 
associated with the rapid progression 
of products through Phase II, Phase III 
and to market and, importantly,  
also provides the opportunity  
for Oxford BioMedica to become  
the LentiVector
®
 platform supplier  
of choice for its current and  
future partners.
Commissioning process complete
Oxford BioMedica appointed James 
Christie, a senior biopharmaceutical 
executive with over 30 years of 
experience in the industry, as Head  
of Manufacturing in February 2011. 
Led by James, an integrated  
team comprising manufacturing, 
development, quality control,  
quality assurance, engineering  
and logistics expertise have been 
engaged in commissioning the 
facility throughout 2011. In line  
with expectations and on budget,  
the manufacturing facility is now 
fully-commissioned and produced  
its first pilot run at the end of 2011.
New MSAT team in operation
The Company’s Manufacturing 
Sciences and Technology (MSAT) 
team is now in place. The MSAT team 
covers all aspects of biological and 
fill/finish manufacturing by bringing 
together core expertise in process 
development, process improvement 
and optimisation, technology  
transfer and process monitoring  
and troubleshooting. With MSAT, 
Manufacturing & Supply, Quality 
Assurance and Quality Control, 
Oxford BioMedica has the necessary 
capabilities and core competencies  
to develop and support current  
and future production activities.
Next steps
Oxford BioMedica is currently 
manufacturing product batches  
in preparation for obtaining  
a license from the UK Medicines  
and Healthcare products Regulatory 
Agency (MHRA) to enable GMP 
manufacturing for clinical supply. 
Subject to receiving MHRA approval, 
progress remains on track for  
the manufacturing facility to  
be fully-operational in H1 2012. 
Oxford BioMedica also plans  
to work towards a recognised 
environmental programme.

(MVA-5T4)
Therapeutic cancer vaccine
TroVax
®
 is a late-stage clinical asset 
that has completed 10 clinical trials  
in colorectal, renal and prostate 
cancer. It is currently being evaluated 
in a randomised, open-label Phase II 
study in patients with metastatic 
hormone refractory prostate cancer 
(HRPC). Oxford BioMedica also 
continues to receive interest from 
oncologists and clinicians regarding 
the future development of TroVax

in several cancer indications which 
have a clear unmet medical need  
and a lack of effective treatments.  
A number of sponsored Phase II

In March 2011, analyses of the TroVax
®
 
Renal Immunotherapy Survival  
Trial (“TRIST”) Phase III study were 
published in Cancer Immunology, 
Immunotherapy; the official journal 
of the Association for Cancer 
Immunotherapy. Oxford BioMedica 
has identified an algorithm biomarker 
(the “Immune Response Surrogate”) 
for predicting the quantitative  
5T4 antibody response induced  
by TroVax
®
 in order to identify  
those patients who are most likely  
to mount a strong 5T4 antibody 
response subsequent to TroVax
®
 
administration. Importantly, the 
biomarker was also relevant when 
applied to an independent dataset 
derived from the nine historic Phase I 
and II studies in patients with renal, 
colorectal and prostate cancer, which 
suggests that the biomarker could 
potentially be applied to multiple 
cancer types. The biomarker will be 
used in all future TroVax
®
 clinical trials 
in order to target a more responsive 
patient population, including the 
ongoing HRPC Phase II trial.
Phase II study in hormone 
refractory prostate cancer (HRPC)
The ongoing randomised, open-label 
Phase II study in patients with 
metastatic HRPC is designed to 
evaluate the activity of TroVax
®
 plus 
chemotherapy drug docetaxel, versus 
docetaxel alone. The study is being 
led by Dr Anna Ferrari, New York 
University Cancer Institute (USA)  
and has been carefully designed  
to give early proof-of-concept  
by monitoring changes in prostate 
specific antigen kinetics, one of  
the most widely used oncological 
biomarkers in clinical research. 
The first centre started recruiting 
patients in September 2010 and  
the number of recruiting clinical  
sites expanded to eight during 2011. 
However, with new prostate cancer 
treatments on the US market,  
in addition to other clinical trials 
targeting the same indication, 
competition for suitable patients  
is high. As a result, recruitment  
rates during H2 2011 were slower 
than anticipated and two of the 
centres have ceased recruitment.  
As previously communicated, initial 
results from patients treated to  
date are still expected in H2 2012  
and Oxford BioMedica is closely 
monitoring the progress of  
this study.
The 5T4 Tumour Antigen Platform:
Oxford BioMedica’s proprietary  
5T4 antigen is an ideal target for 
anti-cancer treatment given its 
restricted expression on normal 
tissues and its high prevalence  
on the surface of cancerous  
cells across a wide range of  
solid tumours. TroVax
®
 is Oxford 
BioMedica’s 5T4-specific therapeutic 
vaccine candidate which is in Phase 
II development. In partnership with 
Pfizer, pre-clinical evaluation of 
Oxford BioMedica’s 5T4-targeted 
antibody is ongoing to optimise  
the product for clinical development. 
Pfizer also has non-exclusive rights 
for the in vitro diagnostic use  
of 5T4 antibodies. The Company  
is also collaborating with ImaginAb  
to engineer an in vivo diagnostic 
imaging agent using an antibody 
targeting 5T4 for positron emission 
tomography (PET) cancer imaging. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 27
Multiple sponsored Phase II studies 
to be initiated by collaborators
In April 2011, the team of cancer 
immunologists at Cardiff University 
and Velindre Cancer Centre, Wales 
(UK) received a favourable opinion 
from the Gene Therapy Advisory 
Committee (GTAC) and CTA approval 
from the Medicines and Healthcare 
products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 
to undertake a Phase II study for 
TroVax
®
 in patients with malignant 
pleural mesothelioma. The study  
will be funded by the June Hancock 
Mesothelioma Research Fund and  
the Velindre Cancer Centre Stepping 
Stones Appeal and Oxford BioMedica 
will provide TroVax
®
. Recruitment  
is expected to commence during  
H1 2012.
Oxford BioMedica’s collaborators  
at Cardiff University received MHRA 
approval in July 2011 and a favourable 
GTAC opinion in August 2011 to 
evaluate TroVax

 in patients with 
inoperable metastatic colorectal 
cancer. The Phase II study will  
be sponsored by Cardiff University  
and Oxford BioMedica will provide 
TroVax
®
. Recruitment is expected  
to begin during H1 2012.
The Company continues to work 
with its partners at the UK National 
Cancer Research Network (NCRN) in 
order to develop a Phase II metastatic 
ovarian cancer protocol. The protocol 
received a positive review by the 
Clinical Trials Awards and Advisory 
Committee (CTAAC) in November 
2011. Following amendments to 
reflect the CTAAC opinion, the study 
protocol will be submitted to the 
GTAC. Subject to GTAC approval, the 
study is estimated to start in Q3 2012.
Partnering initiative
Expenditure on TroVax
®
 is  
closely monitored and, given the 
interest within the oncology field, 
management continues to explore 
collaborations through clinical 
networks in order to generate further 
data and leverage the value of the 
product. Securing a development  
or financial partner for TroVax
®
’s 
future late-stage development 
remains a key strategic priority  
for the Company and discussions 
with interested parties are ongoing.
Market opportunity 
At $47.7 billion, cancer is one of  
the largest, fastest growing markets  
in the pharmaceutical industry, 
according to MarketResearch.com.  
In prostate cancer alone, the global 
vaccine market is expected to reach 
US$2.3 billion in 2017; growing  
at a compound annual rate of 66% 
(source: GlobalData). TroVax
®
 is  
not prostate cancer specific and  
is administered in the same way  
as most infectious disease vaccines 
are given; a simple injection in the 
arm. If TroVax
®
 is shown to be 
efficacious in a pivotal registration 
trial for even just one of the major 
cancers where it is known that 5T4  
is present on the tumours, it has 
significant potential.

In May 2011, Oxford BioMedica 
broadened its licensing agreement 
with Pfizer granting non-exclusive 
rights for the in vitro diagnostic  
use of 5T4 antibodies, including  
an option for commercialisation of  
a 5T4-based diagnostic. The potential 
value of this collaboration is now  
up to US$28 million, which comprises 
upfront payments, license option  
fees and milestone payments that are 
subject to the achievement of certain 
project objectives. The next milestone 
payment to Oxford BioMedica would 
be due if Pfizer initiates clinical trials 
for the development of a 5T4-targeted 
antibody therapy.
Data presented by Pfizer at ISREC 
Symposium 2011 in Switzerland
In September 2011, Pfizer presented 
new data at the ISREC Symposium 
which confirmed that 5T4 is the single 
oncology target for the antibody-drug 
conjugate (ADC) technology licensed 
from Seattle Genetics earlier this year. 
The Oncology Research Unit has 
synthesised an anti-5T4 antibody-
drug conjugate (ADC), called 
A1-mcMMAF, and has shown that 
A1-mcMMAF can eradicate tumour 
cells that have heterogeneous 
expression of 5T4.
Market opportunity
The concept of an anti-cancer 
therapy, which has antibody-like 
specificity as well as chemotherapy-
like potency, is clearly attractive.  
The 5T4-targeted antibody therapy 
has the potential to benefit patients 
with any solid cancer that expresses 
the 5T4 tumour antigen, which 
represents a multi-billion US dollar 
market. Based on the product’s 
profile, it could have application  
as a single agent or could be used  
in combination with other treatments, 
including therapeutic vaccines, such 
as TroVax

2011 was a year of growth for Oxford BioMedica’s ocular portfolio  
with three pioneering ocular Phase I/II programmes underway and  
a new research and development collaboration with Mayo Clinic, USA  
for chronic glaucoma. Here, Dr Stuart Naylor explains Oxford BioMedica’s 
journey of ocular translational medicine and the importance of strong 
relationships and industry alliances in delivering success. 
Oxford BioMedica was founded in 1995 by Professors Alan and Susan 
Kingsman as a technology spin-out from the University of Oxford’s 
Department of Biochemistry. Our technology is based on a lentiviral gene 
delivery programme using an equine viral vector. This LentiVector
®
 gene 
delivery technology is the most effective platform for targeting non-dividing 
cells such as those in the brain and the eye. It also has the ability to deliver 
therapeutic genes into those cells and express therapeutic proteins for  
the life of a particular cell and therefore, we hope, the life of the patient.
What we aim to do at Oxford BioMedica, which I believe sets us apart in  
the field of gene therapy, is to develop our LentiVector
®
 platform technology 
for clinical application in indications which are an appropriate match. We 
initially started investigating the use of our LentiVector
®
 platform to block  
the aberrant blood vessel growth which underlies “wet” age-related macular 
degeneration (AMD). It was whilst carrying out this research in the retina that 
we first came across the Foundation Fighting Blindness (FFB). Dr Tim Schoen, 
director of science/research communications at FFB, helpfully introduced  
us to the scientific team at FFB. At the same time, we were thrilled to receive  
a call from Dr Rando Allikmets of Columbia University who had already 
established an interest in applying these vectors to retinal diseases  
and, specifically, delivering the ABCA4 gene into a pre-clinical model  
of Stargardt disease.
We are privileged to work closely 
with experts in the field such as  
Dr Allikmets and are extremely 
grateful for the funding that came 
through the FFB and its trustees. 
Without their continued support 
and influence, in addition to our 
strong partnership with Sanofi,  
we would certainly not have 
achieved what we have today.  
We value our partnerships and  
our ocular collaborations are the 
perfect example of what can be 
achieved by working together.

With great support from the FFB,  
we were able to put together a very 
productive collaboration. We have 
strong experience in genetics and 
pre-clinical models at Columbia 
University, and Oxford BioMedica 
provided us with the lentiviral 
vector expertise and platform 
technology. Working together,  
I believe this group of people  
was the main reason for success; 
everybody contributed what they 
knew best and altogether it has 
worked out beautifully.

The Foundation is proud to have 
played a pivotal partnering role  
in advancing these novel ocular 
therapies into clinical development. 
We are delighted by the excellent 
reports coming from Oxford 
BioMedica’s ongoing clinical studies 
for retinal degenerations and are 
pleased to have worked so closely 
with the group throughout the 
stages of development to date. Such 
pioneering clinical development 
efforts hold great promise for saving 
and restoring the vision for millions 
of patients worldwide.
Dr Stephen Rose
Chief Research Officer at the  
Foundation Fighting Blindness
For a genetic disorder such as Stargardt disease, there are currently no 
treatments which try and tackle the root cause of the disease. Children  
are born with a mutated ABCA4 gene which leads to the degeneration  
of photoreceptors in the retina and vision loss. Our LentiVector
®
 platform 
appeared to be well-suited for treating Stargardt disease and, in fact, it was  
the only available technology that could deliver the large ABCA4 genetic 
payload to photoreceptors. We were impressed with Dr Allikmets’ work  
and, having been given the opportunity to apply our technology to Stargardt 
disease, our relationship with Dr Allikmets and FFB quickly facilitated our 
interaction with key opinion leaders in the retinal research field. Importantly, 
our relationships also helped to secure funding to prime an early stage 
pre-clinical ocular portfolio at Oxford BioMedica.
In November 2003, the FFB agreed to fund pre-clinical proof-of-principle 
studies for RetinoStat
®
 in wet AMD. This was followed by an agreement with 
the National Neurovision Research Institute (NNRI), the translational research 
arm of FFB, in October 2006 to fund the development of a portfolio of ocular 
gene therapy products with StarGen
™
 as the lead product in Stargardt disease. 
This funding, originally led by Paul Manning, a director of the NNRI, was 
extended in February 2009 to support the continuing development of 
StarGen
™
. Following several academic publications which raised awareness 
and supported the LentiVector
®
 platform and Dr Allikmets’ work, we were 
delighted to secure a partnership with a large pharmaceutical development 
partner. Sanofi committed US$50 million in April 2009 to bring RetinoStat
®
, 
StarGen
™
 and two other pre-clinical ocular gene therapies (UshStat
®
  
for Usher syndrome type 1B and EncorStat
®
 for corneal graft rejection)  
into Phase I/II clinical development.
Since April 2009, we have made outstanding progress in bringing these  
novel gene therapies to patients. In November 2010, the US Food and Drug 
Administration (FDA) approved our Investigational New Drug (IND) application 
for RetinoStat
®
 which resulted in the initiation of the first US clinical study 
using our LentiVector
®
 platform technology in January 2011. Within 12 months, 
the FDA also approved the StarGen
™
 and UshStat
®
 IND applications and the 
first-ever gene therapy clinical trials in Stargardt disease and Usher syndrome 
type 1B are now underway.
The initiation and development of three ground-breaking Phase I/II ocular 
gene therapy studies is not only a historic milestone for Oxford BioMedica  
and all those involved, but is also of great significance to the field of 
ophthalmology – particularly in orphan indications such as Stargardt disease 
and Usher syndrome type 1B for which there are currently no approved 
treatments. We are particularly excited by the future potential of our 
LentiVector
®
 platform technology which could enable us to swap the genetic 
cargo whilst keeping the same manufacturing processes, thereby creating 
multiple opportunities to apply our technology to other retinal dystrophies.  
If we are successful with StarGen
™
 and UshStat
®
, we should be primed  
and ready to go with the next corrective gene therapy approach.
We continue to work closely with our current partners and clinicians, 
academic institutions, charitable organisations and leaders in the field.  
With four products partnered with Sanofi, our glaucoma collaboration with 
Mayo Clinic and the potential to explore new opportunities, we remain 
extremely encouraged by the potential in our ocular portfolio.

Cash burn in 2011 was £16.5 million, compared to £13.0 million in 2010 and 
the total of cash, cash equivalents and current financial assets at 31 December 
2011 amounted to £14.3 million (2010: £12.3 million).
Revenue in 2011 of £7.7 million was £3.4 million lower than in 2010 primarily 
because R&D funding from Sanofi for the ocular programme was reduced  
as the external programme costs were lower in 2011 by £2.7m. Revenue was 
further reduced in 2011 compared with 2010 because 2010 included £0.6 million 
one-off license income. Cost of sales in 2011 was £0.6 million compared  
with £0.6 million credit in 2010 which was due to the release of a provision. 
Non-exceptional operating expenses of £18.5 million were £1.3 million lower 
than in 2010. The lower ocular programme costs were offset by £1.0m start-
up and commissioning costs at the manufacturing facility that was acquired 
in February 2011. There was a further £3.1 million exceptional impairment  
of intangible assets in 2011 (2010: £3.9 million) as the divestment of Hi-8
® 
MEL  
did not secure a purchaser. The net loss after exceptional items in 2011 was 
£12.6 million, compared with £10.3 million in 2010.

The bulk of the Group’s revenue in 2011 is generated by the ocular collabo-
ration with Sanofi which was initiated in April 2009. The collaboration has two 
elements: a non-refundable upfront payment of US$26 million (£16.6 million) 
which was received in 2009, and R&D funding of up to US$24 million which  
is receivable over the current phase of the collaboration. Revenue recognised  
in 2011 for this collaboration comprised £4.7 million in respect of the upfront 
payment (2010: £4.7 million) and £2.7 million of R&D funding (2010:  
£5.6 million). Deferred income of £4.6 million is expected to be recognised  
in 2012 and 2013. The R&D funding component was lower in 2011 because 
external programme costs were lower than in 2010. Revenue was further 
reduced in 2011 because there was a one-off £0.6 million receipt in 2010  
in respect of the prime-boost technology license with Emergent BioSolutions.

Cost of sales is the royalty payable to third party licensors attributable to 
upfront and milestone payments that are recognised as revenue. In 2010 a 
provision of £1.1 million was released following re-negotiation of the licence 
with Cancer Research Technology (CRT) covering the 5T4 cancer antigen. 
Dependent on certain future commercial milestones that relate to the 
partnering, development and approval of TroVax
®
, up to £1.1 million could 
become payable to CRT. A further write-back of £0.5 million was made  
in respect of this licence in 2009, recognised within non-exceptional cost  
of sales, following a reduction in the estimated royalty rate. 
2011 was a year of significant 
operational progress for Oxford 
BioMedica, and included the raising 
of £20 million before expenses  
in a placing and open offer which 
closed on 10 January 2011 and the 
purchase and commissioning of  
a manufacturing facility in Oxford.

R&D costs comprise external costs (pre-clinical studies, GMP manufacturing, 
regulatory costs, and clinical trials), in-house expenditure (staff, R&D con-
sumables, intellectual property, facilities and depreciation of R&D assets),  
and amortisation of intangibles. External pre-clinical and clinical costs in 2011  
were lower than 2010 by £2.3 million primarily due to lower ocular programme 
costs in 2011 but this was offset by £1.4 million higher in-house UK R&D due 
mainly to the start-up and commissioning costs of the manufacturing facility 
which was acquired in February 2011. External clinical and pre-clinical costs 
from 2006 to 2008 were high due to TroVax
®
 development, particularly the 
TRIST study. In 2009 and 2010 the balance of expenditure shifted away from 
TroVax
®
 to ProSavin

 and the ocular programme which is funded by Sanofi.

Non-exceptional administrative expenses of £3.8 million in 2011 were slightly 
lower than 2010 due mainly to lower employment costs including the charge 
for share options. Legal costs charged to the income statement reduced from 
£1.4 million in 2009 to £0.3 million in 2010, largely due to the costs in 2009  
of defending patent litigation brought by Bavarian Nordic. Other administrative 
expenses in 2008 and 2009 were distorted by foreign exchange gains (2008) 
and losses (2009).

The Group places its cash in bank deposits for periods of up to 12 months  
and generates interest on those deposits. The maturity profile of deposits is 
intended to match planned expenditure. Lower net interest receivable in 2011 
reflects lower interest rates and a lower amount of funds on deposit. The 
dramatic fall in market rates from the end of 2008 had a full-year effect in 2010, 
when the average return on deposits was just 1.29%. The Group has no debt, 
but is recognising as a finance expense the discount on a lease provision

Oxford BioMedica’s UK operating subsidiary is entitled to claim a R&D tax  
credit which is payable in cash to the Company. The credit is based on  
certain eligible expenses, to which a mark-up of 100% (75% before 1 April 
2011) and a tax rate of 12.5% (14% before 1 April 2011) are applied, restricted 
where appropriate to the lower of UK payroll tax (Income Tax and National 
Insurance) and Corporation Tax losses. The reimbursement of R&D costs by 
Sanofi reduces the net eligible expenses for R&D credit. As part of its policy  
to support Small-and Medium-sized Enterprises (SMEs) the Government  
has increased the mark up from 75% to 100% from 1 April 2011 and has stated 
that it intends to increase it further to 125% from 1 April 2012. The increase  
in the mark up from 1 April 2011 has resulted in an increased tax credit in 2011 
compared with 2010. The Group’s US subsidiary supplies services to the UK 
subsidiary subject to a fixed mark-up. Interest is charged by the subsidiary  
at statutory rates for an inter-company loan. This generates a low level of 
taxable income in the USA.  Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 37

Loss for the financial year including exceptional items £12,631,000  
(2010: £10,290,000)
Before exceptional items, the higher net loss in 2011 is attributable principally 
to the £1.1 million credit in cost of sales in 2010 and the £0.6 million license 
income in 2010 from Emergent BioSolutions, neither of which were repeated 
in 2011, and the £1.0 million start-up and commissioning costs of the new

Share issues
At the start of 2011, the Company had 544,875,557 shares in issue.  
On 10 Jan uary 2011 the Company issued 400,000,000 new ordinary shares  
in a placing and open offer, raising £20.0 million before expenses. Expenses  
of £0.8 million were incurred during 2010 in respect of this share issue, 
included in prepayments at 31 December 2010 and charged to the share 
premium account in 2011. Further costs of £0.8 million were incurred  
in closing the share issue in 2011. At 31 December 2011 the Company  
had 944,875,557 shares in issue. 
Cash, cash equivalents and available for sale investments £14,335,000 
(2010: £12,256,000). 
Cash burn £16,488,000 (2010: £13,038,000)
The total of cash, cash equivalents and available for sale investments at  
the end of 2011 was £14.3 million. Cash burn is the aggregate of cash from 
operating activities, proceeds of sale of property, plant and equipment and 
fixed asset investments, purchases of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets, and interest received. It was £16.5 million in 2011, compared 
to £13.0 million in 2010. Cash used in operations in 2011 was £14.3 million, 
£1.0 million less than in 2010 but the 2011 tax credit received was £1.1 million 
lower than in 2010 and 2011 also included the £3.1 million purchase and 
refurbishment of the manufacturing site.
Financial outlook
There has been good operational progress for Oxford BioMedica throughout 
2011 and in particular the ocular programmes in collaboration with Sanofi  
are progressing well. We have successfully commissioned the proprietary 
manufacturing facility to support our core programmes. Subject to receiving 
MHRA approval, this facility should generate significant cost savings by 
increasing operational and financial efficiencies and provides the opportunity 
for the Company to become the LentiVector
®
 platform supplier of choice  
for its current and future partners.
We have sufficient financial resources to fund the business until Q1 2013. 
However this does not take into account potential milestone payments should 
Sanofi choose to exercise its options for the ocular products during 2012, nor 
does it factor in potential revenue from partnering deals for ProSavin
®
 and 
TroVax
®
. Our aim is to ensure that Oxford BioMedica is an efficient, focused 
and resilient organisation and until we reach sustainable profitability we will 
continue to strike a balance between growing the Company whilst also being 
careful with costs. Having recently reduced the Company’s cost base, Oxford 
BioMedica has tight fiscal controls in place. We continue to seek to leverage 
the value of our intellectual property through strategic partnerships and our 
growth and success will also come from future corporate activity. We also 
continue to review our options in terms of how best to finance the Company 
to allow us to achieve our strategic aims. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 40

Business Development Europe. In his 
time at Cephalon he led many of the 
deals that built the European business 
to over 1,000 people, taking the 
business from having no sales in 1998 
to revenue of several hundred million 
US dollars. In 2005, Mr Dawson led 
the US$360 million acquisition of 
Zeneus by Cephalon. Between 1991 
and 1996 he was Director of Finance 
and Administration of Serono 
Laboratories (UK) Limited.

Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Risk assessment and evaluation is an integral  
part of Oxford BioMedica’s planning. Most of the  
Company’s risks and uncertainties are common to  
all development-stage biopharmaceutical companies. 
Where possible, the Company’s strategy is designed  
to manage and mitigate these issues. The Board has 
overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of risk 
management and internal control. The management 
structure of the Group allows the Executive Directors 
to be personally involved in all material aspects of risk 
assessment, management and mitigation. The Board 
members have relevant qualification and experience, 
and they have access to external resources where 
required. The Board meets regularly and frequently 
enough for the full Board to stay informed in a timely 
manner and to oversee this activity. The following are 
the principal risks and uncertainties facing the business. 
Intellectual Property and Patent Protection Risk
Oxford BioMedica’s commercial success depends, 
amongst other things, on maintaining proprietary rights 
to its products and technologies and the Board gives high 
priority to the strategic management of the Company’s 
intellectual property portfolio. There can be no assurance 
that Oxford BioMedica’s products and technologies  
are adequately protected by intellectual property. If  
procee dings are initiated against the Company’s patents, 
the defence of such rights could involve substantial  
costs and an uncertain outcome. 
Third-party patents may emerge containing claims that 
impact Oxford BioMedica’s freedom to operate. There can 
be no assurance that the Company will be able to obtain 
licences to these patents at reasonable cost, if at all, or be 
able to develop or obtain alternative technology. Oxford 
BioMedica aims to preserve the confidentiality of its 
technology. Where copyright, design right and/or “know 
how” protect the Company’s products or technology, 
there can be no assurance that a competitor or potential 
competitor will not independently develop the same 
product or technology. 
Rights of ownership over, and rights to licence and  
use, intellectual property depend on a number of factors, 
including the circumstances under which the intellectual 
property was created and the provisions of any agreements 
covering such intellectual property. There can be no 
assurance that changes to the terms within license 
agreements will not affect the entitlement of the Company 
to the relevant intellectual property or to license the 
relevant intellectual property from others.
Pre-clinical and Clinical Development
Oxford BioMedica currently has five products in active 
clinical trials: ProSavin
®
, TroVax
®
, RetinoStat
®
, StarGen
™ 
and UshStat
®
. Results of pre-clinical studies are not 
necessarily indicative of results that may be obtained  
in clinical trials. The projected timetables for continued 
development of the technologies and related product 
candidates by the Company and/or its partners or 
licensees may be otherwise subject to delay or suspension. 
There is a risk that the failure of any one product 
candidate could have a significant and sustained  
adverse impact on the Company’s share price. 
Furthermore, there is a risk that the failure of one product 
candidate in clinical development could have an adverse 
effect on the development of other product candidates,  
or on the Company’s ability to enter into collaborations in 
respect of product candidates, or to raise additional funds.
Safety and Regulatory Risk
The clinical development and marketing approval of 
Oxford BioMedica’s product candidates are regulated by 
healthcare regulatory agencies, such as the FDA, EMA, 
AFSSAPS and MHRA, in respective territories. The Company 
must conduct pre-clinical studies and clinical trials for 
each of its product candidates to demonstrate safety and 
efficacy, however there can be no assurance that the  
data collected will be sufficient to satisfy the relevant 
regulatory authorities. In addition, the continuation of a 
particular study after review by an independent data 
safety monitoring board or review body does not 
necessarily indicate that all clinical trials will ultimately be 
successfully completed.
During the development stage, regulatory reviews of 
clinical trial applications or amendments can prolong our 
anticipated development timelines. Similarly, there can be 
no assurance of gaining the necessary marketing approvals 
to commercialise our products. Each regulatory authority 
may impose its own restrictions on the product’s use  
or may require additional data before granting approval.
Safety or efficacy issues may arise at any stage of the drug 
development process. Adverse or inconclusive results 
from pre-clinical testing or clinical trials may substantially 
delay, or halt, the development of Oxford BioMedica’s 
product candidates, consequently affecting the Company’s 
timelines for profitability. If regulatory approval is obtained, 
the product and manufacturer will be subject to continual 
review and there can be no assurance that such an 
approval will not be withdrawn or restricted. 
Collaboration and Third-party Risk
Collaborations and licensing are an important component 
of Oxford BioMedica’s strategy to realise value and manage 
risk. The Company is dependent on the successful 
outcome of relationships with outside parties as part of 
research, development, manufacture, commercialisation 
and marketing of products. There can be no assurance 
that the Company’s existing relationships will not be 
terminated or require re-negotiation for reasons that may 
be unrelated to the potential of the programme.
Circumstances may also arise where the failure  
by collaborators and third parties, such as contract 
manufacturers, to perform their obligations in accordance 
with our agreements could delay, or halt entirely, 
development, production or commercialisation of our 
products, or adversely impact our cash flows. Currently, 
the Company’s most important collaborators are Sanofi 
and Pfizer. If the relationship with either of these parties  
is adversely affected, Oxford BioMedica’s development 
programme may also be adversely impacted.  Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 43
Pharmaceutical Pricing and Government Risk
The ability of Oxford BioMedica and its partners  
to commercialise their products may depend on the 
availability of reimbursement from government health 
administration authorities, private health coverage 
insurers and other organisations. There is no assurance 
that adequate reimbursement will be available or that 
satisfactory price levels will be reached. 
If satisfactory pricing cannot be obtained, the Company’s 
future profitability would be adversely affected. In addition, 
there is increasing pressure by certain governments to 
contain healthcare costs by limiting both coverage and 
the level of reimbursement. Based on pre-clinical studies, 
Oxford BioMedica’s LentiVector
®
 platform product 
candidates have the unique potential to provide permanent 
therapeutic benefit from a single administration. The 
pricing of these therapies will depend on assessments  
of their cost-benefit and cost effectiveness.
All governments reserve the right to amend their policies 
in relation to the full, partial or non-reimbursement of  
the price of pharmaceutical products. These policies are 
subject to change at any time in any country and can 
impact profoundly upon the pharmaceutical industry  
as a whole or in part.
Competition Regulation and Risk
Oxford BioMedica is subject to UK and EU competition 
law which may impose fines on companies which  
enter into agreements that restrict competition in the  
EU e.g. licenses or patents which restrict competition.  
The Company’s competitors and potential competitors 
include major pharmaceutical and biotechnology 
companies who may have superior research and 
development capabilities, drugs, manufacturing  
capability or marketing expertise. 
Through the Company’s collaborative strategy, Oxford 
BioMedica aims to work with leading companies in 
respective therapeutic areas. However, there can be  
no assurance that competitors will not succeed in 
establishing superior proprietary positions and developing 
products and technologies that are more effective  
or economic than the Company’s.
Financial Risk
The Company is of the opinion that, taking into account 
existing cash balances, the Group has sufficient working 
capital for its present requirements. Oxford BioMedica’s 
future capital requirements to support operating activities 
and to implement Oxford BioMedica’s business strategy 
are not yet known and will depend inter alia on the 
amount of new commercial funding that it can generate.
Oxford BioMedica’s strategy is to add value to its priority 
in-house programmes by investing in further development. 
The Company aims to offset operating costs through 
partnering and other licensing income. Under the terms 
of the Company’s current collaborations, the receipt  
of further income is dependent on the achievement of 
specific milestones related to development, regulatory  
or commercial progress. Similarly, the timing and 
magnitude of income from new collaborations  
is inherently unpredictable. 
It is possible that the Company may require additional 
financing for the future operation of its business, including 
further equity funding as appropriate where dilution to 
the then existing Shareholders may result. The level and 
timing of future expenditure will depend on a number  
of factors, many of which are currently outside Oxford 
BioMedica’s control. There is no certainty that adequate 
financial resources will be available on a timely basis.
Staff Risk
While Oxford BioMedica has employment contracts with 
all of its personnel, the retention of their services cannot 
be guaranteed. Recruiting and retaining key management 
and scientific personnel is critical to the Company’s 
success. The loss of those employees could weaken 
Oxford BioMedica’s scientific and management capabilities, 
resulting in delays in the development of its drugs and 
impacting negatively on the Company’s business.
Manufacturing Risk
Oxford BioMedica’s product candidates use specialised 
manufacturing processes for which there are few suitable 
manufacturing contractors. There can be no assurance 
that the Company’s current contractors will continue  
to make capacity available at economic prices, or that 
suitable new contractors will enter the market. Oxford 
BioMedica has taken steps to actively mitigate this risk  
by investing in its own manufacturing capability via  
the acquisition of a UK manufacturing facility in February 
2011. There is no guarantee that the in-house capability 
that the Company is seeking to commission will be  
able to supply material for clinical use on a timely  
and cost effective basis. 
Manufacturing processes that are effective and practical  
at the small scale required by the early stage of clinical 
development may not be appropriate at the higher scale 
required for later stages of clinical development or for 
commercial supply. There can be no assurance that 
Oxford BioMedica will be able to adapt current processes 
or develop new processes suitable for the scale required 
by later stages of clinical development or commercial 
supply in a timely or cost-effective manner, nor that the 
in-house facility or external contractors will be able to 
provide sufficient manufacturing capacity when required.
Gene Therapy Risk
No gene-based medicines are currently approved for  
sale in the USA or EU. The commercial success of Oxford 
BioMedica’s products will depend, in part, on acceptance 
by the medical community and the public. Furthermore, 
specific regulatory requirements, over and above those 
imposed on other products, apply to gene therapy and 
there can be no assurance that additional requirements 
will not be imposed in the future. This may increase  
the cost and time required for successful development  
of the Company’s products. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 44
Corporate Governance
Application of the principles in the UK  
Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”)
The policy of the board is to manage the affairs of  
Oxford BioMedica to the highest standards of corporate 
governance and in accordance with the principles of 
good governance and the code of best practice as set  
out in the Code. A copy of the code is available from 
www.frc.org.uk  
The board considers that it has complied throughout  
the year with the provisions of the Code, unless otherwise 
indicated below. 
Compliance with the provisions of the Code
The Board
Oxford BioMedica is led and controlled by a board 
consisting of a chairman, two non-executive directors 
and four executive directors. Between January 2011 and 
May 2011 there had been a total of four non-executive 
directors. On 5 May 2011 Dr Alan Kingsman (Chairman) 
left the Board, at which time Nick Rodgers (Deputy 
Chairman and Senior Independent Director) became 
Chairman. On 24 May 2011 Dr Alex Lewis (non-executive 
Director) left the Board to take up a management position 
with the Company as Director of Corporate Activities and 
Strategy. On 9 February 2012 Andrew Wood stepped 
down from the Board and was replaced on that date as 
Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary by Tim 
Watts. As set out in their biographies on pages 40 to 41, 
the Directors have significant experience of the 
management and development of a biopharmaceutical 
group and of pharmaceutical research and the new  
drug development process. There is a clear division of 
responsibilities, set out in writing, between the Chairman 
and Chief Executive Officer. The Board considers that the 
non-executive Directors are independent of management. 
All Directors have access to advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible to the Board for 
ensuring that board procedures are complied with. The 
appointment and removal of the Company Secretary is a 
matter for the Board as a whole to consider. The Chairman 
has no significant external commercial commitments  
that would impact the performance of his duties. 
Provision A.3.1 of the Code recommends that the 
Chairman should meet the independence criteria  
on appointment, and that a Chief Executive Officer  
should subsequently be appointed as Chairman.  
This recommendation is complied with by the present 
Chairman, Nick Rodgers who was appointed on 5 May 
2011. The previous arrangement did not meet the 
recommendation as Dr Alan Kingsman, who was 
Chairman until 5 May 2011, had previously been the  
Chief Executive Officer. Dr Alan Kingsman also held share 
options and long term incentive plan awards that had 
been granted when he held executive positions, which 
was contrary to the requirements for independence. 
Notwithstanding this, provision B.1.2 of the Code which 
recommends that a small company should have at least 
two independent non-executive Directors, has been fully 
met throughout the year. 
Board meetings
The Board meets regularly and at least eight times per 
year, with meeting dates agreed for each year in advance. 
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved to the 
Board for its decision. The schedule covers senior 
appointments, business strategy and budgets, substantial 
transactions, contracts and commitments, financing 
treasury and risk policies, and the approval of certain 
documents and announcements including the annual 
report. There is frequent contact between executive and 
non-executive Directors. Each Director is provided with an 
appropriate induction on appointment, and is supplied on 
a timely basis with financial and operational information 
sufficient for the Board to discharge its duties. All Directors 
have access, as required, to independent professional 
advice. During 2011 there were 10 board meetings.  
The attendance of individual Directors at board meetings 
was as follows:

As required, the Chairman holds meetings with  
non-executive Directors without the executive Directors  
in attendance. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 45
Board committees
As appropriate, the Board has delegated certain 
responsibilities to board committees, which operate 
within defined terms of reference and constitution.  
There is a Remuneration Committee, the report and 
membership of which is set out on pages 53 to 58.  
The Remuneration Committee met five times in 2011.  
All meetings were attended by all committee members. 
Audit Committee
There is also an Audit Committee, which comprises two 
non-executive Directors: Nick Rodgers (Chairman) and  
Dr Andrew Heath. Up to 24 May 2011 Dr Alex Lewis was 
also a member of the committee. The Board considers 
that both members of the Audit Committee possess 
recent and relevant financial experience. The Audit 
Committee has written terms of reference which have 
been published on the Company’s website. It monitors 
the integrity of the financial statements of Oxford 
BioMedica and any formal announcements relating  
to the Company’s financial performance, reviewing 
significant financial reporting judgements contained  
in them. It reviews internal financial controls and  
the internal control and risk management systems.  
It makes recommendations to the Board, for it to put  
to shareholders for their approval in general meeting,  
in relation to the appointment, re-appointment and 
removal of the external auditors, and approves  
the remuneration and terms of engagement  
of the external auditors. 
Provision C.3.1 of the Code states that the company 
Chairman should not chair the Audit Committee.  
When the composition of Board and its committees  
was re-organised in May 2011, Nick Rodgers became 
company Chairman, and retained on a pro tem basis  
the chair of the Audit Committee. The Board recognises 
that this arrangement is not satisfactory and in the  
longer term the intention is to appoint an appropriately 
qualified non-executive director who could chair  
the Audit Committee. 
Provision C.3.5 of the Code states that the Audit Committee 
should review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function. Due to the small size of the Company,  
it has not been considered necessary to have an internal 
audit function. The Audit Committee regularly (at least 
once per year) reviews the need for internal audit.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been auditors to the 
Company and the Group since 1997 . The Audit Committee 
regularly reviews the relationship with the auditors and 
remains satisfied with their effectiveness and that they 
remain independent. Accordingly it has not considered  
it necessary to date to require the firm to tender for the 
audit work. There are no contractual obligations restricting 
the Company’s choice of external auditor. The incumbent 
independent auditors continue to operate procedures  
to safeguard against the possibility that their objectivity 
and independence could be compromised. This includes 
the use of a quality review partner, use of a technical 
review board (where appropriate) and annual 
independence procedures, including confirmations by  
all staff. The auditors report to the Audit Committee on 
matters including independence and non-audit fees on 
an annual basis. In addition, the role of the audit partner  
is rotated on a periodic basis. The Audit Committee 
reviews and monitors the external auditors’ independence 
and objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, 
taking into consideration relevant UK professional and 
regulatory requirements. The Audit Committee is advised 
of and approves all non-audit services provided by the 
Company’s auditors. As part of this approval process,  
the Audit Committee ensures that the provision of non-
audit services will not impact the auditors’ objectivity  
and independence. It reports to the Board as necessary, 
identifying matters in respect of which it considers  
that action or improvement is needed, making 
recommendations as to the steps to be taken. 
Oxford BioMedica has a public interest disclosure policy, 
and the Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing 
arrangements by which staff may raise concerns about 
possible improprieties. At the committee’s invitation or 
request, the Chief Executive Officer and other Directors 
may attend meetings of the Audit Committee. The Audit 
Committee met twice in 2011 with the Chief Financial 
Officer present, at the committee’s invitation. All meetings 
were attended by the full committee. 
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee leads the process for  
making appointments to the Board, and comprises the 
non-executive Directors and the company Chairman, 
who is Chairman of the Nomination Committee.  
The Nomination Committee did not meet in 2011. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 46
Corporate Governance
Retirement of Directors
In accordance with the articles of association, at each 
annual meeting any Director who was appointed after the 
last Annual General Meeting or has served for three years, 
and one third of the other Directors (or if their number  
is not a multiple of three the number nearest to but  
not exceeding one third) retire from office by rotation. 
Review of performance
Provision B.6 of the Code requires an annual review  
of the performance of the Board, the committees and the 
individual directors. During 2011 a comprehensive review 
of the executive Directors and senior management was 
carried out in conjunction with RSA Consulting Limited, 
an organisation that is independent of Oxford BioMedica. 
In July 2011 the Board carried out a wide ranging review 
of strategy and management processes, including the 
effectiveness of the Board. The Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director monitored board performance  
and maintained their review of the performance of the 
committees and the individual Directors throughout 2011. 
They considered the performance satisfactory. At least 
once per year the non-executive Directors meet under 
the leadership of the Senior Independent Director to 
appraise the Chairman’s performance.
Management committees
The Board retains overall responsibility for, and control  
of, the Company. Management is conducted by the  
Chief Executive Officer and the executive Directors who, 
together with other senior managers, form the senior 
management team. Executive Directors sit on the 
following committees and management groups: the 
Senior Management Group, the executive research group,  
the clinical development group, the safety committee,  
the commercial development committee, the quality 
committee and the internal patent group. By this means,  
a direct and ongoing link exists between the determination 
of strategy by the Board and the execution of the 
Company’s policies by management and employees.
Relations with shareholders
We attach a high priority to effective communication  
with both private and institutional shareholders. The 
annual report contains a detailed business review and a 
description of our candidate products and of our research 
and development portfolio. An interim business review  
is also provided with the half-year report sent to  
share holders. With these documents and the Company’s  
press releases, we seek to present a balanced and  
under standable assessment of Oxford BioMedica’s position 
and prospects. Our website (www.oxfordbiomedica.co.uk) 
provides extensive other information about the Company. 
The Annual General Meeting (AGM) is the principal forum  
for dialogue with private shareholders. A business 
presentation is made by the Chief Executive Officer and 
there is an opportunity for shareholders to put questions 
to the directors. At the AGM the Directors’ service 
contracts or letters of appointment are available  
for inspection. 
We maintain regular contact with institutional share-
holders through a programme of one-to-one visits and 
briefings. The Chairman and Senior Independent Director 
have contact with a range of major shareholders to  
listen to their views in order to help develop a balanced 
understanding of their views and concerns. In addition, 
the Senior Independent Director is available to 
shareholders if contact through the normal channels  
is inappropriate, or has failed to resolve concerns. 
Internal control
The Directors are responsible for Oxford BioMedica’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. Such a system is designed to manage, 
rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives, and can only provide reasonable,  
and not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. As described above, the active 
involvement of the executive Directors in the 
management committees allows the Board continually  
to monitor and assess significant business, operational, 
financial, compliance and other risks, and to review the 
effectiveness of internal control. This is reinforced by  
the provision to the Board by the executive Directors of 
regular and detailed reports covering, inter alia, financing, 
investor relations, research and development, clinical 
development, financial performance, commercial 
interactions and intellectual property management.  
In addition the Board annually reviews the effectiveness  
of all significant aspects of internal control, including 
financial, operational and compliance controls and risk 
management. The review for 2011 did not highlight  
any matters that require reporting to shareholders.
Oxford BioMedica has procedures in place which 
incorporate the recommendations included in the FRC’s 
2005 document Internal Control Revised Guidance  
for Directors on the Code.
Share capital
The information about share capital required by the 
take over directive is in the Directors’ Report on page 51. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 47
Corporate Social Responsibility (CSR) requires 
consideration of the economic, social and  
environ mental impacts of our business activities.  
The Board recognises the potential benefits of CSR  
for the competitiveness of Oxford BioMedica and 
encourages a culture of continuous improvement  
in CSR-related issues. The Company has set specific 
policies that cover key aspects of CSR and strives  
to operate at the highest level of integrity.
Employees
Attracting, motivating and retaining a highly skilled 
workforce are critical to Oxford BioMedica’s success.  
The Company’s employment policies are based on 
guidelines for best practice. They recognise the rights  
and ensure equal opportunities for all employees  
without discrimination. 
Oxford BioMedica aims to develop and maintain a 
motivated and professional workforce through career 
development, performance management, training and 
promotion. Managers are responsible for developing 
employees and identifying talent within the workforce. 
Training is given in a wide variety of ways including 
on-the-job coaching and in-house or external courses. 
Our annual employee appraisal process continues to 
function well, by providing a formal process for setting 
objectives and reviewing performance. In 2011,  
we launched Oxford BioMedica’s new mission, vision  
and values in order to further encourage inspiration  
and innovation amongst employees.
Management acknowledges the importance of 
communication between colleagues and company 
briefings are held to keep employees informed of general 
business issues and any other matters of interest.  
The circulation of press announcements and internal 
newsletters keeps employees informed of business  
and employee activities. The Board as a whole takes 
considerable interest in employment matters. These are 
represented at Board level by the Chief Executive Officer.
Health and Safety
Oxford BioMedica is committed to protecting the health, 
safety and welfare of all its employees. The Company’s 
Health and Safety Management System covers all work 
activities such as the usage of biological, chemical and 
radioactive materials, and the operation of laboratory 
equipment. 
The Health and Safety Management System is reviewed 
and updated in order to improve current systems and 
procedures, adapt to variations in scientific work and 
reflect changes in legislation. Oxford BioMedica continues 
to have a first-class safety record and to date has never 
been required to report an accident to the UK Health  
and Safety Executive or a USA equivalent. 
Oxford BioMedica strives to maintain an effective health 
and safety culture within the organisation. The importance 
of health and safety is reflected through the active 
involvement of senior management and representation  
at Board level by the Chief Scientific Officer.
Quality Assurance
Oxford BioMedica is committed to operating all its 
activities at a high level of scientific quality and regulatory 
compliance. The Company’s policies reinforce senior 
management’s commitment to high standards of quality 
being maintained at all times. A set of regulations and 
procedures provide guidance and instruction pertaining 
to the development, manufacturing, testing, clinical 
evaluation, storage and distribution of investigational 
medicinal products (IMP) performed by or authorised  
by the Company. 
Oxford BioMedica places the highest priority on the safety 
and well-being of its clinical trial patients who will be 
treated with the Company’s products. It is a regulatory 
and Company requirement that employees are aware  
of the implications and importance of maintaining drug 
safety, quality and efficacy throughout its clinical trial 
programmes. Oxford BioMedica held company wide 
Good Manufacturing Practice (GMP), Good Laboratory 
Practice (GLP) and Pharmacovigilance training in 2011  
to ensure that employees are aware of and compliant 
with current best practice. The Company continues  
to support ongoing and periodic training as an essential 
part of its continuous improvement philosophy.
Strong emphasis is also placed on maintaining the 
integrity of the Company’s products including their safe 
manufacture, controlled distribution and compliance with 
all relevant regulations. Oxford BioMedica is responsible 
for ensuring that each batch of product is fit-for-purpose 
in terms of safety, quality, identity, strength, purity  
and expected efficacy. In March 2011, the UK Medicines  
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) 
completed a successful GLP compliance inspection  
of Oxford BioMedica. There were no major or critical 
observations and the GLP Certificate of Compliance  
was renewed. In December 2011, an application was 
made to the MHRA to vary the current GMP license  
to include drug manufacture for clinical trials at the 
Company’s manufacturing facility and an MHRA 
inspection of the manufacturing facility is expected  
in H1 2012. Oxford BioMedica continues to operate  
under Good Clinical Practice (GCP), GMP and GLP 
accreditations on an ongoing basis and has remained 
within compliance throughout 2011.

Manufacturing
In February 2011, Oxford BioMedica invested in its 
specialist manufacturing processes by acquiring a UK 
manufacturing facility based in Cowley, Oxford. During 
the refurbishment and commissioning phase of the 
manufacturing facility, the Company took the opportunity 
to upgrade and replace old equipment with new energy 
efficient systems. The manufacturing facility complies 
with Oxford BioMedica’s general environmental policy  
and Oxford BioMedica also plans to work towards  
a recognised environmental programme.
External Relationships
Our external stakeholders include suppliers, advisers, 
shareholders, patients, healthcare professionals, partners, 
collaborators and licensees. These relationships are  
a fundamental aspect of our business activities. We are 
committed to interacting with these third parties in an 
ethical manner, and to ensuring that the relationships  
are maintained at a professional and appropriate level. 
Our internal procedures for dealing with third parties  
are reviewed annually.
We have a policy for the management of clinical trials  
to ensure compliance with appropriate guidelines and 
legislation. Our website (www.oxfordbiomedica.co.uk) 
provides information on ongoing clinical trials, and  
we also list our US-based trials on a US government-
sponsored website (www.ClinicalTrials.gov).
The Chief Executive Officer and executive Directors  
have primary responsibility for communication  
with shareholders and related stakeholders. We also  
use the services of external financial and corporate 
communications agencies. We seek to disseminate 
information in a timely, reliable and comprehensive 
fashion, and we comply with the rules and guidelines  
of the UK Listing Authority for a company on the  
Official List. 
Environment
We fully recognise our responsibility to protect the 
environment and we review our environmental policy, 
objectives and guidelines regularly. The Company 
complies with all regulations that cover the processing 
and disposal of laboratory waste; using qualified licensed 
contractors for the collection and disposal of chemical 
and radioactive waste and decontaminated biological 
materials. No laboratory waste goes to landfill sites. 
As part of our commitment to the environment, our 
policies are designed to motivate our staff to be energy 
conscious and environmentally friendly. The Company’s 
recycling program continues to function effectively and 
the majority of our cardboard and office paper is recycled. 
In 2010 we started recycling our coffee disks in order  
to raise money for MacMillan Cancer Support and this 
continued during 2011. Given its importance to Oxford 
BioMedica, environmental issues are represented at Board 
level by the Chief Executive Officer. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 49
The Directors present their annual report and audited

Principal activity
Oxford BioMedica (LSE: OXB) is a biopharmaceutical 
company developing innovative gene-based medicines 
and therapeutic vaccines that aim to improve the lives of 
patients with high unmet medical needs. The Company 
was established in 1995 as a spin-out from Oxford 
University, and has its primary listing on the London  
Stock Exchange. 
The Company has a platform of gene delivery 
technologies, which are based on highly engineered  
viral systems. Oxford BioMedica also has in-house clinical, 
regulatory and manufacturing know-how. The Company’s 
technology platform includes a highly efficient gene 
delivery system (LentiVector
®
 platform), which has 
specific advantages for targeting diseases of the central 
nervous system and the eye; and a unique tumour antigen 
(5T4), which is an ideal target for anti-cancer therapy. 
The Group’s products and technologies are underpinned 
by over 60 patent families, which represent one of the 
broadest patent estates in the field. Oxford BioMedica’s 
commercial partners include Sanofi, Sigma-Aldrich and 
Pfizer for product development; Biogen Idec, Emergent 
BioSolutions, GlaxoSmithKline, Merck & Co and Pfizer,  
as technology licensees; and collaborations with the 
Mayo Clinic and ImaginAb.
At 31 December 2011 the Group had 98 employees,  
all but two of whom are based at the two operational  
sites in Oxford. The Group has a wholly owned subsidiary, 
BioMedica Inc, in San Diego, California comprising an 
office for US intellectual property management and 
business development. In early 2012, a decision was  
taken to close the US office and also to reduce Oxford 
staff levels, which will lead to a reduction in headcount 
numbers of 16.
Oxford BioMedica plc is a public limited company 
incorporated in England and Wales, domiciled in England 
with its registered office at The Medawar Centre,  
Robert Robinson Avenue, The Oxford Science Park,

in 1999. The BIA code includes principles and provisions 
relating to corporate governance matters, access to 
external advice, confidentiality, dealings in the Company’s 
shares, and standards of public announcements. It is 
intended to operate by reference to the particular 
circumstances of bioscience companies and in support  
of the combined code and the rules of the Financial 
Services Authority. Throughout 2011 the Company has 
complied with the relevant provisions of the BIA code.
Information required to be disclosed  
by the Takeover Directive
Structure of the Company’s capital
The Company’s share capital comprises a single class of 
1p ordinary shares, each carrying one vote and all ranking 
equally with each other. Following the adoption of new 
articles of association in 2010, the share capital of the 
Company is unlimited. At 20 February 2012 there were 
944,875,557 1p ordinary shares issued, allotted and fully 
paid. There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in 
the Company or on voting rights. All shares are admitted 
to trading on the London Stock Exchange. 
Rights to issue and buy back shares
Each year at the Annual General Meeting the Directors 
seek rights to allot shares. The authority, when granted 
lasts for 15 months or until the conclusion of the next 
Annual General Meeting if sooner. At the last Annual 
General Meeting held on 5 May 2011, authority was given 
to allot up to 314,958,500 shares (that number being one 
third of total issued share capital of the Company at the 
time), subject to the normal pre-emption rights reserved 
to shareholders contained in the Companies Act 2006, 
and to allot up to a further 314,958,500 shares, solely in  
a rights issue. Authority was also given, subject to certain 
conditions, to waive pre-emption rights over up to 
47,243,700 shares, being 5% of the shares then in issue.  
No rights have been granted to the Directors to buy  
back shares. 
Employee share schemes
The Company has a share incentive plan under which 
shares may be held in trust for employees. The trustees 
may only exercise the voting rights in respect of such 
shares in accordance with the employees’ instructions. 
Currently there are no such shares held in trust.
Agreements that take effect, alter or terminate  
because of a takeover bid or on change of control
There are no such agreements that the Directors consider 
are material. There are no agreements providing for 
compensation for loss of office for Directors or employees 
in the event of a takeover bid.
Creditor payment policy
The Company and its subsidiaries agree the terms  
of payment when agreeing the terms and conditions  
for their transactions with suppliers. Payment is made  
in compliance with those terms, subject to the terms  
and conditions of the relevant transaction having  
been met by the supplier. The Group’s average creditor 
payment period at 31 December 2011 was 27 days (2010: 
25 days). The Company has no trade creditors (2010: nil).
Risk management
The Group’s risk management objectives and exposure  
to risks is set out on pages 42 to 43 (Principal Risks  
and Uncertainties) and pages 70 to 71 (note 2: financial  
risk management).
Going concern
Oxford BioMedica plc is a research and development 
based business with no currently marketed products.  
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the introduction (pages 01 to 03 
and 06 to 07), the Chairman’s Message (page 04), the 
Chief Executives’ Review (page 08), the Operational 
Review on pages 18 to 29, interview with the Chief 
Scientific Officer (pages 30 to 31) and the Principal  
Risks and Uncertainties on pages 42 to 43. The financial 
position of the Group, including its cash flows, is 
described in the Financial Review on pages 33 to 39.  
In addition, note 2 to the financial statements includes  
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
its capital; its financial risk management objectives;  
and its exposure to cash flow and liquidity risk.
The Group is expected to incur significant further costs  
as it continues to develop its portfolio of candidate 
products and related technology. The Directors estimate 
that the cash held by the Group will be sufficient to 
support the current level of activities into the first quarter 
of 2013. Based on anticipated progress in the business  
in 2012, the Directors also expect to secure additional 
financing sufficient for the future needs of the business 
beyond the first quarter of next year. However, there  
is no certainty that adequate resources will be available  
on a timely basis, and in the event that further funding  
is not achieved, then the Group would have to curtail  
or suspend the existing programme development.  Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 52
Appointment and replacement of Directors
Directors may be appointed by an ordinary resolution  
at any general meeting of shareholders, or may be 
appointed by the existing Directors, provided that any 
Director so appointed shall retire at the next following 
Annual General Meeting and may offer himself for  
re-election. At each Annual General Meeting any Director 
who has served for three years, and one third of the  
other Directors must retire, and may offer themselves for 
re-election. A Director may be removed in the following 
ways: by an ordinary resolution at a general meeting;  
if he is prohibited by law from being a Director; in the 
event of bankruptcy; if he is suffering from specified 
mental disorders; if he is absent without consent for  
more than six months; or by request in writing by all  
the other Directors. Any Director may appoint another 
Director or another person approved by the other 
Directors as an alternate Director.
Amendment of the Company’s articles of association
Amendment of the Company’s articles may be made by 
special resolution at a general meeting of shareholders. 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable  
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the 
directors have prepared the Group and parent company 
financial statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. Under company law the directors must 
not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state  
of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these 
financial statements, the directors are required to:
—  select suitable accounting policies and then apply 
them consistently;
—  make judgements and accounting estimates that  
are reasonable and prudent; and
—  state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding 
the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for 
taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance  
and integrity of the Company’s website. Legislation  
in the United Kingdom governing the preparation  
and dissemination of financial statements may differ  
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions  
are listed in this section confirm that, to the best  
of their knowledge:
—  the Group financial statements, which have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
financial position and loss of the Group; and
—  the Directors’ Report contained in this section includes 
a fair review of the development and performance  
of the business and the position of the Group, together 
with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.
Statement as to disclosure of information to auditors
In accordance with s418 of the Companies Act 2006,  
so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware, 
and each director has taken all the steps that he ought to 
have taken as a director in order to make himself aware  
of any relevant audit information and to establish that  
the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
The auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP, have indicated 
their willingness to continue in office and a resolution 
concerning their reappointment will be proposed at the 
Annual General Meeting.
Corporate governance
The Company’s statement on corporate governance is 
included in the corporate governance statement on pages 
44 to 46 of these financial statements.

Directors’ Report

Directors’ Remuneration Report
for the year ended 31 December 2011
Only paragraphs marked with ‘*’ within this report 
have been audited.
During 2011 the Remuneration Committee met five  
times. Up to 5 May 2011 the committee comprised  
three non-executive Directors: Dr Alex Lewis (Chairman),  
Dr Paul Blake and Nick Rodgers. Following the 2011 AGM 
on 5 May 2011 the committee has comprised Dr Paul 
Blake (Chairman) and Dr Andrew Heath. The committee 
determines, on behalf of the Board, the Company’s  
policy for executive remuneration, and the individual 
remuneration packages of the executive Directors 
including awards under the long term incentive plan 
(LTIP). The committee also determines the remuneration 
package of the Chairman. At the committee’s invitation  
or request, the Chief Executive Officer and other  
Directors may be in attendance at the meetings  
of the Remuneration Committee. The committee has 
access to professional advice, both inside and outside  
the Company as required. In 2011 the committee received 
assistance on remuneration, succession planning  
and other matters from RSA Consulting Limited. 
Remuneration policy
The Group’s policy on remuneration is to attract, retain 
and incentivise the best staff in a manner consistent  
with the goals of corporate governance. In setting the 
remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee 
considers a number of factors, including the basic salaries 
and benefits available to Directors of comparable 
companies as provided by information in independent 
remuneration reports, and the level of pay for other 
employees in the Group. 
Remuneration of executive Directors and the Chairman
Consistent with this policy, the Company’s remuneration 
packages awarded to executive Directors are intended  
to be competitive and comprise a mix of performance-
related and non-performance-related elements. Salaries 
are normally reviewed in January each year. 
There is a discretionary non-pensionable bonus scheme 
for executive directors, subject to the achievement of 
agreed goals and targets that are designed to incentivise 
them to perform at the highest levels and to align their 
interests with those of the shareholders. The principal part 
of performance-linked remuneration is related to overall 
measures of group performance with a small amount 
being linked to individual targets which are set to support 
the Group objectives and effective running of the 
Company. For 2011 the Group performance measures 
related to the following corporate goals:
— Significant product-related deals – 30%
—  Targets related to the existing collaboration  
with Sanofi – 10%
— Progress of existing clinical trials – 15%
— Progress with new clinical trials – 35%
— Other goals – 10%
For the executive Directors the performance-related 
annual bonus potential is up to 60% of basic salary.  
For the CEO 75% of this relates to the corporate goals 
above with the balance on personal targets. For the other 
executive Directors the weighting for corporate goals vs. 
personal targets was 60-40. Although several of the key 
goals were delivered in 2011, in light of the share price  
at the year end, the committee decided that no bonuses 
would be paid in respect of 2011. In respect of 2010, 
bonuses of 20% to 25% of salary were paid. 
Benefits, detailed in the table of Directors’ emoluments, 
mainly comprise healthcare insurance. 
The Group makes contributions to a defined contribution 
personal pension scheme for the executive Directors  
at 10% of salary. 
Directors and senior managers may participate in a 
share-based long term incentive plan. Details of the 
awards made in 2011 under the LTIP are on page 57. 
Awards under the LTIP may be conditional shares or 
nil-cost options, the release of which will depend on the 
completion of a holding period of at least three years and 
the satisfaction of performance conditions. Up to 2009 
there was one main performance condition attached to 
share awards granted under the LTIP – comparative total 
shareholder return (TSR) measured against a comparator 
group of companies. Since the LTIP award made in June 
2010 a secondary performance condition, described 
below was added. The TSR comparator group for the  
LTIP awards made in 2011 was:
Ark Therapeutics Group plc; Allergy Therapeutics plc;  
BTG plc; GW Pharmaceuticals plc; ImmuPharma plc; 
Phytopharm plc; Proteome Sciences plc; Proximagen 
Neuroscience plc; ReNeuron Group plc; Renovo Group 
plc; Silence Therapeutics plc; Vernalis plc; Verona  
Pharma plc. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 54
Directors’ Remuneration Report
for the year ended 31 December 2011
No awards will be released at the testing date for less than median performance of Oxford BioMedica TSR compared  
to the comparator group. Median performance will result in release of 25% of the shares. Performance at the 75th 
percentile will result in the release of 50% of the shares, with straight line release between these points. Upper quartile 
TSR performance (i.e. greater than 75th percentile performance) will result in release of 100% of the shares. 
For TSR above median but below the upper quartile, a secondary performance test, based on events that are expected 
to be significant drivers of value for the Company, will be applied. In these circumstances, up to a further 50% of the 
LTIP awards in 2011 will be released on the achievement of the following milestone events:
Event       % of award released
Commercial collaboration for TroVax 
®
 executed        5%
Commercial collaboration for ProSavin
®
 executed       20%
Exercise of the development option by Sanofi for one of the collaborative ocular products    20%
First batch of clinical-grade material released from the Oxford BioMedica manufacturing facility   20%
There will be no re-testing of the performance conditions. 
The maximum level of awards under the LTIP in any calendar year is 150% of each eligible employee’s emoluments. 
The committee intends that annual awards to executive Directors will not normally exceed 100% of salary. Taking 
account of the level of the Company’s share price in 2011 and of the potentially high number of shares and the dilutive 
impact of an award of 100%, the 2011 LTIP awards were scaled back to 30% of salary. There is an overall limit on dilution 
from share schemes of up to 10% within a ten year period to satisfy awards to participants in the LTIP and any other 
share plan operated by the Company under which shares are issued. Including the LTIP and all other share plans; 
assuming that 100% of presently un-vested LTIP awards and share options vest and are exercised; and taking into 
account all options granted in the last 10 years that had been exercised by 31 December 2011, the maximum potential 
dilution against this limit was 3.88%. 
Following the introduction of the LTIP in 2007, executive Directors and certain senior managers no longer receive 
awards under the share option scheme. However, the share option scheme continues to be used for other eligible 
employees. Prior to 2007, options were awarded under the share option scheme to executive Directors. The exercise 
price for all share options is the market price of the Company’s ordinary shares on the last trading day before the  
date of grant. Full details of Directors’ share options are on pages 56 to 57. A summary of all share options outstanding 
at 31 December 2011 is given in note 22 to the financial statements. The remaining share options held by Directors  
at 31 December 2011 are subject to the rules of the Oxford BioMedica 1996 (No. 1) Share Option Scheme. These options 
became exercisable three years from the date of grant, and will cease to be exercisable seven years from the date of 
grant. All awards of share options are at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. Share options held by Directors 
are mostly subject to a performance-based condition, described in note 2 to the table on page 57.
Remuneration of non-executive Directors
The fees paid to non-executive Directors are determined by the Board. Non-executive Directors do not receive pension 
contributions or a bonus. Non-executive Directors do not participate in the Company’s share option schemes. 
The non-executive Directors have appointments that are for three years unless terminated by three months’ written 
notice by either party. Non-executive Directors’ appointments may be renewed by mutual agreement. As recommended 
by Code provision B.2.3, any term beyond six years for a non-executive Director is subject to considered review by  
the Board. Non-executive Directors serving beyond nine years are subject to renewal for one year at a time, and are 
submitted for re-election each year at the Annual General Meeting.  Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 55

1.  A performance-based condition applies to these options. The options are exercisable only if at the time of exercise, or for a period of at least 12 months in aggregate  
in the three years before exercise, the percentage increase in Oxford BioMedica plc’s total shareholder return since the grant of the option exceeds the percentage increase 
in the FTSE techMARK MediScience index. This target was chosen because the directors believe that the FTSE techMARK MediScience index should be a benchmark that 
reflects the factors bearing on the UK biotechnology sector.
2.  Dr Alan Kingsman resigned from the board of Oxford BioMedica on 5 May 2011 but remains a consultant. In accordance with the rules of the Oxford BioMedica 1996  
(No.1) share option scheme, the options held at 5 May 2011 remained in place on their original terms.

1.  All awards made under the LTIP to date have been nil-cost share options (options exercisable at par value). Subject to a performance condition, these options vest  
on the third anniversary of the date of grant and, if vested may be exercised until the tenth anniversary of the date of grant.
2.  The performance condition for these awards compares the Company’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’) to the TSR of a chosen group of healthcare and biotechnology 
companies over a three year period. A median ranking must be achieved before any part of the award vests (25% of the award) and an upper quartile ranking must be 
achieved for the award to vest in full.
3.  On 13 October 2011 the TSR performance test was applied to the LTIP award made on 13 October 2008. Oxford BioMedica’s TSR over the 3 year period was ranked  
11th out of 20 companies. In accordance with the scheme rules, 40% of the award vested, and the remaining 60% of the award lapsed. The share price at the date  
of vesting was 5.34p. The value of the vested share options at 31 December 2011 was £35,000.
4.  For the LTIP awards since 2010, a secondary performance test, based on events that are expected to be significant drivers of value for the Company, will be applied  
if TSR is above median but below the upper quartile. In these circumstances, up to 50% of the LTIP award will be released on the achievement of the specified  
milestone events.
5.  On 13 March 2011 the TSR performance test was applied to the LTIP award made on 13 March 2008. Oxford BioMedica’s TSR over the 3 year period was below the median  
of the comparator group, and consequently none of the awards vested. 
6. Dr Alan Kingsman resigned on 5 May 2011 and consequently his remaining LTIP awards lapsed.
7 .  Andrew Wood resigned on 9 February 2012. The Company has agreed that the 3,346,000 LTIP awards held by Andrew Wood at 9 February 2012 shall not lapse  
as a consequence of the termination of his employment with the Company, but shall continue as if he had remained an Eligible Employee and Participant  
(both terms as defined in the LTIP Rules) until the expiry date of the last of such LTIP awards. 
The Company regularly reviews the performance conditions that apply to LTIP awards in order to estimate  
the extent to which the awards might vest. Assuming that relative share price performance in the comparator  
groups remains consistent with performance up to 31 December 2011, the Directors estimate that the LTIP  
awards would vest as follows:
— Award made on 25 March 2009: performance below median – none of this award would vest
— Award made on 15 June 2010: performance below median – none of this award would vest
— Award made on 13 April 2011: performance below median – none of this award would vest Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 58
Directors’ Remuneration Report
for the year ended 31 December 2011
The market value of ordinary shares as at 31 December 2011 was 3.50p (31 December 2010: 5.53p). The market value  
of ordinary shares during the year ranged from 2.91p to 7.20p.
Except as detailed above, no Directors had interests in shares or share options of the Company or any other group 
company at 31 December 2011. There have been no changes in the interests of the Directors in office at the date of  
this report in the ordinary shares of the Company between 31 December 2011 and the date of this report.
Comparison of five year total shareholder return 
The chart shows the value at the end of each year of £100 invested on 31 December 2006 in Oxford BioMedica 1p 
ordinary shares (OXB) compared to the change in the FTSE all-share index and the FTSE techMARK MediScience index 
over the same period. In previous years we have observed that the OXB share price tends to follow the direction given 
by the benchmark indices, but with greater volatility, and occasionally affected by major company developments. 
These trends were apparent in the earlier part of the period up to Q3 2009, with a steep drop through 2007 and 2008, 
and a reversal from Q2 2009, coinciding with the commencement of the ocular collaboration with Sanofi in April 2009. 
However, since Q3 2009 the market has generally been on a rising trend, while the OXB share price trended 
downwards between Q3 2009 and Q3 2010, and moved down sharply in Q4 2010 on the announcement of a placing 
and open offer of 400 million new shares at 5p per share. A further downward movement occurred in Q4 2011 
following the release of clinical trial data for ProSavin
®
 on 15 December 2011.
The Directors consider that the high volatility in share price is not unique to Oxford BioMedica, but is a feature  
shared by many high-tech companies whose valuations are significantly influenced by newsflow, investor sentiment 
and attitude to risk.
In the opinion of the Directors, the FTSE all-share index should be a reasonable index against which the total 
shareholder return of Oxford BioMedica plc may be measured over a five-year term, because it represents  
a broad-based, objective measure of investment return from equities. The FTSE techMARK MediScience index,  
made up of emerging healthcare companies in the early stages of growth, provides a second benchmark that  
may better reflect the factors bearing on valuations in the UK biotechnology sector.

We have audited the financial statements of Oxford 
BioMedica plc for the year ended 31 December 2011  
which comprise the Consolidated Statement of  
Com pre hensive Income, the Balance Sheets, the 
Statements of Cash Flows, the Statements of Changes  
in Equity Attributable to Owners of the Parent Company 
and the related notes. The financial reporting framework 
that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and international financial reporting standards  
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and, as regards 
the parent company financial statements, as applied  
in accordance with the provisions of the Companies  
Act 2006.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 52, the Directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the financial statements 
and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and international standards on auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s ethical standards for auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared  
for and only for the Company’s members as a body in 
accordance with chapter 3 of part 16 of the Companies 
Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving 
these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report 
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where 
expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient  
to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused  
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s  
and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the 
financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial 
and non-financial information in the annual report to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion: 
—  the financial statements give a true and fair view of the 
state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs 
as at 31 December 2011 and of the Group’s loss and 
the Group’s and parent company’s cash flows for the 
year then ended;
—  the Group financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union; 
—  the parent company financial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union and as applied in accordance 
with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
—  the financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, article 4 of the IAS regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed  
by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
—  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to  
be audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and
—  the information given in the Directors’ Report for  
the financial year for which the financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the financial 
statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion: 
—  adequate accounting records have not been kept by 
the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit 
have not been received from branches not visited by 
us; or 
—  the parent company financial statements and the part 
of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited  
are not in agreement with the accounting records  
and returns; or 
—  certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified 
by law are not made; or 
—  we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
—  the Directors’ statement, set out on page 51,  
in relation to going concern;
—  the parts of the corporate governance statement 
relating to the Company’s compliance with the nine 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
specified for our review; and
—  certain elements of the report to shareholders by  
the Board on Directors’ remuneration.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2011
1, Accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies adopted in the 
preparation of these financial statements are set out 
below. These policies have been consistently applied to  
all the financial years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union  
and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations endorsed by the 
European Union and with those parts of the Companies 
Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The financial statements are prepared in accordance 
with the historical cost convention. As more fully 
explained in the Directors’ Report on page 49 to 52  
the going concern basis has been adopted in preparing 
the financial statements. 
Going concern
Oxford BioMedica plc is a research and development 
based business with no currently marketed products.  
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance  
and position are set out in the introduction (pages 01  
to 03 and 06 to 07), the Chairman’s Message (page 04), 
the Chief Executives’ Review (page 08), the Operational 
Review on pages 18 to 29, interview with the Chief 
Scientific Officer (pages 30 to 31) and the Principal Risks 
and Uncertainties on pages 42 to 43. The financial 
position of the Group, including its cash flows, is 
described in the financial review on pages 33 to 39.  
In addition, note 2 to the financial statements includes  
the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for 
managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; and its exposure to cash flow and  
liquidity risk.
The Group is expected to incur significant further  
costs as it continues to develop its portfolio of candidate 
products and related technology. The Directors estimate 
that the cash held by the Group will be sufficient to 
support the current level of activities into the first quarter 
of 2013. Based on anticipated progress in the business  
in 2012, the directors also expect to secure additional 
financing sufficient for the future needs of the business 
beyond the first quarter of next year. However, there  
is no certainty that adequate resources will be available 
on a timely basis, and in the event that further funding  
is not achieved, then the Group would have to curtail  
or suspend the existing programme development. 
After making enquiries, the Directors consider that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. Accordingly, they have adopted the going concern 
basis in preparing the financial statements.
Accounting developments
The following new standards and amendments to 
standards are mandatory for the first time for the financial 
year beginning 1 January 2011 and are considered to have 
an impact on the Group.
—  Revised IAS 24, ‘Related party disclosures’, issued in 
November 2009. It supersedes IAS 24, ‘Related party 
disclosures’, issued in 2003. The revised IAS 24 is 
required to be applied from 1 January 2011.
The following new standards, amendments to standards 
and interpretations are mandatory for the first time for  
the financial year beginning 1 January 2011, but are  
not currently relevant for the Group.
—  ‘Classification of rights issues’ (Amendment to IAS 32), 
issued in October 2009. There have been no rights 
issued denominated in a foreign currency and so this 
will have no impact on the Group.
—  ‘Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement’ 
(Amendments to IFRIC 14), issued in November 2009 is 
effective for annual periods beginning 1 January 2011. 
The standard is not applicable to the Group as there is 
no defined benefit pension scheme.
—  ‘Extinguishing financial liabilities with equity 
instruments’ (Amendment to IFRIC 19). The standard  
is not applicable to the Group as no renegotiation of 
terms with creditors has taken place.
—  ‘First-time adoption of IFRS – Limited exemption from 
comparative IFRS 7 disclosures for first-time adopters 
(Amendment to IFRS 1). This is not applicable to the 
Group as it is not a first-time adopter of IFRS. 
—  Improvements to International Financial Reporting 
Standards 2010, effective 1 January 2011. 
The following new standards, new interpretations  
and amendments to standards and interpretations  
have been issued but are not effective for the financial 
year beginning 1 January 2011 and have not been 
adopted early:
—  IFRS 9, ‘Financial instruments’, issued in December 
2009. This addresses the classification and 
measurement of financial assets. The Group is 
assessing whether there will be any impact on the 
accounting for its financial assets. The standard is  
not applicable until 1 January 2013 but is available  
for early adoption.
—  IAS 19, ‘Employee benefits’ was amended in June 2011. 
The standard is not applicable to the Group as there  
is no defined benefit pension scheme.
—  IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ builds  
on existing principles by identifying the concept of 
control as the determining factor in whether an entity 
should be included within the consolidated financial 
statements of the parent company. The Group has 
assessed that this will not impact the entities which  
are consolidated. The standard is not applicable until  
1 January 2013 but is available for early adoption. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 65
—  IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ 
includes the disclosure requirements for all forms  
of interests in other entities, including joint 
arrangements, associates, special purpose vehicles  
and other off balance sheet vehicles. The standard  
is not applicable to the Group. 
—  IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’, aims to improve 
consistency and reduce complexity by providing a 
precise definition of fair value and a single source of 
fair value measurement and disclosure requirements 
for use across IFRSs. The standard is not applicable  
to the Group.
Use of estimates and assumptions
The preparation of financial statements in conformity  
with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting 
estimates and assumptions that affect the reported 
amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues  
and expenses during the reporting period. Estimates  
and judgements are continually made and are based  
on historic experience and other factors, including 
expectations of future events that are believed to  
be reasonable in the circumstances.
Critical accounting estimates and assumptions
Where the Group makes estimates and assumptions 
concerning the future, the resulting accounting 
estimates will seldom exactly match actual results.  
Due to the amounts involved, the estimates and 
assumptions regarding revenue recognition and the 
impairment of tangible and intangible assets have  
the greatest risk of causing a material adjustment  
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities. 
Revenue recognition
In 2009 the Group received an up-front non-refundable 
payment of US$26.0 million (£16.6 million) from Sanofi 
under the ocular product collaboration. This is being 
recognised as revenue on a straight line basis over 42  
to 51 months (the expected duration of the initial stage  
of the collaboration for each of the four products). 
Obtaining data from clinical trials will be a key factor  
in achieving the expected time-lines. Estimating the 
start-date and duration of clinical trials is subject to  
many factors, including the time taken to get regulatory 
approval and the rate of patient recruitment, so such 
estimates are inherently risky. Up to 31 December 2011, 
revenue of £12.4 million has been recognised in respect 
of the initial payment for this collaboration, with the 
remaining £4.2 million classified as deferred income.  
If the revenue recognition periods had been six months 
longer, the amount of revenue recognised in 2011 would 
have been reduced by £0.6 million (2010: £0.6 million)  
and the amount of deferred income carried forward  
at 31 December 2011 increased by £1.5 million (2010:  
£1.0 million). Had the revenue recognition period been  
six months shorter, the amount of revenue recognised  
in 2011 would have been increased by £0.8 million  
(2010: £0.8 million) and the amount of deferred income 
carried forward at 31 December 2011 decreased by  
£2.0 million (2010: £1.3 million).
Over the term of the ocular product collaboration  
with Sanofi, Oxford BioMedica may recover up to  
US$24.0 million in research and development funding  
and recognise this as revenue. Project costs in excess  
of US$24.0 million will be borne by Oxford BioMedica.  
The amount of research and development funding that  
is recognised as revenue is based on an estimate of  
the amount of project costs expected to be borne  
by the Group by the end of the collaboration. Up to  
31 December 2011 £11.4 million (2010: £8.7 million)  
had been recognised as revenue and £0.4 million  
(2010: £0.5 million) had been classified as current 
deferred income. If the estimated total project 
expenditure had been 5% higher, the amount of revenue 
recognised to 31 December 2011 would have been  
£0.6 million (2010: £0.4 million) lower and the amount  
of deferred income higher by the same amounts. 
Intangible asset impairment
The Group has significant intangible assets arising from 
purchases of intellectual property rights and in-process 
R&D. Amortisation is charged over the assets’ patent  
life on a straight line basis from the date that the asset 
becomes available for use. When there is an indicator  
of a significant and permanent reduction in the value  
of intangible assets, an impairment review is carried  
out. The impairment analysis is principally based  
on estimated discounted future cash flows. Actual 
outcomes could vary significantly from such estimates  
of discounted future cash flows, due to the sensitivity  
of the assessment to the assumptions used. The 
determination of the assumptions is subjective and 
requires the exercise of considerable judgement. Any 
changes in key assumptions about the Group’s business 
and prospects or changes in market conditions affecting 
the Group or its development partners could materially 
affect the amount of impairment. This risk is now 
concentrated on purchased patent rights which have been 
sublicensed to collaborative partners. At 31 December 
2011 the book value of intangible assets was £3.1 million 
of which £2.2 million related to PrimeBoost technology. 
In respect of intellectual property rights and in-process 
R&D relating to Hi-8
® 
MEL, following a marketing initiative 
that did not result in securing a partner, an impairment 
charge of £3.1 million was recognised in 2011, writing  
the Hi-8
® 
MEL asset down to zero.  Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 66
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2011
Manufacturing facility carrying value
The Group acquired a new manufacturing facility  
in 2011 at a cost of £1.9 million and has incurred 
capitalisable refurbishment costs of £1.2 million giving  
a book value of £3.1 million. Prior to purchasing the plant, 
the Group obtained an independent valuation and an 
indication of a ‘fire-sale’ price if the manufacturing plant 
was to be stripped out and the building sold as a shell 
which was substantially less than the year end carrying 
value. However, the Directors consider that the book  
value is supported on a value-in-use basis as the costs  
of in-house manufacture of LentiVector
®
 platform batches 
is very substantially lower than the cost of purchasing 
them from a third-party contract manufacturer. The value 
in use calculation is based on an assumed output of  
19 batches over the next 4 years. The number of batches 
is dependent on the progress of the Company and its 
collaborations and so is inherently uncertain. However 
the plant only needs to operate at approximately 50%  
of its capacity, for forecast savings to support the value  
in use and carrying value of the facility. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
the Group balance sheet and the Group statement  
of cash flows include the financial statements of the 
Company and its subsidiary undertakings made up  
to 31 December. Subsidiaries are consolidated from  
the date at which control is transferred to the Group.
Subsidiaries are entities that are directly or indirectly 
controlled by the Group. Control exists where the  
Group has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of the entity so as to obtain benefits 
from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting 
rights that are currently exercisable or convertible  
are taken into account.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account 
for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The  
cost of an acquisition is measured as the fair value of  
the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially 
at their fair values at the acquisition date, irrespective of 
the extent of any minority interest. The excess of the cost 
of the acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share 
of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded as 
goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the fair 
value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the 
difference is recognised directly in the statement of 
comprehensive income. Where necessary, adjustments 
are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries  
to bring accounting policies used into line with those  
of the Group.
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised 
gains on transactions between group companies are 
eliminated. Unrealised losses are also eliminated but 
considered an impairment indicator of the asset 
transferred. Accounting policies of subsidiaries have  
been changed where necessary to ensure consistency 
with the policies adopted by the Group.
The Group and Company have elected not to apply  
IFRS 3 ‘Business combinations’ retrospectively to business 
combi nations which took place prior to 1 January 2004, 
namely the acquisition in 1996 of 100% of the issued 
share capital of Oxford BioMedica (UK) Limited that has 
been accounted for by the merger accounting method.
Revenue
The Group generates revenue from product and 
technology licence transactions and from funded 
research and development programmes. 
Product licence transactions typically have an initial 
up-front non-refundable payment on execution of  
the licence, and the potential for further payments 
conditional on achieving specific milestones, plus 
royalties on product sales. Technology licence 
transactions typically have an initial up-front  
non-refundable payment on execution of the licence  
and the potential for further annual maintenance 
payments for the term specified in the licence.  
Where the initial fee paid is non-refundable and there  
are no ongoing commitments from the Group and the 
licence has no fixed end date, the Group recognises the 
element received up front as a payment in consideration 
of the granting of the licence on execution of the 
contract. Amounts receivable in respect of milestone 
payments are recognised as revenue when the specific 
conditions stipulated in the licence agreement have been 
met. Payments linked to “success” such as regulatory filing  
or approval, achievement of specified sales volumes,  
are recognised in full when the relevant event has 
occurred. Maintenance fees within the contracts are 
spread over the period to which they relate, usually  
a year. Otherwise, amounts receivable are recognised  
in the period in which related costs are incurred, or  
over the estimated period to completion of the relevant 
phase of development or associated clinical trials. 
Research and development funding is recognised  
as revenue over a period that corresponds with the 
performance of the funded research and development 
services. Where the Group incurs pass-through expenses 
in relation to collaborative partners’ own research and 
development programmes, such costs are included  
in the Group’s financial statements as operating  
expenses net of collaborator reimbursement, and  
the reimbursement received does not form part  
of the Group’s revenue. 
Amounts recognised exclude value added tax.  
Differences between cash received and amounts 
recognised are included as deferred income where  
cash received exceeds revenue recognised and as  
accrued income where revenue has yet to be billed  
to the customer. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 67
Cost of sales
The Group’s products and technologies include 
technology elements that are licensed from third parties. 
Cost of sales is the royalty arising on such third party 
licenses. Where royalty due on revenue has not been paid 
it is included in accruals. Where revenue is spread over  
a number of accounting periods, the royalty attributable  
to the deferred revenue is included in prepayments. 
Pass-through costs reimbursed by collaborative partners 
do not form part of cost of sales.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner  
consistent with the internal reporting provided to the 
chief operating decision-maker. The chief operating 
decision-maker, responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing performance of the operating segments, has 
been identified as the Senior Management Group (SMG).  
The Group has one single business segment based  
upon its proprietary technology.
Clinical trial expenses
Where advances are made to clinical trial sites, or stocks 
of materials for use in clinical trials are purchased and 
stored, the relevant costs are included in trade and other 
receivables as prepaid clinical trial expenses. Expenses  
are charged to the statement of comprehensive income 
as clinical trial services are carried out, or clinical trial 
materials are used. 
Exceptional items
Exceptional items represent significant items of income 
and expense which due to their nature or the expected 
infrequency of the events giving rise to them, are 
presented separately on the face of the statement of 
comprehensive income to give a better understanding  
to shareholders of the elements of financial performance 
in the period, so as to facilitate comparison with prior 
periods and to better assess trends in financial 
performance. Exceptional items include non-recurring 
reorganisation costs, costs to complete onerous or  
futile contracts, and intangible asset impairments.
Financial instruments
The Group and Company’s financial instruments 
comprise investments in subsidiaries, cash and cash 
equivalents, together with available for sale investments 
and receivables and payables arising directly from 
operations. Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash  
in hand and short term deposits which have an original 
maturity of three months or less and are readily 
convertible into known amounts of cash. Available-for-
sale financial assets are non-derivatives that are either 
designated in this category or not classified in any  
of the other categories. They are included as non-current 
assets unless management intends to dispose of the 
investments within 12 months of the financial year  
end. Bank deposits with maturity of more than three 
months at the date of inception are included in the 
classification ‘Financial assets: available for sale 
investments’, and are carried at their historic purchase 
price unless there is objective evidence of impairment,  
in which case they are written down to fair value.  
Such assets are classified as current where manage ment 
intend to dispose of the asset within twelve months of  
the financial year end. Financial instruments are valued  
at fair value, subject to review for impairment at the 
financial year end. Charges or credits for impairment are 
passed through the statement of comprehensive income.
The Group does not enter into derivative transactions, 
and it is the Group’s policy not to undertake any trading 
in financial instruments. The Group does not have any 
committed borrowing facilities. Current operations are 
financed from its own cash resources. Cash balances are 
mainly held on short and medium term deposits with 
financial institutions with a credit rating of at least A, in 
line with the Group’s policy to minimise the risk of loss. 
The main risks associated with the Group’s financial 
instruments relate to interest rate risk and foreign 
currency risk. The Group’s policy in relation to interest 
rate risk is to monitor short and medium term interest 
rates and to place cash on deposit for periods that 
optimise the amount of interest earned while maintaining 
access to sufficient funds to meet day to day cash 
requirements. In relation to foreign currency risk,  
the Group’s policy is to hold the majority of its funds  
in Sterling. No other hedging of foreign currency cash  
flows is undertaken. 
Leases
Assets acquired under leases are reviewed to see if they 
are operating leases or finance leases. The following 
characteristics would lead to classification as a finance 
lease:
—  If the leases transfer ownership of the assets at the end 
of the lease
—  If they have a bargain purchase option
—  If the lease term is for the major part of the economic 
life of the asset
—  If the leased assets are specialised for the lease only
No leases have been classified as finance leases. Costs in 
respect of operating leases are charged to the statement 
of comprehensive income on a straight line basis over  
the lease term. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 68
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2011
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are carried at their 
historical purchase cost, together with any incidental 
expenses of acquisition, less depreciation. Cost includes 
the original purchase price of the asset and any costs 
attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition 
for its intended use such as refurbishment costs.
Depreciation is calculated so as to write off the cost  
of property, plant and equipment less their estimated 
residual values on a straight line basis over the expected 
useful economic lives of the assets concerned. 
Depreciation of an asset begins when it is available for 
use. The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Manufacturing assets including  10% 
freehold property 
Short leasehold improvements 20%
(or the remaining lease  
term if shorter)
Computer equipment 33%
Office and laboratory equipment,  20% 
fixtures and fittings 
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed, 
and adjusted if appropriate, at each financial year end.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets, relating to intellectual property rights 
acquired through licensing or assigning patents and 
know-how are carried at historic cost, less accumulated 
amortisation and impairments, where the useful 
economic life of the asset is finite and the asset will 
probably generate economic benefits exceeding costs. 
Where a finite useful life of the acquired intangible asset 
cannot be determined, the asset is tested annually for 
impairment. Amortisation commences when products 
underpinned by the intellectual property rights become 
available for use. In this context, a development candidate 
which is at a stage where management would expect  
it could be the subject of a commercial development 
collaboration or available for out-licensing, then the 
intellectual property asset is considered to be available  
for use. Amortisation is calculated on a straight line  
basis over the remaining patent life of the asset. 
Expenditure on product development is capitalised as an 
intangible asset and amortised over the expected useful 
economic life of the product concerned. Capitalisation 
commences from the point at which technical feasibility 
and commercial viability of the product can be 
demonstrated and the Group is satisfied that it is probable 
that future economic benefits will result from the product 
once completed. Capitalisation ceases when the product 
receives regulatory approval for launch. No such costs 
have been capitalised to date.
Expenditure on research and development activities that 
do not meet the above criteria, including ongoing costs 
associated with acquired intellectual property rights and 
intellectual property rights generated internally by the 
Group, is charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income as incurred. Intellectual property and in-process 
research and development from acquisitions are 
recognised as intangible assets at fair value. Any residual 
excess of consideration over the fair value of net assets  
in an acquisition is recognised as goodwill in the  
financial statements.
Impairment of non-financial assets
The carrying value of non-financial assets with indefinite 
lives is reviewed annually for impairment or earlier if  
an indication of impairment occurs and provision made 
where appropriate. Charges or credits for impairment are 
passed through the statement of comprehensive income. 
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by 
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of  
an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use.  
For the purposes of assessing impairments, assets are 
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately 
identifiable cash flows or cash-generating units.
Financial assets: investments
Financial assets: investments of the Group are carried  
at cost less any provision made for impairment. Options 
over the Company’s shares have been awarded to 
employees of subsidiary companies. In accordance with 
UITF44, the Company treats the value of these awards  
as a capital contribution to the subsidiaries, resulting  
in an increase in the cost of investment.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value  
and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less provision for impairment.  
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is 
established when there is objective evidence that  
the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due 
according to the original terms of the receivables. 
Significant financial difficulties of the debtor, probability 
that the receivable will enter bankruptcy or financial 
reorganisation, and default or delinquency in payments 
(more than 30 days overdue) are considered indicators 
that the trade receivable is impaired. The amount of the 
provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying 
amount and the present value of estimated future cash 
flows, discounted at the original effective interest rate. 
The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the 
use of an allowance account, and the amount of the loss 
is recognised in the income statement within ‘selling and 
marketing costs’. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, 
it is written off against the allowance account for trade 
receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously 
written off are credited against ‘selling and marketing 
costs’ in the income statement. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 69
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits 
held on call with banks, and other short term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or 
less. Bank deposits with original maturities between three 
months and twelve months are included in current assets 
and are classified as available for sale financial assets.  
After initial recognition, available for sale investments  
are measured at their fair value.
Trade payables
Trade payables are obligations to pay for goods or services 
that have been acquired in the ordinary course of business 
from suppliers. Accounts payable are classified as current 
liabilities if payment is due within one year or less. If not, 
they are presented as non-current liabilities. Trade payables 
are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
measured at amortised cost using the effective  
interest method.
Provisions
Provisions are measured at the present value of  
the expenditure expected to be required to settle  
the obligation using a pre-tax rate that reflects current  
market assessments of the time value of money and  
the risks specific to the obligations. The increase in  
the provision due to the passage of time is recognised  
as interest expense.
When leasehold properties become redundant or excess 
space arises in those properties, the Group provides for  
all costs to the end of the lease or the anticipated date  
of surrender of the lease, net of anticipated income. 
Onerous lease provisions are discounted using the UK 
government zero-coupon bond yield applicable to  
the term of the cash flows. 
The Group recognises dilapidations provisions when: 
property leases have a legal or constructive obligation  
to reinstate any alterations or to make good dilapidations 
at the end of the lease; it is probable that an outflow of 
resources will be required to settle the obligation; and  
the amount has been reliably estimated. Dilapidations 
provisions are discounted using the UK government  
bond yield applicable to the remaining term of the 
relevant leases. 
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Costs of share 
issues are charged to the share premium account.
Government and other grants
Income from government and other grants is recognised 
over the period necessary to match them with the related 
costs which they are intended to compensate, on a 
systematic basis. This grant income is included as other 
operating income within the statement of comprehensive 
income, and the related costs are included within 
research and development costs and administrative 
expenses. Where the purchase of property, plant and 
equipment is supported by a grant, the relevant asset  
is included in the balance sheet at its full purchase  
price, and grant income is recognised over the useful  
life of the asset. The difference between grant income 
receivable and income recognised is included in  
deferred income.
Rental income
Rental income from the Group’s redundant former 
research and development facility in San Diego, USA is 
offset in the statement of comprehensive income against 
the rent payable under the head lease. Rental income is 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income 
when it becomes receivable. 
Employee benefit costs
The Group operates a defined contribution pension 
scheme for its directors and employees. The assets  
of the scheme are held in independently administered  
funds. The pension cost charge recognised in the period 
represents amounts payable by the Group to the scheme.
Share based payments
Equity settled share based payments under which the 
Group receives services from employees as consideration 
for equity instruments (options) are measured at fair value 
at the date of grant and expensed on a straight-line basis 
over the vesting period of the award. Options issued on 
the same date are valued in batches where the valuation 
model assumptions are the same. At each financial year 
end, the Group revises its estimate of the number of 
options in each batch that are expected to become 
exercisable based on the non-market vesting condition. 
At the end of the vesting period for each batch of options 
the cumulative charge for share-based payment reflects 
the actual options that have vested, with no charge  
for those options which were forfeit prior to vesting.  
The financial consequences of revisions to the original 
estimates, if any, are recognised in the current year 
statement of comprehensive income either as an 
addition to or a deduction from the charge for share-based 
payment, with a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
The fair value of share options is measured using a 
Black-Scholes option pricing model. Where complex 
market performance criteria exist, a Monte Carlo model 
has been used to establish the fair value on grant.  
When share options are exercised the proceeds received 
are credited to share capital (nominal value) and  
share premium. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 70
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2011
Other employee benefits
The expected cost of compensated short term absence 
(e.g. holidays) is recognised when employees render 
services that increase their entitlement. Accrual is made 
for holidays earned but not taken, and prepayments 
recognised for holidays taken in excess of days earned. 
Foreign currency translation and transactions
Items included in the financial statements of each of  
the Group’s entities are measured using the currency  
of the primary economic environment in which the entity 
operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated 
financial statements are presented in Sterling, which  
is the Company’s and the Group’s functional and 
presentational currency.
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies  
are translated into the functional currency at the rates  
of exchange ruling at the end of the financial year. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into  
the functional currency at the rates of exchange ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Foreign exchange differences 
are taken to the statement of comprehensive income  
in the year in which they arise.
Assets and liabilities of the Company’s US subsidiary are 
translated to Sterling at the year end exchange rate, whilst 
its statements of income and cash flows are translated  
at monthly average rates. Redundant assets at the US 
subsidiary’s former laboratories have been written down 
to a book value of zero and have no impact on present  
or future exchange differences. Translation differences 
that arise are taken directly to a currency translation 
account within equity.
Taxation including deferred income tax
The charge/credit for current tax is based on the results 
for the year, adjusted for items which are non-assessable 
or disallowed. It is calculated using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantially enacted at the financial  
year end.
Deferred income tax is accounted for using the liability 
method in respect of temporary differences arising  
from differences between the carrying amount of  
assets and liabilities in the financial statements and  
the corresponding tax bases used in the computation  
of taxable profit. In principle, deferred income tax liabilities 
are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and 
deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent 
that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can  
be utilised. 
Deferred income tax liabilities are recognised for  
taxable temporary differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and associates, except where the Group and 
company are able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax is calculated at the average tax rates 
that are expected to apply to the period when the asset  
is realised or the liability is settled. Deferred income tax  
is charged or credited in the statement of comprehensive 
income, except when it relates to items credited or 
charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred 
income tax is also dealt with in equity.
2, Financial risk management 
Financial risk factors
The Group’s relatively simple structure, principally 
operating in the United Kingdom, and the lack of debt 
financing reduces the range of financial risks to which  
it is exposed. Monitoring of financial risk is part of the 
board’s ongoing risk management, the effectiveness of 
which is reviewed annually. The Group’s agreed policies 
are implemented by the chief financial officer, who 
submits reports at each board meeting. The Group does 
not use financial derivatives, and it is the Group’s policy 
not to undertake any trading in financial instruments.
(a) Foreign exchange risk
At the current time, the Group’s revenues are mostly 
receivable in United States Dollars, and certain of its 
expenditures are payable in Euros and US Dollars. The 
majority of operating costs are denominated in Sterling.  
In 2011, the level of US Dollar-denominated receipts was 
closely matched by US-Dollar denominated payments, 
such that a 10% difference in the £/$ exchange rate would 
only have had an impact of approximately £10,000 over 
the year. In the future if this degree of matching was not 
present, it could present a possible source of foreign 
exchange risk. The Group had a slightly greater exposure 
to the £/€ exchange rate due to the need to fund 
expenditure denominated in Euros. Had Sterling been  
10% weaker in relation to the Euro, the increased cost  
in 2011 would have been approximately £224,000. 
(b) Interest rate risk
The Group does not have any committed borrowing 
facilities. Current operations are financed from its own 
cash resources. The Group’s policy is to maximise interest 
receivable on deposits, subject to maintaining access  
to sufficient liquid funds to meet day to day operational 
requirements, and preserving the security of invested 
funds. With the current low level of bank interest rates, 
interest receivable on bank deposits in 2011 was just 
£144,000 (2010: £213,000). 
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower  
in 2011, the impact on net loss in 2011 would have been  
a decrease/increase of £111,000 (2010: £164,000) due  
to changes in the amount of interest receivable. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 71
(c) Credit risks
The Group’s policy is to place funds with financial 
institutions rated at least A and to distribute deposits 
between several banks. 
Currently the majority of the Group’s revenue and a 
significant proportion of the Group’s trade and other 
receivables derive from a single trading relationship. 
Although the counter-party is a profitable, well-capitalised 
multinational organisation, there is a theoretical credit  
risk associated with this concentration of revenue. 
(d) Cash flow and Liquidity risk
At present the Group’s operations are funded from its 
cash and short-term investments. The maturity profile  
of investments is structured to ensure that sufficient  
liquid funds are available to meet planned operating 
requirements. To date the Group’s funding has been 
provided mainly by the issue of shares and from 
commercial collaborations. Most recently the Company 
raised £20 million before costs from a placing and open 
offer which closed on 10 January 2011. Future working 
capital is expected to be provided by commercial 
collaborations and licensing transactions. Licensing 
transactions typically provide funding from milestone-
based payments which are significant in size but 
infrequent. There can be no certainty that this source  
of funding will be timely or sufficient, and that additional 
funding from other sources, including the issue of further 
shares, will not be required. In planning the Group’s 
activities and its financial resources, the directors take 
account of the probability receiving income from 
commercial collaborations, and of the likely availability  
of other sources of funding. The Group’s spending plans 
are set to achieve a balance between adding value  
to the key development programmes while seeking  
to maximise the operating window provided  
by current funds. The directors consider that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources  
to continue in operational existence for the  
foreseeable future. 
(e) Pricing risk
Currently the Group’s revenue derives from collaboration 
milestones and reimbursement of funded research and 
development, which should not be sensitive to pricing 
risk. The ocular research and development collaboration 
with Sanofi is subject to an overall cap of US$24 million, 
which means that if the relevant costs escalate from the 
levels currently anticipated, the Group would suffer future 
losses equal to the amount of cost escalation. 
(f) Capital management
The Group manages its cash, cash equivalents and 
available for sale investments in order to ensure it  
has working capital to meet its day to day needs, and  
has never failed in this objective. Further information  
on cash flow and liquidity risk is given in section (d) 
above. The Group is not subject to any regulation 
requiring any specific capital management.
Derivative financial instruments and hedging
There were no derivatives at 31 December 2011  
or 31 December 2010, and hedge accounting has  
not been used.
Fair value estimates
The fair value of short term deposits with a maturity  
of one year or less is assumed to be the book value.
3, Segmental analysis
The chief operating decision-maker has been identified 
as the Senior Management Group (SMG), comprising  
the executive directors and other key members of 
management. The SMG reviews the Group’s internal 
reporting in order to assess performance and allocate 
resources. Management has determined the operating 
segments based on internal management reports. 
The SMG considers that the business comprises  
a single activity, which is biotechnology research and 
development. The SMG reviews the Group’s profit  
or loss and its cash flows, assets and liabilities on  
a whole-company basis. In carrying out these reviews, 
the SMG considers all material items of income and 
expenditures that are directly attributable to individual 
development programmes. The internal management 
reports do not allocate assets and liabilities or shared 
overheads to individual products, as the Group does  
not consider it meaningful, in the present development 
phase, to attempt to attribute profits or losses to  
individual products. 
Based on the above considerations, there is considered  
to be one reportable segment: biotechnology research 
and development.
Internal and external reporting is on a consolidated basis, 
with purchases and sales between subsidiaries eliminated 
on consolidation. Therefore the segment financial 
information is the same as that set out in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated 
balance sheet, the consolidated statement of cash flows 
and the consolidated statement of changes in equity.  Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 72

5, Exceptional items 
Exceptional items represent significant items of income or expense which due to their nature or the expected 
infrequency of the events giving rise to them, are presented separately on the face of the statement of comprehensive 
income to give a better understanding to shareholders of the elements of financial performance in the year, so as  
to facilitate comparison with prior periods and to better assess trends in financial performance.

8, Taxation 
The Group is entitled to claim tax credits in the United Kingdom for certain research and development expenditure. 
The amount included in the statement of comprehensive income for the year ended 31 December 2011 comprises  
the credit receivable by the Group for the year less overseas tax paid in the year. The United Kingdom corporation  
tax research and development credit is paid in arrears once tax returns have been filed and agreed. The tax credit 
recognised in the financial statements but not yet received is included in current tax assets in the balance sheet.  
The amounts for 2011 have not yet been agreed with the relevant tax authorities.

At 31 December 2011, the Group had tax losses to be carried forward of approximately £87 .3 million (2010: £83.0 million) 
of which £82.6 million has been agreed with the revenue authorities. Of the Group tax losses, £87.3 million (2010:  
£83.0 million) arose in the United Kingdom. 
There is no deferred tax recognised (see note 20).
9, Basic loss and diluted loss per ordinary share
The basic loss per share has been calculated by dividing the loss for the year by the weighted average number of shares 
in issue during the year ended 31 December 2011 (935,012,543; 2010: 543,924,620). 
As the Group is loss-making, there were no potentially dilutive options in either year. There is therefore no difference 
between the basic loss per ordinary share and the diluted loss per ordinary share. 
10, Loss for the financial year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company’s statement of comprehensive income has  
not been included in these financial statements. The Company’s loss for the year was £15,861,000 (2010: £31,674,000).  
The loss includes a charge of £15,725,000 (2010: £31,522,000) for impairment of investments in subsidiaries.  Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 76

For intangible assets regarded as having a finite useful life amortisation commences when products underpinned by  
the intellectual property rights become available for use. Amortisation is calculated on a straight line basis over the 
remaining patent life of the asset. 
An intangible asset is regarded as having an indefinite useful life when, based on an analysis of all of the relevant factors, 
there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the asset is expected to generate net cash inflows for the entity. 
Such assets are tested annually for impairment. 
In-process R&D relates to the product Hi-8
®
 MEL acquired as part of the acquisition of Oxxon Therapeutics Limited in 
2007. During the year a process to divest Hi-8
® 
MEL was concluded without securing a partner. The asset was fully 
impaired with a charge of £3,136,000 (2010: charge of £3,949,000).
Impairment losses are recognised for the amount by which each asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. Where the asset 
is no longer being developed by the Company sales value less cost to sell is used as the recoverable amount.  
Value in use is calculated using estimated discounted future cash flows. Key assumptions in the discounted cash flow 
calculations are:
—  The product is developed by a collaborative partner who funds all future development costs and markets the product.
—  The Group receives an initial licence fee, milestone payments and royalties on sales.
—  The cash flow projections include estimates for selling price, royalty rates, population growth, disease incidence  
and market penetration. 
—  The resulting cash receipts are discounted at 12% per annum.
—  The cash flow projections are a long-term view, based on the expected patent life. Due to the length of the 
development cycle for innovative medicines, this period is significantly longer than 5 years.  Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 77
The key assumptions are management estimates, based where possible on available information for similar products. 
Due to the novelty and early stage of development of the Group’s products, it is not possible to benchmark these 
assumptions against past experience. 
Impairment and amortisation charges are included within research and development costs in the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Intellectual property rights comprise third party patent rights that have been purchased by the Group. No in-house 
research and development or patent costs are included in intangible assets.
The Company had no intangibles at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010.

On 25 February 2011 the Group purchased a freehold property in Oxford, UK comprising a manufacturing facility  
and associated offices and laboratories for £1,896,000 including costs of acquisition. The facility was previously 
approved by the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) to Good Manufacturing Practice  
(GMP) standards. Oxford BioMedica has invested a further £1,219,000 on the building and £477,000 on plant and 
equipment in order to commission the facility, a process which was substantially complete by 31 December 2011. 
The Company had no property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 78

All of the above subsidiaries have been consolidated in these financial statements.
At each year end the directors review the carrying value of the Company’s investment in subsidiaries, by reference  
to the Group’s market capitalisation on the London Stock Exchange. Where there is a material and sustained shortfall,  
or a significant and sustained change in the business resulting in an increase in market capitalisation, the directors 
consider this to be a trigger of an impairment review as set out in IAS 36, and the carrying value of the Company’s 
investments in subsidiaries is adjusted. The directors consider that reference to the market capitalisation of the Group  
is an appropriate external measure of the value of the Group for this purpose. Following an impairment review at  
31 December 2011 a £15,725,000 impairment charge was recognised. Cumulative impairment of £117,201,000 was  
held at 31 December 2011. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 79

The fair value of trade and other receivables are the current book values.
At 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2010 none of the trade receivables were aged over three months and 
consequently there are considered to be no past due trade receivables. No provision for impairment of receivables  
has been recognised. Non-current receivables are not discounted as the impact of discounting would not be material. 
Accrued income of £33,000 (2010: £1,366,000) relates to R&D funding receivable from Sanofi.
In January 2011 the Company raised £20 million before costs in a placing and open offer. Costs related to the share 
issue of £777,000 classified as prepaid costs of share issues at 31 December 2010 were recognised as costs of share 
issues in 2011. 
Prepaid clinical trial expenses mainly comprise advance payments to clinical trial sites.
The carrying amounts of the Group’s trade and other receivables are denominated in the following currencies:

On 28 April 2009 the Group entered into a collaborative programme with Sanofi to develop gene therapy products  
to treat ocular diseases. An initial non-refundable payment of US$26 million (£16,641,000) was received. This is being 
recognised as revenue on a straight line basis over 42 to 51 months (the expected duration of the initial stage of the 
collabo ration for each of the four products). Revenue to date of £12,440,000 has been recognised under this collabo ra-
tion, of which £4,665,000 was recognised in 2011. The remaining £4,201,000 is classified as deferred income. £4,031,000 
is expected to be recognised as income in the next 12 months and is classified as current: the remaining £170,000 is 
classified as non-current.
Over the term of the ocular gene therapy collaboration, Oxford BioMedica may recover from Sanofi up to US$24 million 
in research and development funding. Project costs in excess of US$24 million will be borne by Oxford BioMedica.  
To date, £11,387,000 has been recognised as revenue, of which £2,651,000 was recognised in 2011. £355,000 (2010: 
£457,000) has been classified as current deferred income.
The Company had no deferred income in 2011 or 2010.

The dilapidations provision relates to anticipated costs of restoring the leasehold property in Oxford, UK to its  
original condition at the end of the present leases in 2016, discounted using the rate per the Bank of England nominal 
yield curve. The equivalent rate was used in 2010. The provision will be utilised at the end of the leases if they are  
not renewed. 
The onerous lease provision relates to the estimated rental shortfall in respect of a redundant property in San Diego, 
USA which has been sub-let for the remainder of the lease term until June 2012, discounted using the rate per the  
Bank of England nominal yield curve. The equivalent rate was used in 2010. The provision will be utilised over the term 
of the lease.
The Company had no provisions at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010.
19, Financial instruments
The Group’s and company’s financial instruments comprise investments in subsidiaries, cash and cash equivalents, 
together with available for sale investments, trade and other receivables, and trade and other payables. Additional 
disclosures are set out in the corporate governance statement and in note 2 relating to risk management.

In accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’ the Group has reviewed all contracts 
for embedded derivatives that are required to be separately accounted for if they do not meet certain requirements set 
out in the standard. There were no such derivatives identified at 31 December 2011 or 31 December 2010.

The Directors consider that the fair values of the Group’s financial instruments do not differ significantly from their  
book values.  Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 82

for the year ended 31 December 2011
20, Deferred taxation
Neither the Company nor the Group had any recognised deferred tax assets or liabilities at 31 December 2011 (2010: 
nil). In light of the Group’s continuing losses, recovery of the deferred tax asset is not sufficiently certain, and therefore 
no asset has been recognised.
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the March 2011 budget statement.  
The Finance Act 2011, which was substantively enacted on 29 March 2011, included legislation reducing the  
main corpo ra tion tax rate from 28 per cent to 26 per cent from 1 April 2011. The Finance (No. 2) Act 2011, which  
was substantively enacted on 5 July 2011, included legislation reducing the main corporation tax rate from  
26 per cent to 25 per cent from 1 April 2012. The effects of these reductions in corporation tax rate are included  
in these financial statements. 
Further reductions to the main corporation tax rate are proposed to reduce the rate by 1 per cent per annum to 23  
per cent by 1 April 2014. These further changes had not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are 
therefore not included in these financial statements. These further reductions in the corporation tax rate are not 
expected to have a material impact on the tax figures disclosed in these financial statements.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2011
Options granted to UK employees could give rise to a national insurance (NI) liability on exercise. For options granted 
up to October 2006, the Company obtained undertakings from the holders of the relevant options to pay any 
secondary NI on exercise, so there is no NI liability in respect of these options. In respect of options (including LTIP 
awards) granted from February 2007 there are no such employee undertakings, so an NI liability could arise on the 
exercise of the options. A provision of £4,000 (2010: £59,000) is included in accruals for the potential NI liability accrued 
to 31 December on relevant options that were above water, based on the year end share price of 3.50p (2010: 5.53p)  
per share. 
23, Share based payments
All eligible employees of the Group are awarded share options or long term incentive plan (LTIP) awards. Options 
granted to UK employees have been issued under the Oxford BioMedica 1996 (No.1) Share Option Scheme (“the 1996 
Scheme”) or its successor the Oxford BioMedica 2007 Share Option Scheme (“the 2007 Scheme”). It is the Company’s 
policy under the share option scheme to make grants of options to new UK employees at approximately six-month 
intervals during their first three years of employment, and at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee, annually 
thereafter. Since the introduction of the LTIP in 2007, directors and certain senior managers are not eligible to 
participate in the share option scheme, but are eligible for LTIP awards. 
Options granted under the 1996 Scheme have a fixed exercise price based on the market price at the date of grant.  
The contractual life of the options is seven years. Options cannot normally be exercised before the third anniversary  
of the date of grant. For options granted to directors and to certain other employees since 2001, the options are 
exercisable only if at the time of exercise, or for at least 12 months in aggregate during the three years before exercise, 
the percentage increase in Oxford BioMedica plc’s total shareholder return since the grant of the option exceeds the 
percentage increase in the FTSE techMARK MediScience index. 
Options granted under the 2007 scheme also have a fixed exercise price based on the market price at the time  
of grant. The contractual life of these options is ten years. Options cannot normally be exercised before the third 
anniversary of the date of grant.
LTIP awards made to date have been nil-cost options, exercisable at par on the third anniversary of the date of  
grant. Release of the LTIP awards depends on the satisfaction of performance conditions based on comparative  
total shareholder return against a comparator group of companies. The LTIP awards since June 2010 also have a 
secondary milestone-based performance condition.
Options, other than LTIP awards, have been valued using a Black-Scholes option pricing model. The LTIP awards,  
which contain complex market-based conditions, were valued using a Monte Carlo model. For each relevant option 
grant, individual valuation assumptions were assessed based upon conditions at the date of grant. The range  
of assumptions in the calculation of share based payment in 2011 is as follows: 
    Share options Share options Share options Share options 
    granted 13.03.08 granted 25.03.09 granted 01.04.10 granted 15.03.11

Before 2009, expected volatility for LTIP awards was based on historical share price volatility up to the date of grant.  
For LTIP awards since 2009 a volatility cone analysis has been used, as this approach provides better estimate of the 
mean reverting annual rate of volatility. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on UK government bonds of a term 
consistent with the expected option life. 
Excluding the LTIP awards, which are exercisable at par subject to satisfaction of the performance condition, the 
weighted average share price for options granted during the year was 5.5p (2010: 9.5p). No options were exercised  
in 2011. The weighted average share price for options exercised during 2010 was 6.9p. The total charge for the year 
relating to employee share based payment plans was £431,000 (2010: £542,000), all of which related to equity-settled 
share based payment transactions. A reconciliation of movements in all options over the year to 31 December 2011  
and an analysis of options outstanding at the year end are shown below.

LentiVector
®
 Platform
Oxford BioMedica’s LentiVector
®
 platform technology is 
an advanced lentiviral vector based gene delivery system 
which is designed to overcome the safety and delivery 
problems associated with earlier generations of vector 
systems. The technology can stably deliver genes into 
cells with up to 100% efficiency and can integrate genes 
into non-dividing cells including neurons in the brain and 
retinal cells in the eye. In such cell types, studies suggest 
that gene expression could be maintained indefinitely. 
The LentiVector
®
 platform technology also has a larger 
capacity than most other vector systems and can 
accommodate multiple therapeutic genes.
ProSavin
®
: Parkinson’s disease
ProSavin
®
 is a gene-based treatment for Parkinson’s 
disease, a progressive movement disorder caused by the 
degeneration of dopamine producing nerve cells in the 
brain. ProSavin
®
 uses the Company’s LentiVector
®
 platform 
technology to deliver the genes for three enzymes that 
are required for the synthesis of dopamine. The product  
is administered locally to the region of the brain called the 
striatum, converting cells into a replacement dopamine 
factory within the brain, thus replacing the patient’s own 
lost source of the neurotransmitter.
RetinoStat
®
: “wet” age-related macular degeneration
RetinoStat
®
 is a gene-based treatment for neovascular 
“wet” age-related macular degeneration (AMD) and 
diabetic retinopathy (DR). RetinoStat
®
 aims to preserve 
and improve the vision of patients through anti-angio-
genesis; blocking the formation of new blood vessels.  
The product uses the Company’s LentiVector
®
 platform 
technology to deliver two anti-angiogenic genes, 
endo statin and angiostatin, directly to the retina.
StarGen
™
: Stargardt disease
StarGen
™ 
is a gene-based therapy for the treatment of 
Stargardt disease. The disease is caused by a mutation  
of the ABCR gene which leads to the degeneration of 
photoreceptors in the retina and vision loss. StarGen
™ 
uses the Company’s LentiVector
®
 platform technology  
to deliver a corrected version of the ABCR gene. A single 
administration of the product directly to the retina could 
provide long-term or potentially permanent correction.
UshStat
®
: Usher syndrome type 1B
UshStat
®
 is a gene-based therapy for the treatment  
of Usher syndrome type 1B. The disease is caused by  
a mutation of the gene encoding myosin VIIA (MY07A), 
which leads to progressive retinitis pigmentosa 
combined with a congenital hearing defect. UshStat
®
 
intends to address vision loss due to retinitis pigmentosa 
by using the Company’s LentiVector
®
 platform 
technology to deliver a corrected version of the MYO7A 
gene. A single adminis tration of the product could  
provide long-term or potentially permanent correction.
EncorStat
®
: corneal graft rejection
EncorStat
®
 is a gene-based treatment for the prevention 
of corneal graft rejection. Corneal grafting arises from  
a need to remove and replace pathology arising in the 
cornea causing ‘clouding’. Although one of the most 
successfully transplanted tissues, a significant number  
of grafts are rejected due to vascularisation. EncorStat
®
 
uses the Company’s LentiVector
®
 platform technology  
to deliver endostatin and angiostatin ex vivo to donor 
corneas prior to transplant in order to block vascularisation 
and to prevent graft rejection.
Glaucoma-GT: chronic glaucoma
Glaucoma-GT is a gene-based treatment for the 
treatment of chronic glaucoma.  Chronic glaucoma 
results from a partial blockage within the trabecular 
meshwork of the eye, the tissue mainly responsible for 
draining the internal fluid of the eye (aqueous humour). 
As the aqueous humour builds up, it causes increased 
intraocular pressure which can damage the optic nerve 
and lead to permanent patches of vision loss or, in some 
cases, blindness. Glaucoma-GT uses the Company’s 
LentiVector
®
 platform technology expressing a COX-2 
gene and a PGF-2a receptor gene in order to reduce 
intraocular pressure and minimise the risk of disease 
progression.
MoNuDin
®
: motor neuron disease
MoNuDin
®
 is a gene-based treatment for motor neuron 
disease. This progressive, usually fatal, neurodegenerative 
disease is caused by the degeneration of motor neurons, 
the nerve cells in the central nervous system that control 
voluntary muscle movement. MoNuDin
®
 uses the 
Company’s LentiVector
®
 platform technology to deliver  
a neuroprotective gene, vascular endothelial growth factor 
(VEGF), to prevent further degeneration of the motor 
neurons and potentially restore motor function.

5T4 Tumour Antigen
The 5T4 tumour antigen is a unique protein found on 
most common types of solid cancer. It is potentially a 
valuable target for novel anti-cancer interventions given 
its restricted expression in normal tissues and its high 
prevalence on the surface of both primary and metastatic 
cancerous cells. The 5T4 tumour antigen was identified 
through research into the similarities between the 
development of the placenta during pregnancy and the 
progression of cancer. 5T4 is produced by both cancerous 
cells and also by placental and foetal cells, suggesting 
that the process of immunological escape in pregnancy
and cancer is based on similar mechanisms.
TroVax
®
 (MVA-5T4): cancer
TroVax
®
 is a therapeutic vaccine that stimulates the 
immune system to destroy cancerous cells expressing  
the 5T4 tumour antigen which is present on most solid 
tumours. The product is based on an attenuated modified 
vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), engineered to deliver the 5T4 
antigen. Vaccinia viruses are commonly used as delivery 
systems for the development of antigen-specific vaccines. 
MVA is the vaccinia strain of choice because of its 
excellent safety profile.
Targeted Antibody Therapy: cancer
The 5T4-targeted antibody therapy is a humanised 
mono clonal antibody linked to the potent anti-cancer 
agent, calicheamicin. The product binds to the 5T4 
antigen on the surface of cancerous cells. Once bound, 
the complex is internalised by the tumour cell, the 
calicheamicin is released from the antibody, and the  
free drug kills the cancerous cell.
Anti-Angiogenisis
The creation of new blood vessels, known as angio 
genesis, is a critical element in tumour formation and 
growth. Endostatin and angiostatin were discovered 
by one of the best known researchers in the field of 
angiogenesis, Dr Judah Folkman of Children’s Hospital 
and the Harvard Medical School in Boston. The proteins 
have shown potent anti-cancer activity in pre-clinical 
models and a potentially additive effect when used 
in combination.
EndoAngio-GT: cancer
EndoAngio-GT is a gene therapy for the treatment of solid 
tumours. The product uses a viral vector to deliver the 
genes for endostatin and angiostatin, which inhibit tumour 
growth by blocking the formation of new blood vessels.
Hi-8
®
 PrimeBoost
Heterologous prime-boost immunotherapy involves 
priming the immune system to target an antigen 
using one vector and then boosting the response 
by adminis tration of the same antigen using a different 
vector. In many cases this can elicit immune responses 
of greater magnitude and breadth than can be achieved 
by priming and boosting with the same vector. Oxford 
BioMedica’s Hi-8
®
 PrimeBoost technology can stimulate 
potentially potent and specific cellular immune responses 
against diseased cells, even those expressing very low 
levels of the antigen.
Hi-8
®
 MEL: melanoma
Hi-8
®
 MEL is a therapeutic vaccine for metastatic 
melanoma. The product uses two different vector  
systems, one based on plasmid DNA and the other  
based on modified vaccinia virus Ankara (MVA), to  
induce a mela noma-specific cellular immune response. 
Both vectors contain the Mel3 polyepitope string,  
which encodes seven defined peptides from five  
different melanoma-specific antigens.
GDEPT
Gene-directed enzyme prodrug therapy (GDEPT) is 
the use of genetic delivery to administer an enzyme into 
diseased cells that can activate a non-toxic prodrug into 
a toxic agent. Cyclophosphamide (CPA) is an anti-cancer 
prodrug that is activated in the liver by the naturally 
occurring enzyme P450 and then disperses via the 
circu lation to the tumour target.
MetXia
®
: pancreatic cancer
MetXia
®
 is a GDEPT strategy to deliver a P450 enzyme  
to cancerous cells, enabling cyclophosphamide (CPA)  
to be activated within the tumour. MetXia uses a highly-
engineered retroviral delivery system to achieve efficient 
expression of a specific P450 enzyme within the cancerous 
cells. It can be administered locally to non-resectable 
pancreatic cancer prior to treatment with CPA. Oxford BioMedica plc   Annual Report and Accounts 2011 92

Considerable emphasis has been placed on
increasing the Company’s land bank which at 31
December 2003 stood at 1458 plots (2002: 945
plots) with an additional 123 plots where
unconditional contracts have been exchanged.
The funding for the enlarged land bank has been
achieved partly from profits and partly from
increased borrowings.  Our gearing expressed as a
percentage of net debt to shareholders funds has
increased to 75.2% from 37.8%.  The current level
of borrowings has been arranged in a structured
manner taking into account the Company’s
present trading strengths, the value of its
underlying land bank and future cash flow.
At the important level of Human Resources we
have continued to develop skills and expertise
within our organisation and to foster relationships
with suppliers and sub-contractors.  On behalf of
the Board, I wish to thank them all sincerely for
their contribution to this year’s extremely
satisfying performance.
Future Prospects
We have started the current financial year with a
highly satisfactory level of forward reservations.
This, coupled with the scope afforded by the
increased size and quality of the land under our
control, enables your Board to plan confidently
for further increases in the physical output 
of new homes.
Based upon these factors, I look forward to a year
of continuing improvements in the financial
performance of the company.
Dividend
The Board is recommending an increased final
dividend of 8.0p per share which together with
the interim dividend of 4.0p makes a total of 12.0p
for 2003.  This represents an increase of 60% over
the 2002 level of 7.5p.  This final dividend will be
paid on 14 May 2004 to shareholders on the
register at 16 April 2004.
Results
I am delighted to be able to report on a further
year of significant growth in the Company’s
business.  Pre-tax profits for the year ended 31
December 2003 increased by 71.5% to £12.88m
(2002: £7.51m), giving rise to an improved
earnings per share of 79.2p (2002: 49.3p).
T urnover advanced by 27.6% to £62.8m (2002:
£49.2m), aided by increased activity levels and
more importantly, operating margins improved 
to 21.9% from 16.4% achieved in 2002.  
Review of Operations
As reported to you in my trading update to
shareholders in December 2003, the Company
continued to enjoy favourable trading conditions
in the area of our operations, (Yorkshire,
Nottinghamshire and Lincolnshire).  Average
selling prices across the product range rose to
£139,500 per plot from £121,500 in the previous
year, an increase of 14.8%.  The Company was
also able to achieve its targeted sales output of 450
plots (2002: 405 plots), with little or no increase in
sales incentives.
The continuing momentum in our sales initiative
has been aided by the flexibility of having an
enlarged land bank and the widening of our
product range.  These factors have helped to
mitigate the delays in planning consents currently
experienced by most house builders.

Ben Bailey Plc
Whilst successfully completing 450 new homes in
2003, your company has taken advantage of the
favourable housing market to enable it to report
increased turnover, enhanced margins and a
further year of record profits.  This structured
growth emanates from good local knowledge of
the land and housing markets, coupled with solid
management of the operational aspects of the
business – marketing, design, technical and
construction.
The Market
There is no doubt that the economic environment
of low inflation and low interest rates coupled
with good employment prospects, has enabled the
housing market to maintain its momentum
throughout the year, despite early concerns of the
Iraq War.  This conflict did have some effect, but a
prompt conclusion ensured customer confidence
was not damaged.
In our area of operations - east of the Pennines
between Leeds and Nottingham - house price
inflation continued throughout the year, whilst
planning delays frustrated the supply side of our
industry.  Demand for our range of house types
was strong as output increased to 450 plots (2002:
405 plots). This together with an increase of
14.8% in the average selling price to £139,500
enabled the Company to achieve record turnover
of £62.8 million (2002: £49.2m).  
Our new house types ranging from one bedroom
apartments through to five bedroom detached
executive homes are now firmly established and
proving popular with both home buyers and
investors seeking to buy to let.
Financial Review
T urnover
T urnover increased from £49.2m to £62.8m,
which represents an increase of 27.6%.  The
number of legal completions increased to 450
units, an increase of 11.1% over the 2002 level of
405 units.  The average selling price increased
from £121,500 to £139,500, an increase of 14.8%.   
Operating Profit
Operating Profit increased by 69.9% to £13.7m,
(2002: £8.1m).  Operating Margins increased to
21.9% (2002: 16.4%).  This significant increase
reflects the strength of the housing market within
our area of operations.
Profit before Tax
The Profit before tax increased by 71.5% to
£12.88m, (2002: £7.51m).  The effective tax rate
was 30.3% (2002: 29.4%).  Basic Earnings per
Share increased by 60.8% to 79.24p per share
(2002: 49.27p).
Capital Employed
The return on opening capital employed was
71.4% (2002: 47.4%).  The increase in capital
employed in the year of £20.65m arose as a result
of increased spending on development land of
£26.36m (2002: £10.05m).  This has resulted in
the Company’s land bank of owned plots with
planning permission increasing to 1458 plots
(2002: 945 plots).
Cash Flow and Gearing
The significant investment of £26.36m in 2003 in
development land referred to previously, has
resulted in an operating cash outflow of £8.05m
(2002: operating cash inflow £5.09m).  As a result
of this, Gearing expressed as a percentage of net
debt to shareholder funds has increased from
37.8% to 75.2%.

Chief Executive’s Review
4
T reasury 
It is the Company’s policy to finance itself
through a mixture of shareholders’ funds and
debt.  In March 2003 the company negotiated its
banking facilities to incorporate a three year
committed facility of £18 million with a further
£7 million borrowing facility to meet short-term
borrowing requirements.  The Company has an
interest rate risk management policy which allows
a proportion of the Company’s debt to be
protected against adverse interest rate movements,
by using simple interest rate risk management
products.  At 31 December 2003 the Company
had entered into an interest rate swap from
floating to a fixed base rate of 3.94% in respect of
£9 million of its borrowings.
Corporate Social Responsibility Review
This Company has always recognised its
responsibilities and commitment to the local
community.  Our operational area has seen
significant structural change with the demise of
the mining, steel and rail industries.  We have
always helped and must continue to help in areas
where we have carried out development.
The Company provides significant financial
assistance to local schools seeking approval as
‘Special Status’ schools.  We actively encourage all
of our employees, sub-contractors and suppliers
to contribute towards the community projects – a
notable example of this is the re-furbishment
work on classrooms at the Robert Ogden School
for Autistic Children based here in the Dearne
Valley.
Health and Safety
Health and Safety Management is an essential part
of our business.  The Company in the conduct of
its activities will ensure that it protects the Health
and Safety of its employees and other persons who
may be affected.  Procedural Review and Safety
Audits are carried out at all of our locations on a
regular basis with the aim of achieving further
improvements to create a safe and incident free
culture.
T raining
The Company firmly believes that well-trained
employees are vitally important for its future
success.  We encourage our employees to develop
their skills through both in-house training and
external courses.  The Company has always had an
apprentice scheme for joiners and bricklayers.  
T wenty four young people are currently employed
by the Company at various stages of their
apprenticeships, which combines site based
learning with attendance at local colleges.

Ben Bailey Plc
Design and Development
The Government’s requirements to increase
density and re-use Brownfield land has forced all
house builders to adapt to these new regulations
whilst providing customer satisfaction.  We now
have a full range of new house types and
apartments that comply with these regulations.
Improvements and enhancements will evolve as
we respond to the market place.
Our range of apartments has now been prototyped
and are selling well across a number of
developments, with the first completions due in
early 2004.
Land
Your Board recognises that it is vital to have an
adequate supply of good quality land. The year
saw an increase in our land bank to 1458 plots,
which represents a significant increase over the
2002 level of 945 plots.  This increased land bank
equates to almost three years’ sales, which will
enable us to plan ahead with greater certainty
whilst mitigating the effects of planning delay.
Brownfield developments increase the lead-time
between acquisition and first completion and we
will continue to enhance our land holdings to
achieve our forward growth.
Paul Russell
Chief Executive
Construction
A shortage of skilled craftsmen is now a factor
across the industry. We believe that our training
programmes, local knowledge and quality of site
management are key issues in successful house
building.
It is pleasing to report that Ian Bedford, our Site
Manager at our Manor Grange, Shafton
development received a Seal of Excellence Award
from the House Building Council’s ‘Pride in the
Job’ competition for the house building industry.
This award is only given to 100 Site Managers
across the United Kingdom.
Our Employees and Sub-Contractors
This excellent result could not have been achieved
without the efforts and support from all our
employees and sub-contractors.  Once again, we
thank them for their efforts and commitment.

Directors’ Report (continued)
Derivatives and other Financial Instruments
The Group’s financial instruments comprise cash, borrowings and other items such as trade debtors and
trade creditors which arise directly from operations.  The main purpose of these financial instruments is
to raise finance for the Group’s operations.  It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the
Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.  The Group takes advantage
of the exemption available for short-term debtors and creditors.
Taxation status
The Company is not a close company within the meaning of the Income and Corporation T axes Act
1988 and there has been no change in this respect since 31 December 2003.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors to the Company will be proposed at
the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting
A notice convening the Annual General Meeting of the Company at 12 noon on 7 May 2004 at the
Doncaster Moat House Hotel is set out on pages 39 to 40, and a proxy form for use in relation to such
meeting accompanies this document. Your attention is drawn to the items of special business, being
resolutions 8 and 9 set out in such Notice of Meeting.
Resolution 8
Under Section 89(1) of the Companies Act 1985, if the directors wish to allot any of the unissued shares
for cash, they must first offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to the number of shares they
each hold at that time. Resolution 8, a special resolution, proposes to grant limited power to the directors
to allot shares for cash without the need to first offer them to existing shareholders.  The power being
sought will permit the directors to deal with problems arising from fractional entitlements in any rights
issue, to allot shares pursuant to the Company’s Executive and Savings-Related Share Option Schemes
and to allot up to 586,855 shares (representing approximately five per cent of the current issued share
capital as at the date of this document) and will expire no later than fifteen months from the passing of
the resolution.  The directors intend to comply with the cumulative limits on exercise of the
disapplication entitlement which are contained in the Pre-Emption Group guidelines of the Investment
Committees.
55485 Ben Bailey 07-40  25/2/2004  4:32 pm  Page 9 Directors’ Remuneration Report
The Remuneration Committee is comprised exclusively of non-executive directors who are B Leesing
(Chairman of the Committee), A M Peacock and R M T eare.  
The Company’s Remuneration Committee (“the Committee”) decides the remuneration policy that
applies to executive directors and the Group’s other senior management.  In determining that policy, it
has given full consideration to the principles of the Combined Code.
In setting the remuneration policy, the Committee considers the basic salary and benefits available to
executive directors of comparable companies both in size and within the house building sector.  
The Remuneration Committee takes into account the need to attract and retain directors of an
appropriate calibre and the need to ensure the commitment of executive directors to the continued
success of the Company.  No external consultants were used by the Committee in the year in advising
the Remuneration Committee on remuneration policy. 
The terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee will be available for inspection at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Remuneration of non-executive directors
The non-executive directors each receive a fee for their services which is approved by the Board,
following recommendation by the Chairman of the Company.  The level of remuneration paid to non-
executive directors reflects the time commitment and responsibilities required by the role.
The non-executive directors do not receive any pension or other benefits from the Company, nor do
they participate in any of the bonus or incentive schemes or share option schemes.
The non-executive directors do not have service contracts with the Company.  They are appointed on
the basis of serving at least one period of one year.
Remuneration policy for all executive directors
The Group provides competitive remuneration packages in order to attract, retain and motivate
executives who are expected to meet high levels of performance.  The structure of the remuneration
package has been designed to:
•
ensure that the performance related elements of remuneration (annual bonus and long-term
incentives) constitute a significant proportion of an executives’ performance criteria, which are
aligned to the interests of shareholders; and
•
provide employment related benefits including the provision of a company car, life assurance,
medical insurance and pension.
Salaries and benefits
The Committee meets at least once a year in order to consider and set the annual salaries for executive
directors.  
11 Ben Bailey Plc
55485 Ben Bailey 07-40  25/2/2004  4:32 pm  Page 11 Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued) 
Share options
Throughout the year the Company has operated an Inland Revenue Approved Executive Share Option
Scheme, a Savings-Related Share Option Scheme and an Unapproved Executive Scheme.  All of these
arrangements, which were established in 1998, were approved at the 1998 Annual General Meeting of
the Company.
Following changes to the relevant legislation in 1996, the maximum value of shares over which options
may be granted under an Inland Revenue approved scheme to any one individual may not exceed
£30,000. The Unapproved Scheme will enable additional options to be granted to employees and
directors on an unapproved basis in excess of this limit. However, the Remuneration Committee has
imposed a limit on the grant of options under this scheme to any one individual.  T aking into account
options granted to an individual in the previous ten years, under any option scheme of the Company,
options granted under the Unapproved Scheme to that individual may not exceed four times his
remuneration for the current or preceding financial year. 
Options granted under the Approved Scheme will normally be exercisable within the period of between
three to ten years after the date of grant and, for options granted under the Unapproved Scheme, within
three to seven years. In establishing the executive schemes, the Committee has decided to subject grants
made under the Approved and Unapproved Schemes to performance criteria, such that options may
only be exercised if, over a consecutive three year period, there has been a growth in the Company’s
earnings per share in excess of the Retail Price Index plus 2.5% per annum.  Options granted under the
Approved Scheme are not offered at a discount.
Under the Savings-Related Share Option Scheme, employees who are eligible to participate in the
Sharesave Scheme will be invited to enter a savings contract the proceeds of which, after three, five or
seven years, can be used to exercise share options granted at the start of the contract. The Sharesave
Scheme gives the Board discretion to offer a discount on the exercise price of up to 20% of the relevant
middle market price at the date of grant.
The Committee supports employee participation in the Company through employee share schemes and
believes that these schemes play a useful role in aligning the interests of employees and shareholders.
Annual and long-term bonus scheme
The Company operates an annual and long-term bonus scheme (“the Bonus Scheme”) for the executive
directors, including B R Bailey, the Chairman of the Company.  The Bonus Scheme runs for a fixed
three year period to 31 December 2005.  It is linked to the amount by which the average annual growth
in the Company’s earnings per share (“EPS”) exceeds the Retail Price Index plus 2.5% per annum over
the three year period from a base point of 34.0p per share.  Earnings per share is believed to be an
appropriate measure for growth given the size and structure of the company .  Annual bonuses are payable
under the Bonus Scheme amounting to the relevant EPS growth factor for that year applied to 60% of
basic annual salary.  The final bonus is paid at the end of the three year period and will be based upon
the average annual EPS growth factor for the period and applied to basic annual salary, less any annual
bonuses paid under the Bonus Scheme.  Over the three year period, the maximum bonus payable to each
director shall not exceed two and half times the executive directors’ basic salary for the three year period.
12 Ben Bailey Plc
55485 Ben Bailey 07-40  25/2/2004  4:32 pm  Page 12 Directors’ Remuneration Report (continued) 
Service contracts
The service contract of  B R Bailey is subject to two years’ notice of termination by the Company and
one year’s notice of termination by B R Bailey.
The service contract of  P A Russell is subject to two years’ notice of termination by the Company and
six months’ notice of termination by P A Russell.
The service contract of  S W North is subject to one year’s notice of termination by the Company and
six months’ notice of termination by S W North.
These notice periods, in excess of one year, were agreed in order to attract and retain high calibre
individuals.  All of the service contracts are rolling contracts.  In the event of early termination of a
director’s service contract the Remuneration Committee would seek to reduce the compensation to
reflect the departing director’s obligation to mitigate loss of earnings.
Total Shareholder Return
A new Schedule 7A to the Companies Act now requires the Company to publish in the Directors’
Remuneration Report a line graph which shows the total shareholder return on a holding of the
Company’s shares against a holding of hypothetical shares measured by reference to a broad equity
index.  Total shareholder return is the measure of the returns that a company has provided for its
shareholders reflecting share price movements and assuming reinvestment of dividends.  It is, therefore,
considered to be a good indicator of a company’s overall performance.
The performance chart shown below illustrates the Company’s total return over the past five years
compared to the performance of the Small Capital Index, which the Remuneration Committee believes
to be the most appropriate index to be used given the size of the Company.

Resolution 9
This resolution seeks authority from shareholders for the Company to purchase up to 1,173,710
ordinary shares, an aggregate nominal amount of £117,371, which is equivalent to approximately 10% of
the Company’s issued ordinary share capital at 31 December 2003.  The authority will expire at the end
of next year’s Annual General Meeting and the resolution specifies the maximum and minimum prices
at which the shares may be bought.  Other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the
overall financial position of the Company will be taken into account before deciding upon this course of
action.  Any shares purchased in this way will be cancelled and the number of shares in issue will
accordingly be reduced.  The directors have no immediate intention of exercising the proposed authority
when it becomes effective, but believe that the ability of the Company to buy its own shares if, in the
directors’ opinion, market prices do not reflect the Company’s worth, will be in the best interests of the
Company and its shareholders.  The directors intend to exercise this power only if they believe the effect
of such purchases will increase earnings per ordinary share.
The authority will expire on whichever is the earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual General
Meeting or 7 November 2005.

Corporate Governance
Statement of Compliance with the Combined Code
Following the publication of the Combined Code which is appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority (“the Code”) the Board has reviewed its Corporate Governance practices and an
explanation of how the Principles of Good Governance have been applied are contained in this report and
the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 11 to 16.
The Company was in compliance with the Combined Code throughout the period, with the following
exceptions:
•  The Company did not have a Nominations Committee, which is required by Code provision A5.1
until 28 November 2003.
•  The Audit Committee did not comprise three Non-Executive Directors, which is required by Code
provision D.3.1 until the appointment of R M T eare on 28 February 2003.  The Audit Committee
now comprises three Non-Executive Directors.
•  The notice period for certain executive directors is two years as explained in the Directors’
Remuneration Report on page 13.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good governance and this statement describes
how the relevant principles of governance are applied to the Company and the Company’s compliance with
the code provisions set out in Part 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate Governance.
Group Objectives and Board of Directors
The objective of the Group is to build quality homes at realistic prices for its customers whilst securing the
optimum return from its assets for the benefit of its shareholders.
Following the appointment of R M Teare on 28 February 2003, the Board now comprises three Non-
Executive Directors who are all considered to be independent.  R M Teare, a former partner in
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP has not been involved with the audit of the Company for nearly three years
and is considered to be independent.  B Leesing was appointed to the Board in 1989.  Notwithstanding this
fact the Board considers that he is independent and his knowledge and experience of the Company and the
house building sector are invaluable.  The Board considers that this composition now provides an
appropriate segregation of responsibilities, and independent non-executive director representation for the
current size of the Group.  One third of directors, including Non-Executive Directors, are subject to
retirement by rotation annually .
Individual profiles of the directors are given on page 6.  The Board has the necessary knowledge and
experience to achieve the stated objectives of the Group and retain effective control over the Group.
Board Practices
The Board meets regularly on a formal basis and not less than nine times per annum to monitor the
performance of the Group, to authorise capital expenditure and purchases of land, to approve annual budgets
and to monitor business performance.  Strategy on interest rate exposures is also reserved for the Board.  In
the year ended 31 December 2003, the Board met nine times.  Information is provided to the Board in a
detailed and timely manner in order to allow informed decisions to be taken on all matters.
The Board has adopted a formal schedule of reserved powers as well as an agreed procedure for a director
to take independent professional advice, if necessary, at the Group’s expense, and to have full access to the
services of the Company Secretary who is responsible to the Board for ensuring that the Board procedures
are followed and that applicable rules and regulations are complied with.  Directors’ and Officers’ Liability
Insurance is in place for directors and officers.

Board Committees
Audit Committee B Leesing  (Chairman)
B R Bailey
A M Peacock
R M T eare
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee, which meets three times a year, include the appointment of
and liaison with external auditors, the review of annual and interim financial statements and the review of
the suitability and effectiveness of the Group’s internal controls.  The Committee reviews the findings of
the external auditors and reviews key accounting policies and judgements.  It also reviews the independence
of the external auditors on an annual basis.
The fees relating to non-audit services provided by PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are disclosed in note 6 to
the accounts.  The main area of non-audit work relates to the provision of taxation compliance work and
taxation advice.  The Audit Committee has reviewed the level of non-audit work and has concluded that this
level of fee does not affect the independence of the Audit.
Remuneration Committee B Leesing  (Chairman)
A M Peacock
R M T eare
The responsibilities of the Remuneration Committee include the recommendation of terms of
employment, including remuneration, and grant of bonuses and share options for all executive directors, as
may be appropriate from time to time.
Under Resolution 2  the Remuneration Committee report will be put before shareholders for adoption at
the Annual General Meeting on 7 May 2004.  
Nominations Committee B R Bailey  (Chairman)
B Leesing
A M Peacock
R M T eare
The responsibilities of the Nominations Committee include the identification and recommendation to the
Board of suitable Executive and Non-Executive Directors.
Board Remuneration
The Group’s Remuneration Committee decides the remuneration policy that applies to executive directors
and senior management of the Group.  In setting the remuneration policy, the Remuneration Committee
considers the basic salary and benefits available to executive directors of comparable companies, the need to
attract and retain directors of an appropriate calibre, and the need to ensure the commitment of executive
directors to the continued success of the Group. Bonus packages for executive directors are linked to the
Group’s objective of securing optimum return from its assets for the benefit of its shareholders.
Shareholder Communication
The majority of the shareholders of the Group are private individuals.  Presentations to City Analysts have
been made in the past year.  All shareholders are welcome to attend the Annual General Meeting at which
they have the opportunity to ask questions of the Board.
55485 Ben Bailey 07-40  25/2/2004  4:32 pm  Page 18 Going Concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the
Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.  For this
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Group’s financial statements.
Internal Control
The Group’s control environment is the responsibility of the Group’s directors and managers at all levels.
The Board is, therefore, responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. Although no control system can provide absolute protection against material mis-statement or
loss, it is designed to manage the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and to provide the directors
with reasonable assurance that problems should be identified on a timely basis and dealt with appropriately .
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control for the period.  The
Group has reviewed its operations and identified risk areas which have been assessed for their potential
impact on the business.  The size of the Group, together with the fact that virtually all of the Group’s
operations derive from one company, Ben Bailey Homes Limited, allows the Executive Directors of the
Group to monitor performance, evaluate and manage on a continual basis the risks faced by the Group.  No
internal audit function is considered necessary .
The key features of the Group’s internal controls are as follows:
•  Defined authorisation levels for the purchases of land and capital expenditure.
•  Defined authorisation levels for the placing of orders and contracts.
•  A formalised reporting structure which includes the setting of detailed annual budgets which are
updated on a regular basis to form forecasts which are reviewed at both Group and Subsidiary
Company Board level.
•  Monthly Board/Executive Meetings are held within Ben Bailey Homes Limited at which all key
aspects of the business are discussed including comparison of actual performance compared with
budgets.
•  A monthly meeting is held within Ben Bailey Homes Limited to review the production progress on
all sites, sales position, technical and development issues arising from each development.
•  All sites are visited on a monthly basis by the Group Chairman and the Chief Executive together
with the Construction, Technical and Sales Directors of Ben Bailey Homes Limited to review
progress on site.
•  The Group’s reporting systems provide weekly updates on key statistics including sales, production
and gross margin analysis by development.
•  Daily cash movements are reconciled and monitored by the Finance Director.  The Group’s cashflow
is also monitored monthly in comparison to budget and forecast.
The Board reviews management letters prepared by the external auditors and considers the suitability of
suggested improvements to the system of internal financial controls.

Corporate Governance (continued) 
55485 Ben Bailey 07-40  25/2/2004  4:32 pm  Page 19 Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year that give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group
for that period.  In preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
•  Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
•  Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
•  State whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
•  Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the Group will continue in business.
The directors confirm that they have complied with the above requirements in preparing the financial
statements.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.  They are also responsible for
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention of fraud and other irregularities.
The financial statements are also published on the Company’s website, the maintenance and integrity of
which is the responsibility of the directors.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the Members of
Ben Bailey Plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the consolidated profit and loss account, the
balance sheets, the consolidated cash flow statement and the related notes.  We have also audited the
disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 contained in the directors’
remuneration report (“the auditable part”).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the statement of directors’
responsibilities.  The directors are also responsible for preparing the directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors’
remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United
Kingdom auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.  This report, including the opinion,
has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.  We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or
assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or in
to whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether
the financial statements and the auditable part of the directors’ remuneration report have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the
directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit,
or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the annual report and consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial
statements. The other information comprises only the Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Financial Highlights, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief
Executive’s Review, and the Corporate Governance Statement. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the
seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial
Services Authority and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s
statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of
the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the
financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the
financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.

Year Ended 31 December 2003
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with
applicable Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom.  A summary of the more important Group
accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, except as explained below, is set out in the
following paragraphs:
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated profit and loss account and balance sheet include the audited financial statements of the
Company and all of its subsidiary undertakings made up to the year end.  Intra-group sales and profits are
eliminated fully on consolidation.
Accounting for results
Revenue and profits on house-building sales are recognised in the financial statements on legal completion.
The purchase and disposal of land held for development is recognised when unconditional contracts have
been exchanged.
T angible fixed assets
The cost of tangible fixed assets is their purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is calculated at rates intended to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets on a straight line basis
over the expected useful lives of the assets concerned.  The principal useful lives used for this purpose are
as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 5 to 10 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Fixtures and fittings 2 to 5 years
Showhouse furniture 2 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Depreciation is charged on tangible fixed assets from the beginning of the month following their acquisition
and up to the month prior to their sale.
Investments
Investments are shown in the balance sheet at cost less any amounts written off for permanent diminution
in value.

Land held for development, stocks and work in progress
Land held for development, stocks and work in progress are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Cost comprises direct expenditure together with an appropriate proportion of production overheads.
The cost of land held for development is transferred into housing developments in progress as building work
on each unit commences.
Net realisable value represents the estimated amount at which stock could be realised after allowing for costs
of realisation.  Provision is made, where necessary , for obsolete, slow moving and defective stocks.

T urnover, which excludes value added tax, sales between group companies and trade discounts, represents
the invoiced value of new houses and land, less any allowances given, and relates wholly to operations in the
United Kingdom. Proceeds from the sales of part exchange houses and undeveloped land, purchased for
immediate re-sale, are excluded from turnover.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet to pay
more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rules expected to apply when they crystallise based on
current tax rates and law . Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded as more than likely
that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted.
Finance and operating leases
Costs in respect of operating leases are charged on a straight line basis over the lease term.  Leasing
agreements, which transfer to the group substantially all the benefits and risks of ownership of an asset are
treated as if the asset had been purchased outright.  The assets are included in fixed assets and the capital
element of the leasing commitments is shown as obligations under finance leases.  The lease rentals are
treated as consisting of capital and interest elements.  The capital element is applied to reduce the
outstanding obligations and the interest element is charged against profit in proportion to the reducing
capital element outstanding.  Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease
terms and the useful lives of equivalent owned assets.
Pensions
The Group operates a Group Personal Pension Plan which was established on 1 April 1997.  Pension
contributions made to this and other personal pension plans, on behalf of employees, are charged to the
profit and loss account in the year in which the contributions become payable.
Financial instruments
Financial instruments are utilised to support and raise finances for the trading operations of the Group.
Interest is charged or credited to the consolidated profit and loss account as incurred or earned.
2 SEGMENTAL ANAL YSIS BY CLASS OF BUSINESS
The Group’s turnover, profit before taxation and net assets relate wholly to house building.

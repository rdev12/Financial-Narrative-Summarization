In 2015 we opened 48 places in three 
hospitals for adults with a personality

of personality disorder services in the UK. 
 
Greater specialisation and 
move to higher acuity services 
In response to customer demands, we 
are increasing the focus of our services 
on specific conditions (for example in 
Adult Autism and Children’s Learning 
Disabilities), and continue to move to 
higher acuity services (for example 
expanding our offering for children who 
have suffered from neglect or abuse).

With our customers preferring a family 
setting where possible for looked after 
children, fostering has been a focus  
for Cambian. With a strong reputation  
for supporting children with high 
severity needs, By the Bridge has 
significantly increased Cambian’s 
capability in this area.

Performance review

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 5
Strategic report Chairman’s statement
Overview
Operationally, 2015 looked as if it would  
be a year of achievement. We continued  
to experience significant demand for our 
services, our strong quality ratings were 
maintained, we broadened the range of 
our services with the acquisition of By the 
Bridge, a specialist fostering business, and 
we added significantly to our number of 
places in an ambitious expansion drive. 
Regrettably, our expansion plan was  
in retrospect overly ambitious and  
this is reflected in our disappointing 
financial performance. 
Difficulties in recruiting and training staff, 
particularly in Children’s Services, left us 
unable to open some of our new facilities 
on time, and in order not to sacrifice 
quality, we made a number of unit level 
decisions to block or slow admissions, 
which resulted in revenues falling short  
of expectations. 
This was further exacerbated by failures  
in forecasting and controlling our cost 
base during a period of integration  
and high growth, and has resulted in 
adjusted EBITDA over 12% lower than  
the previous year.
In response to this, we commissioned 
PricewaterhouseCoopers to undertake  
a financial review of certain aspects of  
the Group’s cost management. In addition,  
we are currently implementing a number 
of remedial actions to improve our cost 
control, forecasting and management of 
our suppliers. We have restructured our 
central functions and more closely aligned 
them with the business, resulting in cost 
savings, and we have reduced our growth 
plan so that our focus is now on filling 
existing capacity.
Christopher Kemball
Chairman
Cambian has continued to deliver high 
quality outcomes for the children and 
adults placed in our care.
We hired Martin Hopcroft, who has 
restructuring and turnaround experience,  
in late 2015 and he was appointed as 
Interim CFO in early 2016. In addition  
we have hired additional resource to  
focus on managing our cost base  
with an emphasis on procurement.
We are currently undertaking a search 
process for a permanent CFO. 
Financial results
Revenue increased by 21% to £290.1 million 
(2014: £240.6 million). Adjusted EBITDA was 
£42.5 million (2014: £48.4 million) with 
adjusted EBITDA margin down from 20.1% 
to 14.7%. Operating loss was £7.6m (2014: 
£7.1m profit). Adjusted earnings per share 
were 10.6p (2014: 11.0p). Statutory basic  
loss per share was 5.4p (2014: 6.1p loss). 
The Group’s total capacity

 increased from 
2,668 to 2,989 in the year with average 
occupancy of 78% (2014: 81%). 
As previously advised, the Board is not 
recommending a final dividend and will 
look to reinstate the dividend at an 
appropriate time.
Bank agreement
As announced in March 2016, our financial 
performance has resulted in a breach of our 
banking covenants at 31 December 2015 and 
would also be likely to have led to a breach 
when next tested in the current financial year. 
Accordingly, and as announced in March,  
we agreed a temporary waiver with our 
lending banks to cover this eventuality and  
to facilitate our discussions with them to 
amend our facility agreement.
On 26 April 2016 the Board and the  
Group’s lending banks agreed terms for 
the amendment of the Group’s £290m 
Facilities Agreement, the provisions of 
which are set out within the Finance  
review on page 36. 
1  2014 capacity and occupancy have been adjusted to remove CAMHS and Sexual Trauma school places where, although the education capacity is separately registered, the fee is combined 
within the residential facility fee. The impact is a reduction in 2014 closing capacity of 82 places and a reduction in 2014 closing occupancy of 35 occupants. 
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 6 Strategy update
The Board has been reviewing its strategic 
options in light of the agreed terms for the 
amendment of its banking facilities as well 
as the wider market environment in which 
it is operating.
The Board has concluded that it will continue 
to focus on its leading position in Children’s 
Services and has appointed advisors to 
review its strategic options in the Adult 
Services business, which may or may not 
lead to a sale of all or part of this division. 
No final decisions have been made on this 
or any other strategic option and the Board 
will provide updates as appropriate.
Quality of care
Ensuring high levels of care quality for  
the individuals we look after is core to  
our business. I am therefore pleased  
to confirm that as at 31 December 2015, 
92% of our adult facilities and 83% of our 
children’s facilities were rated either “Good” 
or “Outstanding” by our regulators, CQC 
and Ofsted respectively, at a time when 
they are rightly increasing the standards 
they expect from care providers.
We are still aiming to improve the delivery  
of what we believe are life-changing 
outcomes for our patients by supporting 
them with our highly skilled specialist 
teams and deploying a therapy-led 
approach in modern and friendly 
surroundings. Our objective is to increase  
the proportion of our facilities rated “Good”  
or “Outstanding” over the medium term.
We make considerable efforts to anticipate 
and efficiently deliver the services required by 
our customers and regulators. As Chairman, 
I now meet CQC and Ofsted annually to 
discuss areas of mutual interest and concern. 
In this regard, we also invited David Behan, 
the Chief Executive of the CQC, to attend our 
Board and Audit and Risk Committee in 
August so that he could see, understand  
and comment on how we operate.
Board changes
In July 2015, Dr Graham Rich joined the 
Board as a non-executive director and 
member of the Nomination and Audit  
and Risk Committees. Graham qualified  
in medicine and has spent his career in  
the healthcare profession where he gained 
significant experience in running two NHS 
organisations as well as having been 
Director of Health Services at The Boston 
Consulting Group, where he is now a 
Senior Advisor. 
On 2 November 2015 it was announced 
that Andrew Griffith would stand down 
from the Board after the announcement  
of the 2015 full year results. Accordingly, 
Andrew will resign from the Board on  
27 April 2016 and will leave the business 
shortly thereafter. Martin Hopcroft was 
appointed as Interim CFO early in 2016  
and we are currently undertaking a  
search process for a permanent CFO.
We are pleased today to announce the 
appointment of Mike Butterworth as an 
additional non-executive director with 
immediate effect.
Our people
The welfare of our dedicated and  
skilled staff is critical to achieving the  
best possible outcomes for those placed  
in our care. During 2015, we conducted  
a thorough review of our staff pay and 
conditions to ensure that we are in line  
with salaries in the NHS and our private 
sector competitors. As a result, we have 
simplified our pay scales, introduced 
additional pay for achieving relevant 
qualifications and linked these to the 
Government’s announced National  
Living Wage (“NLW”) levels, irrespective  
of an employee’s age. 
The Board would like to take this 
opportunity to thank all our staff for their  
hard work and dedication throughout the 
year. It is much appreciated.
Governance overview
p.42
Pricing
We have engaged with our customers 
since last November to discuss and agree 
increased prices for existing service users 
to reflect the NLW introduction and other 
factors, with the aim of ensuring that there 
will be no negative impact on the business. 
We are pleased with the progress we have 
made so far.
Outlook
The results for 2015 were very disappointing 
but our remedial actions are taking effect. 
We continue to experience strong demand 
for our specialist services and trading to 
date is in line with the Board’s expectations. 
As previously advised, the result for the first 
half will be lower than H1 2015. The Board is 
confident that growth will be resumed for 
the year as a whole.
Despite the challenges we faced, we 
should not lose sight of the fact that 
Cambian remains fundamentally a good 
business with a strong value proposition 
for its customers. 
Our agenda is clear: continue to implement 
the remedial action programme; ensure 
we meet our obligations under the agreed 
terms for the amendment of our bank 
facilities; and continue to deliver the 
highest quality specialist services our 
customers demand.

Overview
Our failure to recruit and train staff to  
the required standards meant that we 
were unable to increase occupancy in line 
with our strategic plan. These operational 
events were compounded by weaknesses 
in our financial procedures and forecasting, 
which impacted our ability to adjust our 
cost base in a timely manner. 
Consequently, the year ended with a 
disappointing financial performance as 
revenues increased but were lower than 
expected and the impact on margins 
impacted profitability. 
During the year we became the largest 
provider of therapeutic fostering services 
through the acquisition of By the Bridge. 
Additionally, we launched a number of 
new specialist services.
Despite the disappointment of our 
financial results, we remain confident in 
the business. Cambian is a leader in the 
provision of high quality care in a market 
where there is urgent need. Our focus in 
the short-term is the ongoing remedial 
action plan to boost occupancy levels  
and to put the Group on a sound financial 
footing to enable sustainable profitable 
growth, including reviewing the Group’s 
strategic options.
Business performance
In 2015 the Group delivered revenue 
growth of 21% (2014: 12%), with an Adjusted 
EBITDA margin of 14.7% (2014: 20.1%).  
The revenue growth includes the impact  
of current and prior year acquisitions as 
well as revenue from new occupants in  
our sites. 
We did however experience a revenue  
and occupancy shortfall against our initial 
expectations, in part due to difficulties in 
recruiting sufficient skilled staff in our new 
sites and to replace normal turnover in 
existing sites, particularly in our Children’s 
Services division in the second half of the 
year. The Group’s average occupancy in 
the year was 78% (2014: 81%).
 
Going into 2015, we had budgeted a 
significant increase in costs over 2014 in 
two main areas: first, an investment in our 
central functions such as HR, Marketing 
and Quality to build an operating platform 
capable of delivering significant growth; 
and, secondly, costs relating to newly 
opened units which are incurred ahead  
of revenue from occupancy. 
With the shortfall in revenue against our 
budget, these costs impacted our profit in 
the year and, in addition, we experienced 
cost overruns in areas such as recruitment 
costs and repairs and maintenance. Our 
forecasting of costs was poor in part due  
to issues arising from the integration of  
the Cambian and Advanced Childcare 
back offices in the year. Once the revenue 
shortfall was identified, it took longer than 
expected to manage down non-wage 
costs during the year. 
Saleem Asaria 
Chief Executive Officer
The demand for Behavioural Health services 
in the UK is strong and we remain confident 
in our business, providing high quality care 
where there is urgent need.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 8
Chief Executive’s strategic review In response to this performance, we have 
taken a number of steps: 
• We commissioned 
PricewaterhouseCoopers to undertake 
a financial review of certain aspects  
of the Group’s cost management.
• We are currently implementing  
a number of remedial actions to 
improve our cost control, forecasting 
and management of our suppliers.
• We have put on hold new openings  
to focus on filling the Group’s current 
capacity from existing sites and those 
sites already in development. This will 
reduce 2016 openings to approximately 
40 net additional places allowing for 
improved margins as the portfolio of 
facilities matures. 
• We have restructured our central 
functions: we devolved our HR 
department into regional centres, 
reporting to the operating divisions  
and thereby improving the connection 
between staffing needs and our 
recruitment pipeline; we have 
disbanded our M&A and asset 
acquisition teams; and restructured  
our quality team. All of these steps  
will generate ongoing savings for  
the Group. 
• Finally, we hired Martin Hopcroft,  
who has restructuring and turnaround 
experience, in late 2015 and he was 
appointed as Interim CFO in early  
2016. In addition we have hired 
additional resource to focus on 
managing our cost base with an 
emphasis on procurement.
In 2015 we have focused on four main areas:
Delivering value for  
our customers
Investing to expand  
our specialist services
Investing in our  
internal capabilities
Improving the life 
outcomes for the 
people in our care

Strategic report • Thirdly, we aligned our management, 
training and therapeutic capabilities to 
these services. 
In line with these areas of focus, Cambian 
has grown its capacity significantly in the 
year, adding a total of 377 places. With  
56 places being closed or re-provisioned, 
we added a net 321 places in the year 
including 259 in our Children’s Services  
and 62 in our Adult Services. 
With a focus on maturing our existing 
business, our growth plan for 2016 is 
restricted to completing units that are 
currently in construction, so we anticipate 
adding approximately 40 net new places  
to capacity in the year.
Children’s Services
The focus of our growth plan in the year  
was in the Children’s division.
We increased our education services 
significantly, in particular adding three 
large schools: Bletchley, Spring Hill and 
Potterspury Lodge (with a combined 
capacity of 166 places). These offer 
Service delivery
The demand for Behavioural Health 
services in the UK remains strong, driven  
by underlying trends of a higher incidence 
and better diagnosis of conditions, 
together with greater quality of life 
expectations for those people impacted.  
In addition, HM Government continues  
to outsource such services, with high 
expectations for the quality of service 
provided and the outcomes expected. 
In order to ensure that we are well-
positioned to take advantage of these 
market dynamics we made significant 
changes in 2015:
• First, we moved to a greater 
specialisation and delineation of our 
services (for example in Autism and 
Personality Disorders). 
• Secondly, we continued our move to 
higher severity services (for example for 
children who have suffered from sexual 
exploitation or abuse, or children and 
adolescents suffering from mental  
health conditions).
significant opportunity for future revenue 
growth as we build occupancy and focus 
their offerings on higher value services  
to address more acute needs. We have 
also grown our Children’s residential 
services, in particular for children 
suffering from abuse or neglect or  
with mental health conditions. 
We have previously highlighted fostering  
as an area that we wished to grow. To this 
end, we were pleased to acquire By the 
Bridge in March 2015. By the Bridge operates 
at the high-severity end of fostering and has 
built a reputation for providing high quality, 
therapeutic fostering services and for 
successfully placing children with complex 
needs in a family environment. As such,  
it occupies a niche position between 
traditional fostering and residential care and 
now forms an integral part of our Children’s 
Services offering. Cambian’s existing 
fostering operation has been integrated  
into By the Bridge during the year. Our focus 
is now on foster carer recruitment to drive 
placement numbers. At 31 December 2015 
the Group had 668 fostering placements 
(2014: 203 placements), of which 501  
related to By the Bridge. 
Adult Services
The Adult Services market is more mature 
than the Children’s market. However,  
we see opportunities in specialist sub-
segments in the Adult market and, to  
that end, we opened four larger units  
in Adult in the year with including two 
Personality Disorder units, an Acquired 
Brain Injury unit and a unit for Adults  
with autism. 
We have two Woodleigh units under 
construction and due to open later this 
year and, with a good performance from 
existing Woodleigh units since acquisition 
in 2014, we are confident that there will be 
strong demand for these services.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 10
Chief Executive’s strategic review
continued Quality and regulatory 
Our ambition is to be the highest quality 
provider of behavioural health services  
to Children and Adults. It is pleasing to 
report, therefore, that our regulatory  
scores remained strong throughout the  
year with 85% of our facilities rated good  
or outstanding with Ofsted or the CQC  
as at 31 December 2015. We underwent  
no embargoes and we currently have  
no facilities with compliance notices. 
The sector is seeing an increasingly 
stringent regulatory environment with  
an enhanced rigour of inspections which  
we both welcome and are well-positioned 
to benefit from in this drive to improve the 
focus on quality of care. 
At the same time we have seen an 
extension of the time taken to register new 
sites and services and this has contributed  
to delays in opening new sites.
From a governance perspective, in order  
to ensure an integrated approach to risk  
we have now merged the Audit Committee 
and the Quality and Risk Committee.  
The re-named Audit & Risk Committee  
now directly oversees all elements of risk  
in the business.
Fees 
In April 2015 we increased fees, across the 
majority of our services, by an average of 
2% for new admissions. From the beginning 
of 2016, we have further increased fees for 
new service users. 
As previously indicated, we are supportive 
of the introduction of the NLW and we  
are in negotiation with commissioners to 
mitigate the net impact by corresponding 
fee increases for all existing service users. 
We have engaged with our customers  
since last November to discuss and  
agree increased prices to reflect the  
NLW introduction and other cost factors  
with the aim of ensuring that there  
will be no negative impact on margins.  
We are pleased with the progress we  
have made so far. 
Summary and outlook 
It is a disappointment to report poor 
results, especially when they disguise  
the very real progress we did make  
during the year in terms of new service 
delivery and care quality.
We have moved quickly to remedy the 
issues facing our business and have 
already seen positive trends, including 
improved occupancy levels, in the first 
quarter of 2016. 
We are focussing on our core business.  
We are filling our existing capacity, 
ensuring that we have the necessary 
systems in place and deploying staff  
more efficiently.
We remain confident for the medium- 
term outlook and also the Group’s 
longer-term potential.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 12 Amy’s story
Amy was admitted to Cambian Acer Clinic from  
a secure service. She had a chaotic lifestyle, with 
serious self-harming behaviours and a lack of  
any meaningful interaction with health services. 
The Cambian team focused on engagement  
with Amy so they could unpick the cause of her 
self-harming behaviour. Over time these events 
became fewer as other coping mechanisms 
helped her through difficult times. Amy is looking 
forward to discharge shortly and setting up her 
own home in the community.

environment, with a level of security matched

Max’s story
Max was taken into care aged 9 
having been removed from his 
parents by the police due to neglect 
and abuse. After four placement 
breakdowns he was placed with  
By the Bridge. He arrived with anxiety, 
low in confidence. In a safe ‘home’ 
environment Max is starting to  
thrive. With improving confidence  
and self-esteem he attends his  
local school and for the first time  
in his life has the stability to build his  
future along with enjoying the typical 
experiences of any child, such as 
going on holiday with his carers.
Cambian delivery 
By the Bridge – a fostering  
service that increases  
our pathway offering for 
our customers.
Operating with children with high 
severity needs, fostering services from 
By the Bridge have built a reputation 
for providing high quality, therapeutic 
fostering and for supporting children 
with complex needs in a family 
environment. Cambian can now offer 
a complete pathway for our Children’s 
Service from residential care to the 
ultimate aspiration of children living 
with a foster family, through to 
returning home to their birth family 
where possible.
 – Data presented at the Royal College of 
Psychiatrists rehabilitation conference  
in November 2015 showed that over  
70% of patients discharged from the 
Cambian Churchill hospital in London 
remain within services with less 
support and in a less restrictive 
environment one year later. 
 – Cambian’s facilities have high 
regulatory scores, and the Group 
operates a robust risk management 
framework that encompasses both 
operational and clinical risks. 
 – With a well-developed sales and 
marketing function, we maintain 
strong relationships with our 
customers and understand customer 
preferences very well. We do not 
require long-term contracts, but 
rather work with our customers  
to ensure that we offer services  
in areas with strong demand and 
where our model of high quality 
outcomes can be applied.
Cambian delivers value for 
money to our customers  
in a number of ways:
 – Through the efficacy of our operating 
model and by providing specialist 
services, we offer value for money  
to our customers and a service with  
a personalised care pathway. Our 
daily rates often offer savings to  
our customers as compared to the 
equivalent public sector provision.
 – At the same time, we deliver excellent 
outcomes for the people in our care 
with a view to enabling a transition 
back into the community or into a 
lower severity setting. This often 
follows a multi-year history of being 
treated in other high severity services 
at a substantial cost to the funding 
organisation. These outcomes 
provide a strong “cost of life” benefit  
to our customers.

required to cope with his schizophrenia and  
catch up on his schooling by attending Meeko’s

Britney’s story
Britney was diagnosed with severe autism. She 
displayed very challenging behaviours and levels  
of anxiety and would sometimes run away from 
home. Cambian Broughton Lodge used a high level  
of support to address her challenging behaviours, 
and a speech and language therapy programme  
to improve communication. To date Britney has 
significantly reduced the number of behaviour 
incidents, and is learning the key skills to look  
after herself and cope with other people. Her next 
key step will be to move to a supported living service.

Recognition for the work 
we do
Our approach to achieving these 
outcomes are clearly articulated in 
a recent CQC regulatory inspection 
report for Cambian Sherwood 
Lodge, a hospital that supports 
men with a learning disability. 
Rated as ‘OUTSTANDING’ the  
report stated, “The hospital was 
pioneering the use of visual 
discharge planning, which  
includes the patient from the  
point of admission...visual 
discharge planning centres on  
the patient being an active driver  
in their treatment...staff were 
proactive to ensure timely 
discharges...they took a whole 
team approach to meeting the 
needs of the patient. We saw 
catering, administration, 
maintenance and housekeeping 
staff were active team members.” 
Significant personalised 
outcomes
We actively support every person 
in our care to achieve their 
personal best, these ‘outcomes’ 
are different for everyone. A child 
being placed with a foster family,  
a young person with mental 
ill-health returning home to their 
family, an adult with learning 
disabilities living independently or  
a child with Asperger’s attending 
tertiary education, all are 
significant meaningful outcomes. 
These have a positive impact not 
only on the individual and their 
family, but also the authority that 
funded the placement. 
Outcomes start with clear 
objectives being agreed when  
a person is first placed in one of 
our services. They are supported 
by our therapy programmes and 
care approach. Alongside our 
range of specialist environments 
we can allow these outcomes to 
be realised.
Putting in place clear objectives 
for the people in our care, aligned 
to a care pathway to deliver 
successful outcomes.
Providing people with support at each life stage…
Cambian supports the active progression of the people in our care  
with a range of specialist services that allow for greater independence 
through reduced levels of support. In the example of a child with severe 
autism, this support can be seen through a pathway that could include 
attending a Specialist Education School, transitioning to a Specialist 
College to continue to build lifelong skills and then moving into a 
Specialist Adult service where these skills can be maintained and  
they can achieve their personal best in adult life.

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 Market overview
Cambian operates in the behavioural 
health market in the UK. We work with 
children and adults across a number of key 
specialist care sub-sectors focused within 
a defined, high severity range. The Group 
states this as being 7-9 on a severity scale 
ranging from 0-10. A score of 10 indicates  
a person’s needs would typically be met  
in a fully secure setting, whilst lower  
down the scale 1-3 is where an individual 
functions well in society without the need 
for significant specialist interventions.  
The Group’s services can be divided  
across four areas: Intellectual Disabilities, 
Emotional and Social Difficulties, Mental 
Health and Acquired Conditions.
Funding
Our services are predominantly funded 
through Commissioning Care Groups 
(“CCGs”) who are responsible for 
commissioning primary and secondary 
healthcare services for their local 
communities, and through Local 
Authorities from within their social  
care budgets. In addition, certain  
services are funded through NHS  
England, the central independent 
commissioning body within the NHS.
Emotional and Social Difficulties (“ESD”) cover 
a range of complex and chronic conditions 
experienced by children and young people. 
Conditions include emotional, conduct and 
hyperkinetic disorders, as well as anxiety, 
self-harm, depression, attachment and 
attention deficit disorders. Underlying 
reasons for ESD can include individual and 
external factors with children driven primarily 
by challenging social circumstances or a 
traumatic experience such as neglect  
or abuse. 
The three largest areas in the ESD market 
are the provision of residential care, 
education and fostering services. The UK 
has 66,000 “Looked After Children” who fit 
within this segment. Children placed in 
children’s homes tend to have needs at the 
higher severity end. Cambian is the largest 
provider of specialist children’s homes in the 
UK, with strong and growing positions. In 
the fostering and ESD education markets, 
the acquisition of By the Bridge in March 
2015 has strengthened our position in the 
fostering market, which provides a pathway 
for children placed in children’s homes 
towards care in a family environment. 
Mental Health is the state of emotional and 
psychological being in which an individual  
is unable to use his or her cognitive and 
emotional capabilities, function in society, 
and meet the ordinary demands of 
everyday life. Cambian’s independent 
mental health services provide wrap 
around therapeutic support and treatment 
for people with mental ill health, typically 
for people who are detained under the 
Mental Health Act. There is a recognised 
increase in demand for Child and 
Adolescent Mental Health Services 
(“CAMHS”) in the UK. This increased 
demand, which has also been driven  
by the government’s policy that no young 
people under 18 should be placed in  
adult mental health wards, has placed 
significant strain on services nationally  
and Cambian has responded by  
increasing our investment in this area. 
Independent providers receive funding in 
one of four ways: 
(i)  Spot contracts, or individual placement 
agreements, which generally have  
no minimum term and which offer  
our customers operational flexibility.  
Fees are typically agreed on a case  
by case basis.
(ii)  Framework agreements, which set  
out the key terms on which service 
users will be placed for a set period. 
Within a framework agreement,  
the purchaser does not have any 
minimum purchasing obligations,  
and the actual care package and  
price will be determined at the  
time the placement is made.
(iii)  Block contracts, where terms are 
agreed for a specific volume of 
services to be provided, pre-booked 
over a period of time at a specific 
price. Such block contracts have 
become increasingly uncommon  
over recent years.
(iv)  Private pay or insurance, which  
makes up a very small part of the 
specialist behavioural healthcare 
market. Examples in this category 
would be individuals from outside  
the UK coming here for treatment.
Market segments
An analysis of each of the segments that 
Cambian serves is as follows: 
Intellectual Disabilities relate to those 
conditions that are present at birth, as a 
result of either heredity or environmental 
influences: these are commonly recognised 
as being people with autism or who have 
a learning disability. Such individuals can 
have complex needs, and often challenging 
behaviours. Cambian is one of the UK’s 
leading providers of services for intellectual 
disabilities to both children and adults, 
through our educational and residential 
services for children and young adults, as 
well as rehabilitation hospitals, step-down, 
residential services and day services  
for adults. 
Market dynamics
•  M a r k e t c on s ol i d at i on 
continuing with advantages 
for larger providers 
•  C o m m i s s io n i ng t r e nd s 
driving need for an  
extended care pathway  
for certain services
•  Focus on outcomes driving 
increased specialisation
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 20 Market size and outlook 
In the UK there are estimated to be 
approximately 140,000 individuals  
who require a high intensity service  
within the areas that Cambian serves,  
with the annual spend on these individuals 
being approximately £13bn (Source: 
Company estimates). Approximately  
half of this population’s needs are met  
by independent providers, the remainder 
being public sector provision. 
Our addressable market is seeing 
increasing demand due to a number  
of drivers. As well as population growth,  
the underlying rates of incidence of these 
conditions are increasing, with a greater 
awareness and improving diagnosis of 
conditions. This is illustrated by a rise in UK 
autism prevalence from 39 cases per 10,000 
people in 1979 to approximately 100 cases 
per 10,000 in 2006 (Source: National Autistic 
Society). The independent sector’s role in the 
market has also increased in recent years 
given the benefits specialist providers can 
offer. Whilst the role of private provision 
within the NHS and local authorities remains 
a source of political debate, we believe that 
the trend towards outsourcing behavioural 
health services to specialist independent 
providers will continue to increase, given  
the benefits we can provide.
Acquired Conditions are a disruption in  
brain functioning that is not congenital  
or caused by birth trauma. However, it is  
a severe and life-long disabling condition 
which significantly impairs a person’s  
ability to function in society. The condition  
is manifested by significant decline in 
cognitive functioning and ability or 
deterioration in personality, impulse 
control, judgement, modulation of mood  
or awareness of deficits, typically as a 
result of a motor vehicle accident, stroke or 
substance misuse. Cambian is a relatively 
small provider in this area, but we have  
an additional specialist service due to  
open in 2016 and we believe that the 
segment provides an opportunity for 
growth in the future. 
Regulation 
The market that Cambian serves is 
regulated primarily by the Care Quality 
Commission (“CQC”) and the Office for 
Standards in Education, Children’s Services 
and Skills (“Ofsted”). These bodies control 
and administer the registration, inspection 
and complaints procedures set out under 
applicable laws and regulations. In order 
to open a service, it needs to be registered 
with Ofsted or the CQC, and must pass 
regular inspections to ensure it meets the 
minimum standards and requirements 
prescribed under laws and regulations.

development team to our operations team. 
Capacity is important as it measures the 
potential size of the business as it currently 
stands, whether or not the places are filled. 
Performance 
Capacity increased by over 12% in the  
year, both organically and by acquisition. 
Total gross organic openings of 382 
reflected a strong pipeline going into the 
year and the acceleration of our growth 
plan in the year. We are now focussed on 
filling existing capacity rather than further 
adding to capacity. 
Description 
Revenue measures how we have filled  
our capacity, the fees we have charged, 
together with the impact of acquisitions. 
Performance 
Revenue increased by 22% in the year.  
Total revenue was £290.1m, an increase of 
£49.5m of which £19.3m was attributable 
to the acquisition of By the Bridge made  
in the year.
1 Fostering placements are excluded from capacity and occupancy. Cambian had an average of 556 foster placements in the year (2014: 185).
Description 
Average occupancy is the average  
number of occupants in the year divided  
by the average capacity. This measures  
the degree to which our units were full  
in the year.

Our current Adult Services division is 
comparatively mature and achieved  
an average occupancy of 87%. In our 
Children’s Services division, where  
more places were added organically,  
the units are less mature than in Adult  
and occupancy was lower at 73%.

Description 
The market that Cambian services is 
regulated primarily by the CQC and  
Ofsted. Each facility is inspected and  
given a score, with a range of outcomes 
from “Outstanding”, “Good”, “Requires 
improvement” to “Inadequate”. 
Performance 
As at the end of 2015, 85% of the  
Group’s facilities were rated “Good “ or 
“Outstanding”. This being a new KPI added 
this year, we do not have a comparative, 
but we consider this to be a good result, 
and will measure this performance as  
a KPI going forward.

Strategic report Improving our risk management  
systems and approach
The Group’s business 
involves the care of 
vulnerable people  
with complex needs, 
involving it in significant 
risks. The effective 
management of risk  
has to be a core 
competence and 
operational focus  
of Cambian. 
The 2014 edition of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the “Code”) has  
placed greater emphasis on risk and  
the responsibility of boards for an 
organisation’s overall approach to risk.
During the year, the Committee has 
designed and implemented a risk 
management system to allow the Board to 
assess the main risks facing the business 
and will continue to develop and embed 
these processes in the current year.
In the light of this overall responsibility,  
the Board has developed a process for the 
management of risk at Cambian involving:
• Identifying the principal risks that 
threaten the achievement of our 
strategic objectives and assessing  
their significance to the business;
• Putting in place appropriate mitigating 
controls to manage identified risks to  
an acceptable level;
• Escalation and reporting of principal  
risk and control information to support 
management decision making and 
oversight;
• Assigning responsibility and defining 
accountabilities for risk management 
and putting these into practice across  
the Group;
• Having in place an appropriate risk 
management framework aligned to  
and supportive of the delivery of our 
strategy; and
• Continuously monitoring the changing 
risk environment, the Group’s principal 
risks, and the application of the 
framework.
The Board’s process for identifying the 
principal risks, involved risk workshops with 
the senior management team and also with 
their direct reports to identify risks and the 
existing controls in place to manage these 
risks. This process resulted in the description 
of eleven strategic risks facing the Group 
and both the Children’s Services division  
and the Adult Services division have 
developed their own risk registers using  
the same approach. Strategic risks can be 
defined as the uncertainties and untapped 
opportunities inherent in Cambian’s 
strategic plans and how well they are 
executed in the long term. As such, strategic 
risks are key matters for the Board as they 
impinge on the whole Group and its ability 
to deliver its objectives, rather than just 
having an isolated impact on a site,  
region or function.
During the year, Anne Marie Carrie, who 
had chaired the Quality & Risk Committee, 
stood down from the Board to take up  
an executive position within the business. 
Prompted in part by this change, the  
Board undertook a review in the second 
quarter of 2015 of the operation of the  
Audit Committee and the Quality & Risk 
Committee. Following this review, it was 
decided to combine the responsibilities  
of the two committees, so as to create the 
Audit & Risk Committee (the “Committee”) 
as a single point of reference for the 
monitoring of risk, both clinical and 
commercial, and to establish a framework 
for reporting to the Board. The Committee 
is required to consider the nature and 
extent of the risks facing the Group and 
keep them under review. In addition, the 
Committee reviews the risk management 
framework to mitigate such risk, monitors 
the effectiveness of the risk management 
framework and notifies the Board of 
changes in the status and control of risks.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 26
Risk management Ongoing process for risk identification, 
reporting and management
The Board is ultimately responsible for 
maintaining sound risk management, 
internal control and quality systems across 
the Group and monitoring these systems, 
although responsibility for risk and control 
oversight is principally delegated to the 
Committee, as described above. The Board 
must ensure that there are robust risk 
management and internal control systems 
and, at least annually, carry out a review  
of their effectiveness and report on that 
review to shareholders and the executive 
management team. The executive 
management team is responsible for 
defining, debating and challenging  
the nature of the principal risks and for 
sponsoring risk management activity 
across the Group. They are also 
responsible for ensuring that each of  
the operational services and Group 
functions implement the framework  
and providing challenge on risk issues  
and their mitigation. In parallel with the 
development of the strategic risk register, 
the Company has developed an enhanced

risk reporting framework intended to draw 
together day to day business risks and 
those risks specifically associated with 
clinical and care quality issues. A clear 
framework and cycle of reporting on risk  
is essential in building, implementing and 
developing strategic and operational risk 
management practices across Cambian. 
While the Group’s focus on the quality of 
the services it delivers acts as its principal 
tool for the management of operational 
risks, the risk management framework 
supports the delivery of the Group’s risk 
management objectives and outlines 
policy, application principles, risk oversight 
structures, key accountabilities and 
requirements for identifying, assessing 
reporting and monitoring risk. However, 
effective risk management is not just  
about meeting regulatory requirements. 
Understanding the risks Cambian faces 
and managing them appropriately will 
enhance its ability to make more informed 
decisions, deliver on objectives and 
subsequently improve its performance.  
In addition, managing risk effectively will 
protect and enhance the benefits and 
commitments the Company has made  
to our service users and shareholders,  
and it is this overarching principle that  
is the backbone of our approach to risk 
and control management. 
Responsibility for risk and quality rests  
with each and everyone in the business  
and is monitored by each facility manager  
on a daily basis. Both the Adult Services  
and Children’s Services divisions are 
supported by a dedicated Quality 
Intelligence team (“QI team”), which  
include former regulatory inspectors,  
who assist with regular site visits,  
auditing quality assurance, compliance  
and performance improvement.
The Group’s risk management framework is based on three lines of defence, as outlined below.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 27
Strategic report At an operational level in Adult Services 
each hospital holds a monthly clinical 
governance meeting to review matters 
such as medication, staffing levels,  
care plans and the like. The output  
from these meetings is reviewed on a 
quarterly basis by the regional clinical 
governance meetings and the Adult 
Services clinical board, which is attended  
by senior operational managers, the 
Quality Intelligence team, and health  
& safety manager. 
The Children’s Services and the educational 
services leadership teams meet weekly to 
review safeguarding and operational risk 
matters and matters arising are considered  
monthly at the Children’s Services residential 
safeguarding board and the education 
monthly management meeting. Any issues 
of immediate concern are raised either at 
the weekly Group executive management 
meeting or escalated further to the Audit & 
Risk Committee.
The management forums in both children’s 
residential and education services report 
ultimately to the Children’s Services 
leadership team, who meet monthly  
and review all safeguarding and other  
risks from the Children’s Services risk 
register, consider any regulatory issues  
or inspections and report to the Clinical 
Corporate Governance meeting.
The executive management team at their 
monthly management meetings consider 
whether, in the light of incidents reported 
from unit managers, the risks identified  
in the Group strategic risk register have 
moved. The meeting also considers the 
effectiveness of existing controls against the 
strategic risks and any mitigating actions 
identified in response to specific incidents. 
The output of the monthly management 
meeting is a risk heat map that identifies  
the likelihood of the risk occurring and the 
financial and reputational impact of the risk 
on the Group, as well as the steps that are 
being taken to reduce any risks identified  
as having increased in either impact or 
likelihood. This map and an explanation of 
the reasons why any risks are identified as 
being high or very high, together with plans 
in place or being formulated to reduce the 
risk, is tabled at each Board meeting for 
consideration by the directors.
In this way we believe that we are able  
to bring together consideration of medical, 
clinical, safeguarding and regulatory risks 
with other commercial risks.
Principal risks & uncertainties
The risks and uncertainties described in 
pages 30 and 31 are considered, at this 
point in time, to have the greatest effect  
on Cambian’s strategic objectives. This list  
is not intended to be comprehensive or 
exhaustive. While the Company can monitor 
risks and prepare for adverse scenarios,  
the ability to affect the core drivers of some 
risks are not within the Group’s control,  
for example changes in government 
regulation or policy.
During 2015 the principal risks identified 
through this process were in respect of the 
Group’s systems and process, in particular 
risks associated with the integration of  
the former Advanced Childcare Limited’s 
finance, HR and payroll systems into the 
existing Cambian systems, and the risk 
associated with the Group’s ambitious 
organic expansion plans. In response  
to these identified risks, the Group 
implemented a review of processes and 
procedures and is currently in the course  
of implementing a number of improved 
processes, and has scaled back the plans 
for organic growth. The other principal risk 
identified through the framework related to 
our Children’s Services which experienced 
some operational fragility caused by a 
difficulty in attracting the right calibre of 
support staff to work in an often challenging 
environment. This risk was manifested in 
delays during the year to openings of new 
facilities and restrictions in the number of 
pupils who could be accommodated at 
some of our schools. To mitigate these risks, 
management over-hauled the Group’s 
recruitment processes, improved induction 
and training and reviewed its pay-scales  
in certain geographical areas.
At the current point in time, the principal 
risks faced by the Group are its high level  
of indebtedness and the risk posed by 
weaknesses in the Group’s management 
information systems and financial controls. 
As indicated in the Chairman’s statement, 
the Board is considering a number of 
strategic options in order to reduce the 
Group’s leverage and is confident that it  
will be able to effect a transaction in order 
to achieve this strategic goal. In addition, the 
Board is working hard to address the risks 
posed by the weakness in the Group’s 
systems and controls with a number of 
improved processes being introduced. 
In addition, from April 2016 the government 
has introduced the national living wage 
which will increase the Group’s employment 
costs. Management have commenced a 
series of negotiations with customers with  
a view to increasing fees for existing service 
users to allow the Group to recover this 
increased cost and not impact on the  
quality of care provided. While the Group 
is reasonably confident, there can be no 
guarantee that it will be possible to fully 
recover the costs associated with the 
introduction of the national living wage 
through increased charges and the Group 
will continue to explore ways of ensuring 
that the impact of this legislative change  
is mitigated.

Strategic report Performance review
Adult Services
Overview
Adult Services revenue grew by 20% in  
the year including the contribution from 
Woodleigh, acquired in December 2014. 
Average occupancy was 87% (2014: 89%), 
the reduction mainly being the impact of 
the new places opened in the year being 
at the start of their maturity profile. Over 
the year, Adult Services added 43 net new 
occupants organically, a relatively modest 
number, but this follows a strong 
performance in 2014. 
The primary areas of growth were in 
Personality Disorders and Acquired Brain 
Injury. As new units mature we expect to 
increase occupancy further in the future. 
Adjusted EBITDA margin was 20.6% (2014: 
24.5%), reflecting the impact of growth sites 
in the year, some additional costs in our 
mature Adult sites, and additional support 
costs in areas such as HR and Quality.
Growth
The Adult Services market is more mature 
than the Children’s market. However,  
we see opportunities in specialist sub-
segments in the Adult market and, to  
that end, we opened four larger units  
in Adult in the year with including two 
Personality Disorder units, an Acquired 
Brain Injury unit and a unit for Adults  
with autism. 
We have two Woodleigh units under 
construction and due to open later this 
year and, with a good performance from 
existing Woodleigh units since acquisition 
in 2014, we are confident that there will  
be strong demand for these services.
The focus of our growth plan in the 
year was in the Children’ s division.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 32 Children’s Services 
Overview
Children’s Services revenue grew by 21%  
in the year, including the contribution of  
By the Bridge in 2015. Average occupancy 
in Children’s Services was 73% (2014: 74%), 
reflecting the relatively immature nature  
of the Children’s Services segment as 
compared to the Adult Services segment, 
and in particular, the significant capacity 
added in 2015. 
Whilst we added 188 net new occupants 
organically in Children’s Services, this was 
short of our target as we were unable to 
accept admissions in some parts of our 
Children’s Services in the second half of  
the year due to staffing and training  
issues, and the relatively short tenure of 
new staff recruited. Our autism schools 
and Children’s mental health services  
saw good growth in occupancy with new 
capacity added in the year. 
The Adjusted EBITDA margin of Children’s 
Services was 10.4% (2014: 17.0%), with an 
absolute reduction in Adjusted EBITDA of 
£6.1m. The biggest impact on profit was 
within our Children’s residential services 
where we incurred significant additional 
costs in areas such as wages, recruitment 
and repairs and maintenance, without  
a commensurate increase in revenue. 
Against this our education and Children’s 
mental health units grew profitability in  
the year. In addition, profitability was 
impacted by significant additional central 
support costs in the year, for example  
in the operations teams required to 
manage a portfolio of over 200 sites.
Growth 
The focus of our growth plan in the year 
was in the Children’s division.
We increased our education services 
significantly, in particular adding three 
large schools: Bletchley, Spring Hill and 
Potterspury Lodge (with a combined 
capacity of 166 places). These offer 
significant opportunity for future revenue 
growth as we build capacity and focus 
their offerings on higher value services to 
address more acute needs. We have also 
grown our Children’s residential services, in 
particular for children suffering from abuse 
or neglect or with mental health conditions. 
We have previously highlighted fostering 
as an area that we wished to grow. To  
this end, we were pleased to acquire By 
the Bridge in March. By the Bridge operates 
at the high-severity end of fostering and 
has built a reputation for providing high 
quality, therapeutic fostering services  
and for successfully placing children with 
complex needs in a family environment. As 
such, it occupies a niche position between 
traditional fostering and residential care 
and now forms an integral part of our 
Children’ Services offering. Cambian’s 
existing fostering operation has been 
integrated into By the Bridge during the 
year. Our focus is now on foster carer 
recruitment to drive placement numbers. 
At 31 December 2015 the Group had  
668 fostering placements (2014: 203 
placements), of which 501 related to  
By the Bridge.

Strategic report Finance review
Group performance 
In 2015 the Group delivered revenue 
growth of 21% (2014: 12%). Average 
occupancy was 78% (2014: 81%) the drop 
largely being due to the lag effect of new 
places added in the year. The Group’s 
Adjusted EBITDA
1
 margin was 14.7% (2014: 
20.1%), impacted by additional costs being 
incurred in the year. At a unit level, costs 
were incurred particularly in relation to 
new sites in areas such as recruitment 
costs, in advance of revenue growth from 
occupancy. In addition, we increased  
costs centrally, including in our operations 
teams, HR function and sales and 
marketing function, which impacted  
the margin in the year in both Adult  
and Children’s services. 
With the scaling back of the Group’s  
growth plan, Underlying EBITDA  
(calculated as Adjusted EBITDA adding 
back development losses, being losses 
incurred in the first 18 months of a site’s 
operation or repositioning) is no longer  
a KPI that is being measured. Instead, 
Adjusted EBITDA is the key measure  
of business profitability.
Operating profit 
Adjusted EBITDA reconciles to Operating 
Profit as follows:
M&A costs
M&A costs represent advisory fees, stamp 
duty and other direct costs in respect of 
acquisitions completed in the year. 
Charge on IPO option plans
The charge on IPO option plans arises on 
Continuation Option Plan shares awarded 
as part of the IPO, the impact of which is 
excluded from Adjusted EBITDA. Charges 
on future share based awards will be 
included within Adjusted EBITDA.
Exceptional items 
Exceptional items consist of a fixed asset 
impairment of £21.7m, £2.7m IT project 
costs written off, redundancy costs of 
£0.3m and IT integration costs of £0.2m. 
The fixed asset impairment relates to 19 
sites where the net asset value was not 
supported by the value in use or fair value 
less costs of disposal.
IT project costs written off relate to  
£0.9m costs capitalised in 2014, and 
£1.8m of costs capitalised in 2015, in 
relation to an integrated Finance, HR  
and CRM system. In December 2015  
the Board revised the project in order  
to pursue a lower cost option of 
remediating current systems.
Finance charges
The Group incurred net finance costs  
of £8.8m in the year (2014: £11.4m).
Taxation 
The Group’s tax charge was a credit  
£6.8m (2014: £4.1m charge). This includes  
a credit of £8.5m in relation to the 
impairment of assets and a revaluation  
of deferred tax liabilities following the 
change in the UK corporation tax rate. 
Excluding these factors, the Group’s tax  
rate was 22% of profit before tax and  
M&A and exceptional costs. The difference 
between the current statutory rate of 20.25% 
and the effective tax rate is principally due  
to non-deductible expenditure and 
non-qualifying depreciation. 
Earnings per share 
Statutory basic EPS was a loss of 5.4 pence 
(2014: loss of 6.1 pence), and statutory 
diluted EPS was a loss of 5.4 pence (2014: 
loss of 6.1 pence). Adjusted basic EPS is 
defined as statutory basic EPS, adding 
back the impact of amortisation of 
acquired intangible assets, the charge 
relating to Continuation Option Plan  
shares awarded as part of the IPO,  
and exceptional items and M&A costs,  
net of the tax effect of these items.

Acquisitions 
During the year, the Group acquired By the Bridge for a net cash consideration of £34.3m, initially funded by debt and subsequently 
partially refinanced through an issue of additional share capital raising £25.4m. 
In addition, the Group purchased the share capital of Interact Care Limited, a portfolio of assets providing Learning Disability services  
to Children, for a net cash consideration of £3.3m, and acquired two schools, Spring Hill and Potterspury Lodge for £1.6m and £2.1m 
respectively. For the purposes of the capacity and occupancy numbers within this report, these purchases are treated as organic growth  
as the assets were acquired at rebuild cost and meet our organic growth capital expenditure hurdle rates of return. 
Capital expenditure 
The Group incurred £44.3m (2014: £24.5m) of capital expenditure in the year, of which £32.5m was spent on acquiring and developing 
new capacity. A further £6.8m (2014: £5.2m) was spent on the maintenance of our existing units (including £0.6m remedial work on 
certain Woodleigh units), £1.8m was incurred on an integrated Finance, HR and CRM project (which was cancelled in December 2015  
as the Group pursued remediation of current systems), and £3.1m was spent on IT and non-site level capital expenditure, including 
refurbishing our central office in Hammersmith.

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 35
Strategic report The movement on working capital 
comprises a £17.6m outflow on the 
movement on trade and other debtors,  
a £6.2m inflow from the movement on 
deferred income and £3.0m inflow on 
trade and other payables. The increase  
in trade and other debtors partly arises 
from an acceleration in the timing of 
billing of certain of our services in 2015 
and is effectively offset by the increase  
in deferred income. Netting these two 
factors gives a net outflow of £11.4m from 
trade and other receivables – a reduction 
from the position reported in our 2015  
half year results, but still a higher than 
expected outflow given the growth in the 
business in the year. The reason for this 
was issues arising out of the integration  
of the finance functions of Cambian  
and Advanced Childcare during 2015. 
During the year, the Group made tax 
payments of £8.3m which related to  
the prior year charge, and instalment 
payments on our current year charge. 
In March 2015, following the acquisition of 
By the Bridge, the Group issued 11,863,636 
shares for a cash consideration of £25.4m, 
net of fees. 
Debt Facilities 
The Group extended its facilities agreement 
in March 2015 by £35m initially to fund the 
acquisition of By the Bridge. In the second 
half of 2015, the Group entered into £80m  
of interest rate swaps until April 2019 at  
a blended rate of 1.6% over LIBOR. 
At 31 December 2015, the total facilities 
available to the Group were £290m of which 
£256.5m was utilised. Together with cash 
and other debt like items on the balance 
sheet, net debt was £239.3m (2014: £188.7m). 
On 26 April the Board and the Group’s 
lending banks agreed terms for the 
amendment of the Group’s £290m Facilities 
Agreement, the principal provisions of which 
are that a fee of £2.9m (representing 1% of 
the total Facilities) is payable immediately, 
with a flat rate margin of 3.75% over LIBOR 
payable on the amounts drawn under the 
Facilities. Furthermore, the Facilities are split 
into “Tranche A” of £120m and “Tranche B”  
of £170m. Additional interest of 10% per year 
is to be accrued on Tranche A and paid on 
repayment or expiry of Tranche A. Should 
Tranche A not be repaid by 30 April 2017 , then 
a further fee of £4.0m is payable. An exit fee 
of up to £10m is payable on repayment of 
Tranche A which expires on 30 September 
2017 . Tranche B expires on 31 March 2019. The 
Group has also amended its covenants and 
a number of information undertakings under 
the agreed terms.
An important requirement of the agreed 
amended terms is the repayment of Tranche 
A by 30 September 2017 . As explained in the 
Chairman’s statement on page 6, the Board 
has been actively reviewing with its advisors 
a number of strategic options for the Group 
and the Board is confident that these will 
enable a successful repayment by that date.
Dividend 
In view of the disappointing financial 
performance of the business in the year,  
as announced on 9 February 2016, the 
Board has determined that no dividend  
will be proposed in respect of the 2015 
financial year. 
Finance review  
continued
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 36 Going concern  
and viability statement
Going concern statement
The directors have considered the Group’s 
financial resources including a review of 
the medium-term financial plan, which 
includes a review of the Group’s cash  
flow forecasts for the period of at least  
12 months from the date of approval of 
these financial statements. The directors 
reviewed the assumptions that underlie  
the cash-flow forecasts produced by 
management and tested these under  
a number of differing scenarios
In particular, the directors have considered 
the availability of cash, short-term deposits 
and undrawn facilities under committed 
facilities of £290m, which, when taken  
out, were due to mature on 31 March 2019. 
Since the end of the financial year, as 
described on page 36 of the finance review 
and as set out in note 35 to the financial 
statements, the Company has agreed 
terms for amendment of these facilities  
(the “Amended Facilities”). 
The directors believe that the Group will  
be able to draw down on the Amended 
Facilities, if required to finance the Group’s 
forecast cash requirements during the 
period under review. This provides 
confidence that the Group has sufficient 
financial resources for at least 12 months 
from the date of approval of these financial 
statements. As a consequence, the 
directors believe that the Company is  
well placed to manage its business. 
Based on the considerations noted  
above, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the 
Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for  
at least 12 months from the date of 
approval of these financial statements.  
For this reason, the directors continue  
to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the accounts.
Viability statement
In accordance with the revised UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the directors 
have assessed the prospects of the Group 
over a period significantly longer than 12 
months from 31 December 2015. 
The directors have concluded that the  
most appropriate time period for this 
review should be a three year period  
to 31 December 2018. This period of 
assessment has been chosen since  
it conforms with the Group’s strategic  
plan and the term of the Amended 
Facilities as set out in note 35 to the 
financial statements.
In making their assessment, the directors 
considered, in particular, Cambian’s  
ability to repay the £120m tranche of  
the Amended Facilities during 2017.  
The directors formed the view that there  
were reasonable grounds for concluding 
that the Group would be able to meet this 
obligation under the Amended Facilities in 
the light of the options open to the Group 
following a strategic review undertaken 
with its financial advisers and the quality 
of, and continued demand for, the services 
provided by the Group.
In addition, the directors reviewed the 
current financial and operational position 
and contracted and forecast capital 
expenditures of the Group during the 
period. The directors also tested the 
assumptions underlying the Group’s 
business plans under a variety of 
scenarios, including the likelihood of 
delivering on the current strategy of  
the Group to complete and fill the new 
facilities it has in development. They  
also assessed the potential financial and 
operational impacts of the principal risks  
and uncertainties set out on pages 30  
and 31, together with the current controls, 
assurances and mitigating factors that 
could reduce the impact of such risks.  
The directors also gave consideration  
to the impact of the introduction of the 
National Living Wage on the Group’s  
cost base and the ability of the Group  
to pass on any increased costs through 
planned fee increases or to otherwise 
mitigate its impact. 
Based on this assessment, the directors 
have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group will be able  
to continue in operation and meet their 
liabilities as they fall due through to the 
end of 2018.

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 38 Being a successful and 
sustainable business 
requires Cambian to  
do more than generate  
a financial return  
for our shareholders.  
We believe our continued 
success depends on 
acknowledging and  
fulfilling our responsibilities 
to those individuals who  
are entrusted to our care,  
to our employees and  
our other stakeholders.
As a leading provider of specialist 
behavioural health services for adults  
and children in the UK, we believe our 
most important corporate responsibility is 
to continue to deliver successful outcomes 
for the individuals entrusted to our care, so 
that they can each achieve their personal 
best. We do this by ensuring that our staff 
and systems are focused on the delivery  
of good-quality, therapeutically led services 
in modern, high-quality facilities or within 
well-supported, outstanding foster families 
that deliver outcomes leading to a better 
quality of life for our service users. In the 
year we celebrated the achievements of  
a young person in our fostering services 
publishing a book through Matador  
and another from Grately House School 
being offered a place to study at 
Cambridge University.
Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”)  
also permeates how we treat our over 
7,000 employees and give them the 
training and support to continue to 
deliver excellent care, as well as our 
commitment to playing a positive role in  
the communities we serve and in how  
we manage our environmental impacts.
Our Group Code of Conduct
Our Code of Conduct provides the 
framework for our policies, programmes 
and procedures for a range of Corporate 
Responsibility issues. It sets out broad 
principles based on the common values  
of responsibility, accountability, integrity, 
honesty, fairness and transparency. 
This gives us a clear understanding of  
how we do business and how we work 
with each other and those in our care, as  
well as with other stakeholders. It applies  
to every Cambian employee and it applies  
to every interaction we make. 
This year we began a review of our core 
values and Code of Conduct to make  
sure they reflect our diverse and growing 
business, while being aligned to our core 
purpose: to be one of the largest providers 
of specialist behavioural health services for 
children and adults in the UK. More work  
is being done in 2016 to bring together a 
Cambian culture with shared values and 
common goals. 
Social and community involvement
Cambian is focused on developing strong 
ties with the local communities in which  
we are situated. It helps both foster an 
understanding in the community of the 
work that we do and has therapeutic and 
educational benefits for those individuals  
in our care. There are numerous examples 
of community participation, such as: 
• A number of local football teams are 
supported by Cambian facilities, such  
as the support that Delfryn House and 
Delfryn Lodge provide to local football 
team, Mold Alexandra
• Within our educational services,  
a number of schools and colleges  
make their facilities available where 
practicable for local use, such as  
the New Elizabethan School in 
Worcestershire which makes its cricket 
pitch available for the local cricket club
• Cambian Dilston College has formed  
a local partnership with Darlington 
College. Working in conjunction with the 
college, we provide life skills training to 
local students, preparing them for more 
independent living. We also work with 
them to develop their employability skills; 
this includes supporting students on a 
local work placement. The partnership 
also involves a tutor from the college 
providing tutoring services to locals four 
days a week

national charities through fundraising 
activities such as charity bake sales

• The Group funds two free places at  
its schools: one in its schools for pupils  
with autism and one for pupils with 
Asperger’s Syndrome
A key component of our Corporate 
Responsibility programme relates to 
ensuring that our business activities are 
conducted in such a way that we are not 
complicit in the abuse of fundamental 
human rights and labour rights. This is  
a particular issue with the services which 
Cambian provides to adults and children 
who may have mental health issues  
or intellectual difficulties that make the  
issues of consent to treatment particularly 
sensitive. The Group places particular 
emphasis through training and policies 
that before any individuals in our care 
receive any care or treatment they are 
asked for their consent and the provider 
acted in accordance with their wishes,  
or where people do not have the  
capacity to consent, the provider acted  
in accordance with legal requirements.
Employees
Our people are at the heart of our 
business; they are central to the quality  
of care and support we offer to those 
entrusted to us. The pursuit of talent  
in the care sector remains a challenge,  
so the recruitment, retention and 
development of our people continue  
to be a key priority for the Group. 
Following a comprehensive review of the 
Group’s HR and talent strategy, we took  
a new approach to recruitment this year  
to help build the best talent pool and lay 
solid foundations for a working culture 
across the business:
We identified what good looks like
• We’ve standardised role profiles  
across the Group with a clear outline  
of accountabilities, required experience 
and skills
We changed the way we source 
candidates
• Along with enhancing our direct  
sourcing channels (reducing our  
reliance on costly recruitment agencies), 
we are undertaking proactive searches  
for passive candidates with greater  
use of referrals
We are attracting the right people
• We’ve put together a strong employer 
brand and are attracting people who 
want meaningful work and are trusted  
to do a good job
We’ve changed how we select candidates
• We are looking to recruit people with 
motivation and passion for a career in 
care, not just look at their experience
We’ve introduced a new approach to 
inducting colleagues
• We communicate with candidates prior 
to them joining to fully engage them  
with the organisation
These initiatives, along with the 
establishment of a HR Shared Services 
Centre to focus on recruitment, will 
enhance our efforts to create and foster  
a strong workplace culture, with further 
plans to continue this work in 2016.
The Group’s policy is that it will not tolerate 
any discrimination, directly or indirectly,  
in recruitment or employment because of 
age, disability, sex, gender reassignment, 
pregnancy, maternity, race (which includes 
colour, nationality and ethnic or national 
origins), sexual orientation, religion or 
belief, or because someone is married or 
in a civil partnership. We will demonstrate 
our commitment by:
• Promoting equal opportunity for our 
current and potential team members
• Reflecting the communities in which  
we work
• Aiming to build teams which reflect the 
diversity of our customers and treating 
our customers, partners and team 
members fairly and with respect
• Promoting an environment free from 
discrimination, bullying and harassment, 
and tackling any behaviour which may 
breach this intent
• Providing support and encouragement 
to our people to develop their careers and 
increase their contribution to Cambian

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 40 Environmental
This section includes our mandatory 
reporting of greenhouse gas emissions 
pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 
(Strategic Report and Directors’ Report 
Regulations 2013) (the “Regulations”). We 
include this reporting data in this section  
in order to provide a complete Corporate 
Responsibility picture.
Reporting year
We have aligned our greenhouse gas 
emissions reporting year with our  
financial year, being 1 January 2015 to  
31 December 2015.
Greenhouse gas emissions (GHG) 
reporting
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Large and 
Medium-Sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
as amended in August 2013. 
Reporting boundary
The reporting boundary used for collation of 
the above data is consistent with that used 
for consolidation purposes in the financial 
statements. We report our emissions data 
using an operational control approach to 
define our organisational boundary which 
meets the definitional requirements of the 
Regulations in respect of those emissions for 
which we are responsible. We have reported 
We have continued to make a concerted 
effort to reduce our carbon footprint. For 
example, across our business we have 
continued to focus on the reduction of 
emissions by:
• Implementing vehicle tracking on fleet 
vehicles to promote less aggressive  
and more fuel efficient driving strategies
• Adopting new more energy-efficient 
standards and specifications for the 
building of new facilities and conversions 
of buildings that we acquire and aim  
to achieve minimum BREEAM standards 
wherever possible
• Implementation of a range of energy 
efficiency projects including the 
introduction of more energy efficient 
condenser boilers into our facilities  
and better insulation specifications  
at all sites and unless prohibited by 
Listed Building or Conservation Areas
• Promoting the use of rail travel
on all material emission sources for which 
we deem ourselves to be responsible. These 
sources align with our operational control 
and financial control boundaries. We do  
not have responsibility for any emission 
sources that are beyond the boundary of  
our operational control. For example, 
business travel other than by car (including, 
for example, commercial flights) is not within 
our operational control and, therefore, is not 
considered to be our responsibility.
Methodology
The greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions  
report has been prepared in line with UK 
mandatory reporting requirements, set  
by the Department for Environment, Food 
and Rural Affairs (DEFRA). The mandatory 
requirement is for the disclosure of scope  
1 and 2 emissions only. These are direct 
emissions such as heating, vehicle fuel and 
indirect emissions, for example purchased 
gas and electricity. The Group’s total GHG 
footprint in line with DEFRA’s mandatory 
reporting requirements is 15.5m tonnes CO
2
e.
Intensity ratio
In order to express our annual emissions in 
relation to a quantifiable factor associated 
with our activities, we have used revenue 
in our intensity ratio calculation, as this is 
the most relevant indication of our growth 
and provides for a good comparative 
measure over time.

Strategic report Governance overview
Christopher Kemball 
Chairman
Dear Shareholder
Introduction
Corporate governance at Cambian  
is about running the business in the  
right way in order to create long-term 
sustainable value for the benefit of all of 
our stakeholders: the adults and children 
placed under our care, their families, our 
commissioners, our regulators and our 
shareholders. I hope that by reading our 
governance reports you will gain a better 
understanding of our culture and the 
effectiveness of our Board.
What good governance means  
to Cambian 
Corporate governance at Cambian is 
treated as a core and vital discipline that 
complements our need to improve the 
performance of the business on behalf  
of our service users, commissioners and 
shareholders. Our approach to governance 
is set by the Board. Our executive board 
then ensures that our approach is effectively 
implemented across the entire business, 
and that all our employees are aware of, 
and live by, our culture and uphold the 
highest standards of service. We believe 
that effective governance is achieved 
through leadership and collaboration, 
resulting in consistently focused and 
sensible business decisions
Board performance in 2015
Non-executive site visits
The independent role of our non-executive 
directors is extremely important to us.  
We are determined to ensure that they  
can play an active role in the development 
and management of our business. We do 
not believe they can develop a complete 
picture of how the Group operates by  
simply reviewing Board papers and 
attending Board and committee meetings. 
above and attending selected 
meetings with commissioners.
(iii) The executive board needs to be more 
open and candid about issues facing 
the business and clearer about its 
recommendations and decision making. 
We can achieve this through greater 
and more regular exposure to the 
executive board members.
(iv) Our systems and processes need to 
be reviewed and, where necessary, 
overhauled to ensure that we are able 
accurately to record and forecast the 
financial performance of our business, 
and we are implementing remedial 
actions in these areas.
(v) A comprehensive set of key 
performance indicators (KPI’s) should 
be developed and understood at  
all levels of the business. These  
have been developed and cover 
measurements such as revenue per 
bed, profitability, average length of 
stay, and clinical quality.
Board experience
To achieve its governance objectives, the 
Board comprises a majority of independent 
non-executive directors who have been 
selected to deliver an appropriate mix of 
diversity, skills and experience. The Board 
is led by an independent Chairman, who  
in turn is well-supported by a Senior 
Independent Director. 
 
I am delighted that Mike Butterworth has 
agreed to join the Board as an independent 
non-executive director and his considerable 
experience as CFO in a number of listed 
companies will be a considerable asset to 
Cambian. Further details of the Board can 
be found on pages 44 and 45.
Board committees
At the time of our 2014 Annual Report, the 
Board had formed four committees: Audit, 
Remuneration, Nomination and a Quality 
and Risk Committee under the guidance of 
its then Chair, Anne Marie Carrie. Anne Marie 
Carrie decided to stand down in March 2015 
as a non-executive director in order to 
become the CEO of our Children’s Services 
division. At the same time, the Board 
considered how it could most effectively 
discharge its responsibilities under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, as amended in 
September 2014 (the “Code”) for monitoring 
We have therefore implemented a 
programme of individual site visits whereby 
each of our non-executives is required to visit 
at least one site independently during the 
year. These visits give our non-executive 
directors a valuable opportunity to meet 
and engage with our local management 
teams to understand better local operations 
and procedures and to get to know our 
people and those they care for.
Induction of new NED
We were delighted to welcome Dr Graham 
Rich as an independent non-executive 
director in July 2015 who brought a  
wealth of experience as a clinician  
and management consultant within  
the healthcare sector. In conjunction  
with the Company Secretary, we provided  
a tailored induction programme designed  
to ensure that Graham obtained a 
comprehensive picture of Cambian’s 
operations and culture. 
Performance evaluation
The Board appointed Lintstock Limited,  
an independent consultancy, to assist us  
in the annual Board evaluation which was 
conducted with the assistance of the Company 
Secretary by me in October and November 
2015. The process consisted of a carefully 
prepared online questionnaire which  
was completed by both the Board and  
the executive board. The answers to the 
questionnaires were then compiled and 
discussed at a meeting of the non-executive 
directors on 12 November 2015 and a final 
version was approved with recommendations 
to the Board on 15 December 2015.
The principal conclusions and 
recommendations were that:
(i) The Board composition of five 
non-executive directors (one of whom 
is not independent) and two executive 
directors is adequate but we should 
look to add a further non-executive 
director with relevant public company 
experience in 2016 and I am delighted 
that we announced the appointment 
of Mike Butterworth to the Board.
(ii) The Board needs to develop greater 
understanding of both our staff and 
our commissioning customers. This 
can best be achieved through the 
independent site visits described

Section of The Code Further information
Leadership
A company must be led by an effective board responsible for the success of 
the company, in the near and long term. Such a board will have clear divisions 
of responsibility between company governance and business execution. 
Board leadership, 
p.46
Effectiveness
The established board will have the relevant level of and appropriate 
balance of skills in order to suitably steer the company. Such knowledge  
is certified by rigorous procedures regarding the appointment of new,  
and the re-appointment of existing, Directors.
Evaluation,  
p.49
Accountability
At all times, the board must present a fair, balanced and understandable 
evaluation of the company’s standing and future prospects. Such future 
prospects are considered against risks that the company is or may face 
moving forward; it is the Board’s responsibility to ensure effective and 
appropriate risk management procedures are in place.

p.2 to 41
Remuneration
While it is necessary for levels of remuneration to attract, retain and motivate 
directors of sufficient quality, at no point should the company allocate more  
than is necessary. Where possible, remuneration should be linked to 
performance and, at all times, established through formal and transparent 
procedures of which no one director is involved in his or her own remuneration.

How we apply the principles of the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014 risk across both usual business risk and the 
key areas for Cambian of quality and clinical 
risk. Following this review, it was decided to 
report the totality of all risks across of the 
Group into the Audit Committee, so as to 
create a single point for assisting the Board  
in its obligations under the Code, and to 
rename the Audit Committee as the Audit & 
Risk Committee. The composition and terms 
of reference of the committees of the Board  
are described in more detail below.
Strategic oversight
I have had regular meetings during the  
year with our Chief Executive, Saleem  
Asaria, and other members of the executive 
management team at Cambian and will 
continue to do so in 2016. These meetings 
enable me to stay abreast of developments 
in the business between Board meetings 
and to confirm that we are continuing to 
perform against our strategic objectives.
Last October, we held a constructive strategy 
meeting with executive management which 
enabled the Board to assist the executive in 
further defining our strategy and to identify 
areas where the Group could develop further.

Governance UK Corporate Governance Compliance statement
In September 2014, the Financial Reporting Council published the 
2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
which contains broad principles and specific provisions to assist 
how boards operate. This Code applied to Cambian during the 
financial year ended 31 December 2015.
In the period following the resignation of Anne Marie Carrie and 
before the appointment of Dr Graham Rich in July 2015, at least half 
the Board, excluding the chairman, did not comprise non-executive 
directors determined by the Board to be independent, as required by 
Code provision B.1.2, and the Audit Committee only comprised two 
independent non-executive directors, Alison Halsey and Chris 
Brinsmead, which was only appropriate for smaller quoted 
companies (Code Provision C.3.1).
In addition, as disclosed in the directors’ remuneration report on 
pages 59 to 74, certain nil-cost option awards were made to executive 
directors (all of which were made prior to Admission) which will vest  
as to one-third of the award on each of the third, fourth,and fifth 
anniversaries of the date of Admission. These awards do not contain 
any performance-related vesting conditions as recommended in 
Schedule A of the Code since they were made prior to Admission  
and in part to reward for past performance and to provide a  
long-term retention mechanism for the executive directors and  
key senior managers.
Save as disclosed above, the Board considers that it has complied 
with the provisions of the Code throughout the year. The tables 
below set out our approach to applying the Code.
Board leadership
Role of the Board 
The Board has collective responsibility for the management, 
direction and performance of the Company and provides 
leadership within a framework of prudent and effective controls 
which seeks to enable risk to be appropriately assessed and 
managed. The Board has established the governance framework 
illustrated in the chart on page 43 to support the development  
of good governance practices throughout the Group.
The Board takes a long-term outlook and sees itself as responsible 
to a wide range of stakeholders, including shareholders, customers, 
care commissioning bodies and employees, whilst pursuing its 
objectives in a manner consistent with its statutory duties.
Board composition and balance 
As at 31 December 2015, the Board comprised the Chairman,  
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, together  
with three independent non-executive directors and one further 
non-executive director. 
Corporate governance report
The list of current directors, their responsibilities and respective 
dates of appointment are set out in the table below.
Director’s name Title Appointed
Christopher Kemball Non-executive, Chairman March 2014
Saleem Asaria Executive director, CEO March 2014
Andrew Griffith Executive director March 2014
Chris Brinsmead Non-executive, Senior 
Independent Director 
July 2014
Alison Halsey Independent non-executive 
director
March 2014
Dr Graham Rich Independent non-executive 
director
July 2015
Alfred Foglio Non-executive director March 2014
Further biographical information on each of our directors can be 
found on pages 44 and 45, which shows the breadth of strategic 
and financial management insight brought to our Board. All of our 
independent non-executive directors have held senior executive 
or non-executive positions within listed companies. These 
non-executive directors bring industry experience from a wide 
range of backgrounds including finance, business services, 
pharmaceuticals, software and the NHS.
The principle of boardroom diversity is strongly supported by the 
Board. It is the Board’s policy that appointments will always be 
based on merit so that the Board has the right individuals in place. 
The Board ensures that diversity is an important consideration and 
part of the selective criteria used to assess candidates to achieve 
a balanced board.
The Board also reviews non-executive directors’ independence  
on an annual basis taking into account such factors as their 
contribution to unbiased and independent debate during 
meetings. All non-executive directors (other than Alfred Foglio)  
are considered by the Board to be independent of management 
and free of any relationship, which could materially interfere with 
the exercise of their independent judgement, as explained above. 
Alfred Foglio is not considered to be independent for the purposes 
of the Code as a result of his being the director appointed to  
the Board by GI Partners in accordance with the terms of the 
Relationship Agreement. 
To safeguard their independence, a director is not entitled to vote  
on any matter in which they have a material personal interest 
unless the rest of the Board unanimously decides otherwise. 
Where necessary, directors are required to absent themselves 
from a meeting of the Board while such matters are being 
discussed, although no such situations arose in 2015. The Board 
has an annual process of formally reviewing conflicts disclosed, 
and the authorisations given (including such conditions as the 
Board may determine in each case). Any conflicts or potential 
conflicts considered by the Board and any authorisations given  
are recorded in the Board minutes and in a register of directors’ 
conflicts which is maintained by the Company Secretary.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 46 Dr Graham Rich joined the Board in July 2015. As part of his 
induction process, Graham Rich has visited Cambian Alders,  
a specialist service for women with a personality disorder, 
Cambian Churchill, a male mental health rehabilitation service  
in London, Cambian Brunel, a new service we are looking to  
open next year, and Cambian Fairviews, to gain insight into  
the therapeutic model which Cambian delivers. Dr Rich has  
also met with a number of the senior management team to  
gain an understanding of the principal risks and uncertainties 
facing the Group, as well as the strategic challenges and 
opportunities faced by Cambian.
Dr Rich also participated with the other non-executive directors  
in a visit to two of the Group’s specialist schools: the Cambian 
Potterspury Lodge School and Cambian Bletchley Park. Cambian 
Potterspury Lodge, is a residential school for young persons aged 
8–18 years old, who have a diagnosis of Asperger’s Syndrome  
or other associated difficulties. Cambian Bletchley Park is a day 
school for students aged 11-17 years old with a diagnosis of 
autism, communication difficulties and related conditions  
that opened in September 2015. The non-executive directors 
broadened their understanding of Cambian’s approach, designed  
to assist the students in developing academic, social and life skills 
that will enable them to achieve the maximum amount of 
independence in their adult lives, through meeting students, 
teachers, clinicians and other support staff at these facilities.
How the Board functions
The Board meets regularly, with six scheduled meetings held  
in 2015. In addition, three other meetings were held outside this 
schedule, principally related to the approval of the acquisition  
of By the Bridge Limited and its financing, the approval of an 
updated forecast for the Company’s financial performance,  
and to approve the initial stage of a project to improve the 
Company’s financial, HR and sales & marketing processes. 
During the current year, the Board has met regularly in connection 
with the negotiation of the amended terms of the Group’s facility 
agreement and to review the Group’s strategy and options to 
reduce borrowings. During 2016 it is intended that at least two  
of the meetings of the Board will be held at one of the Group’s 
regional management centres in order to ensure that all directors 
have the opportunity to meet regional management teams, to 
broaden their knowledge of the Group’s operations and of the 
industry in general. 
During the year, meetings of the Board were often preceded by  
a board dinner to which members of the executive management 
team or others were invited. These dinners provide a useful  
forum for additional debate between directors and executives  
on complex matters to be discussed at the scheduled meetings.  
This helps the directors to fully understand the issues at hand,  
and ensures that the process of the formal meetings is facilitated.
During the year, the Chairman met the other non-executives in the 
absence of the executive directors to re-confirm and take account 
of their views. 
Roles and responsibilities
The roles of the Chairman (Christopher Kemball) and the  
Chief Executive Officer (Saleem Asaria) are separated  
and clearly defined. The Chairman regularly visits our

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 48 Responsibility and delegation
There remains in place a formal schedule of matters specifically 
reserved for Board consideration and approval, which includes  
the matters set out below:
• Approval of the Group’s long-term objectives and  
commercial strategy;
• Approval of the annual operating and capital expenditure 
budgets and any changes to them;
• Major acquisitions and disposals;
• The extension of the Group’s activities into any new business  
or geographic areas, or to cease any material operations;
• Changes in the Company’s capital structure or entering  
into any material bank facilities or granting security;
• Approval of treasury policies, including foreign currency 
exposures and use of financial derivatives;
• The entering into of agreements that are not in the ordinary course 
of business or material strategically or by reason of their size;
• Changes to the size, composition or structure of the Board  
and its committees; and
• Corporate governance matters.
The Board has delegated certain of its responsibilities to a number 
of committees of the Board to assist in the discharge of its duties. 
The principal committees of the Board currently are the Audit  
& Risk Committee, the Remuneration Committee, and the 
Nomination Committee. The composition of these committees  
is set out in the table on page 43 and a report on the activities  
of each of the committees is set out on pages 52 to 74 below.  
The minutes of each of these committees are circulated to and 
reviewed by the Board. The Company Secretary is secretary to 
each of these committees. The terms of reference for each of  
the committees are available to view on the Company’s website 
www.cambiangroup.com
In addition to an executive management committee, consisting  
of the senior management with responsibility for the operational 
divisions of Children’s Services and Adult Services and by key 
support functions, the Group has established an operational 
governance committee that meets four times per year to monitor 
issues of safeguarding, clinical practice or other operational 
issues. The operational governance committee reports to the  
Audit & Risk Committee of the Board.
Risk
Under the Code, the Board is responsible for determining the 
nature and extent of the principal risks it is willing to take in 
achieving its strategic objectives. The Board should maintain a 
sound system of risk management and internal control systems 
(Main Principle C.2). During the year, the Board carried out an 
assessment of the principal risks facing the Company, including 
those that would threaten its business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity. 
During the year and with the assistance of the Audit & Risk 
Committee, the Board have carried out a robust assessment of  
the principal risks facing the Company, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. The Board also carried out a review of the effectiveness  
of the Company’s risk management and internal control systems. 
These risks, and the steps taken by Cambian to mitigate them,  
are described more fully on pages 26 to 31. The viability statement 
required to be made under the new Code provision C.2.2. is set 
out on page 37. 
Board balance
The Board comprises individuals with wide business experience 
gained in various industry sectors related to the Group’s business 
and it is the intention of the Board to ensure that the balance of the 
directors reflects the changing needs of the business. 
The Nomination Committee has a formal, rigorous and transparent 
procedure for the appointment of new directors, which are made 
on merit and against objective criteria, having due regard for the 
benefits of diversity, including gender. The Chairman and the rest  
of the Board continue to support Lord Davies’ aspiration for female 
board representation, but this presents a particular challenge for  
a small board. At the start of the year, two of the Group’s Board 
directors (28%) were women, above the 25% recommended by the 
Davies Report, though with the resignation of Anne Marie Carrie 
and the appointment of Dr Graham Rich, this number fell to one. 
Further details on the diversity of the workforce of the Group 
generally are set out on page 38. 
Following a review of the Board’s effectiveness, it was considered 
that it would be strengthened by the appointment of a further 
independent director. While not having a specific policy regarding 
the constitution and balance of the Board, potential new directors 
are considered on their own merits with regards to their skills, 
knowledge, experience and credentials. 
Evaluation
This year’s formal evaluation of the performance of the Board, its 
committees and the individual directors was conducted by Lintstock 
Limited, an external facilitator which has no other connection with 
Cambian. The anonymity of all participants was ensured in order  
to promote the open and frank exchange. Details of the procedure 
adopted for the evaluation and the principal conclusions of the 
review are set out on page 42 in the letter from the Chairman that 
introduces the governance report.
Chris Brinsmead, as Senior Independent Director, led a review of 
the Chairman’s performance through private discussions with the 
remaining directors.
Board tenure
In accordance with the articles of association, every new director 
appointed in the year is required to stand for re-election by 
shareholders at the AGM next following their appointment,  
and at each Annual General Meeting any director who shall have 
been a director at each of the two preceding AGMs shall retire. 
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 49
Governance Notwithstanding the provisions of the articles of association, the 
Board has decided to comply with the Code requirements that 
directors of companies in the FTSE 350 Index submit themselves  
for re-election annually. Therefore, all the directors are seeking 
their re-appointment at this year’s AGM.
The Board has collectively agreed that the directors proposed  
for re-election in 2016 have made significant contributions to the 
business since their last re-election and each has a key role to  
play in the formulation of the Group’s future strategy.
Time commitment and training
All directors are aware of the need to allocate sufficient time to the 
Company in order to discharge their responsibilities effectively. The 
Company provides the non-executive directors with appropriate 
support and facilities for the consideration of the Company’s 
strategy and performance, and a dialogue with the Chairman  
is encouraged so that any issues regarding time pressures or 
conflicting commitments are addressed appropriately. The Board 
monitors the extent of directors’ external interests and any conflicts  
on a continuing basis. The letters of appointment for non-executive 
directors set out the time commitment expected to be necessary to 
perform their duties.
During the year the non-executive directors received a  
number of presentations from the executive directors and senior 
management in relation to the business of the Group, including 
presentations on the services provided by the Group. There  
will be a continued focus during 2016 on ensuring that through  
a combination of presentations, teach-ins and site visits, the 
non-executive directors are provided with sufficient information  
for them to understand fully the challenges and opportunities  
in the services provided by the Group. 
The Chairman consults with the directors on their respective 
training and development requirements. The suitability of external 
courses is kept under review by the Company Secretary who is 
charged with facilitating the induction of new directors and with 
assisting in the ongoing training and development of all directors. 
All directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and a procedure is in place for them to  
take independent professional advice at the Company’s  
expense should this be required.
Information and training provided to directors
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring good 
information flows within the Board and its committees and 
between the senior management and the non-executive directors 
and to facilitate the directors in receiving any additional training 
they may require. The Board uses a secure, web-based system 
which provides quick, easy and secure access to Board papers 
and materials. Prior to each Board meeting the directors receive 
through this system the agenda and supporting papers to ensure 
that they have all the latest and relevant information in advance  
of the meeting. After each Board meeting, the Company Secretary 
operates a comprehensive follow-up procedure to ensure that 
actions are completed as agreed by the Board. Directors regularly 
receive additional information from the Company between Board 
meetings, including a monthly Group performance update. Where 
a director was unable to attend a meeting, they were provided 
with all the papers and information relating to that meeting and 
were able to discuss issues arising directly with the Chairman.
Directors’ and officers’ indemnity insurance
The Company recognises that all directors are equally and 
collectively accountable under the law for the proper stewardship  
of the Company’s affairs. The Company maintains a Directors’  
and Officers’ liability insurance policy for the benefit of the 
Company and the directors. 
Relationship with shareholders
The Board is responsible for ensuring that the Company maintains 
a satisfactory dialogue with shareholders. The Chairman and  
the Senior Independent Director are always available to major 
shareholders. Formal trading updates are given to the market 
during the year. Following each of these announcements, 
conference calls are held with shareholders and analysts and  
after the full year and interim results a presentation is made to  
the shareholders and analysts. Analyst research is circulated to  
the Board. A programme of meetings and conference calls is  
also organised at appropriate times during the year at which the  
Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer comment on Company 
performance and respond to any issues raised by investors. 
Members of the Board, and in particular non-executive directors, 
are kept informed of investors’ views in the main through 
distribution of analysts’ and brokers’ briefings. 
The major shareholders of the Company are listed on page 76  
of the Directors’ Report.
 
Relationship Agreement
The Company’s largest shareholder, GI Partners (“GI”) is one of the 
Group’s founders. In accordance with the requirements of the Listing 
Rules, the Company, GI Partners and GI Partners UK Limited entered 
into a relationship agreement on 11 April 2014 (the “Relationship 
Agreement”). The principal purpose of the Relationship Agreement 
is to ensure that the Company and the Group are capable at all 
times of carrying on their business independently of GI Partners  
and certain persons deemed to be connected with it (together the 
“Potential Controlling Shareholders”) and that agreements and 
transactions with GI Partners and/or any Potential Controlling 
Shareholders will be at arm’s length and on normal commercial 
terms. The Relationship Agreement entitles GI Partners to nominate 
one person to be a director of the Company for so long as the 
Potential Controlling Shareholder, controls at least 10% of the voting 
rights attaching to the ordinary shares of the Company. The current 
nominee is Alfred Foglio.

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 50 Under the Relationship Agreement, GI Partners and GI Partners  
UK have agreed (inter alia) that: 
(i) it will vote its shares in such a manner so as to procure  
that each member of the Group is capable of carrying  
on its business independently of the Potential Controlling 
Shareholders;
(ii) it will not exercise any of the voting rights attaching to its 
shares in such a manner so as to procure any amendment  
to the articles of association which would be inconsistent  
with, undermine or breach any of the provisions of the 
Relationship Agreement; 
(iii) it will not take any action which has or would have the effect 
of preventing the Company or any other member of the Group 
from carrying on its business independently of GI Partners or 
any Potential Controlling Shareholders; 
(iv) it will not take any action which has or would have the effect 
of preventing the Company or any other member of the Group 
from complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules;
(v) it will not exercise any of its voting rights with respect to the 
ordinary shares in a manner that would require the Company 
to operate or make decisions solely for the benefit of any 
member of the GI Group; 
(vi) it will not propose or procure the proposal of a resolution of 
the shareholders (or any class thereof) which is intended or 
reasonably appears to be intended to circumvent the proper 
application of the Listing Rules;
(vii) it will not exercise any of its voting right to vary the articles 
which would: (a) be contrary to the maintenance of the 
Company’s independence (including the Company’s ability to 
operate and make decisions independently of the GI Group); 
(b) prevent the election of Independent Directors; or (c) be 
inconsistent with, undermine or breach any provision of this 
Deed or the Listing Rules; and/or
(viii) it will abstain from voting on any resolution: (a) required  
by paragraph 11.1.7R(3) of the Listing Rules to approve a 
transaction with a related party involving GI Partners or any 
Potential Controlling Shareholders; and (b) proposed by the 
Company in respect of the election or appointment of an 
Independent Director (whether or not the same is required  
by the Listing Rules) where the Company shall have given  
GI Partners written notice requiring it to abstain.
As required by the Listing Rules, the Board reviewed the operation 
of the Relationship Agreement at its meeting in December 2015 
and believes that the Company has complied with its obligations 
under the Relationship Agreement and, so far as the Company is 
aware, the independence provisions included in the Relationship 
Agreement have been complied with during the period under 
review by GI Partners or any Potential Controlling Shareholders. 
The Board believes that the provisions of the Relationship 
Agreement and of Rule 11 of the Listing Rules provide reassurance 
that GI Partners and GI Partners UK will not seek to exercise its 
shareholding capriciously and re-enforces the independence of 
the Company.
Details of any related party transactions are set out in note 33 to 
the financial statements on pages 86 to 124 of this document.
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The 2016 Annual General Meeting will be held on 6 June 2016 at 
the Churchill Hospital, Barkham Terrace, Lambeth Road, London, 
SE1 7PW at 12:00 noon. Formal notice of the meeting and details of 
and an explanation for the reasons for the resolutions to be put to 
shareholders, are contained in the separate notice of meeting that 
accompanies this report.
The Board views the Annual General Meeting as an opportunity  
to communicate with investors. All directors are expected to attend 
the Company’s Annual General Meeting and shareholders are 
invited to ask questions during the meeting and to meet directors 
after the formal proceedings have ended. It is intended that, as 
was the case at the previous Annual General Meeting, there shall 
be a poll vote on each resolution at the 2016 Annual General 
Meeting. The audited, final results of the poll votes will be released 
to the London Stock Exchange and published on the Company’s 
website, www.cambiangroup.com, as soon as is practicable  
after the conclusion of the meeting.
Shareholders are encouraged to participate in the Annual  
General Meeting.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 51
Governance Audit & Risk Committee report
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to give you an overview of the operation and scope 
of the Committee and report on our work over the past year.
The 2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
has placed greater emphasis on risk and the responsibility of 
boards for an organisation’s overall approach to risk. In particular, 
boards are required to ensure the design and implementation of 
appropriate risk management and internal control systems that 
identify the risks facing a company and enable the board to make  
a robust assessment of the principal risks.
In the light of this overall responsibility, the Company’s board  
of directors (the “Board”) undertook a review in the second quarter 
of 2015 of the operation of the Company’s Audit Committee and 
the Quality & Risk Committee over the period from the Company’s 
IPO. Following this review, it was decided to combine the 
responsibilities of the two committees under my chairmanship,  
so as to ensure a single point of reference for the monitoring of 
risk, both clinical and commercial, and reporting to the Board.  
At the same time, the Board agreed amended terms of reference 
for the newly constituted Audit & Risk Committee (“Committee”), 
which are available for review on the Company’s website  
www.cambiangroup.com\investors\governance
As set out on page 26, the Board has overall responsibility  
for determining the nature of the risk it is willing to take and 
ensuring that risks are managed effectively across the Group.  
At the Board’s request, the Committee has reviewed the 
Company’s principal risks in the light of the new provisions of  
the Code, covering the assessment of principal risks. The way  
in which the Company manages risk is set out on pages 26 to  
29 with the principal risks facing the Group set out in pages 30 
and 31. We have reviewed the continuing effectiveness of the 
Company’s risk management processes as part of our review  
of the effectiveness of internal controls.
The Committee recognises the paramount importance of the 
quality of care in all our facilities. Reports on care quality and 
related issues are made to each meeting. Considerable progress has 
been made in formalising governance processes for these 
matters up to Board level.
The Committee has a vital role in providing assurance that the 
financial statements provide a true and fair view of the Group’s 
financial affairs. As part of this assurance, we conduct a review  
of any significant financial judgements made during the year and 
any key financial reporting issues. The Committee concluded that 
we are comfortable with the judgements being made on all of 
these issues. More details can be found on page 54 of this report.

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 52 In the light of our profit disappointment in the year, the Committee 
commissioned PwC to undertake a financial review of certain 
aspects of the Group’s cost management. Recognising that cost 
control weaknesses had, in part, contributed to our disappointing 
results, the Committee requested additional financial control 
procedures over the 2015 year end process, including a 
reconciliation of balances with the Group’s major suppliers  
and additional scrutiny of receivables balances.
Having been asked to do so by the Board, we also conducted  
a comprehensive review of the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts 
and confirmed that they are fair, balanced and capable of being 
understood by shareholders and that they include all the 
necessary information to allow our shareholders to assess 
Cambian’s position, performance, business model and strategy. 
We have advised the Board accordingly.
Following a review of the external auditor’s independence and 
effectiveness, the Committee has made a recommendation to  
the Board that the external auditors are reappointed for the year 
ending 31 December 2016. Further information on this review and 
our policy on non-audit fees can be found on page 57 of this report.
During the year I have met, individually and in private, with 
management in order to understand more fully the context  
and challenges of their business operations and thereby  
ensure the Committee’s time was used most effectively.  
I have also visited various parts of the business and met  
informally with a number of members of management below 
Board level to gain a deeper insight into areas relevant to  
the role of the Committee. The activities of the Committee 
members during the year have enabled it to gain a good 
understanding of the culture of the organisation, the risks  
and challenges faced and the adequacy and timeliness  
of the remedial actions being taken to address them.
Alison Halsey
Chair, Audit & Risk Committee
26 April 2016
 
Role of the Committee
The Committee’s principal functions are to monitor the integrity  
of the Group’s financial reports; to assist the Board to monitor the 
Company’s risk management and internal control systems and  
to manage the Board’s relationship with the Group’s outsourced 
internal audit team and its external auditors. The functions of the 
Committee are summarised on page 52. 
The Committee’s terms of reference include all relevant  
matters required by Rule 7.1.3 of the Disclosure and Transparency 
Rules and the Code and are available on the Company’s  
website (www.cambiangroup.com) or on request from the 
Company Secretary.
Committee activities
The Committee met five times during the year (including meetings 
of the Quality & Risk Committee) in February, June, August and 
December. All members of the Committee are non-executive 
directors and all are considered by the Board to be independent. 
Its work included:
• Agreeing a strategic risk register for the Company and a 
framework within which to report on and manage risks within 
the business, which sought to capture both business risks and 
risks arising from the quality of care which Cambian delivers.
• Reviewing the contents of the Company’s strategic risk register, 
including the existing systems and controls that were seen as 
providing mitigations to these risks, and the process by which 
the same was compiled.
• Reviewing amended processes for risk management to monitor 
risk both in relation to care quality and clinical matters as well 
business risk generally, in which the Company has been 
supported by work from PwC as an outsourced internal audit 
function which resulted in the framework described on page 56
• Agreeing on the appointment of PwC as internal auditors to the 
Company and their scope of work in the year under review and 
through into the next financial year;
• The establishment of a new independent whistleblowing 
hotline and whistleblowing policy for the Group to  
replace a hotline provided by the Company’s lawyers 
RadcliffesLeBrasseur. The former hotline was not seen as 
being sufficiently independent and had attracted no use  
in the previous 12 months. The new whistleblowing facility  
is operated by Expolink, a well-established provider of 
confidential whistleblowing facilities and allows both 
employees, service users, care commissioners or parents  
to raise issues either by using a dedicated free telephone  
line or online. This arrangement, which has been piloted in  
our educational division, is being rolled out across the Group’s 
divisions. To increase awareness of how to use the system  
to report an issue, our ‘Whistleblowing Policy and Guidelines’ 
were amended to emphasise support for whistleblowers,  
the system’s confidentiality and ease of use.

Governance and reported their findings to the Committee. The Committee 
was satisfied as a result of the review process that the approach 
taken by the Group in the financial statements was robust.
Value of goodwill & intangible assets
In the light of the Group’s adverse performance against 
expectations in the year, the Committee considered the judgments 
associated with the carrying value of goodwill in the Group’s two 
cash generating units, in particular, the Children’s Services division 
which had experienced poor trading during the year, to determine 
whether there was a risk of material misstatement in carrying 
value and whether an impairment should be recognised. In 
addition, the Committee also considered the judgments made  
in relation to the valuation methodology adopted by management 
to support the carrying value of other intangible assets and the 
investments in subsidiaries, in particular the appropriateness  
of the discount rate applied. The Committee considered the 
assumptions, estimates and judgements made by management 
to support their models that underpin the valuation of intangible 
assets in the balance sheet. The key assumptions applied in the 
calculation relate to the future performance expectations of the 
business unit. Business plans and cash-flow forecasts prepared 
by management supporting the future performance expectations 
used in the valuation were reviewed. In addition, consideration 
was given to independent indicative valuations of the CGU’s 
provided by the Company’s investment bank. The Committee 
received a report on the outcome of the impairment review 
performed by management. The impairment review was also  
an area of focus for the external auditor, who reported its findings 
to the Committee. The Committee satisfied itself that no material 
impairments were required to the carrying value of goodwill. 
Carrying value of property, plant and equipment
In the light of the Group’s trading performance in the year, the 
Committee also considered whether the carrying value of fixed 
assets at loss-making sites could be supported on the basis of a 
comparison of net asset value, value in use or fair value less sale 
cost or whether asset impairments might be required under IAS 
36. The Committee considered management’s assumptions and 
basis of valuation for those assets covered by the review. These 
included valuations, conducted by Knight Frank, of the fair value 
of seven properties in accordance with IFRS 13. The audit plan 
agreed with the external auditors involved a critical evaluation of 
the completeness of management’s impairment review of fixed 
assets. The Committee satisfied itself that the review was robust 
and that an impairment should be made to the carrying value of 
some fixed assets.
• Reviewing the final and interim financial statements and 
matters raised by management and the external auditors. This 
review included consideration of the key judgements applied in 
the preparation of the consolidated financial statements, which 
are described in the relevant accounting policies and detailed in 
the notes to the financial statements on pages 90 to 120.
Details of the attendance at meetings of the Committee is shown 
in the table below:

Significant financial matters
The Committee reviews all significant issues concerning the 
financial statements. The principal matters we considered 
concerning the 2015 financial statements were:
Going concern & viability
The Committee undertook a review, on behalf of the Board, of  
the medium-term and longer-term business plans of the Group  
in order to support the Board’s judgment in relation to the 
preparation of the financial statements on a going concern basis 
and in relation to the viability statement on page 37 . In particular, 
the Committee considered the assumptions that underlay the 
cash-flow forecasts produced by management and tested these 
under a number of differing scenarios. The Committee also 
considered the availability of sources of external finance, if  
required by those forecasts and plans, to support both the 
directors’ going concern statement and the statement on  
longer-term viability set out on page 37 . 
Revenue recognition
The Committee reviewed revenue recognition, in particular  
to assess whether revenue received in advance is correctly 
recognised and accounted for and the overall completeness  
of the balances. Following this review, the Committee have 
concluded that the timing of recognition continues to be in  
line with IFRS requirements and that all material balances  
were captured. The external auditor performed detailed audit 
procedures on revenue recognition, including auditing a sample  
of admissions, reconciling these back to the revenues recorded 
and performing cut-off testing around the year end to ensure 
revenue is recognised in the period to which it relates,

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 54 Exceptional items
The Committee noted that the Group had significant exceptional 
items in the financial year, arising from the cancellation of a 
business change project on which significant non-recurring costs 
had been incurred and also one-off business restructuring costs. 
In addition, the treatment as an exceptional item of the asset 
impairment charge arising from the review of fixed assets was 
noted. The Committee therefore considered that such items 
should be an area of particular scrutiny. The audit plan agreed 
reviewed the one-off items of expense and income to ensure  
they were appropriately classified and were properly considered 
non-recurring and exceptional in nature and the treatment of the 
asset impairment charge. After consideration of the results of this 
review, the Committee was satisfied that any material items of 
non-recurring expense or income were properly classified and 
that the asset impairment charge should appear separately on 
the face of the income statement. Details of these exceptional 
items are disclosed in note 5 on pages 98 and 99. 
Recovery of trade receivables
Given the nature of the Group’s customers, debts are often 
overdue beyond the contractual payment date and the Group  
has a significant level of aged debt. The Committee therefore 
considered the appropriateness of the Group’s policy for 
provision for debts greater than 120 days and the level of risk  
that exists around the recoverability of overdue debts. In the  
light of this review it was agreed to change the policy and 
provision for all debts more than 180 days old and the audit  
plan agreed with the external auditors therefore placed 
emphasis on a detailed review of aged receivables, and 
included an assessment of recoverability from a sample of 
receivables. Following this review, the Committee was satisfied  
that adequate provisions were being made for any potentially 
irrecoverable debtor balances.
Acquisitions
The Group made a number of acquisitions during the year, 
including the acquisition of By the Bridge Holdings Limited and  
its subsidiaries, the acquisition of Interact Care Limited and the 
business and assets of Potterspury Lodge School and Spring  
Hill School. The Committee reviewed the significant judgments 
required in respect of the purchase price allocation process, 
which includes the fair valuation of the assets and liabilities 
acquired, including separately identifying and valuing acquired 
intangible assets to ensure that acquisitions are accounted  
for appropriately in accordance with IFRS 3 (Business 
Combinations). The proper treatment of acquisitions was  
also a focus of review by the external auditor, who reviewed  
the assumptions underpinning the fair value of assets and 
liabilities and the intangible asset valuation. After consideration  
of these matters, the Committee was satisfied that acquisitions 
made during the year had been properly accounted for in the 
financial statements.
Completeness of liabilities
Following the issues experienced by the Group in managing  
its cost base, the auditors conducted an additional review of 
expense and in particular accruals to ensure the completeness 
of the liabilities recorded in the balance sheet. Following this 
review, it was considered that the balance sheet as at 31 
December 2015 properly recorded or made appropriate  
accruals for all known liabilities of the Group.
Other matters
The Group entered into an interest rate swap in relation to a 
portion of the Group’s bank debt in order to minimise volatility  
in the income statement and the Committee reviewed the 
accounting treatment applied in relation to this transaction,  
which was also an area of review by the external auditor.
Review of the 2015 Annual Report
At the request of the Board, the Committee was asked to  
consider whether the 2015 Annual Report was fair, balanced  
and capable of being understood by shareholders. In order  
to arrive at a position where the Committee was satisfied with  
the overall fairness, balance and clarity of the Annual Report,  
a comprehensive review process was followed.
During the course of the Committee’s review, the following 
questions were considered for debate:
• Fairness and balance: Is the Annual Report open and honest? 
Does it report on weaknesses, difficulties and challenges as well 
as successes? Is there consistency between different sections  
of the Annual Report, including between the narrative and the 
financial statements? Does the Annual Report explain our key 
performance indicators (KPIs) and their linkage to strategy?
• Understandable: Does the Annual Report contain simple 
explanations of business models, strategies and accounting 
policies, using precise and clear language? Is the Annual Report 
easy to read; for example, is the narrative broken up by quotes, 
tables, case studies and other graphics? Does the Annual 
Report have a consistent tone across all sections and provide 
clear signposting to where additional information can be found? 
After careful review, the Committee was satisfied that, taken as a 
whole, the Annual Report was fair, balanced and capable of being 
understood by shareholders, and advised the Board accordingly.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 55
Governance The Company’s internal control is based on assessment of risk 
and a framework of control procedures to manage risks and  
to monitor compliance with procedures. The procedures for 
accountability and control are split between operational and 
financial matters. Financial controls are reviewed and their 
effectiveness assessed by the Committee and tested by work 
undertaken by the internal auditors. In particular, given the cost 
control issues that impacted the Company’s performance in the 
year, the internal auditors were commissioned at the end of the 
year to undertake a detailed review of key balance sheet controls.
The Group’s activities expose it to significant operational risks, 
principally medical, clinical and health & safety risks. As described 
on pages 26 to 29, the Group has in place risk management 
systems and protocols in relation to the operational risks facing 
the Group. Cambian’s governance protocols are aimed at ensuring 
consistently high quality care to mitigate these risks. These protocols 
operate at three levels:
• at individual site level through monthly meetings;
• at the executive level through weekly and monthly meetings  
of the executive management committee; and
• at a corporate level through quarterly meetings of Cambian’s 
Governance Committee, which reviews the Group’s 
performance in these areas.
In addition, the Group operates a Quality Management System 
that has gained BS EN ISO 9001: 2008 certification, including 
aspects specific to education, social care for people with autism 
and complex needs, healthcare, residential and day services. 
Through these frameworks, the Group monitors its quality 
performance on a continuing basis and aims to implement 
improvements and changes when determined to be appropriate. 
In the highly regulated environment in which the Company operates, 
procedures are codified in detailed operating procedures and policies 
and these are reinforced by training programmes. These are 
designed to ensure compliance not only with the regulatory 
requirements but also with general principles of integrity and the 
Group’s philosophy that everyone can achieve their personal best.
The Committee has during the year identified and evaluated the 
key risks and has ensured that controls and procedures are in 
place to manage these risks and to improve these processes 
where weaknesses are identified. 
Internal audit
The internal audit function plays an important role in assessing 
the effectiveness of internal controls by a programme of reviews 
based on a continuous assessment of the strategic risk register.  
It is important that the internal audit function is appropriately 
resourced with the skills and experience relevant to the operations 
of the Group, and is supported by specialist resources where 
required. Given the importance of the internal audit function and 
the resources required and the fact that at the start of the financial 
year the Company had only recently completed its IPO, the Board 
determined to appoint an external firm as internal auditor 
responsible for reviewing, reporting and monitoring improvements 
in internal control performance across its operations. Following  
a review process, involving the Chair of the Committee and  
the Group’s Chief Finance Officer, it was agreed to appoint 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”) to carry-out the function  
of internal audit for the Group. 
Following their appointment, PwC worked with the Company to 
review the principal strategic risks facing the Group, following 
which it agreed an initial programme of work with the Committee 
that was designed to provide assurance in the key areas of risk to 
the business, as well as in the areas of core financial and internal 
control, and where there are regulatory or legal requirements.  
A key focus of internal audit activity in 2015 has been on providing 
assurance on key financial control activities. 
The system of internal controls and audit is designed to ensure 
legal and regulatory compliance and manage, rather than 
eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.  
It can therefore only provide reasonable and not absolute 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. 
Internal control & risk management
The Company has in place internal controls in relation to the 
Company’s financial reporting process and the Group’s process  
for preparation of consolidated accounts. These systems include 
policies and procedures that: pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect 
transactions and dispositions of assets; provide reasonable 
assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to  
permit the preparation of financial statements in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’); require 
representatives of the businesses to certify that their reported 
information gives a true and fair view of the state of affairs of  
the business and its results for the period; and review and 
reconcile reported data. The Committee is responsible for 
monitoring these internal control and risk management systems. 
Audit & Risk Committee report

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 56 External audit
The Committee manages the relationship with the external  
auditor (currently, Deloitte LLP (“Deloitte”)) on behalf of the Board. 
This includes assessing the independence of the external auditor, 
conducting annual evaluations of the external auditor and 
providing final recommendations to the Board on their reappointment, 
remuneration and the level of non-audit fees paid to the auditors.
Auditor’s independence
The Board undertakes a formal assessment of the auditor’s 
independence each year, which includes:
• A review of non-audit related services provided to the  
Company and related fees;
• Discussion with the auditor of a written report detailing all 
relationships with the Company and any other parties which 
could affect independence or the perception of independence;
• A review of the auditor’s own procedures for ensuring 
independence of the audit firm and partners and staff involved 
in the audit, including the rotation of the audit partner;
• Obtaining written confirmation from the auditors that they  
are independent; and
• A review of fees paid to the auditors in respect of audit and 
non-audit services.
Non-audit work undertaken
Cambian follows a pre-approval policy for the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditor. Other accounting  
firms were used for larger, non-audit services, including taxation 
and consultancy advice. Details of services provided by the auditor 
and its associates are included in note 6 on page 99. The focus  
of the policy is to ensure that the independence of the external 
auditor is not compromised and, where possible and appropriate, 
other accounting firms are used. During 2015, the external auditor 
conducted engagements for the provision of non-audit services, 
relating to due diligence in relation to the acquisition of By the 
Bridge Limited, a review of pension payments and a capital 
allowances review totalling £178,000, approximately 29%  
of the audit fee.
The Committee has monitored the development of EU legislation 
in respect of auditors and audit reporting, and in particular the 
provisions of EU Regulation No.537/2014 which will introduce  
(from 2020) a cap on fees for certain non-audit services at 70%  
of the external audit fee, as well as a prohibition on the provision 
of certain non-audit services by the incumbent external auditor. 
The Committee will ensure that the Group will comply with these 
provisions and that the policy on non-audit services will be 
reviewed in line with the Regulation. 
Deloitte was selected to undertake these tasks due to its familiarity 
with the Cambian business and the industry. In order to maintain 
independence and objectivity, Deloitte undertook its standard 
independence procedures in relation to those engagements. 
Auditor’s effectiveness
Deloitte LLP was re-appointed as the auditor at the Annual General 
Meeting in April 2015. The firm was appointed auditor when the 
Company was incorporated as it had acted as auditor to all of  
the companies that were brought together to form the Group 
immediately prior to the initial public offer in April 2014 and so had 
extensive knowledge of the business. Continuity and consistency  
of audit quality are important and the Committee has no current 
intention to initiate an audit re-tendering process. Going forward, 
the Committee will consider a formal tender process in accordance 
with the provisions of the Code. The Committee will comply with the 
Competition & Markets Authority order relating to the statutory audit 
market for FTSE 350 companies, as applicable.
The Committee has adopted a formal framework for the review 
and assess the effectiveness of the external audit process and 
audit quality, which includes the following aspects:
• Assessment of the engagement partner, other partners and 
members of the audit team;
• Audit approach and scope, including clarification of  
audit risk areas;
• Execution of the audit;
• Interaction with management;
• Communication with and support to the Audit Committee; 
• Insights, management letter points and reporting; and
• Independence, objectivity and scepticism.
The Committee assesses the effectiveness of the management  
of the external audit process by considering timely identification 
and resolution of areas of accounting judgment, the quality and 
timeliness of papers reporting to the Committee on these matters 
and the quality of any other documents provided to the Committee 
during the external audit process.

Governance Nomination Committee report
The Nomination Committee comprises Christopher Kemball 
(Chairman), and all of the independent non-executive directors  
in office at the date of this report. Alfred Foglio is entitled to  
attend meetings of the Committee as an observer. Details of the 
Chairman’s other significant commitments are set out on page 44.
 
The Nomination Committee meets at least once a year and on  
an as needed basis and members’ attendance is set out in the 
table opposite. 
The Nomination Committee reviews the structure, size and 
composition of the Board and its committees and makes 
recommendations with regard to any changes considered 
necessary in the identification and nomination of new directors,  
the reappointment of existing directors and appointment of 
members to the Board’s committees. It also assesses the roles  
of the existing directors in office to ensure that there continues to  
be a balanced Board in terms of skills, knowledge, experience and 
diversity. The Nomination Committee reviews the senior leadership 
needs of the Group to enable it to compete effectively in the 
marketplace. The Nomination Committee also advises the Board  
on succession planning for executive director appointments 
although the Board itself is responsible for succession generally.
The Nomination Committee seeks to ensure that all Board 
appointments are made on merit and measured against objective 
criteria and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the 
Board. The Board is committed to ensuring a broad mix of gender, 
age, nationality, experience and skills throughout the business. The 
composition of the Board itself is based on a range and balance of 
skills, knowledge, experience and merit and remains appropriate 
for a business of its size. The Nomination Committee ensures that 
diversity is an important consideration and part of the selective 
criteria used to assess candidates to achieve a balanced Board.
The Nomination Committee met twice in 2015. The first meeting 
considered the appointment of an Independent Non-executive  
Director from a list of candidates drawn up following an 
independent recruitment process run by Egon Zehnder.  
This meeting resulted in the recommendation to the Board  
to appoint Dr Graham Rich.
The other meeting during the year focused on consideration of 
results of the independent evaluation of the performance of the 
Board conducted by Lintstock and on the continued applicability  
of the Committee’s terms of reference, which were considered  
to continue to be appropriate for the Company.

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 58 Chris Brinsmead, CBE
Chair of the Remuneration 
Committee
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our remuneration report for the financial 
year ended 31st December 2015.
At the 2015 Annual General Meeting, the shareholders voted  
by a majority of 85% of the votes cast to approve the directors’ 
remuneration policy as set out in the directors’ remuneration report 
contained in the Cambian 2014 Annual Report and Accounts.
That policy was an evolution of the remuneration framework 
adopted at the Company’s IPO in 2014, involving some 
amendments to ensure good corporate governance and to  
ensure the policy remained appropriate, given the transition  
from a private company to a listed company. These changes 
included increasing the deferral period from options granted 
under the Cambian Group Annual Share Option Plan (“AOP”)  
to a period of three years, introducing malus and clawback 
provisions and a shareholding requirement for executive  
directors and making minor changes to basic salary and  
pension provision to better reflect the market. 
As part of the shareholder consultation process we undertook  
last year, I explained to shareholders that the remuneration policy 
put forward reflected transitional arrangements as we evolved 
into a listed entity. As planned, the Committee and I have worked 
extensively during 2015 to review the policy and create a structure 
that is more appropriate for both our executives in supporting our 
business strategy and which genuinely reflects the experience of 
our shareholders.
As a result of this review, the Committee is now putting forward  
a revised policy, which reflects the shareholder feedback we 
received last year, for shareholders to approve at the Cambian 
2016 Annual General Meeting (“2016 AGM”). 
New proposed directors’ remuneration policy
Key changes to the proposed policy are summarised below:
• Reduction of the annual bonus opportunity for the Chief 
Executive Officer (CEO) to a maximum of 150% of base salary, 
payable in cash, though the Committee has a discretion for  
part to be deferred into options under the AOP. The annual 
bonus opportunity of the Chief Financial Officer has remained 
unchanged. The annual bonus will be determined by 
performance against a mix of financial and operational targets 
and at least half the bonus will be dependent on achievement  
of the financial target, with the requirement for a threshold 
achievement against the financial target being necessary 
before any payment can be made under the plan, whether  
or not the other targets have been met. For 2016, 40% of the 
maximum bonus will be payable for on-target performance;
The Board has delegated formation of its 
policy for the remuneration of the directors 
and senior management to the Remuneration 
Committee (the “Committee”), which also has 
oversight over the Group’s share plans.

Directors’ remuneration report
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 59
Governance • Introduction of a long-term incentive plan representing up to 100% 
of base salary in order to re-balance the package to reward the 
long-term performance of Cambian. The awards will vest subject 
to achievement of a mixture of financial performance measures: 
growth in adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and growth in the 
return on invested capital (ROIC) measured over a three year 
performance period. The Committee considers these measures 
to be key metrics used by investors to determine the performance 
of their investments and so are considered to provide good 
alignment with the long-term interests of shareholders.
Company performance in the 2015 financial year
• Successful acquisition of By the Bridge Limited, significantly 
increasing the scale of the Group’s fostering business;
• The opening of a total of 321 net new places in the Group’s 
facilities, representing a significant increase in the rate of 
organic growth;
• Disappointing margin performance, resulting in an overall  
drop in Adjusted EBITDA, reflected by no bonus being payable  
to the executive directors.
Key activities of the Committee
The Committee’s key activities during the 2015 financial year were:
Consulting with shareholders with respect to the first Company 
remuneration policy as a listed company;
Drafting the Company’s first directors’ remuneration report  
as a listed company;
Formulation of a revised remuneration policy for the executive directors;
Approval of an SAYE plan for extending wider share ownership among 
Cambian employees.
As announced in early November last year, Andrew Griffith  
will be leaving the Company after the preliminary announcement  
of results. 
Notes 
This report has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 as amended in 2013 and the 
provisions of the 2014 Corporate Governance Code and the Listing Rules.
Directors’ remuneration report

Encouraging share ownership
The Committee feel that it is important to offer an opportunity to  
all employees to participate in the Company, so as to increase 
employee engagement and enhance retention. As described  
above, the Committee agreed to the introduction of the Cambian  
2016 Sharesave Plan (“Sharesave Plan”), subject to shareholder 
approval, for offering to the wider employee base of the Company. 
The report that follows consists of three sections: 
• an ‘At a glance’ summary on pages 61 and 62; 
• a policy report on pages 62 to 71 setting out the proposed 
amended Directors’ Remuneration Policy for all directors  
of Cambian, subject to a binding shareholder  
vote at our 2016 AGM; and 
• an annual report on remuneration, detailing how our directors 
were paid during 2015 and how the Policy will be applied in 
2016, on pages 71 to 74. This section will be subject to an 
advisory vote of shareholders at our 2016 AGM.
As a Committee, we work hard to ensure that the executive 
remuneration structure supports the Company’s strategy and 
aligns with the long-term interests of shareholders. We take an 
active interest in your views and hope to receive your support 
again at the AGM, where I will be available to respond to any 
questions which shareholders may have on this report or in 
relation to any of the Committee’s activities.

Introduction
In this section, we summarise the purpose of our proposed remuneration policy, its linkage to our corporate strategic objectives and  
we highlight the performance and remuneration outcomes for the 2015 financial year. More detail can be found in the annual report  
on remuneration of which this section forms a part.
Our principles of remuneration
The Company’s remuneration strategy is to provide remuneration packages that:
• Attract, motivate and retain high performing employees;
• Encourage and support a strong care and service culture;
• Reward the achievement of the overall business objectives of the Company;
• Align employees’ interests with those of shareholders; and
• Are consistent with the Company’s risk policies and systems.
Consistent with this remuneration strategy, the Committee has agreed a remuneration package for the management team, whereby:
• Performance-related pay will form a significant part of remuneration packages; 
• There will be an appropriate balance between short and longer-term performance targets linked to delivery of the Group’s objectives; and
• In the event of a serious failure in the quality of care provided by the Group, or a failure to achieve threshold financial performance, 
this would act as an override to prevent payment of any bonus that might otherwise be payable in respect of that year.

Composition and terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee 
The Board has delegated to the Committee, under agreed terms of reference, responsibility for the remuneration policy and for 
determining specific packages for the executive directors, the Chairman and other members of the executive management team.  
The Company consults with key shareholders in respect of remuneration policy and the introduction of new incentive arrangements.  
The terms of reference for the Committee are available on the Company’s website, www.cambiangroup.com/investors, and from  
the Company Secretary at the registered office. 
All members of the Committee are independent non-executive directors. The Committee received assistance from the Group HR  
Director and Company Secretary, who attended meetings by invitation, except when issues relating to their own remuneration were  
being discussed. Alfred Foglio, the representative of GI Partners, the Company’s largest shareholder, and the CEO also attended  
by invitation on occasions. The Committee met three times during the financial year. Meeting attendance is shown on page 59  
of this report. 
Advisers to the Remuneration Committee 
The Committee has engaged the services of PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as independent remuneration adviser and they 
attended meetings of the Committee by invitation. 
During the financial year, PwC advised the Committee on all aspects of remuneration policy for executive directors and members  
of the executive management committee PwC also provided advice to the Company in relation to the drafting and implementation  
of executive and employee incentives.
The Committee is satisfied that the advice received was objective and independent. PwC is a member of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group and the voluntary code of conduct of that body is designed to ensure objective and independent advice  
is given to remuneration committees.

Remuneration policy
Introduction
In accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 (as amended) the directors’ remuneration policy (the ‘Policy’) as set out 
below will become formally effective at the Annual General Meeting on 6 June 2016 and will apply for the period of three years from the 
date of approval. This policy, if approved, will replace the Directors’ Remuneration Policy approved by shareholders at the Company’s 
last annual general meeting.
Policy summary
The Committee determines the Policy for the executive directors, Chairman and other senior executives for current and future years and 
this is reviewed on an annual basis. The Policy is designed to support the strategic objectives of the Company and to allow the business 
to attract, retain and motivate the quality of senior management needed to shape and execute strategy and deliver shareholder value. 
The Policy aims to align the interests of the executive directors, senior management and employees to the interests of shareholders  
and aims to support a high performance culture with appropriate reward for superior performance without creating incentives that  
will encourage excessive risk taking or unsustainable Company performance. The Committee is satisfied that the design of the Policy 
promotes the long-term success of the Company.
The Committee considers that a successful Policy needs to be sufficiently flexible to take account of future changes in the Company’s 
business environment and in remuneration practice. 
Directors’ remuneration report
continued
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 62 The Policy is designed around the following key requirements to:
• Attract, motivate and retain high performing employees;
• Encourage and support a strong care and service culture;
• Reward the achievement of the overall business objectives of the Company;
• Align employees’ interests with those of shareholders; and
• Be consistent with the Company’s risk policies and systems.
The Committee will review annually the remuneration arrangements for the executive directors and key senior management drawing 
on trends and adjustments made to all employees across the Group and taking into consideration:
• Business strategy over the period;
• Overall corporate performance;
• Market conditions affecting the Company;
• Changing practice in the markets where the Company compete for talent; and 
• Changing views of institutional shareholders and their representative bodies.
UK Corporate Governance Code
The Committee is comfortable that the proposed Policy is in line with the 2014 revised version of the UK Corporate Governance Code 
which applies to the Company in 2016. The following table sets out the key elements of the revised Code and how the Policy is in line 
with the revised Code:
Code provision Company remuneration policy
A significant proportion of executive directors’ remuneration should  
be structured so as to link rewards to corporate and individual 
performance designed to promote the long-term success of the 
company (Provision D.1)
The Policy introduces a long-term incentive plan that would deliver 
vesting of awards worth up to 100% of salary on grant, if performance 
over a three year measurement period meets stretching financial 
performance targets.
Schemes should include provisions that would enable the Company to 
recover sums paid or withhold the payment of any sum, and specify the 
circumstances in which it would be appropriate to do so (Provision D.1.1).
The Policy contains malus and clawback provisions for both Annual 
Bonus and LTIP awards. 
For share-based remuneration, the remuneration committee should 
consider requiring directors to hold a minimum number of shares and 
to hold shares for a further period after vesting or exercise, including for 
a period after leaving the company, subject to the need to finance any 
costs of acquisition and associated tax liabilities.
Minimum shareholding requirements of 200% of salary for the CEO  
and 150% of salary for the CFO to be built up over a period of five years 
from the date of the IPO or joining if later.
The Committee does not currently believe that with the existing 
shareholding requirement that additional holding periods are required. 
However, the Committee will consider this position on an annual basis.
Discretion
The Committee has discretion in several areas of Policy as set out in this report. The Committee may also exercise operational and 
administrative discretions under relevant option plan rules as set out in those rules. In addition, the Committee has the discretion to 
amend the Policy with regard to minor or administrative matters where it would be, in the opinion of the Committee, disproportionate  
to seek or await shareholder approval.
It is the Committee’s intention that commitments made in line with its policies prior to the date of the 2016 AGM will be honoured,  
even if satisfaction of such commitments is made post the AGM and may be inconsistent with the remuneration policies set out below.
Differences in policy from the wider employee population
The Company aims to provide a remuneration package for all employees that is market competitive and operates the same core 
structure as for the executive directors. The Company operates variable pay plans for all executive directors and senior managers,  
with pension provisions provided for all executives and employees.

Salary
Policy 
Provides a base level of remuneration  
to support recruitment and retention of 
executive directors with the necessary 
experience and expertise to deliver the 
Group’s strategy.
An executive director’s basic salary is set on appointment and reviewed annually  
or when there is a change in position or responsibility.
When determining an appropriate level of salary, the Committee considers:
• remuneration practices within the Company;
• the performance of the individual executive director;
• the individual executive director’s experience and responsibilities; 
• the general performance of the Company;
•  salaries within the ranges paid by the companies in the comparator group  
used for remuneration benchmarking;
• the economic environment.
Individuals who are recruited or promoted to the Board may, on occasion, have 
their salaries set below the targeted policy level until they become established in 
their role. In such cases subsequent increases in salary may be higher than the 
average until the target positioning is achieved.
When determining pay, the comparator group 
used comprises listed companies of a comparable 
market capitalisation to the Company and 
excludes any financial services and oil and gas 
companies. The Committee intends to review the 
list of companies each year and may add or 
remove companies from the group as it considers 
appropriate. Any changes to the comparator group 
will be disclosed in the part of the report setting  
out the operation of the Policy for the future year.
In general, salary rises to executive directors will 
be in line with the rise to all other employees.
The Company will set out in the section headed 
”Implementation of remuneration policy” in the 
following financial year the salaries for that year 
for each of the executive directors (see page 74).

Benefits
Policy 
Provides a benefits package in line with 
standard market practice relative to its 
comparator group to enable the Company 
to recruit and retain executive directors  
with the experience and expertise to  
deliver the Company’s strategy.
The executive directors receive family private health cover, death in service  
life assurance, permanent health insurance and subsistence expenses.  
In addition, the CEO may take part in a car leasing programme and the CFO 
receives a car allowance.
The Committee recognises the need to maintain suitable flexibility in the 
determination of benefits that ensure it is able to support the objective of attracting 
and retaining personnel. Accordingly, the Committee would expect to be able  
to adopt benefits such as relocation expenses, tax equalisation and support in 
meeting specific costs incurred by directors to ensure the Company and the 
individuals comply with their obligations in the reporting of remuneration.
The maximum will be set at the cost of providing the benefits described.

Pensions
Policy 
Provides a standard UK market level of 
retirement funding to enable the Company  
to recruit and retain executive directors  
with the experience and expertise to  
deliver the Company’s strategy.
Employee retirement funding is determined as a percentage of gross basic 
salary, up to a maximum limit of 15%. This may be provided in the form of a 
salary supplement, which would not itself be pensionable or form part of salary  
for the purposes of determining the extent of participation in the Company’s 
incentive arrangements.

Annual Bonus 
Plan
Policy 
The Annual Bonus Plan provides a 
significant incentive to the executive 
directors linked to achievement in  
delivering goals that are closely aligned  
with the Company’s strategy and the 
creation of value for shareholders. 
In particular, the Plan supports the 
Company’s objectives allowing the  
setting of annual targets based on the 
businesses’ strategic objectives at that  
time, meaning that a wider range of 
performance metrics can be used  
that are relevant and achievable.
The Committee will determine the maximum annual participation in the Annual 
Bonus Plan for each year, which will not exceed 150% of salary for the CEO and 
100% of salary for other executive directors.
The Company will set out in the section headed “Implementation of Remuneration 
Policy” in the following financial year, the nature of the targets and their weighting 
for each year (see page 74).
Details of the performance conditions, targets and their level of satisfaction for the 
year being reported on will be set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
The maximum bonus opportunity is 150%  
of salary for the CEO and 100% of salary for  
other executive directors. 
Up to 60% of the maximum bonus will be 
payable for on target performance.
The Annual Bonus Plan is based on a mix of financial and care quality conditions and is measured 
over a period of one financial year. The financial measures will account for no less than 50% of the 
bonus opportunity. Payment under the Annual Bonus Plan is conditional upon achievement of the 
threshold performance of the financial target and there being no regulatory enforced closure of any 
of the Group’s facilities. 
The Committee retains discretion in exceptional circumstances to change performance measures 
and targets and the weightings attached to performance measures part-way through a 
performance year if there is a significant and material event which causes the Committee to 
believe the original measures, weightings and targets are no longer appropriate. Discretion  
may also be exercised in cases where the Committee believe that the bonus outcome is not  
a fair and accurate reflection of business performance.
The Committee is of the opinion that given the commercial sensitivity arising in relation to the 
detailed financial targets used for the annual bonus, disclosing precise targets for the bonus  
plan in advance would not be in shareholder interests. Actual targets, performance achieved  
and awards made will be published at the end of the performance periods so shareholders  
can fully assess the basis for any pay-outs under the annual bonus.
The annual bonus contains both malus and clawback provisions.

Awards are granted annually to executive directors in the form of conditional 
share awards or nil cost options. These will vest at the end of a three year  
period, subject to:
• continued employment at the time of vesting; and
• satisfaction of the performance conditions.
The performance conditions for awards are currently equally weighted between 
EPS growth and ROIC. The Committee retains the discretion to subject the LTIP

The maximum award for the CEO and  
other executive directors is equal to 100%  
of base salary. 
Vesting of awards under the LTIP will be dependent on the achievement of purely financial 
metrics over a three year measurement period.
The performance conditions for awards are currently split equally between growth in adjusted 
earnings per share and growth in adjusted return on invested capital. These measures are 
considered to be the key metrics used by investors to determine the performance of their 
investments and so are considered to provide good alignment with the long-term interests

Recruitment policy
The Company’s approach is that the remuneration of any newly recruited executive director will be assessed in line with the  
same principles applying to the executive directors, as set out in the remuneration policy table above. The Committee’s approach  
to recruitment remuneration is to pay no more than is necessary to attract candidates of the appropriate calibre and experience  
needed for the role from the market in which the Company competes.
The Committee is mindful that it wishes to avoid paying more than it considers necessary to secure the preferred candidate and will 
have regard to guidelines and shareholder sentiment regarding one-off or enhanced short-term or long-term incentive payments  
made on recruitment and the appropriateness of any performance measures associated with an award.
The Company’s detailed policy when setting remuneration for the appointment of new directors is summarised in the table below:
Remuneration element Recruitment policy 
Salary Salary will be set in line with the policy for existing executive directors.
Benefits The standard benefit package for existing executive directors will apply.
Pension The maximum employer contribution will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing directors.
Annual Bonus and Annual 
Share Option Plan
Maximum annual participation will be set in line with the Company’s policy for existing directors and will not 
exceed 150% of salary.
LTIP Any award of long-term incentives will be in line with the Company’s policy for existing directors and will not 
exceed 100% of salary. 
Maximum variable pay 
(incentive opportunity)
In the year of recruitment the maximum variable pay will be 250% of salary (400% if maximum sign-on 
compensation is provided).
Sign-on compensation The Committee’s policy is not to provide sign-on compensation.
However, in exceptional circumstances where the Committee decides to provide this type of compensation  
it will endeavour to provide the compensation in equity, subject to a holding period during which cessation  
of employment will generally result in forfeiture and subject to the satisfaction of performance targets.  
The maximum value of this one-off compensation will be proportionate to the overall remuneration offered  
by the Company and in all circumstances is limited to 150% of salary.
“Buy Out” of incentives 
forfeited on cessation  
of employment
The Committee’s policy is not to provide buy outs as a matter of course.
However, should the Committee determine that the individual circumstances of recruitment justified the 
provision of a buy-out, the equivalent value of any incentives that will be forfeited on cessation of a director’s 
previous employment will be calculated taking into account the following:
• the proportion of the performance period completed on the date of the director’s cessation of employment;
•  the performance conditions attached to the vesting of these incentives and the likelihood of them being 
satisfied; and 
•     any other terms and condition having a material effect on their value (“lapsed value”).
The Committee may then grant up to the same value as the lapsed value, where possible, under the Company’s 
incentive plans. To the extent that it was not possible or practical to provide the buyout within the terms of the 
Company’s existing incentive plans, a bespoke arrangement would be used.
Where an existing employee is promoted to the Board, the policy set out above would apply from the date of promotion but there would be 
no retrospective application of the policy in relation to subsisting incentive awards or remuneration arrangements. Accordingly, prevailing 
elements of the remuneration package for an existing employee would be honoured and form part of the ongoing remuneration of the 
person concerned. These would be disclosed to shareholders in the remuneration report for the relevant financial year.
The Company’s policy when setting fees for the appointment of new non-executive directors is to apply the policy which applies to current 
non-executive directors.
Service agreements and letters of appointment
Each of the executive directors’ service agreements is for a rolling term and may be terminated by the Company or the executive director 
by giving 6 months’ notice.
The Committee’s policy for setting notice periods is that a 6 month period will apply for executive directors. The Committee may,  
in exceptional circumstances arising on recruitment, allow a longer period, which would in any event reduce to 6 months following  
the first year of employment.

Governance Payment for loss of office
The Committee will honour executive directors’ contractual entitlements. Service contracts do not contain liquidated damages clauses.  
If a contract is to be terminated, the Committee will determine such mitigation as it considers fair and reasonable in each case. There are 
no contractual arrangements that would guarantee a pension with limited or no abatement on severance or early retirement. There is no 
agreement between the Company and its executive directors or employees providing for compensation for loss of office or employment 
that occurs because of a takeover bid. The Committee reserves the right to make additional payments where such payments are made 
in good faith in discharge of an existing legal obligation (or by way of damages for breach of such an obligation); or by way of settlement 
or compromise of any claim arising in connection with the termination of an executive director’s office or employment.
Non-executive directors would be paid in accordance with their entitlement as set out in their letter of appointment on loss of office,  
other than in the circumstances where they were not re-elected at the AGM.
When determining any loss of office payment for a departing individual the Remuneration Committee will always seek to minimise cost 
to the Company whilst seeking to address the circumstances at the time. 
Remuneration element Treatment on exit
Salary Salary will be paid over the notice period. The Company has discretion to make a lump sum payment on termination 
equal to their basic salary payable during the notice period. In all cases the Company will seek to mitigate any 
payments due.
Benefits Benefits will normally be provided over the notice period. The Company has discretion to make a lump sum payment  
on termination equal to the value of the benefits payable during the notice period. In all cases the Company will seek  
to mitigate any payments due.
Pension Company pension contributions will normally be provided over the notice period. The Company has discretion to make 
a lump sum payment on termination equal to the value of the Company pension contributions during the notice period. 
In all cases the Company will seek to mitigate any payments due.
Annual Bonus Plan Good leaver reason Other reason
Subject to the Committee exercising its discretion, may be 
pro-rated to time and performance for year of cessation.
No bonus payable for year of cessation.
Annual Option Plan Good leaver reason Other reason
Unvested options exercised in full. Any unexercised option shall lapse.
Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP)
Good leaver reason Other reason
For good leavers, unvested awards will vest on the usual 
vesting date but pro-rated for time served (subject to the 
Committee’s discretion) and if the performance conditions have 
been achieved as assessed by the Committee, the Committee 
may, at its discretion, bring forward the vesting date for a good 
leaver, in which case the performance conditions would be 
assessed at that point.
All unvested and unexercised awards shall lapse.
A good leaver reason is defined as cessation for a reason other than the following:
• resignation (save in circumstances in which the participant successfully claims constructive dismissal); or
• dishonesty, fraud, gross misconduct or any other circumstances justifying summary dismissal.

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 70 Change of control
The Committee’s policy on the vesting of incentives on a change of control is summarised below:
Name of incentive plan Change of control Discretion
Annual Bonus Plan Pro-rated to time and performance to the date of the 
change of control.
The Committee has discretion to continue the operation  
of the Plan to the end of the bonus year.
Annual Option Plan All outstanding options shall be exercised in full.
LTIP Vested options may be exercised and unvested  
options will be pro-rated to time and performance.
The Committee retains an absolute discretion regarding 
the proportion vesting, taking into account time and 
performance. There is a presumption that the Committee 
will pro-rate to time. The Committee will only waive 
pro-rating in exceptional circumstances where it views  
the change of control as an event that has provided  
a material enhanced value to shareholders. In all  
cases the performance conditions must be satisfied.
Statement of conditions elsewhere in the Company
While the Company does not directly consult with employees as part of the process of reviewing executive pay and formulating 
remuneration policy set out in this report, the Company does receive updates from the executive directors on their discussions  
and reviews with senior management and employees.
The Company does not use remuneration comparison measurements.
Consideration of shareholder views
The Committee takes the views of the shareholders seriously and these views are taken into account in shaping remuneration policy 
and practice. Shareholder views are considered when evaluating and setting remuneration strategy and the Committee commits to 
consulting with key shareholders prior to any significant changes to its remuneration policy.

Additional information regarding single figure table (audited)
The Committee considers that performance conditions for all incentives are suitably demanding, having regard to the business strategy, 
shareholder expectations, the markets in which the Group operates and external advice. To the extent that any performance condition  
is not met, the relevant part of the award will lapse. There is no retesting of performance. 
Bonus awards
In respect of the 2015 financial year, the financial targets that underpin the performance targets for the payment of bonus, which was  
the achievement of Adjusted EBITDA of not less than £58m, were not met. Therefore no bonus was payable to the executive directors  
in respect of 2015.
Long-term incentives awarded in 2015 (audited)

Comparison of overall performance and pay (TSR Graph)
The graph below shows the value of £100 invested in the 
Company’s shares since listing compared to the FTSE All Share 
index. The graph shows the Total Shareholder Return generated  
by both the movement in share value and the reinvestment over  
the same period of dividend income. The Committee considers  
that the FTSE All Share index is the appropriate index because the 
Company has been a member of this since listing. This graph has 
been calculated in accordance with Regulations. It should be noted 
that the Company listed in April 2014 and therefore only has a listed 
share price for the period of 11 April 2014 to 31 December 2015.
Chief Executive historic remuneration
The table below sets out the total remuneration delivered to the 
Chief Executive Officer over the last three years valued using the 
methodology applied to the single total figure of remuneration. 
The Committee does not believe that the remuneration payable  
in its earlier years as a private company bears any comparative 
value to that paid in its later years and therefore the Committee 
has chosen to disclose remuneration only for the three most 
recent financial years:

Change in Chief Executive’s remuneration compared  
with employees
The following table sets out the change in the remuneration paid 
to the Chief Executive from 2014 to 2015 compared with the 
average percentage change for employees. 
The Chief Executive’s remuneration disclosed in the table below 
has been calculated to take into account base salary, taxable 
benefits, excluding his allowance in lieu of pension, and annual 
bonus (including any amount deferred). The employee pay (on 
which the average percentage change is based) is calculated 
using the increase in the earnings of all employees (including 
part-time and casual staff) using P60 and P11d data from tax years 
2014 and 2015. Part time employees have been excluded from the 
analysis. The employee analysis is done on a matched basis, that 
is the same individuals appear in the 2014 and 2015 populations.

Benefits and pension
No changes are proposed to benefits or pension.
Executive Directors are now eligible to participate in the 
Company’s defined contribution plan or receive a salary 
supplement equivalent to 15% of base salary.
Annual Bonus Plan
It is intended that the executive directors will be able to earn  
an annual bonus, dependent on achievement of a threshold 
performance of 95% of budgeted Adjusted EBITDA and none of  
the Company’s facilities being closed due to regulatory action. It  
is considered that the disclosure of the targets to be commercially 
sensitive. The Company will disclose performance against target 
in full in next year’s Annual Report on Remuneration. The metrics 
chosen, weighting of the bonus target and proposed payout 
based on threshold, target and maximum performance are  
set out below (malus and clawback provisions apply):

Long Term Incentive Plan
It is intended that an award of nil-cost options will be made under 
the LTIP to the CEO and to the replacement CFO representing a 
maximum of 100% of base salary. Any awards will vest in 2019,  
if performance conditions measured over a three year period 
ending 31 December 2018 have been met. Performance  
conditions for 2016 awards are equally weighted between
 
• Growth in adjusted earnings per share; and 
• Improvement in return on invested capital.
Precise targets for each of the LTIP performance measures will be 
set out to shareholders in due course and will be disclosed in next 
year’s Annual Report. Malus and clawback provisions will apply.

the existing Board, but the total number of directors shall not exceed 
any maximum number fixed in accordance with the articles of 
association. Any director so appointed shall hold office only until

before the expiration of his period of office and may (subject to  
the articles) by ordinary resolution, appoint another person who  
is willing to act in his place.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 76 While any shares are held by the EBT it will refrain from exercising 
any voting rights unless the Company otherwise directs and is not 
obliged to exercise such voting rights in a manner requested by the 
employee beneficiaries. The EBT has agreed to waive dividends in 
respect of any shares held in the EBT unless and to the extent 
otherwise directed by the Company.
Rights attaching to shares under the articles of association 
The Company’s articles of association do not contain any specific 
restrictions on the size of a shareholder’s holding.
Voting rights
Subject to any special rights or restrictions as to voting attached  
to any shares by or in accordance with the articles of association, 
on a show of hands every member who is present in person  
or by proxy and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every 
member who is present in person or by proxy and entitled to  
vote has one vote for every share of which he is the holder.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall, unless the Board otherwise determines, be 
entitled to vote at a general meeting or at any separate meeting  
of the holders of any class of shares, either in person or by proxy, 
in respect of any share held by him or to exercise any right as a 
member unless all calls or other sums presently payable by him in 
respect of that share have been paid to the Company. In addition, 
any member (or other person appearing to be interested in the 
shares (a “third party”), who having been served with a notice 
under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006 by the Company 
requiring such member to disclose to the Board in writing within 
such reasonable period as may be specified in such notice, details 
of any past or present beneficial interest of such member or any 
such third party in the shares or any other interest of any kind 
whatsoever which a member or third party may have in the 
shares and the identity of the person having or having had any 
such interest, fails to do so may be disenfranchised by service  
of a notice by the Board.
Transfer
Any member may transfer all or any of his uncertificated shares  
by means of a relevant system in such manner provided for, and 
subject as provided, in the CREST Regulations and the rules of any 
relevant system. Subject to the articles of association, any member 
may transfer all or any of his or her certificated shares by an 
instrument of transfer in any usual form or in any other form  
which the Board may approve.
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Board may,  
in its absolute discretion, decline to register any transfer of any 
share which is not a fully paid share provided that where such a 
share is a member of a class of share admitted to the Official List, 
such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent 
dealings in shares of that class from taking place on an open and 
proper basis.
Capital structure
As at 31 December 2015, the Company had 184,198,746 issued 
ordinary shares of 1 pence each. The Company has one class of 
ordinary shares and each share carries the right to one vote at 
general meetings of the Company and to participate in any 
dividends declared in accordance with the articles of association. 
No person has any special rights of control over the Company’s 
share capital.
The authority under the Companies Act 2006 granted on 15 April 2015 
at the Company’s annual general meeting for the directors to issue 
new shares for cash remains valid until the forthcoming annual general 
meeting when it is intended that a resolution will be put forward to 
shareholders to renew the authority to issue shares for cash.
On 27 March 2015 the Company issued 11,863,636 new ordinary 
shares to Presidio Financing Limited. These shares were issued  
to provide the Company with additional financing following the 
acquisition of By the Bridge Holdings Limited, funded through  
a draw down under the Group’s existing banking facilities.  
The Company did not purchase or acquire any of its ordinary  
shares during the year, nor did any nominee or third party  
with the Company’s assistance acquire any shares on behalf  
of the Company.
Cambian Group Employee Benefit Trust (the “EBT”)
The EBT, a discretionary trust for the benefit of executive directors 
and employees, was established on 14 April 2014. The trustee, 
Lutea Trustees Limited (incorporated in Jersey), is not a subsidiary 
of the Company. The EBT operates in conjunction with the 
Cambian Group 2014 Long-Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”),  
the Cambian Group Annual Share Option Plan (the “AOP”), the 
Cambian Group IPO Continuation Plan No.1 (the “COP1”) and the 
Cambian Group IPO Continuation Plan No.2 (the “COP2”) (together, 
the “Employee Plans”). The number of shares held by the EBT at 
any time, when added to the number of shares held by any other 
trust established by the Company for the benefit of employees,  
will not exceed 5% of the issued share capital of the Company.
The EBT is funded by loans from the Company which are then 
used to acquire, either via market purchase or subscription, 
ordinary shares to satisfy conditional share awards granted under 
the Employee Plans. For the purpose of the financial statements, 
the EBT is consolidated into the Company and Group. As a 
consequence, the loans are eliminated and the cost of the shares 
acquired is deducted from equity as set out in note 23 on page 
106 of the financial statements.
In relation to its operation in conjunction with the Employee Plan, 
the EBT does not transfer the beneficial interest in the shares to  
the executive directors and employees until such share awards 
are vested. On establishment of the EBT, the Company contributed 
an initial trust fund of £1,000 and provided a sum of £34,662 to  
the EBT by way of gift for the purpose of subscribing at par for 
3,466,222 ordinary shares of one penny each. As at 31 December 
2015, the EBT held the non-beneficial interest in 3,400,889 shares 
in the Company.

Governance The Board may only decline to register a transfer of an 
uncertificated share in the circumstances set out in the CREST 
Regulations, and where, in the case of a transfer to joint holders, 
the number of joint holders to whom the uncertificated share is to 
be transferred exceeds four.
The Board may, in its absolute discretion, decline to register any 
instrument of transfer of a certificated share unless the instrument 
of transfer is: (i) left at the registered office, or at such other place 
as the Board may decide, for registration and is accompanied by 
the certificate for the shares to be transferred and/or such other 
evidence as the Board may reasonably require to prove the title  
of the transferor and the due execution by him of the transfer;  
or (ii) (if stamp duty is generally chargeable on transfers of 
certificated shares) the instrument of transfer is duly stamped  
or adjudged or certified as not chargeable to stamp duty; or (iii) 
the instrument is in respect of only one class of share; and (iv) in 
the case of a transfer to joint holders, the number of joint holders 
to whom the share is to be transferred does not exceed four.
Amendment of the Company’s articles of association
Any amendments to the Company’s articles of association may  
be made in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 
2006 by way of special resolution.
Other matters
Related party transactions
The directors have reviewed the operation of the relationship 
agreement between the Company and GI Partners and GI Partners  
UK Limited (the “Relationship Agreement”) during the current 
financial year to 31 December 2015 and all of the directors
(other than Alfred Foglio, who being the appointee of GI Partners  
took no part in this review) are satisfied that the provisions in  
the Relationship Agreement that are intended to protect the 
independence of the Company have been complied with in  
all respects during the period of their review. Details of the 
Relationship Agreement are set out on page 50 and details  
of all related party transactions are set out in note 33 to the 
financial statements.
Disclaimer
The purpose of these financial statements (including this report)  
is to provide information to the members of the Company. The 
financial statements have been prepared for, and only for, the 
members of the Company, as a body, and no other persons. The 
Company, its directors and employees, agents or advisers do not 
accept or assume responsibility to any other person to whom this 
document is shown or into whose hands it may come and any 
such responsibility or liability is expressly disclaimed.
The financial statements contain certain forward-looking 
statements with respect to the operations, performance and 
financial condition of the Group. By their nature, these statements 
involve uncertainty since future events and circumstances can 
cause results and developments to differ materially from those 
anticipated. The forward-looking statements reflect knowledge 
and information available at the date of preparation of these 
financial statements and the Company undertakes no obligation  
to update these forward-looking statements. Nothing in this 
document should be construed as a profit forecast.
Political and charitable donations
The Company made no political donations and has not incurred 
any political expenditure during this period in excess of £2,000, 
nor has it made any contributions to a non-EU political party.
Employees
The Corporate and Social Responsibility Report provides 
information with respect to the Group’s employment policies  
and practices and its impact on the environment and can be 
found on pages 40 and 41.
Disabled employees
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully 
and fairly considered, bearing in mind the nature of the job being 
applied for, and the aptitude and ability of the applicant concerned. 
In the event of members of staff becoming disabled, every effort is 
made to ensure that their employment with the Group continues 
and that appropriate training and any necessary workplace 
adjustments are arranged. It is the policy of the Group that the 
training, career development and promotion of disabled persons 
should, as far as possible, be identical to that of other employees.
Employee involvement
The Group places considerable value on the involvement of its 
employees and has continued to keep them informed of matters 
affecting them as employees and on the performance of the 
Group. This has been achieved by a series of informal meetings 
and information days for employees in different locations across 
the Group during the year, through e-mails to all staff from the 
CEO to inform them of important developments affecting the 
Company and through the Group’s magazine “Insight”. Some 
employees are stakeholders in the Company through participation  
in share option plans put in place at the time of the initial public 
offering. The Group is seeking to widen the number of employees 
who have an interest in the Company’s ordinary shares by 
introducing the Cambian ShareSave Plan 2016 (the “Plan”) during 
the course of the year, if the proposals for the adoption of the Plan 
are approved by shareholders at the forthcoming AGM.

Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
The AGM provides an opportunity for the directors to communicate 
performance and future strategy to shareholders in person and 
for those shareholders to meet with and question the Board. All 
directors plan to be present. All results of proxy votes are read out, 
made available for review at the meeting, recorded in the minutes 
of the meeting and communicated to the market and via the 
Group website.
The 2016 AGM will be held at the Cambian Churchill Hospital,  
22 Barkham Terrace, London SE1 7PW on Monday 6 June 2016  
at 12:00 noon. The notice convening the 2016 AGM, and an 
explanation of the items of non-routine business, are set out  
in the circular that accompanies the Annual Report.
Auditor
A resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP as the Company’s auditors will 
be submitted to the shareholders at the Annual General Meeting.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements including the Directors’ remuneration 
report in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare such financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the  
IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent 
company financial statements under Financial Reporting 
Standards (FRS) 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework. Under 
company law the directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true  
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company. In preparing 
these financial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that directors:
• properly select and apply accounting policies;
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information;
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 81
Governance Opinion on financial 
statements of  
Cambian Group plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at  
31 December 2015 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union;
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice, including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and,  
as regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the consolidated income statement, the consolidated balance sheet, the consolidated 
statement of changes in equity, the consolidated cash flow statement and related notes 1 to 35; and the parent company 
balance sheet, the parent company statement of changes in equity and related notes 1 to 9.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the group financial statements is applicable  
law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice), including FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”.
Going concern and the 
directors’ assessment of the 
principal risks that would 
threaten the solvency or 
liquidity of the group
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ statement regarding the appropriateness of the going concern 
basis of accounting contained within note 2 to the financial statements and the directors’ statement on the longer-term viability  
of the group contained within the going concern and viability statement on page 37.
We have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to:
• the directors’ confirmation on page 26 to 31 that they have carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the 
group, including those that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or liquidity;
• the disclosures on pages 30 to 31 that describe those risks and explain how they are being managed or mitigated;
• the directors’ statement in note 2 to the financial statements about whether they considered it appropriate to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing them and their identification of any material uncertainties to the group’s ability to 
continue to do so over a period of at least twelve months from the date of approval of the financial statements; and
• the directors’ explanation on page 37 as to how they have assessed the prospects of the Group, over what period they have 
done so and why they consider that period to be appropriate, and their statement as to whether they have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group will be able to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period of their 
assessment, including any related disclosures drawing attention to any necessary qualifications or assumptions.
We agreed with the directors’ adoption of the going concern basis of accounting and we did not identify any such material 
uncertainties. However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to 
the group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Independence We are required to comply with the Financial Reporting Council’s Ethical Standards for Auditors and we confirm that we  
are independent of the group and we have fulfilled our other ethical responsibilities in accordance with those standards.  
We also confirm we have not provided any of the prohibited non-audit services referred to in those standards.
Our assessment of risks of 
material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy,  
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team.
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Going Concern and Covenant Compliance 
As result of the adverse trading performance of the Group in the second  
half of 2015, at the year-end the Group was in breach of both of its facility 
covenants and accordingly its bank loans became repayable on demand. 
Consequently, the bank loans have been classified as a current liability.  
The Group has since obtained a temporary waiver from the breach.  
These circumstances result in a risk of a material uncertainty over the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. The Group has agreed terms  
for the amendment of its existing facility with its lenders and has consequently 
concluded that there is not a risk of a material uncertainty over the Group’s ability  
to continue as a going concern. Further detail is included in the going concern 
accounting policy in note 2 and the going concern statement on page 37.
We performed a detailed review of management’s forecasts supporting the 
going concern assumption and challenged the underlying assumptions with 
reference to historic trading, recent adverse performance and future pipeline.
We reviewed a copy of the amended terms to the facility agreed with the 
lenders. We considered the impact of the amendments on the available 
facilities and covenant compliance requirements and assessed the Group’s 
ability to operate within these requirements for the going concern period 
based on management’s forecasts.
We critically assessed the adequacy of the disclosures related to the 
application of the going concern assumption.
Revenue recognition
The group recognises revenue over the period in which its behavioural health 
services in specialist high severity care sub-sectors are provided to adults and 
children in the UK and measures revenue at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable in respect of services rendered. Accounting policies 
relating to revenue are set out in note 2.
Due to the manual nature of the occupancy and billing processes and systems 
and the significant number of sites within the Group, we identified a significant 
risk around the completeness of revenue.
We calculated an expected revenue balance based on key metrics including 
average occupancy and changes in fee on a site by site basis and compared 
this to the actual revenue recognised. Where a reasonable expectation could 
not be formed (e.g. due to new sites or changes in service conditions) we 
traced a sample of transactions to invoice and subsequent cash receipts.
For a sample of sites, we assessed the completeness and accuracy of 
occupants being billed by tracing occupants from the individual site patient  
lists through to contract, the billing system, invoice and general ledger.

Exceptional items
The Group has defined exceptional items as items which individually or,  
if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be disclosed separately due to  
their size or incidence in order to obtain clear and consistent presentation  
of the Group’s performance.
The Group has recorded exceptional items totalling £24.9 million (2014:  
£22.3 million) in respect of non-recurring items and transactions that are 
outside the normal course of business. Of this, the significant elements  
are costs associated with the impairment of fixed assets of £21.7 million  
and the write off of £2.8 million in respect of IT related projects that are no  
longer being implemented. Exceptional items involve a level of judgement  
and therefore present a risk that performance could be distorted.
We assessed the nature of these items to determine whether they met the 
definition included under the Group’s accounting policies in note 2 and that  
the definition had been applied consistently.
We agreed the quantification of the exceptional items to supporting documentation 
and challenged management on the appropriateness of classification of these 
items as material, non-recurring and exceptional in nature.
We assessed whether the disclosures within the financial statements  
provide sufficient detail for the reader to understand the nature of these  
items. We considered whether appropriate prominence is given in the Annual 
Report to statutory financial information and related commentary compared  
to the ‘underlying’ financial information and whether the two have been 
reconciled. We also considered whether the basis of the ‘underlying’ financial 
information is clearly and accurately described and not misleading in the form 
on which it appears in the Annual Report.
Risk of impairment of goodwill
The Group has recognised a goodwill balance of £114.3 million (2014:  
£100.0 million) as described in note 10 to the financial statements. Of this 
£100.0 million related to historic acquisitions and £14.1 million was recognised  
on the acquisition of By the Bridge and £0.2 million was recognised on the 
acquisition of Interact Care during the year to 31 December 2015.
Goodwill must be tested annually and requires a comparison between the 
carrying value of the related cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) (including goodwill) 
and its recoverable amount. Determination of the recoverable amount is  
based upon the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value-in-use.  
An impairment assessment requires management to make significant 
estimates and judgements.
CGUs are reviewed for impairment using a value in use model which reflects 
management estimates of future cash flows for the next four years, the 
long-term growth rate thereafter and the application of appropriate discount 
rates to each CGU. Management have also considered the fair value less  
costs of disposal by reference to external valuation advice.
Management have concluded that, whilst goodwill is not impaired at  
31 December 2015, the Child CGU is sensitive to a reasonable change  
in assumptions which could lead to an impairment.
We challenged the appropriateness of the CGUs as determined by  
the Directors in note 10 with reference to the criteria in the applicable 
accounting standards.
We challenged the assumptions used in the impairment model for  
goodwill which calculates the value-in-use. Our challenge focused  
on assessing the appropriateness of the cash flow projections relative  
to previous performance and external evidence on growth rates,  
benchmarking and recalculating the discount rates used, and the related 
sensitivity analysis which was reperformed by us using our own defined 
variables. We also reviewed the external valuation advice received which 
formed part of Management’s assessment. In the course of this work,  
we consulted Deloitte valuation specialists.
We assessed the adequacy of the related disclosures in the financial statements, 
in particular in relation to the sensitivity disclosures for the Child CGU.
Accounting for acquisitions
The Group made four acquisitions during the year as set out in note 25.  
This resulted in the recognition of goodwill of £14.3 million, acquired intangible 
assets of £28.5 million, and a gain on acquisitions (recognised within exceptional 
items) of £0.1 million. The most significant of these acquisitions was By the 
Bridge in March 2015 which resulted in the recognition of £14.1 million of 
goodwill and £25.1 million of acquired intangible assets. Management also 
finalised the provisional acquisition accounting in relation to the acquisition  
of Ansel and Woodleigh and which were completed in September and 
December 2014.
Significant judgement is required in respect of the purchase price allocation 
process which includes the fair valuation of the assets and liabilities and the 
separate identification and valuation of acquired intangible assets.
We reviewed the sale and purchase agreements for each acquisition to verify 
the costs of acquisition and assess the accounting impact of any conditions 
relating to the acquisition.
We challenged management on the key assumptions used in deriving the fair 
value of assets and liabilities and separately identifying and valuing intangible 
assets by reviewing key assumptions used, assessing events subsequent to 
acquisition and obtaining third party valuation reports to determine if the 
valuations are appropriate.
Supported by Deloitte valuation specialists we assessed the appropriateness  
of the financial model used to value the intangible assets.
In relation to the gain on acquisitions, we challenged management further  
on the appropriateness of the fair value calculations and sought evidence  
to support management’s conclusion that the gain on acquisitions reflected 
the commercial substance of the transactions.
We reviewed the finalisation of the provisional accounting of the 2014 acquisitions 
as allowed in the measurement period and challenged any changes made to 
the previously reported results as at 31 December 2014. We assessed the 
adequacy of the related disclosures in the financial statements.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 83
Financial statements Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Given the adverse trading performance, there is a risk that the carrying value 
of certain property, plant and equipment (“assets”) is impaired. The carrying 
value of property, plant and equipment at 31 December 2015 is £364.0 million 
(2014: £354.7 million).
There is significant judgement involved in assessing the recoverable  
amount of the assets, as it is based on management estimates of future  
cash flows and the application of appropriate discount rates or third party 
surveyor property valuations.
At 31 December 2015, the Group identified £21.7 million of assets that are 
impaired. The impairment has been recognised within exceptional items.  
This is shown in note 5.
We obtained management’s fixed asset impairment model and challenged 
the assessment of the assets which require impairment, and in particular,  
the underlying rationale and assumptions used. We confirmed that the  
cash flow forecasts used in this assessment were consistent with the Board’s 
approved cash flow forecasts used in the Group’s assessment of going concern.
We assessed the integrity of management’s calculations.
Where third-party valuations had been performed, we assessed the  
objectivity and independence of the expert used by management.
Completeness of liabilities
The Group announced that weaknesses in cost management processes 
contributed to adverse performance against forecast. We therefore identified  
a significant risk around the completeness of liabilities as at 31 December 2015.
Trade creditors and accruals as at 31 December 2015 totalled £17.4 million 
(2014: £15.0 million) and are shown in note 15.
We challenged the year-end accruals and trade creditors balance to assess the 
completeness of liabilities and to ascertain whether costs had been recorded in 
the correct period. This included reviewing a sample of supplier statements to 
challenge the completeness of liabilities. We addressed the risk of unrecorded 
liabilities by reviewing, on a sample basis, post year-end unpaid invoices. We also 
selected a sample of payments from post year-end bank statements, identified 
what they related to and assessed whether they had been recorded in the correct 
period. We performed an analysis of the key liability balances as at 31 December 
2015 against 31 December 2014 to understand significant movements, in particular 
in relation to potential understatement of liabilities. We also substantiated a sample 
of accruals to supporting evidence.
Recoverability of trade receivables
Given the nature of the Group’s customer base being largely Local Authorities 
and National Health Service bodies, debts are often overdue beyond 
contractual payment dates. The Group had significant levels of trade 
receivables as at 31 December 2015 of £46.4 million (2014: £27.9 million) of 
which £3.6 million was over 120 days (2014: £1.7 million) and shown in note 13. 
A risk therefore exists that some aged debts may not be recoverable and are 
not sufficiently provided for at 31 December 2015.
We reviewed management’s provision methodology, reviewed the aged 
receivables listing as at 31 December 2015 and challenged management on  
all debts greater than 180 days old as to whether they had been appropriately 
provided for.
We tested the integrity of the aged debtors listing by recalculating the ageing 
of a sample of debtors as at 31 December 2015.
We selected a sample of outstanding debtors at the year-end and assessed 
recoverability by agreeing to payment received from debtors post 31 December 
2015. For those where payment was not received we challenged whether the  
debt should be provided for as at 31 December 2015.
In the prior year the risks we reported on were revenue recognition, exceptional items, impairment of goodwill and accounting for 
acquisitions. The additional risks reported in 2015 are going concern and covenant compliance, recoverability of trade receivables,  
asset impairments and completeness of liabilities.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit and Risk Committee 
discussed on pages 54 and 55 and the critical accounting judgements as set out in note 3.
These matters were addressed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and in forming our opinion thereon, 
and we do not provide a separate opinion on these matters.
Our application  
of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope  
of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be £0.5 million (2014: £1.0 million), which is 6% (2014: 6%) of pre-tax profit adjusted for 
exceptional items. We used pre-tax profit before exceptional items as it represents a key performance measure for the Group and  
due to the non-recurring nature of the exceptional items. This approach is consistent with prior year.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of £20,000 (2014: 
£20,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report to the 
Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the 
scope of our audit
Our group audit scope covers 100% of the Group’s subsidiaries, all of which conduct activities in the UK. At the parent entity level,  
we also tested the consolidation process.

Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 84 Opinion on other 
matters prescribed  
by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of 
explanations received 
and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have 
not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and 
returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate Governance 
Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the company’s 
compliance with certain provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code.
We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read  
other information  
in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the 
annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of 
performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during 
the audit and the directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the 
annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit and risk committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed.
We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective 
responsibilities of 
directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). We also comply 
with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality 
control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional 
standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 
2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to 
state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in  
the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is 
apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Financial statements Notes to the financial statements
For the year ended 31 December 2015
1. General information
Cambian Group plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated in Great Britain under the Companies Act. The principal activity of the 
Company and its subsidiaries (collectively, the “Group”) is the provision of high quality behavioural health services to children and adults.
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the currency of the primary economic environment in which the  
Group operates.
2. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”). The financial 
statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRSs adopted by the European Union and therefore the Group financial 
statements comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements are set out below. These policies 
have been consistently applied to all the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
The historical cost convention has been applied except in respect of those financial instruments that have been measured at fair value at 
the end of each reporting period, as explained in the accounting policies below. Historical cost is generally based on the fair value of the 
consideration given in exchange for goods and services. The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Fair value is the price that would be received to sell an asset or paid to transfer a liability in an orderly transaction between market participants 
at the measurement date, regardless of whether that price is directly observable or estimated using another valuation technique. In estimating 
the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group takes into account the characteristics of the asset or liability if market participants would take 
those characteristics into account when pricing the asset or liability at the measurement date. Fair value for measurement and/or disclosure 
purposes in these consolidated financial statements is determined on such a basis, except for share-based payment transactions that are 
within the scope of IFRS 2, leasing transactions within the scope of IAS 17 , and measurements that have some similarities to fair value but 
are not fair value, such as value in use in IAS 36.
In addition, for financial reporting purposes, fair value measurements are categorised into Level 1, 2 or 3 based on the degree to which the 
inputs to the fair value measurements are observable and the significance of the inputs to the fair value measurement in its entirety, which 
are described as follows:
• Level 1 inputs are quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities that the entity can access at the 
measurement date;
• Level 2 inputs are inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1, that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly  
or indirectly; and
• Level 3 inputs are unobservable inputs for the asset or liability.
Going concern
As indicated on page 37 of the annual report, the directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation 
that the Company and the Group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,  
they have adopted the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements. The directors have considered the Group 
and Company’s forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, and are satisfied that 
the Group and Company should be able to operate within the level of its current facilities.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 90 Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial information incorporates the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company  
(the “subsidiaries”) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved when a company:
• has the power over the investee;
• is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee; and
• has the ability to use its power to affect its returns.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the 
financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. All intra-group 
transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Non-controlling interests in subsidiaries are identified separately from the Group’s equity therein. Those interests of non-controlling 
shareholders, that are present ownership interests entitling their holders to a proportionate share of net assets upon liquidation, may 
initially be measured at fair value or at the non-controlling interests’ proportionate share of the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable  
net assets. The choice of measurement is made on an acquisition-by-acquisition basis. Other non-controlling interests are initially 
measured at fair value. Subsequent to acquisition, the carrying amount of non-controlling interests is the amount of those interests at  
initial recognition plus the non-controlling interests’ share of subsequent changes in equity. Total comprehensive income is attributed  
to non-controlling interests even if this results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in the Group’s interests in subsidiaries that do not result in a loss of control are accounted for as equity transactions. The carrying 
amount of the Group’s interests and the non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their relative interests in the subsidiaries. 
Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interests are adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or received 
is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the equity holders of the Company.
Business combinations 
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured 
at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by 
the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 (2008) are 
recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date.
If the initial accounting for a business combination is incomplete for a business combination by the end of the reporting period in which the 
combination occurs, the Group reports provisional amounts for the items for which the accounting is incomplete. Those provisional amounts 
are adjusted during the measurement period, or additional assets or liabilities are recognised to reflect new information obtained about 
facts and circumstances that existed as of the acquisition date that, if known, would have affected the amounts recognised as of that date.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the “acquisition date”). Goodwill is 
measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the fair 
value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the entity over the net of the acquisition date amounts of the identifiable assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed. 
Goodwill is not amortised but reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each 
of the Group’s cash-generating units (“CGUs”) expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. CGUs to which goodwill has been 
allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable 
amount of the CGU is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination 
Intangible assets acquired in a business combination and recognised separately from goodwill are initially recognised at their fair value  
at the acquisition date (which is regarded as their cost).
Intangible assets acquired in business combinations are comprised of customer relationships, and contractual obligations entered into  
by the vendor not to provide competing services with the Group for a determined period (“non-compete agreements”).
Subsequent to initial recognition, intangible assets acquired in a business combination are reported at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and any impairment losses. Amortisation is recognised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives and charged to administrative 
expenses on the following basis:
Customer relationships 7 to 18 years
Non-compete agreements Shorter of the agreement term or 5 years
The estimated useful life and amortisation method are reviewed at the end of each reporting period, with the effect of any changes in 
estimate being accounted for on a prospective basis.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of loan issue costs incurred, when the relevant contracts are entered into. Borrowings are 
subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of loan issue costs) and the redemption value is recognised 
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Tax
The tax expense represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax.
Current tax
The current income tax charge is calculated on the basis of the tax laws enacted or substantively enacted at year-end in the UK where  
the Company’s subsidiaries and associates operate and generate taxable income. Management periodically evaluates positions taken  
in tax returns with respect to situations in which applicable tax regulations are subject to interpretation and establishes provisions where 
appropriate on the basis of amounts expected to be paid to the tax authorities.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is provided using the liability method for all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and 
their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred income tax is determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted 
or substantively enacted by year-end and are expected to apply when the related deferred income tax asset is realised or the deferred 
income tax liability is settled. Deferred income tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be 
available against which the temporary differences can be utilised. Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group 
and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority on either the 
same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.
Depreciation is recognised so as to write off the cost of assets (other than land and assets under construction) less their residual values over 
their useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following basis:
Land and buildings 2%
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 20% − 33%
Motor vehicles 20% − 25%
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 92 The gain or loss arising on the disposal or scrappage of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the 
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in profit or loss.
Assets in the course of construction are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Cost includes professional fees and, for 
qualifying assets, borrowing costs capitalised in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy. Depreciation of these assets, on the 
same basis as other property assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether  
there is any indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of 
the asset is estimated to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
An intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment at least annually and whenever there is an indication that 
the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value 
of money and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount  
of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised immediately in the  
income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment 
loss is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the balance 
sheet date, taking into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash 
flows estimated to settle the present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
When some or all of the economic benefits required to settle a provision are expected to be recovered from a third party, a receivable  
is recognised as an asset if it is virtually certain that reimbursement will be received and the amount of the receivable can be  
measured reliably.
Restructurings
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised  
a valid expectation in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main 
features to those affected by it. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct expenditures arising from the 
restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with the ongoing 
activities of the entity.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. 
The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group 
revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. 
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the 
revised estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
All financial assets are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where the purchase or sale of a financial asset is under a contract 
whose terms require delivery of the financial asset within the timeframe established by the market concerned, and are initially measured 
at fair value.
All financial assets, other than cash and cash equivalents and derivatives, are classified as “loans and receivables”.
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables, loans, and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are 
classified as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any 
impairment. Interest income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition 
of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets are assessed for indicators of impairment at each balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is 
objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition of the financial asset, the estimated 
future cash flows of the investment have been affected.
For certain categories of financial asset, such as trade receivables, assets that are assessed not to be impaired individually are, in addition, 
assessed for impairment on a collective basis. Objective evidence of impairment for a portfolio of receivables could include the Group’s 
past experience of collecting payments, an increase in the number of delayed payments in the portfolio past the average credit period 
of 60 days, as well as observable changes in national or local economic conditions that correlate with default on receivables.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade 
receivables, where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered 
uncollectable, it is written off against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited 
against the allowance account. Changes in the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in profit or loss.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers 
the financial asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers 
nor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its 
retained interest in the asset and an associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks  
and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises  
a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities and equity
Debt and equity instruments are classified as either financial liabilities or as equity in accordance with the substance of the  
contractual arrangement.
Equity instruments
An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of an entity after deducting all of its liabilities.  
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Financial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classified as either financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss or other financial liabilities. In certain 
circumstances the Group is required to undertake the responsibility of Corporate Appointee for individuals under the Group’s care,  
as they lack the capacity to manage their own finances. The responsibility involves safeguarding the individual’s financial assets and 
ensuring that the support they receive from the UK government is apportioned appropriately. The Group segregates these funds from  
its own in restricted bank accounts and records a corresponding liability.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 94 Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities, including borrowings, are initially measured at fair value, net of transaction costs.
Other financial liabilities are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, with interest expense 
recognised on an effective yield basis.
Effective interest method
The effective interest method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial liability and of allocating interest expense over 
the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that exactly discounts estimated future cash payments through the expected  
life of the financial liability, or where appropriate, a shorter period to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, specifically interest rate swaps, to manage its exposure to interest rate risks.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured to 
their fair value at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised immediately within finance costs in the combined 
statement of comprehensive income, unless it is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the 
recognition in profit or loss depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a financial asset whereas a derivative with a negative fair value is recognised as  
a financial liability. A derivative is presented as a non-current asset or a non-current liability if the remaining maturity of the instrument is 
more than 12 months and it is not expected to be realised or settled within 12 months. Other derivatives are presented as current assets 
or current liabilities.
Hedge accounting
The Group designates its interest rate swaps as cash flow hedges.
At inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, 
along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception  
of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging instrument is highly effective in offsetting changes  
in the cash flows of the hedged item attributable to the hedged risk.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges is recognised  
in other comprehensive income and accumulated under the heading of cash flow hedging reserve. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in profit or loss, and is included in the ‘finance costs’ line item.
Amounts previously recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in equity are reclassified to profit or loss in the periods 
when the hedged item affects profit or loss, in the same line as the recognised hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the Group revokes the hedging relationship, when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated, or exercised, or when it no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. Any gain or loss recognised in other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in equity at that time remains and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in profit 
or loss. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the gain or loss accumulated in equity is recognised immediately in 
profit or loss.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable in respect of services provided in the normal course of 
business, net of discounts, estimated rebates and VAT. In all cases revenue is recognised over the period in which the service is provided. 
Additional services provided by the Group are recognised on provision of the service. Sales rebate accruals and provisions are established 
in the same period as the revenue to which they relate.
Revenue invoiced in advance is included in deferred revenue until the service is provided.

2. Summary of significant accounting policies (continued)
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed 
retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes 
are equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.
Leases
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the 
lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as 
a finance lease obligation.
Finance lease payments are apportioned between finance expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate 
of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Interest expense is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease except where 
another more systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed.
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate 
benefit of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term, except where another 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items reflect expenditure which in the judgement of the directors, individually or, if of a similar type, in aggregate, need to be 
disclosed separately due to their size or incidence in order to obtain clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s performance. 
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets are added to the cost of those assets, 
until such time as the assets are substantially ready for their intended use or sale. Qualifying assets are assets that take a substantial period 
of time to get ready for their intended use.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they are incurred.
Adoption of new and revised standards
In the current year, the following new and revised standards and interpretations have been adopted:
Annual Improvements to IFRSs:  
2011–2013
Amendments to: IFRS 1 First-time Adoption of International Financial 
Reporting Standards, IFRS 3 Business Combinations, IFRS 13 Fair Value

The directors expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will not have a material impact on the financial information of the Group 
in future reporting periods. Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards 
until a detailed review has been completed.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which are described in note 2, the directors are required to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources.  
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are considered to be relevant.  
Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised  
in the period in which the estimate is revised, if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods,  
if the revision affects both current and future periods.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the directors 
have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised 
in the historical financial information.
Initial recognition and useful economic life of intangible assets
The Group’s management team have assessed each acquisition in the combined historical financial information period to identify the 
intangible assets that were acquired in each transaction that qualify for separate recognition. Accordingly, management have recognised 
two main classes of intangibles being customer relationships and non-compete agreements.
The valuation method used to value customer relationships and non-compete agreements is a multi-period excess earnings method.  
The intangibles are amortised over their useful economic life (“UEL”). For the intangibles identified in relation to non-compete agreements, 
UEL is equal to the lower of the length of the agreement and 5 years. For the intangibles identified in relation to customer relationships,  
UEL has been assessed as ranging from 7 to 18 years across the acquisitions.

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty (continued)
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have  
a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year,  
are discussed below.
Carrying value of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated.  
The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from the CGUs, and a suitable discount 
rate in order to calculate present value. 
Carrying value of property, plant and equipment
Determining whether property, plant and equipment is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use, and if required, estimation of 
the fair value less costs of disposal. The value in use calculation requires the entity to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise from 
the property, plant and equipment, and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. 
Carrying value of trade receivables
In the year, management have reviewed the basis of the debtors provisioning policy and adopted a revised approach. The year-end 
provision is based on credit notes for 2015 raised post year end and full provision for older debts to the extent that they have not been 
collected since the year-end.
Effectiveness of cash flow hedge
The hedge effectiveness testing has been performed based on management judgement that there will be suitable highly probable cash 
flows that offset the cash flows of the hedging instrument.
4. Staff costs
The average monthly number of employees (including executive directors) was:
2015 2014
Nursing, care and support staff 6,209 5,478

Gain on acquisition (note 25) (66) (158)
Share schemes vesting on IPO – 7,700
24,861 22,260
IT project costs written off relate to £0.9m costs capitalised in 2014, and £1.9m of costs incurred in 2015, in relation to an integrated 
Finance, HR and CRM system. In December 2015, the Board cancelled the project, and instead the Company is pursuing a lower cost 
option of remediating current systems. 
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 98 Redundancy costs relate to senior management who were made redundant in the second half of 2015.
Impairment loss is the difference between the net asset value of property, plant and equipment, and the greater of value in use or fair value 
less costs of disposal.
Business integration costs represent the cancellation of IT contracts.
The gain on acquisition is the difference between the fair value of the assets acquired and the consideration on certain acquisitions in the year.
The majority of the exceptional costs are capital in nature and therefore do not attract a tax deduction. The Group estimates that £2.7m (2014: 
£2.5m) of the exceptional costs will be deductible, and this is reflected as a reduction of £0.6m (2014: £0.5m) in the tax charge for the year.

and a subsequent 1% reduction to 18% with effect from 1 April 2020. These rate changes were substantively enacted on 18 November 2015 
and reflected in the above calculations.
On 16 March 2016, the UK Government announced a further reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax to 17% with effect from 1 April 2020.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 100 Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (“CGUs”) that are expected to benefit 
from that business combination. 
Goodwill has been allocated to two identifiable CGUs, Adult and Child, which align to the reported operating segments. The recoverable 
amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.

The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and the value in use of CGUs, has been determined based on 
value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections for operational assets at the balance sheet date based on financial 
budgets approved by the Board of Directors for the forthcoming year and forecasts for up to four years which are based on assumptions of 
the business, industry and economic growth. Cash flows beyond this year are extrapolated using growth rates, which do not exceed the 
expected long-term economic growth rate. The cash flows are discounted to the net present value using pre-tax discount rates.
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, long-term growth rates, mature occupancy  
rates, asset level fill rates, patient fee rates and costs. Mature occupancy rates, asset level fill up rates, patient fee rates and direct costs are 
derived from bottom up, asset by asset level analysis produced as part of management’s annual budget process and are not dissimilar to 
past experience at the point of budget production. The Group has assumed a growth rate of 2% (2014: 2%) into perpetuity when assessing 
its future cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the market assessment of the time value of 
money as at each balance sheet date, adjusted for the risks specific to the CGUs.
The pre-tax rate used to discount cash flow forecasts of CGUs is as follows:
2015
%
2014
% 
Adult segment 8.7 9.4
Child segment 8.8 9.6
The Group has additionally utilised a third party to perform a valuation of the business, which supports the value in use calculations.
Sensitivities
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on each of the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill with other variables held 
constant. Consideration of sensitivities to key assumptions can evolve from one financial year to the next.
The directors have concluded that in the case of Adult, due to the extent of the headroom of the value in use over the carrying amount  
of goodwill it is unlikely, although possible, that a key assumption would change to the extent that it causes the carrying amount of 
goodwill to exceed its value in use. In the case of Child, given the headroom of value in use over the carrying amount of goodwill is 
considerably less than in Adult, it is more likely that a change in a key assumption could cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed 
its value in use. The current headroom for Child is £12.9m (2014: £49.2m). Consequently, the directors have considered the amount by 
which the value assigned to each key assumption must change, after incorporating any consequential effects of that change on the 
other variables used to measure recoverable amount, in order for the Child CGUs recoverable amount to be equal to its carrying 
amount. This is illustrated in the below table:

In addition, the Group’s obligations under finance leases (see note 16) are secured by the lessor’s title to the leased assets, which have a 
carrying amount of £0.8m (2014: £1.1m). These assets are included under motor vehicles.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 102 Impairment losses recognised in the year
During the year the Group carried out a review of the recoverable amount of its property, plant and equipment throughout the business. 
The recoverable amount, which is the higher of fair value less cost of disposal and the value in use, has been determined initially based on 
value in use calculations. These calculations use cash flow projections for operational assets at the balance sheet date based on financial 
budgets approved by the Board of Directors for the forthcoming year and forecasts for up to four years which are based on assumptions  
of the business, industry and economic growth. Cash flows beyond this year are extrapolated using growth rates, which do not exceed the 
expected long-term economic growth rate. The review has led to an impairment loss of £20.9m in land and buildings relating to the Adult 
segment, and £0.8m relating to the Child segment, which has been recognised in profit or loss. 
The key assumptions for the value in use calculations are those regarding discount rates, long-term growth rates, mature occupancy rates, 
asset level fill rates, patient fee rates and costs. Mature occupancy rates, asset level fill up rates, patient fee rates and direct costs are 
derived from bottom up, asset by asset level analysis produced as part of management’s annual budget process and are not dissimilar to 
past experience at the point of budget production. The Group has assumed a growth rate of 2% into perpetuity when assessing its future 
cash flows. Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect the market assessment of the time value of money as at 
each balance sheet date, adjusted for the risks specific to the Group.
Where the value in use has indicated an impairment, the Group also estimated fair value less costs of disposal of the related land and 
buildings, through use of external valuations, based on recent market prices of assets with similar age and obsolescence. 
The below table illustrates the net asset value compared to fair value less costs of disposal, and value in use.

The discount rate used in measuring value in use was 8.7% per annum. No impairment assessment was performed in 2014 as there was 
no indication of impairment.
The impairment losses have been included in profit or loss in the administrative expenses line item.

Invoices to customers are due for payment within 60 days of issue. The Group’s experience is that the majority of customers will pay  
within that period. Trade receivables disclosed above include amounts (see below for aged analysis) which are past due at the reporting 
date. In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable 
from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The Group’s exposure to credit risk is limited due to its customers being 
principally local authorities controlled by the UK government. The Group has recognised an allowance for doubtful receivables at each 
reporting date by considering the receivables balance due over 180 days. The average age of receivables is 49 days (2014: 42 days).
The Group does not hold collateral or other credit enhancements over its trade receivables nor does it have a legal right of offset against 
amounts owed by the Group to the counterparty. 
The directors consider that the carrying amount of trade receivables approximates their fair value.

It is the Group’s policy to lease certain fixtures, fittings and equipment and motor vehicles under finance leases. The average lease term 
is 3.1 years (2014: 3.8 years). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment basis and no arrangements 
have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
The fair value of the Group’s lease obligations is approximately equal to their carrying amount.

The borrowings above are shown net of loan issue costs of transactions incurred at inception of the loan.
As at January 2015 the Group had financed all of its debt with a senior term loan of £75.0m and revolving facilities agreement of 
£180.0m (“the facilities”), totalling £255.0m, provided by a syndicate of banks, and secured over the assets of the Group. The facilities  
were subsequently extended by £35.0m on 26 March 2015 to fund the acquisition of By the Bridge. Loans drawn under the facilities carry 
an interest rate of between 2.00% and 2.75% above LIBOR.
As at 31 December 2015, £75.0m was drawn under a fixed term loan and £181.5m was drawn under the revolving credit facilities (“RCF”),  
both expiring on 31 March 2019.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had breached loan covenants, and consequently all borrowings are now current liabilities.  
Subsequent to year-end, the Group has agreed terms for the amendment of its facilities, refer to note 35.

19. Deferred tax liabilities (continued)
Deferred tax assets have been recognised in respect of all tax losses and other temporary differences where the directors believe it is 
probable that these assets will be recovered.
In addition to the recognised losses disclosed above the Group has unused tax losses at the balance sheet date, relating to a mixture  
of trading losses, non-trade deficits and management expenses, of £29.5m (2014: £25.9m) available for offset against suitable future 
taxable profits. A deferred tax asset has not been recognised in respect of any of these losses as it is not considered probable that there  
will be sufficient future taxable profits available.
At the balance sheet date the Group has unused tax capital losses of £6.7m (2014: £6.7m) available for offset against future capital gains. 
No deferred tax asset has been recognised for these losses as no future capital gains are currently expected to arise. There is no expiry 
date for any of the recognised and unrecognised tax losses.

The entity has a forfeitable share scheme for the executive directors and qualifying employees (“participant”). The participant will forfeit the 
forfeitable shares if they cease to be an employee of the Group before the vesting date, unless otherwise determined by the Board.
During 2014, and prior to IPO, nil-cost options were awarded to certain employees and executives of the Group under Continuation Option 
Plan 1 and Continuation Option Plan 2. 3,199,997 nil-cost options over ordinary shares were awarded under Continuation Option Plan 1,  
and a third of these become exercisable on each of the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of the date of IPO and remain exercisable until 
the tenth anniversary of the date of IPO. 246,225 nil-cost options over ordinary shares were awarded under Continuation Option Plan 2,  
and these become exercisable 18 months from the date of IPO and remain exercisable until the tenth anniversary of the date of IPO. All of 
the nil-cost options awarded under these plans were awarded at the then fair value market price of 225 pence. 
The total fair value charge of £7.8m is being expensed over the vesting periods, ranging between 18 months and 5 years. The total 
expense recognised in the year was £2.3m (2014: £1.6m) (note 4).
25. Acquisition of subsidiaries
Year ended 31 December 2015
(a) By the Bridge
On 26 March 2015 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of By the Bridge Holdings (“By the Bridge”) for £44.8m. By the Bridge is an 
independent fostering provider specialising in therapeutic foster care for over 500 children and 350 foster families across the South East, 
Midlands, East, North West and Yorkshire. The transaction has been accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting in accordance 
with IFRS 3 (2008).
The following table summarises the consideration paid for By the Bridge, the provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities 
assumed at the acquisition date:
£’000 
Cash and cash equivalents 10,500
Trade and other receivables 2,096

Total identifiable assets 30,678
Goodwill 14,085
Cash consideration paid 44,763
Less: Cash and cash equivalents in subsidiary (10,500)
Cash flow on acquisition 34,263
The goodwill of £14.1m arising from the acquisition consists of the value of the assembled workforce, potential synergies gained from 
combining the head office functions and expansion potential. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Trade and other receivables include receivables with a gross contractual value of £2.1m. As at the acquisition date, the best estimate  
of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected was £nil.
Acquisition related costs (included in administrative expenses in Cambian Group plc consolidated income statement) amounted to £1m.

By the Bridge contributed revenue of £19.3m and a profit of £3.5m to the Group’s loss before tax for the year between the date of 
acquisition and the balance sheet date.
If the acquisition of By the Bridge had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group revenues for the year would have 
been £302.9m and Group loss before tax would have been £17.0m.
(b) Interact Care Limited
On 9 June 2015 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Interact Care Limited (“Interact”) for £3.4m. Interact is a specialist 
provider of high acuity care for children and young adults (8 to 25 years of age) with learning difficulties, autism and complex needs.  
The transaction has been accounted for by the acquisition method of accounting in accordance with IFRS 3 (2008).
The following table summarises the consideration paid for Interact, the provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
at the acquisition date:

The goodwill of £0.2m arising from the acquisition consists of the value of the assembled workforce, potential synergies gained from 
combining the head office functions and expansion potential. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
Trade and other receivables include receivables with a gross contractual value of £0.2m. As at the acquisition date, the best estimate  
of contractual cash flows not expected to be collected was £nil.
Acquisition related costs (included in administrative expenses in Cambian Group plc consolidated income statement) amounted to £0.3m.
Interact contributed revenue of £2.2m and a profit of £0.3m to the Group’s loss before tax for the year between the date of acquisition 
and the balance sheet date.

26. Business and geographical segments
Products and services from which reportable segments derive their revenues
Management has determined the operating segments based on the monthly management pack reviewed by the Board, which is  
used to assess both the performance of the business and to allocate resources within the Group. Management have identified the 
Board of Directors as the chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) in accordance with the requirements of IFRS 8 – Operating segments. 
The operating and reportable segments are in reference to the category of the customer:
Adult Services Provision of specialist behavioural science healthcare services for adults
Children’s Services Provision of specialist behavioural science healthcare services for children
The Group assesses segment performance using Adjusted EBITDA as its primary measure.
Adjusted EBITDA is defined as earnings before net finance costs, tax, depreciation, amortisation, profit or loss on disposal of assets, 
exceptional items, acquisition costs, and the charge relating to Continuation Option Plan shares awarded as part of the IPO.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 112 All revenue for the Group is generated from within the UK and there are no inter-segment revenues.

Segment assets and liabilities, including depreciation, amortisation and additions to non-current assets, are not reported to the CODM 
on a segmental basis and are therefore not disclosed. Goodwill has been allocated to reportable segments as described in note 10. 
The accounting policies of the reportable segments are the same as the Group’s accounting policies described in note 2. Segment profit 
represents the profit earned by each segment without allocation of the share of profits of associates, investment revenue and finance 
costs, and income tax expense. This is the measure reported to the Group Chief Executive for the purpose of resource allocation and 
assessment of segment performance.

31. Retirement benefit schemes
The Group operates a stakeholder pension scheme as required by the Welfare reform and Pensions Act 1999 and The Stakeholder 
Pensions Scheme Regulations 2000. The Group does not contribute to the scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from 
those of the Group in an independently administered fund.
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 116 The Group contributes to a defined benefit scheme for the benefit of the teaching staff employed by subsidiary companies. The assets 
are administered by the Teachers’ Pension Scheme. The Teachers’ Pension Scheme is a multi-employer scheme run by the UK Government 
where the employer’s liability is limited to providing defined contributions on behalf of its employees. As such, the scheme is treated as  
a defined contribution scheme.
The total cost charged to income of £1.6m (2014: £0.8m) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the schemes. As at 31 December 2015, contributions of £0.4m (2014: £0.4m) due in respect of the current 
reporting year had not been paid over to the schemes.
32. Financial Instruments
The Group seeks to reduce exposures to interest rate and other financial risks, to ensure liquidity is available to meet the foreseeable 
needs of the Group and to invest cash assets safely and profitably. The Group does not engage in speculative trading in financial 
instruments and transacts only in relation to underlying business requirements.
Significant accounting policies

the bases for recognition of income and expenses) for each class of financial asset, financial liability and equity instrument are disclosed

The directors consider that the carrying amount of financial assets and financial liabilities approximates to their fair value.
Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital (defined as total borrowings plus equity) are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern in order to provide returns to shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, while optimising returns to 
shareholders through an appropriate balance of debt and equity funding.
External debt liabilities in the period have been undertaken in the subsidiaries of the Group. In addition, shareholder loans have been  
in place during the period. Details of all such loans are included in note 17.
Each loan has been monitored closely to ensure that the terms of the loan are adhered to with sufficient headroom to manage any 
contingencies. As at 31 December 2015, the unutilised portion of the RCF amounted to £33.5m (2014: £38.5m).

32. Financial instruments (continued)
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages its exposure 
to liquidity risk by reviewing the cash resources required to meet its business objectives through both short and long-term cash flow 
forecasts. The Group maintains sufficient cash balances to ensure that it has sufficient funds for general corporate purposes including 
working capital.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer may default on their obligation to the Group in relation to lending, settlement and other financial 
activities. The Group’s credit risk primarily arises from trade and other receivables. The amounts included in the balance sheet are net  
of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on 
previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of cash flows. The Group has a very low operational credit risk due  
to the Group providing services principally to local authorities. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with the exposure 
spread over a large number of local authorities and combined commissioning groups. The credit risk on liquid funds is considered to be 
low, as 99% of customers are backed by the UK government.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on floating rate borrowings. At 31 December 2015 the Group had bank borrowings of £256.5m 
(2014: £216.5m) with a weighted average interest rate in the year of 3.10% (2014: 3.09%). The Group has in place financial instruments to 
hedge against interest rate movements in the current year.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The sensitivity analyses below have been determined based on the exposure to interest rates for both derivatives and non-derivative 
instruments at the balance sheet date. For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of liability outstanding 
at balance sheet date was outstanding for the whole year. The Group considers a reasonable interest rate movement in LIBOR to be 1% 
based on interest rate history.
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group loss before tax for the year ended  
31 December 2015 would decrease/increase by £1.8m (2014: £2.2m). This is mainly attributable to the Group exposure to interest rates  
on its variable rate borrowings, part of which have not been hedged.
Interest rate swap contracts
Under interest rate swap contracts, the Group agrees to exchange floating rate interest amounts calculated on agreed notional principal 
amounts for a fixed rate interest amount. Such contracts enable the Group to mitigate the risk of changing interest rates on the cash flow 
exposures on the issued variable rate debt. The fair value of the interest rate swaps at the end of the reporting period is determined by 
discounting the future cash flows using the curves at the end of the reporting period and the credit risk inherent in the contract, and is 
disclosed below. The average interest rate is based on the outstanding balances at the end of the reporting period.
The following table details the notional principal amount and remaining terms of the interest rate swap contracts outstanding at the end 
of the reporting period.

The interest rate swaps settle on a quarterly and monthly basis. The floating rate on the interest rate swaps is a 1 month LIBOR.  
The Group will settle the difference between the fixed and floating interest rate on a net basis.
All interest rate swap contracts exchanging floating rate interest amounts for fixed rate interest amounts are designated as cash flow 
hedges in order to reduce the Group’s cash flow exposure resulting from variable interest rates on borrowings.

Annual Report and Accounts 2015 118 Foreign currency risk
The Group does not trade internationally, and has no material foreign currency risk.
Maturity of non-derivative financial instruments
The Group’s non-derivative financial assets consist of cash and trade and other receivables, both of which are non-interest bearing.  
The Group expected maturity for its non-derivative financial assets is less than one year.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities with agreed repayment 
periods. The tables have been drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on 
which the Group can be required to pay. The table includes both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are 
floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from the prevailing 3 month LIBOR rate at the balance sheet date. The contractual 
maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.

34. Dividends
For 2015, the Board has not recommended a dividend (2014:1.8 pence per ordinary share, a total cost of £3.1m).
35. Post balance sheet events
On 26 April 2016 the Board and the Group’s lending banks agreed terms for amendment of the Group’s £290.0m Facilities Agreement,  
the principal provisions of which are that a fee of £2.9m (representing 1% of the total Facilities) is payable immediately, with a flat rate 
margin of 3.75% over LIBOR payable on the amounts drawn under the Facilities. Furthermore, the Facilities are split into “Tranche A” of 
£120.0m and “Tranche B” of £170.0m. Additional interest of 10% per year is to be accrued on Tranche A and paid on repayment or expiry 
of Tranche A. Should Tranche A not be repaid by 30 April 2017, then a further fee of £4.0m is payable. An exit fee of up to £10.0m is 
payable on repayment of Tranche A which expires on 30 September 2017. Tranche B expires on 31 March 2019. The Group has also 
amended its covenants and a number of information undertakings under the agreed terms.

Notes to the Parent Company financial statements 
For the year ended 31 December 2015
1. Summary of significant accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The individual financial statements of Cambian Group plc (the “Company”) have been prepared in accordance with UK Law and applicable 
UK accounting standards. The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under Financial Reporting Standard (FRS) 100, issued 
by the Financial Reporting Council (FRC). Accordingly, the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with FRS 101 Reduced 
Disclosure Framework. The financial statements have been prepared on a historical cost basis.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to 
share-based payments, financial instruments, capital management, presentation of comparative information in respect of certain assets, 
presentation of a cash flow statement and certain related party transactions.
Investments in subsidiary companies
Investments in subsidiaries are recognised at cost less, where appropriate, provisions for impairment. All investments held by the 
Company are in its subsidiaries.
Going concern
As indicated on page 37 of the annual report, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future having considered the Company forecasts and projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance and the current economic uncertainty. Accordingly, they have adopted the going 
concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of loan issue costs, when the relevant contracts are entered into. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 
12 months after year-end.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity and the shares are fully paid up. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Share issue costs incurred directly in connection 
with a business combination are shown as a deduction from equity.
Share-based payments
Equity-settled share-based payments to employees and others providing similar services are measured at the fair value of the equity 
instruments at the grant date. The fair value excludes the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. 
Cambian Group plc
Annual Report and Accounts 2015 122 The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the 
vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of equity instruments that will eventually vest. At each balance sheet date, the Company 
revises its estimate of the number of equity instruments expected to vest as a result of the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. 
The impact of the revision of the original estimates, if any, is recognised in profit or loss such that the cumulative expense reflects the revised 
estimate, with a corresponding adjustment to equity reserves.

The borrowings above are shown net of loan issue costs incurred at inception of the loan.
As at 1 January 2015 the Group had financed all of its debt with a senior term loan of £75.0m and revolving facilities agreement of 
£180.0m (“the facilities”), totalling £255.0m, provided by a syndicate of banks, and secured over the assets of the Group. The facilities 
were subsequently extended by £35.0m on 26 March 2015 to fund the acquisition of By the Bridge. Loans drawn under the facilities  
carry an interest rate of between 2.00% and 2.75% above LIBOR.
At 31 December 2015, £75.0m was drawn under a fixed term loan and £181.5m was drawn under the revolving credit facilities,  
both expiring on 31 March 2019.
As at 31 December 2015, the Group had breached the loan covenants, and consequently all borrowings are now current liabilities.  
Subsequent to year end, the Group has agreed terms for the amendment of its facilities, refer to note 9.

The derivative financial instruments were entered into to manage the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk on its external borrowings.
All derivative financial instruments are classified as Level 2 in accordance with the IFRS 13 hierarchy. Level 2 fair value measurements  
are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly 
(i.e. as a price) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
6. Deferred tax asset
Deferred tax is calculated in full on temporary differences under the liability method using a tax rate of either 18% or 19% (2014: 20%) 
dependent on when the amount is expected to unwind.
The below table represents the deferred tax assets recognised by the Company and movements thereon during the current and prior

8. Profit for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for  
the year. The company reported a loss for the financial year ended 31 December 2015 of £7.6m (2014: £9.7m).
9. Post balance sheet events
On 26 April 2016 the Board and the Group’s lending banks agreed terms for amendment of the Group’s £290.0m Facilities Agreement,

This is our third integrated report and is designed to provide a concise 
overview of how we generate value for all stakeholders.  By following 
an integrated reporting model, we aim to show how our competitive 
advantage is sustainable in the short, medium, and long term. While 
this report focuses on value generation for our shareholders, it also 
demonstrates how we interact with all of our stakeholders.
What is integrated about this report?
In producing this report we have: built upon the key changes introduced 
previously; and developed it in line with the evolving practices in integrated 
reporting. Our future reports will seek to keep up with these new developments 
and achieve our aim of continually improving our stakeholder communications. 
The steps we have taken on this journey so far:
Future orientation
Our business model continues to evolve to provide greater clarity on how 
we create value in the short, medium and long term, ultimately showing 
that we are a sustainable business. 
Connectivity 
Integrated reporting has helped us to ensure connectivity of our thinking 
in every aspect of our business. Our business model is informed by our 
strategic thinking, and our strategy is informed by sustainability and risk 
considerations. T o reflect this we have increased the signposting and 
consistency between sections to show how they connect and interact.
Stakeholder relationships
We have set out the nature and quality of our key stakeholder relationships. 
We have provided details of: how we engage with these groups; how we 
address the issues that affect them; and how each contributes to deliver 
value.
Materiality
T o demonstrate the interdependencies between our resources, our 
relationships and the sustainability of our business, we have identified 
the material items which affect our ability to create value. We have also 
prioritised these items in our risk considerations. These material items are 
integrated into our business model and strategy.
Consistency and comparability
We have provided three-year KPIs throughout this report to make 
comparisons easy, both with previous years’ progress and across other 
organisations. 
Conciseness
We have removed repetition where possible, increased signposting where 
relevant, and made the structure of the report logical and intuitive. We have 
integrated sustainability throughout the report to reflect how it informs 
every business decision we make. We have included our key corporate 
responsibility requirements within the Directors’ Report on page 37, and 
included case studies of our charity and other CSR initiatives into the 
relevant strategy pages.
Reliability and completeness 
This report aims to approach material matters both positive and negative 
in a fair, balanced and understandable way.
Throughout this report, we have included case studies to bring our story  
to life. These case studies illustrate in more depth some of the specific 
ways in which we have executed our strategic objectives and show 
examples of our varied CSR activities which we consider important to  
our strategic performance.
Our Integrated Report
In producing this report we 
have: built upon the key 
changes introduced previously;

the evolving practices in

Chairman’s Statement
It has been a year of change 
for the management team: Jill 
McDonald joined as CEO in May 
2015 and Jonny Mason as CFO 
a few months later. Both have 
settled in quickly and have made 
a strong impact. The change of 
management provided us an 
opportunity to step back and take 
another detailed look at the Group 
and its strategic plans. This re-
affirmed our previously held view 
that Halfords is a fundamentally 
strong business operating in 
good, growing markets. It also 
identified that the turnaround 
the business had gone through 
in the last three years under the 
Getting into Gear strategy was 
impressive; colleagues are much 
more engaged and customers 
have noticed and benefitted 
from the changes. However, it 
also identified that the job to 
modernise Halfords was not 
yet done and that we needed 
This is an exciting time to be 
part of Halfords. We have a clear 
strategic plan aimed at driving 
sustainable long-term growth 
delivered by engaged  
and talented  
colleagues.
to continue to invest to enable 
sustainable long-term growth. As 
a consequence, the new Moving 
Up A Gear strategy was launched 
in November 2015.
These plans are fully laid out in 
the Annual Report, along with 
explanations of the  progress 
already made.
Performance
Following two years of strong 
sales growth in Retail, this was 
always going to be a challenging 
year, particularly for our cycling 
business. The weather wasn’t 
helpful either, but I’m pleased to 
report that  financial performance 
was solid for Retail, with robust 
sales growth from the motoring 
side of the business and a sound 
performance for Autocentres was 
achieved as it executed on its 
plans. As a result, we generated 
growth in underlying earnings 
per share. Confidence in the 
Group’s future prospects and the 
cash generative nature of the 
business has enabled the Board 
to recommend a full year dividend 
of 17.0p, an increase of 3.0%.
Our colleagues have been 
resilient and committed 
throughout, working hard to drive 
sales and implement the strategic 
priorities. I was particularly 
pleased that Halfords was again 
awarded a place in the list of 
T op 25 Best Companies T o Work 
For as well as winning awards 
for community partnerships 
and developing colleagues. 
Well trained, highly engaged 
and happy colleagues will lead, 
in turn, to satisfied, supportive 
customers.

Outlook
This is an exciting time to be 
part of Halfords. We have a clear 
strategic plan aimed at driving 
sustainable long-term growth 
delivered by engaged and 
talented colleagues. On behalf 
of the Board, I would like to thank 
all of our 11,000 colleagues for 
their hard work and commitment, 
and also their enthusiasm in 
embracing the new strategy. 
I would also like to extend a 
warm welcome to the Tredz 
and Wheelies businesses and 
colleagues. We look forward to 
the year ahead.

In November we 
launched our Moving 
up a Gear strategy 
aimed at driving 
sustainable long-term 
growth, with good  
progress to date.
Chief Executive’s Statement
Summary of Group Results 
Sales of £1,021.5m were up 1.7%, 
with like-for-like (“LFL”) revenue 
growth of 1.5%. Group gross 
margin was broadly unchanged at 
53.2%. T otal operating costs rose 
by 1.8% reflecting volume-driven 
cost increases and investments 
made in key areas of the business 
offset by targeted cost savings. 
Investment in the expansion of 
Autocentres continued as the 
business added eleven centres 
and in Retail we opened six Cycle 
Republic shops. 
Group earnings before non-
recurring items, finance costs, 
depreciation and amortisation 
(“Underlying EBITDA ”) were up 
4.3% to £114.6m. Group earnings 
before finance costs, tax and non-
recurring items (“Underlying EBIT”) 
were £84.5m, which compares 
with £84.6m in the prior year. Profit 
before tax and non-recurring items 
was £81.5m and earnings per 
share before non-recurring items 
was 33.2p, up 0.5% and 1.5% 
respectively .  
The cashflow performance 
remained robust with operating 
cashflows more than offsetting the 
impact of our capital expenditure 
programme. Net debt at the end 
of the year was down £13.9m at 
£47.9m, with a net debt to EBITDA 
ratio of 0.4:1 versus 0.6:1 in the 
prior year.
Car Maintenance LFL revenues 
increased by 3.4%, driven by 
good growth in sales of car parts, 
workshop products and the fitting 
and sale of bulbs, blades and 
batteries (“3Bs”). The Halfords own 
brand oil further consolidated its 
number one market position and 
some of our innovations, such as 
130% brighter bulbs, performed 
strongly . Car Enhancement LFL 
revenues increased by 1.0%, 
supported by exclusive products, 
innovation and expert service, and 
dash cams and in-car connectivity 
sales grew strongly . The growth in 
sales of this “new technology” for 
the first time offset the continued 
decline of sat nav sales; the latter 
continuing to decrease as a result 
of the structurally-declining market. 
Our We-Fit proposition drove 
an increase in sales of car audio 
products and services. T ravel 
Solutions LFL revenues increased 
2.8%, driven by growth in child car 
seats and camping equipment.
Cycling sales declined by 0.9% 
on a like-for-like basis. This was 
principally driven by the previously 
highlighted challenging July and 
August for mainstream bikes, due 
to a number of factors including 
particularly strong comparatives, 
poor weather and discounting 
across the market. Bike sales 
returned to growth in Q3 and Q4. 
Parts, Accessories and Clothing 
(“P ACs”) sales declined in the year 
and this is a focus area for us to 
improve over the medium-term. 
Service-related sales increased by 
8.5%, driven in particular by cycle 
repair and elements of motoring 
fitting, such as audio and roof 
boxes. We also introduced new 
services including “2Bs” (bulbs and 
batteries) fitting for motorbikes and 
windscreen chip repair for cars.
Online Retail revenues grew by 
1.4% and represented 12.1% of 
total Retail sales (FY15: 12.1%). The 
importance of our store network 
and service overlay continued to be 
highlighted by the strength of Click 
& Collect, with around 90% of online 
orders picked up in store. 
Jill McDonald 
Chief Executive Operational Review: 
Autocentres
T otal Autocentres revenues were 
up 4.1% and, on a LFL basis, up 
2.5%. Gross margin improved 
by 90 basis points in the year, 
reflecting a lower tyre mix and 
an increase in service, MOT and 
repair margins. Operating costs 
increased by 5.8%, with the 
majority of the increase coming 
from new centres opened in recent 
years and the balance due to 
pay rises, enhanced training and 
investments in support functions. 
Underlying EBITDA increased by 
13.2% to £8.6m. 
Eleven new Autocentres were 
opened and two were closed, 
taking the total number of 
Autocentre locations to 314 at the 
end of the year. 24 centres were 
refurbished during the year, taking 
the total new or refurbished to just 
over 10% of the estate. 10-15 new 
centres will be opened in the year 
ahead and any sub-optimal centres 
will continue to be closed.
Market Update
A full review and update of the 
markets in which we operate is set 
out on pages 8 to 9. 
The Board has recommended a 
final dividend of 11.3 pence per 
share (FY15: 11.0 pence) which, if 
approved, would take the full-year 
dividend to 17.0 pence per share, 
an increase of 3.0% on the prior 
year. If approved, the final dividend 
will be paid on 26 August 2016 to 
shareholders on the register at 
the close of business on 5 August 
2016. The Board continues to 
target to grow the dividend every 
year with an average cover of 
around 2 times over time. 
We have announced a target for 
debt of 1.0x EBITDA with a range 
up to 1.5x to allow for appropriate 
M&A. This is a prudent level for 
debt, taking account of our regular 
strong cashflow, no pension deficit 
and shorter, more flexible leases 
than many other UK retailers.  Our 
priorities for capital allocation are 
explained later in this report. 
Operational Review: Retail
Halfords Retail achieved a solid 
year of sales performance in the 
context of the trading conditions, 
with sales up 1.2% to £868.5m. LFL 
growth of 1.3% reflected Motoring 
LFL of +2.5% and Cycling LFL of 
-0.9%. The weather was not helpful, 
with both a wet summer and a 
mild winter, including the warmest 
December since records began. 
Despite this, the motoring side of 
our business, which contributes 
around 70% of Group sales, was 
resilient and reflected the healthy 
underlying market indicators and 
the service-led proposition.

Halfords Business Review
Our goal is to be customers’ first 
choice for their life on the move 
and we will achieve this by being 
Committed to Making Customers’ 
Journeys Better.
In November we set out the 
evolution in strategy from Getting 
Into Gear to Moving Up a Gear. In 
Retail this new strategy has five 
key pillars:
•	 Putting Customers in the 
Driving Seat — investing in 
customer data and insight 
capabilities to maximise the 
lifetime customer value 
•	 Service in our DNA — 
embedding the focus on 
customer service
•	 Building on our Uniqueness 
— exclusive products, relevant 
innovation and unique 
partnerships, such as our 
new collaboration with British 
Olympian and T our de France 
winner Sir Bradley Wiggins
•	 Better Shopping Experience 
— a seamless customer 
experience, online as well as 
in store
•	 Fit for the Future 
Infrastructure — moving from 
fixing the basics to improving 
efficiency and fulfillment 
On pages 14 to 15 we have set 
out a more detailed explanation 
of the Retail strategy and on 
pages 16 to 19 we have explained 
in more detail our progress on 
each of these pillars. On pages 
20 to 21 we have explained 
our Autocentres strategy and 
progress during FY16.
Financial Targets 
In November we set out four key 
financial targets, which we reaffirm 
and update below:
•	 Grow sales faster than the 
markets in which we operate. 
We anticipate that the motoring 
market will grow at an average 
rate of 2–3% per annum and the 
cycling market at an average 
rate of 3–5% per annum over 
the medium-term. We will aim 
to beat whatever those growth 
rates are.
• Maintain Group EBITDA % 
margin roughly flat over the 
next few years as we continue 
to invest for sustainable growth. 
• Grow the dividend per share 
every year with coverage of 
around 2 times underlying 
earnings on average over time.
• A debt target of 1.0 times 
EBITDA with a range up to 1.5 
times to allow for appropriate 
M&A. We have set out below 
some important principles in 
this regard. 
Capital Structure and 
Priorities
Our top priority will be to maintain 
a strong balance sheet. The 
debt target has been set at a 
prudent level, taking into account 
the strong, regular cash flow 
generation, no pension deficit and 
shorter, more flexible leases than 
many UK retailers.   
Our priorities for use of cash, 
based on the balance sheet 
described above, will be firstly 
capital investment to grow the 
business in line with previous 
guidance, secondly to pay and 
grow the ordinary dividend every 
year within a cover ratio of 2x on 
average over time, thirdly for any 
appropriate M&A opportunities 
which may arise and thereafter any 
excess cash would be available 
for additional distribution to 
shareholders.
The debt target and range is 
intended as guidance rather than 
a hard and fast rule. We anticipate 
moving towards the debt target 
over time. Our clear priority at 
present is investment to deliver the 
Moving Up A Gear strategy and for 
growth.  
Acquisition of Tredz and 
Wheelies
Subsequent to the year end, 
on 23 May 2016 the Group 
acquired T redz Limited (“T redz”) 
and Wheelies Direct Limited 
(“Wheelies”). T redz is a UK-wide 
online retailer of premium bikes 
and cycling parts, accessories 
and clothing. It also operates four 
stores in South Wales. Wheelies 
is the UK’s largest provider of 
bicycle replacement for insurance 
companies. 
Collectively, these businesses 
generated revenue of circa £32m 
for the year ended 29 February 
2016, up from circa £24m in the 
prior year, and EBITDA of £2.4m. 
The initial cash consideration is 
£18.4m and has been settled from 
the Group’s existing borrowing 
facilities. Dependent upon the 
financial performance of T redz 
in the year ending 28 February 
2017, there will be an element of 
deferred consideration payable in 
12 months. 
From a customer and supplier 
perspective the businesses will 
continue to trade on a standalone 
basis and will continue to be led by 
the existing management teams. 
The businesses have strong 
web development capability 
and are supported by office and 
warehousing premises in Swansea. 
The majority of sales are fulfilled 
from the warehouse operation 
where a team of highly skilled and 
experienced bike technicians build 
bikes which are then carefully 
boxed and delivered direct to 
customers’ homes.
This acquisition is a strong and 
complementary addition to the 
Group, extending our presence 
in the online market for premium 
bikes, parts, accessories and 
clothing. 
Current Activity
As we look ahead there is plenty to 
do as we implement Moving Up a 
Gear and we’ve already built good 
momentum. The year ahead will 
be a busy one, both for product 
developments and strategic 
progress.
In Motoring, we are embedding 
our new motorcycle product 
and service offer, building our 
new windscreen chip repair 
service, launching exclusive 
in-car technology products, 
further expanding our ranges 
and developing our trade offer. In 
Cycling we have just launched our 
Orla Kiely collaboration and there 
will be a refresh of our Apollo and 
Carrera bike ranges, the launch 
of the Wiggins and T rott ranges 
and extended online PACs range 
through Cycle Republic.
The key focuses under the Moving 
Up A Gear plan include building 
relationships with more of our 
customers, growing more service-
related revenue, continuing to 
improve our colleague training 
and retention, implementing 
transformational colleague and 
customer-facing distribution and 
IT development and improving 
on our successful store refresh 
programme with the Store of the 
Future concept.
In Autocentres we remain 
committed to new centre 
openings, along with the 
continuation of a roll-out across 
the wider estate of the refresh 
programme. We are also investing 
in a new electronic point of sale 
system, which will enable us to 
stock and sell Retail products in our 
centres, jointly source parts with 
Retail and implement an e-diary.
I would like to thank all colleagues 
for their fantastic contribution, 
support and commitment to the 
further progress and performance 
made in Halfords this year.

Discovering  
Potential
Halfords was awarded a new ‘Discovering 
Potential’ award by Sunday Times Top 100 
Companies, presented by Employment 
Minister, Priti Patel. slugline
Our Marketplace
Halfords principally operates in 
two broad markets: Motoring and 
Cycling. Around 70% of Group 
sales are generated from products 
that are principally Motoring 
related with the remaining 30% 
coming from Cycling. At a profit 
level, the contribution of Motoring 
is even greater.
The Motoring Market
Within Motoring, the Halfords 
Group operates in two segments:
•	 Car parts, accessories, 
consumables and technology , 
with a total market worth up 
to an estimated £7bn. This 
element of the Motoring market 
has grown by around 3% per 
annum in the last few years. 
Halfords Retail competes in a 
portion of this market worth 
circa £3bn, holding around a 
15% market share.
•	 Car servicing and aftercare, 
with a total market worth 
around £9bn. This element 
of the market has grown by 
around 2% per annum in the 
last few years and is where 
Autocentres competes, 
holding around 1.5% share of 
a highly fragmented market.
Going forward we anticipate the 
Motoring market to continue to 
grow at an average rate of 2-3% 
per annum over the medium-
term. The number of cars on the 
road is rising and the mileage 
being driven is increasing. The 
number of new car registrations in 
2015 was the highest on record. 
The average age of cars in the UK 
is steady at around 7.5 years.
Cars are also becoming more 
complex, with greater variety 
of models and enhanced 
technology making it more 
difficult or even impossible for 
people to “Do it Yourself”. For 
example, replacing a stop-start 
battery requires connection 
with the on-board computer — 
something that Halfords stores 
and colleagues are equipped 
to do, but is not possible for 
an individual. This complexity, 
combined with a change in 
needs from increasingly time-
poor consumers, is driving the 
“Do It For Me” trend.
Our product ranges continue 
to evolve in line with market 
requirements and advances 
in automotive technology. For 
example, stop-start batteries are 
becoming increasingly prevalent 
and we have the right equipment 
and fully-trained colleagues to 
be able to cater to this demand, 
both in our Retail stores and our 
Autocentres. 
We continue to see good 
growth in some subsections of 
our in-car technology offering. 
In-car cameras (“dash cams”) 
continue to be very popular 
and we are uniquely placed 
to offer a comprehensive 
advice and fitting service for 
these products. Multimedia, 
connectivity and streaming 
technology continue to grow as 
customers look for ways to bring 
their in-car environment more 
technologically up-to-date. 
The sat nav market continues 
to decline, but this is becoming 
an increasingly smaller and less 
important part of our business. 
Key products such as child car 
seats continue to be important 
for customers and are providing 
growth. 
Likewise, the services we offer 
alongside our products continue 
to evolve, as evidenced by the 
continued success of our “3Bs” 
(bulbs, blades, batteries) fitting 
service. In FY16 in the Retail 
stores we sold nearly 9 million 3B 
products and fitted 38% of these 
on demand. 
The growth in new drivers, cars, 
miles driven and car complexity 
is also an opportunity for our 
Autocentres business to attract 
and retain new customers. Trust, 
value, convenience and the 
attitude of our colleagues are 
also key to doing this as well 
as retaining our long-standing 
Halfords customers.
The Cycling Market
The Cycling market is not 
particularly well documented, 
with data difficult to come 
by, which is reflective of the 
fragmented nature of the 
operators within it. As such we 
conduct our own extensive, 
bespoke customer and market 
research, some of which we have 
included below.
The Cycling market had been 
growing at a compound annual 
growth rate of around 6–8% over 
the three years prior to 2015. 
The market for bikes is estimated 
to be around £800m and for 
parts, accessories and clothing 
(“PACs”) around £750m. In 
recent years we have gained 
share in bikes, now standing 
at around 24% of the market. 
Our share of the PACs market 
has remained steady at around 
15%. In cycle repair, a market of 
around £100m, our investments 
in equipment and people have 
resulted in strong growth, and we 
believe we have been continuing 
to take share over the past 12 
months.
Our Cycling sales were 
particularly strong over 2013  
and 2014 due to a combination 
of factors:
•	 The economic conditions 
were favourable with true 
disposable income recovering 
to drive big ticket purchases.
•	 There was plenty of positive 
media coverage driving 
awareness around cycling — 
the fantastic achievements 
of T eam GB at the London 
Olympics, the T our de France 
starting in Yorkshire and more 
amateur cycling and triathlon 
events. 
•	 The Government has 
continued to invest in 
infrastructure and safety, 
particularly	in	London.

•	 Whilst the Cycle to Work 
initiative has been in place  
for some time now, 
awareness and participation 
grew significantly over those 
years.
•	 Finally, we saw consistently 
warm and sunny summers in 
2013 and 2014.
New cyclists look for entry level 
bicycles around the £200–300 
mark and our fantastic Apollo 
and Carrera ranges meant 
Halfords was better positioned 
than most to benefit from this.
Looking forward we have 
confidence in the long-
term growth potential of the 
cycling market, based on 
our understanding of the 
customer and macro factors, 
both economic and social. 
We anticipate that the Cycling 
market will grow by 3-5% per 
annum on average.
Our research has identified 
cyclists by how they use their 
bike and how often they use it, 
and although there are many 
subtleties in the segmentation, 
we broadly see three types of 
customers:
•	 Those who use their bike for 
leisure; cycling with family and 
friends for light exercise
•	 Those who commute
•	 Those who are cycling 
for fitness and potentially 
entering competitions and 
cycling with clubs.
The fitness cyclists are not the 
only set who cycle frequently 
and are engaged or enthusiastic 
about cycling. Our research has 
revealed that many of the leisure 
cyclists are cycling just as often 
and are just as engaged.
Reflecting on the different 
customers, we know that 
we over-index in our share 
of cyclists riding for leisure 
purposes and conversely under-
index with those who cycle for 
fitness or cycle in clubs. We 
know these groups behave and 
therefore spend differently, so 
we have a dual offering in cycling 
with Halfords and now Cycle 
Republic.
The total pool of people now 
cycling has increased and they 
are cycling more often and more 
miles than previously. We have 
confidence that those who are 
currently cycling will continue to 
do so. Our research shows that 
these more frequent cyclists 
replace their bikes more often; 
a large proportion of frequent 
cyclists plan to replace their 
bikes within the next year. 
Fitness cyclists are more likely 
to increase their bike spend the 
most,	sometimes	doubling	it. 	
They are also the group that buy 
more PACs.
Our research also looked at 
those not cycling today and we 
were very encouraged by the 
proportion of them that intended 
to buy a bike in the near term.
In addition to understanding 
the customer we’ve also looked 
at future market drivers. We 
know that participation in the 
UK is still low and there is large 
scope for new entrants as 
well as increased spend from 
existing cyclists. Also, female 
participation is particularly low, 
but growing. This presents an 
opportunity for us because 
we know that an increase in 
female cyclists will also drive an 
increase in families and children 
taking up cycling. Furthermore, 
there is significant government 
support in London and in many 
other cities. For example, there 
are now four cycle super-
highways in London and five 
more to come.
Looking specifically at recent 
market performance, our 
analysis suggests that the 
market declined in the last 12 
months, due to the reasons 
explained in the operational 
review. This decline was 
principally attributed to the 
summer of 2015. Since then 
we have observed a gradual 
stabilising of market conditions, 
notwithstanding that it may take 
some time to return to consistent 
growth and the weather 
continues to have an impact on 
the timing of customer purchase. 
However we remain confident 
in the long-term growth 
prospects of the cycling market. 
Participation in the UK is still low 
and there is large scope for new 
cyclists as well as increased 
spend from existing cyclists. 
This is supported by significant 
government support in London 
and in many other cities, as well 
as consumer trends towards 
healthy activities.
A ‘win-win’ collaboration 
We understand the fear many adults have of getting back on a bike 
after years out of the saddle so, to help, we partnered with British 
Cycling’s Breeze network.  British Cycling’s Breeze network is the 
largest programme in Britain, designed specifically to get more 
women cycling. Led by women for women, Breeze is underpinned 
by an amazing network of volunteers — Breeze Champions — who 
organise local rides catering to all levels, from grassroots up.
The partnership is a ‘win-win’ collaboration, increasing the profile of British Cycling’s 
Breeze network and supporting our appetite to grow women’s cycling.  In addition 
to promoting the network to customers on our website and through emails, in FY16 
we piloted bike maintenance workshops in partnership with Breeze, with over 2,500 
women attending and 97% saying they’d recommend the workshop to others. Later 
in the summer our cycle mechanic crew supported cycle events organised by 
Breeze, with a team of Halfords colleagues also taking part. The partnership has 
also provided the opportunity for colleagues to become Breeze champions too.

A better life cycle
Transforming people’s lives
A full cycle mechanic training facility set up inside Onley Prison, trains 
prisoners to become professional cycle mechanics. Offenders work 
on children’s bicycles that have been handed in at participating stores 
and these, along with new bike helmets, are then donated to schools in 
disadvantaged areas. 
The programme offers the very best candidates an opportunity to become 
full-time Halfords colleagues, helping them to rebuild their lives following 
their sentences and providing Halfords with fully trained and committed 
colleagues. 15 have so far graduated and been offered jobs.
The programme has had a lot of high profile government interest 
culminating in a visit to the workshop by Prime Minister, David Cameron. 
Plans are underway to set up a second cycle workshop at Drake Hall’s 
women’s prison providing further opportunities for rehabilitation. 
In some areas of Africa, a bike can be the only 
means of transport. Owning a bike enables 
people to travel to work or school, and carry 
goods or passengers, whilst small scale farmers 
and traders can reach customers further afield. 
The bikes can similarly be an invaluable resource 
for travelling health workers and provide access 
to training and employment, helping to improve 
lives in a sustainable way.  However, bikes can 
be too expensive for the majority in Africa. 
Additionally, the skills to maintain the bikes  
might not exist. 
Our charity partner, Re~Cycle, helps to address 
this. Not only by getting bikes over to Africa but 
also by teaching local people how to repair and 
maintain the bikes, helping to improve lives in 
a sustainable way. We provide opportunities 
for customers to donate unwanted bikes via 
national trade-in events and also  
at over 75 stores on an ongoing basis. 
Over 20,000 bikes have been donated so 
far, resulting in 300 tonnes of bikes being 
diverted from landfill /disuse and benefitting 
an estimated 120,000 beneficiaries in Africa 
(household research in Ghana shows that 
each bike is used by an average of six people). 
Halfords’ colleagues have also raised over 
£295,000 to help support the charity’s costs.

Operational Review — Retail
In recent months we have been rapidly 
improving our customer data knowledge 
and capability. We introduced e-receipts 
in January across all stores and since 
then have collected over 1 million email 
addresses, of which the majority are new 
contacts to our database. For the 12 months 
to the end of April 2016 we can match 15% 
of Retail sales to customers, up from 3% as 
of November 2015. We have joined up our 
online and in-store customer databases 
in Retail, meaning that we can now match 
online orders to customers when they 
collect in store. Over the course of the year 
we will develop a complete single view of 
customer, which involves joining up all of the 
numerous customer databases within Retail, 
Cycle Republic and Autocentres. 
Investment in customer data has allowed 
us to move from generic email marketing 
to a more personalised approach. In recent 
weeks we have started our first tailored 
email campaigns. For example, anyone 
buying a bike and agreeing to submit their 
details will, for the first time, receive an email 
Putting Customers

operational review on pages 20 and 21
Helping families cycle safer
A major factor parents worry about when 
cycling is safety and the confidence to 
fix things, as and when problems occur. 
Through workshops colleagues share 
their knowledge and expertise, to give 
customers the confidence to get out on 
their bikes. The majority of workshops 
focus on primary school children, an  
age when they are often starting to  
cycle without adults and are also  
doing Bikeability.
reminder to come in to have their free 6-week 
bike check. Also, after any purchase online or 
in-store, the following day the customer will 
receive a “we recommend” email containing 
6 products; this is driven by a bespoke 
recommendation engine built for Halfords. We 
will develop more of these tailored campaigns 
in the months ahead. This summer we will also 
commence a customer discovery project, 
where we will use the enhanced data to 
segment customers and better understand 
shopping habits. We will share some of these 
insights in due course.
There is more to be done. In FY17 the 
implementation of the new electronic point 
of sale (“EPOS”) system towards the end of 
the year will, apart from delivering operational 
enhancements, provide benefits for customer 
data, enabling store colleagues to look up 
customer details in a live customer database 
at the till and improving the speed and 
accuracy of matching and customer interface.
Another key part of Putting Customers in 
the Driving Seat is a new brand positioning. 
Over the past few years our messaging 
to consumers has been focused around 
price and spot buys, rather than creating a 
relationship with the brand. In a few days’ time 
we will be launching a new Halfords Brand 
positioning and new brand look and feel 
across a number of customer touch points, 
including advertising campaigns, website 
design and in-store marketing, under the 
strapline of Halfords – For Life’s Journeys. 
This is a significant change of approach and 
is designed to create a more emotional and 
relevant connection to the brand. We are also 
improving the richness of online content, with 
more videos and “how to” guides, positioning 
Halfords as a friend in times of need. At this 
stage we are not embarking on a complete 
and immediate change to external branding 
of stores or a complete change of in-store 
point-of-sale collateral. Rather, these will 
change over time as and when they come up 
for refresh, in order to provide a more cost-
effective rollout. 
In November we explained that we needed 
to improve our value perception. Value is an 
equation of the right price, great service and 
outstanding quality. The relative importance 
of each factor varies by category and we 
have assessed our products and services 
accordingly. We have already introduced new 
opening price points in order to improve the 
value perception where we are, for example, 
competitive on pricing of the “better” and 
“best” products but don’t have a “good” 
equivalent to our competitors. 
Kids’ Bike Workshops
22,000 children and their 
parents attended free in-store 
bike workshops helping to 
improve their skills in basic bike 
maintenance and cycling safely, 
giving them greater confidence 
to go out cycling more. 96% 
of parents found the in-store 
workshops useful/very useful 
and 96% would recommend the 
workshop to other parents. 
Cub Bike Workshops
In FY16 we helped over 5,500 
Cubs achieve their Cyclist 
Activity Badge, with over 98% 
satisfaction.  In addition to a 
more advanced in-store based 
workshop, a resource pack also 
supports Cub Leaders.
16 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 1 April 2016 slugline
Services and service-related sales are a 
key part of this pillar of the strategy. We 
have recently introduced new services into 
our stores including windscreen chip repair 
and motorcycle bulb and battery fitting. 
We continue to look to add to and enhance 
the suite of services we offer. In November 
we introduced a new KPI: service-related 
sales. This is the income that Halfords 
derives from the sale of services and any 
associated products included within the 
same transactions. Our aim is to grow 
this faster than overall sales; in FY16 we 
achieved growth of 8.5%. 
Our customer service metrics continue to 
improve. The net promoter score is at its 
highest recorded level and has increased 
significantly year on year. We have decided 
to continue to use net promoter score, 
but we have opened up more channels 
for customers to give us their feedback 
including exit interviews as customers 
leave the store, carried out by an external 
third party.
Service in  
Our DNA
See our Chief Financial Officers’ 
review on pages 24 to 29
We remain committed to the 3-Gears training 
programme; 99% of eligible colleagues are at 
Gear 1, over 70% of colleagues had qualified 
for Gear 2 by the end of FY16 and we also 
now have over 600 colleagues trained to 
Gear 3 “guru” level. As of April 2016 we 
introduced the National Living Wage for our 
colleagues aged 25 and over, and at the 
same time introduced our 20p supplement 
for all colleagues upon qualifying for Gear 
1. This, combined with other changes to our 
pay structures, lifted the pay of all colleagues 
of the Halfords Group to above the minimum 
wage.
Our Retail apprenticeship scheme has now 
been in place for over a year and we have 
already placed nearly 200 trainees into 
permanent roles across our stores. We 
continue to build our pipeline of Assistant 
Store Managers and Store Managers through 
our Aspire programme; in FY16 all but two 
of our store manager roles in our Southern 
division were filled internally.
We have previously reported on the progress 
made on improving turnover of colleagues 
within 3 months of joining. This continues to 
be around 9%, having been over 20% three 
years ago. We have now turned our focus 
to improving the overall colleague turnover 
and this improved by 500 basis points within 
the last year. We were pleased to once again 
be included within the Sunday Times Best 
Companies T o Work For list, maintaining 
our 18th position, and our Retail colleague 
engagement score, surveyed annually each 
April, has been maintained at 82%; a strong 
result in the context of the more challenging 
trading conditions this year. 
School Bike Workshops
Colleagues also go out to primary schools each year to teach  
pupils in their final year bike maintenance and safety. 
Complementing the Government scheme Bikeability, which 
teaches children how to ride a bike safely; Gear-Up workshops 
show basic bike maintenance and safety hazards to avoid 
— key skills as pupils prepare to make the transition 
to secondary school.  5,500 pupils benefited from 
the programme in FY16; 96% of teachers found the 
school workshops useful/very useful and 92% would 
recommend the workshop to other teachers.

Over the last three years we have been working hard to improve 
the in-store and online experience for customers but, as we set 
out in November, there is more to be done. We continued to make 
ongoing enhancements to our fulfillment proposition, such as 
adding specific delivery time slots and extending the online order 
cut-off deadlines. 
Since May 2013 we have refreshed 97 stores under the Getting 
Into Gear programme. Customer feedback has been positive and 
the investments have justified themselves financially. As such we 
remain committed to the continuation of a refresh programme, 
but we have slowed down the pace of roll-out whilst we create the 
“Store of the Future” refresh concept. The initial design principles 
have now been agreed and we anticipate trialing the first concept 
in the second half of this year. Store of the Future builds on many 
of the features of our recent store refreshes and is building in 
technology to enable colleagues to better serve customers, create 
a hub for our We-Fit services and create more flexible spaces.
We are not locking down the refresh concept at this stage; as we 
learn from the trial we will look to evolve the concept over the next 
12 months. In the meantime we will continue to roll out a number of 
existing refresh concepts during FY17. Across both concepts, we 
anticipate refreshing 15 to 25 stores in the year.
Cycle Republic reached 10 stores by the end of the year and 
represented 0.5% of group revenue.  It was a difficult year to launch 
a new cycling concept because of the market conditions, but we 
are encouraged by the progress of the brand.  The next important 
step is to launch the new website, which will go live in the next few 
weeks.  In the year ahead, we will continue to roll out more stores, 
although fewer than last year, and will continue to implement 
lessons to develop the concept. We anticipate that sales in FY17 
will reach approximately 1% of group revenue and total capital 
expenditure for the three years to the end of FY17 will be around 
£5m, 4% of the Group total.
Exclusive products, relevant innovation and unique partnerships 
all strengthen our clear differentiation as a retailer. Over the last 
few months we have introduced the following new initiatives and 
products:
•	 Launched the world’s first 130% brighter bulb. In Q4 this was 
our second highest selling bulb.
•	 Introduced a lifetime guarantee on certain car batteries.
•	 Extended our range of motorcycle products to include 
a 2B’s (bulbs and batteries) product and fitting service 
for motorbikes, as well as a range of consumables and 
accessories. 
•	 Expanded our range in store and online of gifts and toys. 
For Christmas we had many new products including camera 
drones and Disney Frozen roller skates, as well as gift versions 
of our popular tool products.
•	 Launched the new range of Boardman Performance bikes.
During the year we commenced joint sponsorship with Yuasa of 
last year’s winning team in the British T ouring Car Championships 
(“BTCC”). Halfords previously sponsored a BTCC team from 2004 
to 2008.
In March we unveiled to the press our new Wiggins and Orla Kiely 
collaborations, which were both well received. The partnership 
with Orla Kiely comprises a range of cycling and leisure products 
and accessories and has recently launched online and in around 
250 Halfords Retail stores. The Wiggins range comprises bikes for 
toddlers to teenagers and priced at £99 to £450.
We have lots planned for FY17 including:
•	 An exclusive collaboration with Olympic Gold Medalist and 
World Champion cyclist Laura Trott to create a range of limited 
edition performance bikes for women under the Trott brand. 
These will be launched in stores and online in July, priced from 
£449.
•	 Our largest ever range of in-car connectivity products, with an 
emphasis on design, colour and technology, such as solar-
powered devices and branded items.
•	 First to market with an exclusive launch of digital in-car 
adaptors.
•	 Developing our trade offer, starting with the enabling of the 
trade cards to be used online.

Our Uniqueness
Operational Review — Retail continued
18 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 1 April 2016 slugline
In November we explained how investment in infrastructure remains a 
priority , but that the type of investment moves from being about fixing 
the foundations to customer and colleague-facing enhancements. 
This change in focus began during FY16 with projects such as 
the online marketplace, new tills in stores, electronic number-
plate lookups and bike finance online. There are also a number of 
developments that we have been working on in recent months that will 
launch in the coming weeks: a transactional Cycle Republic website, 
contactless payments in store and the ability to use trade cards online.
Looking ahead, our IT investment is focused on two key projects that 
we anticipate will be implemented over the next 12 months: a new 
electronic point of sale (“EPOS”) system and a new people resource 
planning tool.
The EPOS system will be rolled out across all stores and also 
into Autocentres. This will be the first major change to our 
EPOS system for many years. In Retail there are many benefits, 
including:
•	 improved customer data capability, including improved 
customer matching and the ability for colleagues to look up 
customers within a live single view database;
•	 an e-diary, with which customers can pre-book services, such 
as 3B fitting or cycle repair, and with which we can allocate 
resource accordingly;
Fit for Future  
Infastructure
•	 opportunities to improve in-store processes, such as goods 
in/out, processing vouchers and promotions, as well as 
eradicating many paper-based processes; and
•	 providing a modern and stable platform on which to implement 
other enhancements.
The new resource planning tool removes eleven systems and 
replaces them with one tool that we will use across stores, 
autocentres, the Support Centre and distribution centres. 
Colleagues and line managers will be able to log into the system to 
view and change shifts, as well as optimise scheduling of resource. 
Our supply chain infrastructure has undergone significant change 
over the last 18 months, having moved in October 2014 from 
1-day-a-week deliveries to store to a 5-day-a-week in-house 
delivery arrangement and then, in August 2015, to a 3-day-a-week 
outsourced delivery solution. This is now embedded, stable and 
working well; providing the benefits of good availability on a cost 
effective basis. Availability has remained at strong levels through the 
transition and thereafter. Concurrently, over the last few months we 
have been reviewing the long-term supply chain requirements. We 
have concluded that in order to support our future growth we will 
develop our warehouse infrastructure to improve customer service, 
but we do not anticipate such plans to cause any significant ongoing 
changes to warehouse and distribution operating costs or to the 
capital expenditure guidance we have previously given.

Our Autocentres Strategy
Description
Making our Autocentres the first choice for 
motorists across the UK is both the first 
step and the ultimate aim of our strategy. 
Description
We believe great service, delivered by 
engaged and motivated colleagues, who 
value customer feedback, guarantees a 
loyal and satisfied customer base.
While our convenient locations and 
consistent pricing can attract new 
customers, great service is what will keep 
them coming back. We are creating a 
culture of customer service among our 
colleagues, where their skills, knowledge 
and attitude combine to form great 
relationships with our customers.
Be First Choice  
for Motorists
A Service Customers

Description
Excellent technical service isn’t all our 
customers expect. We want centres we 
can be proud of, offering customers the 
consistent experience they expect from 
the Halfords brand. That means clean and 
tidy receptions, friendly colleagues willing 
to help and a great environment to wait for 
their vehicle.

popular online booking system which 
customers can access via tablets, desktop 
computers and smartphones.

20 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 1 April 2016 slugline
Continued progress on 
our strategy to attract 
and retain customers  
by building trust.
Like-for-like sales 
increased for the 10th 
consecutive quarter  
and customer service 
metrics improved.
Financial performance
T otal Autocentres revenues were up 4.1% 
and, on a LFL basis, up 2.5%. Gross margin 
improved by 90 basis points in the year, 
reflecting a lower tyre mix and an increase 
in service, MOT and repair margins. 
Operating costs increased by 5.8%, with 
the majority of the increase coming from 
new centres opened in recent years and the 
balance due to pay rises, enhanced training 
and investments in support functions. 
Underlying EBITDA increased by 13.2% to 
£8.6m. 
Eleven new Autocentres were opened and 
two were closed, taking the total number 
of Autocentre locations to 314 at the end 
of the year. 24 centres were refurbished 
during the year, taking the total new or 
refurbished to just over 10% of the estate. 
10-15 new centres will be opened in the 
year ahead and any sub-optimal centres will 
continue to be closed.
Strategic progress
The Autocentres strategy was launched 
in November 2014 and remains in place; 
with the focus on building trust with 
our customers. We continued to make 
good progress and we are seeing the 
improvements come through in customer 
service measures, but there remains much 
to be done.  
The standards in our centres continued 
to improve, evidenced in an improvement 
in customer retention and Net Promoter 
Score. We have introduced a new quality 
team, with the objective of continuing 
to improve the quality of workmanship. 
Following the trial of a new centre concept 
in Croydon in 2014 we have been rolling 
out to the rest of the estate some of the 
elements that have worked well, including

Indicators on pages 22 to 23
Description
The strength of the Halfords brand and the 
wider Group capabilities will help to ensure 
the success of our Autocentres. While 
Retail and Autocentres are separate parts 
of our Group, their capabilities are clearly 
linked, and cross-selling our services is a 
key part of our strategy going forwards.
Leverage the  
Halfords Brand
2016 Progress
•	 All centres now using Halfords anti-
freeze in addition to oil and batteries.
•	 Development commenced on new 
electronic point of sale system, which 
will enable centres to hold and sell Retail 
stock.
•	 Trial of email marketing to Retail 
customers.
Objectives
•	 T o operate common offers across 
both Autocentres and Retail, using our 
knowledge of each customer base 
to encourage customers of each to 
become customers of both. 
•	 T o sell jointly-sourced products.
•	 T o explore opportunities to cross-sell.
Operational Review  
— Autocentres
customer service pods, TV screens, Wi-Fi, 
coffee and large viewing windows. In the 
year all eleven new centres were opened 
in the new concept style and we also 
refreshed 24 centres. We will continue to 
refresh centres during FY17.
During the year we have increased the 
number of services you can book on the 
web and added timed slots.  We have 
trialled more customer-focused opening 
hours, such as Sundays and weekday 
evenings, and we are rolling this out on a 
gradual basis. We also trialled interest-free 
credit during the year and rolled this out 
across the business in February 2016.
In terms of leveraging the Halfords brand, 
we have continued to run a basic car check 
service consistently across our stores and 
garages. In addition to using Halfords car 
batteries and oils, our garages are now 
also using Halfords antifreeze. For the first 
time we have started to send emails to 
the Halfords Retail customer database to 
promote Autocentres’ services.
We have continued to invest in our people; 
training around 750 technicians in the year 
and continuing to invest in our apprentice 
scheme. Our training programmes are now 
externally recognised by the Automotive 
T echnician Accreditation. We are also 
introducing a new technician pay grading 
to suitably reward technicians and provide 
a clearer development path. 
Outlook
We remain committed to new centre 
openings, along with the continuation of 
a roll-out across the wider estate of the 
refresh programme. We are also investing 
in a new electronic point of sale system, 
which will enable us to stock and sell Retail 
products in our centres, jointly source 
parts with Retail and implement an e-diary.

Chief Financial Officer’s Review 
Halfords Group plc (the “Group”)
Reportable Segments
Halfords Group operates through two reportable business segments:
•	 Halfords Retail, operating in both the UK and Republic of Ireland; and
•	 Halfords Autocentres, operating solely in the UK.
All references to Group represent the consolidation of the Halfords (“Halfords Retail”/“Retail”) and Halfords 
Autocentres (“Halfords Autocentres”/“Autocentres”) trading entities.
The FY16 accounting period represents trading for the 52 weeks to 1 April 2016 (the “financial year”). The 
comparative period FY15 represents trading for the 53 weeks to 3 April 2015 (the “prior year”). We believe 
that the 52 week proforma results for FY15 better reflect the underlying performance of the business 
when compared to FY16. On this basis, all commentary included in this report is based on the 52 week 
period to 27 March 2015 unless otherwise stated.

costs £1.1m (FY15: £1.9m). 
Unallocated costs represent 
amortisation charges in respect 
of intangible assets acquired 
through business combinations, 
namely the acquisition of 
Nationwide Autocentres Limited 
in February 2010 and Boardman 
Bikes Limited and Boardman 
International Limited (together, 
“Boardman Bikes”) in June 2014, 
which arise on consolidation of 
the Group.  
Group EBITDA before non-
recurring items increased 4.3% to 
£114.6m (FY15: £109.9m), whilst 
net finance costs were £3.0m 
(FY15: £3.5m).
Group Profit Before Tax and 
non-recurring items for the year 
was up 0.5% at £81.5m (FY15: 
£81.1m).
Non-recurring costs during the 
year represented organisational 
restructuring costs of £1.7m 
across Retail and Autocentres. 
Net non-recurring costs in the 
prior year were £0.3m and are 
explained later in this report. 
Group Profit Before Tax in the 
year after non-recurring items 
was £79.8m (FY15: £80.8m).
Revenue for the Retail business 
of £868.5m reflected, on a 
constant-currency basis, a like-
for-like (“LFL”) sales increase of 
1.3%. Non-LFL stores, including 
6 new Cycle Republic store 
openings since the prior year, 
contributed £5.2m revenue in the 
year.
Motoring sales represented 
66% of Retail sales and grew 
by 2.5%. Car Maintenance LFL 
revenues increased by 3.4%. 
Growth in sales of car parts 
and workshop products more 
than offset a decline in winter-
related products. The fitting 
and sale of bulbs, blades and 
batteries (“3Bs”) continued to 
grow, helped by new innovation 
in the year such as the 130% 
brighter bulbs, and our Halfords 
branded oil maintained its 
number one market position. 
Car Enhancement LFL revenues 
increased by 1.0%. Dash cams 
and in-car connectivity sales 
grew strongly, reflecting Halfords’ 
authority in these categories, 
supported by exclusive products, 
innovation and expert service. 
Audio sales increased, driven by 
good growth in fitting services. 
Sat Nav sales continued to 
be impacted by structurally-
declining markets, with sales 
down in the year. Travel Solutions 
LFL revenues increased 2.8%, 
driven by child car seats and 
camping equipment.
Cycling sales declined by -0.9% 
on a like-for-like basis, driven 
by the -7.6% LFL recorded in 
Q2 offsetting positive or flat 
LFL performance in each of the 
other quarters. Q2’s performance 
reflected particularly strong 
comparatives exacerbated by 
poor weather, discounting across 
the market and annualising 
against the Yorkshire Grand 
Départ of the T our de France. 
Since then, bike sales have 
been in growth in each of Q3 
and Q4. Parts, Accessories and 
Clothing (“PACs”) sales declined 
in the year and this is a focus 
area for us to improve over the 
medium-term, beginning with 
the launch of the new Cycle 
Republic website in a few weeks’ 
time. Cycle Repair sales grew 
strongly in the year, reflecting our 
investments in equipment and 
colleagues, along with our focus 
on driving service-related sales.

Chief Financial Officer’s Review continued
Gross profit for the Retail 
business at £444.8m (FY15: 
£442.0m) represented 51.2% of 
sales, 30bps down on the prior 
year (FY15: 51.5%). The margin-
accretive factors principally 
comprised the mix benefit out 
of Cycling into higher margin 
Motoring along with the strong 
growth of service-related sales. 
These were more than offset by 
greater promotional activity in 
Cycling during the summer and 
increased third-party-branded 
product mix.
Operating Costs before non-
recurring items were £363.0m 
(FY15: £359.3m). The breakdown 
is set out below:

Support Costs 76.0 76.8 -1.0%
T otal Operating Costs before non-recurring items 363.0 359.3 +1.0%
Store Staffing costs increased 
by 3.3%, due mostly to the 
anniversary of the uplift in the 
national minimum wage and the 
3-Gears wage uplifts. The opening 
of 6 Cycle Republic stores also 
contributed to the increase. 
Partially offsetting these costs 
were improvements to in-store 
processes, such as bike building, 
stock put-away and cash counting. 
We’re currently working on the next 
batch of process re-engineering 
ideas. 
Store Occupancy costs decreased 
by 0.7%. Cost increases from 
rates, depreciation and Cycle 
Republic opening costs were 
offset by reduced rental charges 
as a result of favourable lease 
renegotiations.
Warehouse & Distribution costs 
increased by 5.0%. The year began 
with the continued operation of the 
in-house 5-day-a-week delivery 
schedule, before switching to the 
more cost effective out-sourced 
3-day-a-week delivery schedule 
at the beginning of August 2015. 
After three previous years of 
double digit % cost increases in 
Warehouse & Distribution costs 
and a period of transition over the 
last 18 months, we now have a 
stable solution that is delivering 
good availability.  In the second half 
of the year costs decreased 10.9% 
on the prior year.
Support Costs decreased by 1.0%, 
reflecting lower bonus accruals 
and efficiencies within marketing, 
including a rationalisation of the 
supplier base and a shift in the 
mix of activity towards digital 
marketing, partially offset by the 
impact of pay rises and increased 
depreciation.
The non-recurring items in the 
year represented organisational 
restructure costs.

Autocentres generated total

£147.0m), an increase of 4.1% on 
the prior year with a LFL revenue 
increase of 2.5%. LFL tyre 
revenues decreased by 3.0% and

Gross profit at £98.3m (FY15: 
£93.1m) represented a gross 
margin of 64.3%; an increase

combined with improved service, 
MOT and repair margins has 
driven the variance.
Autocentres’ EBITDA before 
non-recurring items of £8.6m was 
13.2% higher than FY15 (FY15: 
£7.6m), with the upside in gross 
profit being offset by continued 
cost investments as part of the 
on-going growth strategy. EBIT 
before non-recurring items was 
flat at £3.8m (FY15: £3.8m).
The non-recurring items in the 
year represented organisational 
restructure costs.
Portfolio Management 
The Retail store portfolio at 1 April 2016 comprised 472 stores (end of FY15: 467).

The six openings in the Retail portfolio were all Cycle Republic. Eleven new Autocentres were opened and 
two were closed in the year, taking the total number of Autocentre locations to 314 as at 1 April 2016 (end 
of FY15: 305).
With the exception of eight long leasehold and two freehold properties within Autocentres, the Group’s 
operating sites are occupied under operating leases, the majority of which are on standard lease terms, 
typically with a 5 to 15-year term at inception and with an average lease length of less than 7 years.
Management anticipates opening around 5 Cycle Republic stores and 10-15 Autocentres in FY17, as well 
as refreshing 15 to 25 Retail stores and Autocentres.

Chief Financial Officer’s Review continued
In the prior year, all non-recurring 
items arose within the 52 week 
period to 27 March 2015.
In the current year organisational 
restructuring was undertaken 
across Autocentres and Retail, 
mainly in their support centres, 
to better align resource to the 
implementation of the new 
strategy. 
Non-recurring costs in the prior 
year represented the net effect 
of: £0.7m charge in relation 
to the impairment costs to 
support the Stores Fit to Shop 
initiative; £0.2m income from the 
release of the final balance held 
in relation to the Focus lease 
guarantee provision; and £0.2m 
income from the release of an 
excess onerous lease provision 
following the finalisation of the 
exit agreement for the Wembley 
store.  The provisions had all 
been previously charged as non-
recurring items.  
Finance Expense
The net finance expense for the 
year was £3.0m (FY15: £3.5m). 
Lower average debt and favourable 
interest rates following the 
amendment and extension agreed 
in November 2014 contributed to 
the reduced charge.
Taxation
The taxation charge on profit for 
the financial year was £16.3m 
(FY15: £18.0m), including a £0.3m 
credit (FY15: £0.1m charge) in 
respect of non-recurring items. 
The effective tax rate on profit 
before tax and non-recurring 
items of 20.5% (FY15: 21.5%) was 
higher than the UK corporation 
tax rate (20.0%) principally due 
to the effect of non-deductible 
depreciation charged on capital 
expenditure.
Earnings Per Share (“EPS”)
Basic EPS before non-recurring 
items was 33.2 pence and after 
non-recurring items 32.5 pence 
(FY15: 32.7 pence before non-
recurring, 32.5 pence after non-
recurring), a 1.5% increase on the 
prior year. Basic weighted-average 
shares in issue during the year 
were 195.2m (FY15: 194.1m).
Dividend 
The Board has recommended a 
final dividend of 11.3 pence per 
share (“DPS”) (FY15: 11.0 pence), 
taking the full year dividend 
to 17.0 pence per share, an 
increase of 3.0%. If approved, 
the final dividend will be paid on 
26 August 2016 to shareholders 
on the register at the close of 
business on 5 August 2016. 
The Board continues to target 
to grow the dividend every year 
with an average cover of around 2 
times over time.
Capital Expenditure
Capital investment in the year 
totalled £40.3m (53 week FY15: 
£37.5m) comprising £32.1m in 
Retail and £8.2m in Autocentres. 
Within Retail, £13.4m (53 week 
FY15: £18.5m) was invested 
in stores, including 25 store 
refreshes, 3 of which were also 
store relocations or right-sizes, 
as well as general capital spend 
relating to training rooms, roofing, 
flooring and heating. By the 
end of FY16, 97 stores were 
trading in a refreshed format. 
Retail continued to roll out the 
Cycle Republic brand, opening 
6 dedicated stores in the year. 
Additional investments in Retail 
infrastructure included a £17.4m 
investment in IT systems, such 
as continual development of the 
online Retail proposition, refresh 
of store tills, investment in vehicle 
recognition software and tablets 
in store and investment in the 
underlying web platform. 
The £8.2m (53 week FY15: £6.8m) 
investment in Autocentres 
comprised of the opening of 11 
centres in the year (FY15: 9) along 
with investment in refreshing 
centres and new equipment. 
On a cash basis, total capital 
expenditure in the year was 
£38.5m (53 week FY15: £39.6m).
Inventories
Group inventory held as at the 
year-end was £157.9m (FY15: 
£149.3m). Retail inventory 
increased to £156.5m (FY15: 
£147.8m) mostly due to the 
impact of foreign exchange. 
Autocentres’ inventory was 
£1.4m (FY15: £1.5m). 
Cashflow and Borrowings
Cash generated from operating 
activities during the year was 
£103.7m (53 and 52 weeks FY15: 
£142.2m).  In the prior year there 
was a reduction in working capital 
of £25.3m partly due to the change 
in timing of year end, compared 
to an increase of £11.2m in FY16. 
After taxation, capital expenditure 
and net finance costs, free cash 
flow of £45.4m (FY15: £66.4m) was 
generated in the year.
Group net debt was £47.9m (53 
and 52 week FY15: £61.8m), with 
the non-lease-adjusted 12-month 
net debt: EBITDA ratio at 0.4:1. 
Financial Guidance
In November 2015 we set out 
our medium term financial target 
of maintaining Group EBITDA % 
roughly flat as we invest to drive 
sustainable long-term growth. 
We also stated that we expected 
FY17 Group Profit Before T ax to 
be broadly unchanged on FY16. 
This guidance was issued on the 
basis of a US Dollar exchange rate 
of $1.50. There is no change to 
this profit guidance other than the 
impact of the extent to which the US 
Dollar rate varies from our original 
planning assumption of $1.50. 
Each year we buy goods worth 
approximately £200m denominated 
in US Dollar and about half of that 
is hedged in advance. The impact 
on cost of goods of a 5 cent move 
in exchange rate (for example from 
$1.50 to $1.45) would be around 
£3m in a full year.
28 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 1 April 2016 slugline
There is no change to our prevailing 
guidance on capital expenditure 
requirements in the medium term, 
which we continue to expect to 
average around £40m per annum 
for the Group over the next three 
years. In FY17 we anticipate this 
to be circa £45m, split as circa 
£35m in Retail and circa £10m 
in Autocentres. We anticipate 
the Group depreciation and 
amortisation charge to be circa 
£34m for FY17. 
We anticipate the net finance 
expense to be circa £3m and an 
effective tax rate of circa 20%  
in FY17.
The timing of Easter is different 
year-on-year and we have 
estimated the impact on trading 
to be as follows: 
•	 In Q1 FY17 there is no Easter 
compared to half an Easter 
period occurring in Q1 FY16. 
We estimate the impact of 
this will be circa 1% of LFL 
revenue in Q1 itself.
•	 In Q4 FY17 there will be 
no Easter compared to a 
full Easter in Q4 FY16. We 
estimate the impact of this  
will be circa 2% of LFL 
revenue in Q4 itself.
Principal Risks and 
Uncertainties
The Board considers risk 
assessment, identification of 
mitigating actions and internal 
control to be fundamental to 
achieving Halfords’ strategic 
corporate objectives. In the 
Annual Report and Accounts the 
Board sets out what it considers 
to be the principal commercial 
and financial risks to achieving 
the Group’s objectives. The 
main areas of potential risk and 
uncertainty in the balance of the 
financial year are described on 
pages 30 to 33 and in note 20 of 
the Annual Report and Accounts. 
These include:
•	 Economic risk
•	 Business strategy risks
•	 Competitive risks
•	 Compliance
•	 Supply chain disruption
•	 Product and service quality
•	 Information technology 
systems and infrastructure
•	 Dependence on key 
management personnel
Specific risks associated with 
performance include Christmas 
trading as well as weather-
sensitive sales, particularly within 
the Car Maintenance and Cycling 
categories in the Retail business.

Getting into the  
community spirit
Storm Desmond flooded the UK in December 
leaving many in Cumbria needing help. At Penrith 
colleagues held a collection for unwanted clothing 
and furniture for those whose homes had been 
damaged and also donated a number of household 
batteries, hand warmers, sponges, buckets, 
torches, snow shovels and hand wipes to aid 
people in their clean-up efforts.
Jerry cans were also sent to mountain rescue to help them  
get water to people who had supplies cut off and two jumpstart 
packs to allow people without power to start vehicles and charge 
mobiles. Well done Penrith for making a huge difference in the  
local community.

Our Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Like all businesses, our Group faces risks and uncertainties that could 
impact the achievement of the Group’s strategy. These risks are 
accepted as being a part of doing business. The Board recognises 
that the nature and scope of these risks can change and so regularly 
reviews them as well as the systems and processes to mitigate them. 
Our corporate risk register is maintained by the Head of Internal 
Audit and Risk and is regularly updated following discussions with 
executives and senior management. It is subject to an annual in depth 
review by the Audit Committee. The Audit Committee is also alerted 
to any material changes to the register at each of its meetings. The 
Board is regularly updated on Audit Committee proceedings.
The directors have therefore carried out a robust assessment of 
the principal risks facing the company, including those that would 
threaten the business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity. The Corporate Governance report on pages 40 to 47 further 
discusses the Board’s responsibilities in relation to risk management 
and internal control systems.
Senior management colleagues assess risks on a department-by-
department basis using a variety of techniques to identify risk. The 
likelihood and impact of these risks are considered and scored against a 
recognised framework dependent upon their effect on the achievement 
of our corporate objectives. Responsibility for taking the necessary 
actions to manage risk is delegated to appropriate colleagues in the 
business, with executive manager sponsor involvement. 
Mindful of corporate strategy, executive management and the Board 
consider the risks reported within the risk register and review and 
monitor new risks and all mitigating actions to ensure that the Group’s 
appetite for risk is not exceeded. The Board recognises that each of its 
strategic pillars could be compromised by the any of the risks set out 
below. Individual ‘Moving Up a Gear’ initiatives are reliant on some of 
the mitigations identified. For example ‘Service into our DNA’ delivery is 
reliant on full utilisation of our online training system and on our ability 
to attract and retain good colleagues. ‘Better shopping experience’ is 
reliant on our continuing investment in modernisation of our stores.
The Group has discussed its risk register with its insurance broker 
and ensures that it has cover to help to mitigate significant risks 
where practicable and cost-effective.
Specific financial risks (e.g. liquidity, foreign currency) are detailed in 
Note 20 to the Annual Report and Accounts on pages 104-107.
 Key Risk and Uncertainty Mitigation
Economic, Environmental and Political
The economy is a major influence on 
consumer spending. T rends in employment, 
inflation, taxation, consumer debt levels, 
weather and interest rates impact consumer 
expenditure in discretionary areas. Changes in 
Government policies (e.g. Cycle to Work) may 
also affect our customers’ ability to benefit 
from our products and services. In addition 
there is, at the time of publishing this report, 
uncertainty surrounding the outcome of the 
EU membership vote.
The Group mitigates these risks by maintaining a focus on the defensive 
characteristics of its needs driven product groups. A firm focus is maintained on cost 
control. Targeted promotions and excellent service are designed to attract and retain 
customers. We ensure that marketing and merchandising can be revised quickly to 
react to weather conditions.
We also ensure that we have representation with Governmental decision makers in the 
areas supporting our core categories.
Business Strategy
The aim of the Group’s business strategy is to 
deliver long-term value to our shareholders. 
The Board understands that if the strategy 
and vision are inappropriately formulated, 
communicated, or executed then the 
business will suffer.
Key investments could fail to deliver sufficient 
returns. The Autocentres and Cycle Republic 
businesses could fail to meet growth 
expectations.
The Group has set out its ‘Moving Up a Gear’ strategy. Strategic issues are regularly 
reviewed at Board meetings. Regular assessment is made to ensure that strategy 
remains appropriate, and that the business is making progress in meeting its strategic 
objectives. KPIs relating to strategy have been communicated clearly, both within the 
business and to the market. These KPIs are regularly discussed by the Board. Our 
budget process recognises the importance of strategic initiatives.
The Group has delegated authorities processes to approve significant investments, 
including review by an Investment Committee and the Board. Autocentres and Cycle 
Republic have dedicated, experienced management teams supported by appropriate 
infrastructure and allocated resources. The performances of both businesses are closely 
monitored by the Board.

 Key Risk and Uncertainty Mitigation
Competition
The retail industry is highly competitive and 
dynamic. The Group competes with a wide 
variety of retailers of varying sizes and faces 
competition from UK retailers, in both stores 
and online, as well as international operators. 
The car servicing market is a service-
based market with a number of different-
sized providers where trust is extremely 
important to customers. Failure to compete 
with competitors on areas including 
price, product range, quality, service and 
trustworthiness could have an adverse 
effect on the Group’s financial results.
The Board is aware of the risks faced from UK retailers both in-store and online, and 
from the national car-servicing networks and smaller independents.
We have a significant investment programme to support ‘Moving up a Gear’. The 
investment programme is allowing us to improve the service we provide to customers 
by improving the quality of our stores, IT infrastructure, training, customer knowledge 
(including e-receipts) and website (including optimisation for mobile and tablet devices). 
Excellent service is fundamental to differentiating ourselves from our competitors.
The national geographical coverage of our stores underpins our ‘Click & Collect’ 
offering. Our WeFit service is a key differentiator. Our Cycle Repair and extended Parts, 
Accessories and Clothing range offer confirm our credibility within the Cycling market.
The Group seeks to continually strengthen its own-brand retail offer and develop opportunities 
to differentiate the Halfords brand, including TV , radio, press and social media advertising. Our 
products benefit from association with well-known cyclists and designers.
Our Autocentres business continually seeks to provide innovative solutions for their 
customers, such as ‘brakes4life’.
Compliance
The Group operates in an environment 
governed by legislation and codes in areas 
including, but not limited to, Listing Rules, 
trading standards, advertising, product 
quality, health and safety, hazardous 
substances, Bribery Act and data 
protection.
The Group recognises that failure to comply 
with ethical standards could expose the 
business to reputational risk and loss  
of goodwill.
Regulatory requirements are closely monitored by our Company Secretarial team 
which includes colleagues with relevant professional qualifications and experience. 
The Group has Quality Assurance and Compliance teams working in both the Retail 
and Autocentres businesses. Specialist Health and Safety teams ensure that the Group 
has adequate policies and risk assessments. Retail margin erosions are minimised by a 
dedicated profit protection team.
Colleagues and management are trained to identify and handle in-store regulatory 
issues using Gears training modules on our online Learning Management System. We 
have a whistleblowing hotline that allows colleagues to raise concerns in confidence.
We operate a Code of Conduct that clearly sets out our expectations of suppliers. 
We have a corporate delegated authorities framework (How We Do Business) setting 
out key authorisation levels. Anti-Bribery and Corruption training has been delivered 
through face-to-face and online training sessions.
The Group has a dedicated Investor Relations team which ensures that there is frequent 
and appropriate communication with investors and the wider financial community.
The Group has a dedicated Corporate Social Responsibility Committee, which calls 
upon cross-functional support as required. The Group has a comprehensive record 
of community engagement through events such as children’s bike workshops, and 
support of the Re-Cycle charity

Our Principal Risks and Uncertainties
 Key Risk and Uncertainty Mitigation
Supply Chain Disruption
Halfords sources a significant proportion 
of the merchandise it sells in its stores 
from outside of the UK, either directly or 
via third-party suppliers. Consequently, the 
Group is subject to the risks associated 
with international trade (particularly those 
which are common in the import of goods 
from developing countries) including, but 
not limited to, inflation, currency fluctuation, 
the imposition of taxes or other charges 
on imports, the exposure to different legal 
standards, the burden of complying with a 
variety of foreign laws and changing foreign 
government policies and natural disasters. 
UK withdrawal from the EU could impact on 
our supply chain.
The Group could also be impacted in the 
event of disruption to domestic logistic 
arrangements; for example, unavailability 
of distribution centres or road transport 
problems.
Extensive research is conducted into quality and ethics before the Group procures 
products from any new country or supplier. The Group’s strong management team in 
the Far East blends expatriate and local colleagues. It understands the local culture, 
market regulations and risks and we maintain very close relationships with both 
our suppliers and shippers to ensure that disruption to production and supply are 
managed appropriately.
We work with suppliers in a number of territories to reduce the risks of disruption.
We maintain firm security and protection measures at our distribution centres.  
We have business continuity plans to manage any incidents that may occur.  
Our logistics are overseen by an experienced, dedicated warehouse and logistics 
team who maintain contacts with a range of logistics businesses who could be utilised 
if necessary.
Product and Service quality  
and Brand Reputation
The Board recognises that the quality and 
safety of both our products and services 
in our stores and autocentres are of critical 
importance and that any major failure 
will affect consumer confidence and our 
reputation. Failure to protect the Group’s 
reputation and brand could lead to a loss 
of trust and confidence. This could result in 
a decline in the customer base and affect 
the ability to recruit and retain good people. 
There is also the risk that our service 
proposition fails due to inconsistent levels  
of service at individual stores and  
individual centres.
The Group constantly seeks to enhance its position as the store or centre of first 
choice in each of the markets that it serves.
Our Gears training programme uses online modules to ensure that colleagues are 
consistently knowledgeable about our products and able to deliver quality services to 
customers. This online training is reinforced by face-to-face learning and assessments. 
Stores use an accreditation matrix to ensure that all building and fitting is undertaken 
by competent colleagues. Product knowledge among colleagues is promoted through 
specialist conferences for selected staff (e.g. BikeHut managers). 
We have also implemented measures to ensure that we attract and retain the best 
colleagues: engagement surveys aim to identify opportunities to reduce colleague 
turnover; colleagues who have successfully passed ‘Gears’ training programmes receive 
a premium; we have again been recognised as one of the Sunday Times “25 Best Big 
Companies to Work For”; our recruitment processes are now centralised to improve 
efficiency and consistency.
Our products are risk assessed and rigorously tested for quality and safety by 
qualified engineers in our dedicated quality team. We monitor customer comments 
and complaints and, when necessary, we have established recall processes.
Our Autocentres utilise a comprehensive quality assurance process with checks by 
centre managers. T echnicians are regularly checked to ensure quality of workmanship, 
and the priority status allocated to individual jobs is reviewed to ensure safety and 
prevent overselling. There is a dedicated Operations Quality team. We utilise  
mystery shoppers.

 Key Risk and Uncertainty Mitigation
Information T echnology  
(“IT” Systems and Infastructure)
In common with most businesses, Halfords 
is dependent on the reliability and suitability 
of a number of important IT systems where 
any sustained performance problems 
(including those caused by cyber attack) 
could potentially compromise our operational 
capability for a period of time impacting on 
stores, centres or warehouse, multi-channel 
and distribution systems. With ambitious 
growth plans for our multi-channel offer, 
our trading capacity could be affected by 
internal and external systems’ resilience and 
interdependencies.
Commercial data could be lost or stolen 
through cyber attack, sabotage, or other 
security breaches.
Extensive controls are in place to maintain the integrity of our systems and to ensure 
that systems changes are implemented in a controlled manner. Halfords’ key trading 
systems are hosted within a secure data centre operated by a specialist company 
remote from our support centre. These systems are also supported by a number of 
disaster recovery arrangements including a comprehensive backup and patching 
strategy, and a hotlink secure data centre hosted in a different location. IT recovery 
processes are tested regularly.
We review our IT security processes and risk assessments on an ongoing basis and 
our IT team has dedicated IT security and continuity experts. We utilise appropriate 
firewalls, physical and logical system access controls. We have undertaken network 
penetration testing.
Dependence on Key  
Management Personnel
The success of the Group’s business 
depends upon its senior management 
closely supervising all aspects of its 
business, in particular, the operation of 
the stores and Autocentres, including the 
appropriate training of in-store and centre 
colleagues, and the design, procurement 
and allocation of merchandise.
Our Remuneration Policy outlined on pages 60 to 62 details the strategies in place 
to ensure that high calibre executives are attracted and retained. The Group looks to 
improve its senior manager cadre through operating a talent management process 
to help individuals achieve their full potential within Halfords and to ensure that 
appropriate succession plans are in place to meet the future needs of the business. 
At a junior level, the Group continues to invest in graduate programmes and store and 
centre colleague training and development.

A very special delivery
Talk about going above and beyond... Chris Smart, from 
Bodmin, made a magnificent gesture on Christmas Day. 
He personally delivered two children’s bikes to a local 
family after discovering on social media that they had 
been unable to collect them in time.
The children were disappointed not to receive their presents and the 
distraught family posted their tale on Facebook. Chris noticed the post, 
went to the shop to pick up two bikes and then took them straight to the 
family’s home.
There were huge smiles all round and the grateful family sent him ‘the 
biggest thank you in the world’ on Facebook. slugline

Directors’ Report
Principal activities
The principal activities of the Group are: the retailing of automotive, 
leisure and cycling products from its Halfords and Cycle Republic retail 
stores and car servicing and repair from its Autocentres outlets. The 
principal activity of the Company is that of a holding company. The 
Company’s registrar is Capita Asset Services, which is situated at The 
Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU.
Strategic report 
In accordance with Section 414A of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Directors have chosen to set out in the Strategic Report the following 
information required to be included in the Directors’ Report:
Likely future developments – page 4;
Greenhouse Gas Emissions – page 53;
Use of Financial Instruments – Note 20 to the Group Financial 
Statements; and
Charitable Donations – page 52
The Corporate Governance Report on pages 40 to 47 is a statement 
for the purposes of Disclosure and T ransparency Rule 7.2.1.
Profits & dividends
The Group’s results for the year are set out in the Consolidated Income 
Statement on page 79. The profit before tax on ordinary activities was 
£81.5m (2015: £83.8m) and the profit after tax amounted to £64.9m 
(2015: £65.8m). The Board proposes that a final dividend of 11.34 
pence per ordinary share be paid on 26 August 2016 to shareholders 
whose names are on the register of members at the close of business 
on 5 August 2016. This payment, together with the interim dividend of 
5.66 pence per ordinary share paid on 22 January 2016, makes a total 
for the year of 17 pence per ordinary share. The total final dividend 
payable to shareholders for the year is estimated to be £22m. 
Computershare T rustees (Jersey) Limited, trustee of the Halfords’ 
Employee Share T rust, has waived its entitlement to dividends.
Performance monitoring 
The delivery of the Group’s strategic objectives is monitored by the 
Board through KPIs and periodic review of various aspects of the 
Group’s operations. The Group considers that the KPIs listed on 
pages 22 to 23 are appropriate measures to assess the delivery of the 
strategy of the Group via its Retail and Autocentres divisions.
Directors
The following were Directors of the Company during the period ended 
1 April 2016 and, unless otherwise stated, at the date of this Annual 
Report:
Dennis Millard 
Jill McDonald (appointed 11 May 2015) 
Jonny Mason (appointed 12 October 2015) 
David Adams 
Claudia Arney 
Helen Jones 
Matt Davies (resigned 30 April 2015) 
Andrew Findlay (resigned 1 October 2015)
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and the UK 
Corporate Governance Code guidelines, all those persons holding 
office as a Director of the Company on 1 April 2016 will retire and offer 
themselves for re-election at the 2016 AGM. Jonny Mason, who was 
appointed on 12 October 2015, will stand for election for the first time.
Directors’ interests
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid situations in which they have, 
or may have, interests that conflict with those of the Company unless 
that conflict is first authorised by the Board. 
The Company has in place procedures for managing conflicts of 
interest. The Company’s Articles of Association contain provisions 
to allow the Directors to authorise potential conflicts of interest, so 
that if approved, a Director will not be in breach of his/her duty under 
company law. In line with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006, 
each Director has notified the Company of any situation in which he 
or she has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that conflicts or 
possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company (a situational 
conflict). Directors have a continuing duty to update any changes to 
their conflicts of interest.
Directors’ indemnities
Directors’ and Officers’ insurance cover has been established for 
all Directors and Officers to provide cover against their reasonable 
actions on behalf of the Company. The Directors of the Company and 
the Company’s subsidiaries have the benefit of a third-party indemnity 
provision, as defined by section 236 of the Companies Act 2006, the 
Company’s Articles of Association.
Colleagues
The Group strives to meet its business objectives by motivating 
and encouraging all colleagues to be responsive to the needs of our 
customers and continually improve operational performance. This 
is delivered through a range of structured training and development 
programmes, such as “Gears in Retail”, where Retail colleagues 
progress through a structured series of e-learning, face to face and 
shop floor experience modules and are then recognised for their 
success through certification, career progression and increased pay 
awards. Autocentres runs, in conjunction with the IMI, a number of 
T echnical T raining Courses that are designed to develop colleagues’ 
skills. Similar to Retail, it has its own version of the “Gears in Retail” 
programme which supports colleagues’ development and rewards 
via a pay matrix. Autocentres has become the first organisation in 50 
years to be authorised by the DVSA to train MOT T esters in-house. In 
addition we run a Leadership Development programme, called Aspire, 
to identify, nurture and develop colleagues across the Group, with 
potential to be our leaders of the future. This continues our drive to 
develop from within.
The Group is committed to providing equality of opportunity to 
colleagues and potential colleagues. This applies to recruitment, 
training, career development and promotion for all colleagues, 
regardless of physical ability, gender, sexual orientation, religion, age 
or ethnic origin. Full and fair consideration is given to employment 
applications by disabled persons wherever suitable opportunities 
exist, having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. T raining 
and career development support is provided where appropriate. 
Should a colleague become disabled, efforts are made to ensure their 
continued employment with the Group, with retraining being provided 
if necessary.
The Group has an established framework of colleague 
communications, to provide colleagues with information on matters of 
concern to them and business performance as well as to encourage 
the engagement of every colleague in the Board’s commitment to high 
standards of customer care and service provision. 
A whistleblowing policy and procedure enables colleagues to report 
concerns on matters affecting the Group or their employment, without 
fear of recrimination. In addition, the Group takes a zero-tolerance 
approach to matters of discrimination, harassment and bullying in all 
aspects of its business operations, including in relation to gender, race, 
national origin, disability, age, religion or sexual orientation. Appropriate 
policies and procedures are in place for reporting and dealing with 
such matters.
Auditor
The Company’s Auditor is KPMG LLP . A resolution proposing the 
reappointment of KPMG LLP is expected to be in the Notice of the AGM 
and will be put to shareholders at the meeting.
Disclosure of information to the auditor
In accordance with Section 418(2) of the Companies Act 2006, each 
Director in office at the date the Directors’ Report is approved confirms 
that: 
i. so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s Auditor is unaware; and 
38 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 1 April 2016 slugline
ii. he/she has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s Auditor is 
aware of that information.
Going concern
The Group has a £170m five-year revolving credit facility , ending in 
November 2019. At the year end, the Group had undrawn borrowing 
facilities of £143m (2015: £117m). The Group’s current committed 
borrowing facilities contain certain financial covenants, which have been 
met throughout the period. The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show 
that the Group should be able to operate within the level of its borrowing 
facilities and covenants for the foreseeable future. As a consequence, 
the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business 
risks successfully . The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future, hence they continue to adopt the going concern basis 
of accounting in preparing the Financial Statements.
v iability Statement
In accordance with provision C.2.2 of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Directors have assessed the viability of the Company over 
a three year period to 1 April 2019. The directors believe this period to 
be appropriate as the Company’s strategic planning encompasses this 
period, and because it is a reasonable period over which the impact of 
key risks can be assessed within a fast-moving retail business.
The Board has a reasonable expectation that the Company will be able 
to continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due at least 
until 1 April 2019.
In making this statement, the Directors have reviewed the overall 
resilience of the Group and have specifically considered:
•	 a robust assessment of the impact, likelihood and management 
of principal risks facing the Group, with a focus on those risks that 
could threaten its business model, future performance, solvency or 
liquidity or sustainability. The assessment considered how risks may 
develop over three years.; and
•	 financial analysis and forecasts showing current financial position 
and performance, cash flow projections, funding requirements and 
funding facilities.
Branches
The Company and its subsidiaries have established branches in the 
different countries in which they operate.
Political donations
The Group made no political donations and incurred no political 
expenditure during the year (FY15: nil). It remains the Company’s policy 
not to make political donations or to incur political expenditure, however 
the application of the relevant provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
is potentially very broad in nature and, as last year, the Board is seeking 
shareholder authority to ensure that the Group does not inadvertently 
breach these provisions as a result of the breadth of its business 
activities, although the Board has no intention of using this authority.
Creditor payment policy
The Group does not follow any formal code of practice on payment, 
instead it agrees terms and conditions for transactions when orders for 
goods or services are placed, and includes relevant terms in contracts, 
as appropriate. These arrangements are adhered to when making 
payments, subject to the terms and conditions being met by suppliers. 
The number of trade creditor days outstanding as at 1 April 2016 for 
the Group was 63 days (2015: 70 days). The Company is a holding 
company and has no trade creditors. 
Share capital
Details of the Company’s share capital, including changes during the 
year in the issued share capital and details of the rights attaching to 
the Company’s ordinary shares, are set out in Note 21 on page 107. 
All ordinary shares, including those acquired through Company share 
schemes and plans, rank equally with no special rights. 
All shareholders are entitled to attend and speak at the general 
meetings of the Company, appoint proxies, receive any dividends, 
exercise voting rights and transfer shares without restriction. There 
are no known arrangements that may restrict the transfer of shares or 
voting rights.
The Company has term and revolving credit facilities that require 
the Company in the event of a change of control to notify the facility 
agent and, if required by the majority lenders, these facilities may be 
cancelled. The Company does not have agreements with any Director 
or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or 
employment resulting from a takeover, except that provisions of the 
Company’s share schemes and Deferred Bonus Plan may cause 
options and awards granted to Directors and employees under such 
schemes and plans to vest on a takeover.
Rules relating to the appointment or removal of the Directors, and their 
powers, are contained within the Company’s Articles of Association, 
which in accordance with legislation can only be changed with 
shareholder approval.

Dennis Millard 
Chairman
Chairman’s Introduction
My primary role is to lead the Board and ensure that it works effectively and collaboratively to create 
sustainable, long-term shareholder value. 
Good corporate governance is a key element of our business success. The Board is therefore committed 
to ensuring that high standards of governance, values and behaviours are consistently applied throughout 
the Group. These elements are critical to business integrity and maintaining the trust of all stakeholders in 
Halfords. 
As reported last year, Jill McDonald was appointed as Chief Executive Officer on 11 May 2015. In October

Andrew Findlay. Jonny joined the Company from Scandi Standard AB, a Scandinavian company, where 
he was CFO. Prior to that he was CFO at Odeon and UCI Cinemas and Finance Director of Sainsburys 
Supermarkets. He brings to the Board a broad range of financial experience across consumer facing and 
retail businesses. 
The following Corporate Governance Report contains a summary of the Company’s governance 
arrangements and the regulatory assurances required under the UK Corporate Governance Code 2014. 
I would encourage you to attend this year’s AGM where you can meet me and my Board colleagues.

‘How We Do Business’ is the internal name of 
the formal delegated authorities document 
approved by the Board. It describes how 
day-to-day decisions are delegated to the 
Executive Directors, the Senior Management 
T eam and others within the business.  
Each potential activity is set out by reference 
from whom approval must be sought and 
the process and documentation required to 
evidence that approval. Where an activity is 
not expressly described within How We Do 
Business, approval must be sought from the 
Senior Management T eam, who will apply 
the principles of How We Do Business to the 
decision. The implementation of the document 
is constantly monitored, with updates 
proposed to the Board to reflect changing 
practices or structures. Briefing sessions 
were held for all relevant Support Centre and 
Operating colleagues upon launch and are 
refreshed whenever the document is updated.

Board Composition and Succession
As at the date of this report, the Board of Directors 
was made up of six members, comprising the Non-
Executive Chairman, two Executive Directors and 
three Non-Executive Directors. The composition of 
the Board is as set out on page 38 and the biographies 
of individual Directors, including any other business 
commitments, are available on page 36 and also at www.
halfordscompany.com/investors/governance/the-board.
Each of the Non-Executive Directors (excluding the 
Chairman) is considered independent of management 
and free of any relationship that could materially interfere 
with the exercise of their independent judgement. 
The Chairman was considered independent upon his 
appointment. The Board considers that each Non-
Executive Director brings their own senior level of 
experience, gained within their field. 
Succession planning for the Board is on-going and 
the recent appointments of Jill McDonald and Jonny 
Mason are noted. Succession planning is also viewed 
at executive management level on an on-going basis.
Board Responsibilities
The Board is committed to ensuring that it provides 
leadership to the business as a whole, having regard 
to the interests and views of its shareholders and 
other stakeholders. It is also responsible for setting 
the Group’s strategy, values and standards. Details 
of the Group’s business model and strategy can be 
found on pages 10 to 20.
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive Officer 
are separate and clearly defined, with the division of 
responsibilities set out in writing and agreed by the 
Board. The definitions of the roles are available at: 
www.halfordscompany.com/investors/governance/
division-of-responsibilities-between-the-chairman-
and-chief-executive-officer. 
The Directors together act in the best interests of the 
Company via the Board and its Committees, devoting 
sufficient time and consideration as necessary 
to fulfil their duties. Each Director brings different 
skills, experience and knowledge to the Company, 
with the Non-Executive Directors additionally 
bringing independent thought and judgement. This 
combination seeks to ensure that no individual or 
group unduly restricts or controls decision-making.

The table above shows the attendance of Directors at the meetings 
of the Board and of the Audit, Nomination and Remuneration 
Committees during the year ended 1 April 2016. Where a Director 
did not attend meetings owing to prior commitments or other 
unavoidable circumstances, they provided input to the Chairman so 
that their views were known. There was one Board meeting during the 
period where a CEO was not in post.
Other members of the Senior Management T eam and advisors 
attended Board meetings by invitation as appropriate throughout the 
year. The Board also held a two-day Strategy meeting during  
the period. 
At each Board meeting, the Chief Executive Officer delivers a high 
level update on business, the Board considers specific reports, 
reviews business and financial performance, key initiatives, risks and 
governance. In addition, throughout the year the Senior Management 
T eam and other colleagues deliver presentations to the Board on 
proposed initiatives and progress on projects.
Board Committees 
The Board’s principal Committees are the Audit Committee, 
the Nomination Committee and the Remuneration Committee. 
In December 2015, the Board established a Corporate Social 
Responsibility (“CSR”) Committee, comprising of directors and 
senior management and chaired by a Non-Executive Director. 
Each Committee has its terms of reference approved and regularly 
reviewed by the Board. The terms of reference for the Committees 
are available on www.halfordscompany.com/investors/governance. 
On the following pages each Committee Chairman reports how the 
Committee he/she chairs discharged its responsibilities in FY16 and 
the material matters that were considered. 
Following each meeting of a Committee, the Committee Chairman 
reports to the Board. Whilst not entitled to attend, other Directors, 
professional advisers and members of senior management attend 
when invited to do so. The Auditor attends Audit Committee meetings 
by invitation. No person is present at Nomination Committee or 
Remuneration Committee during discussions pertinent to them.  
The Company Secretary acts as the secretary to each Committee.
A Disclosure Committee, made up of a minimum of two Directors, 
approves the final wording of market announcements prior to release. 
There were five Disclosure Committees during the period.
The day-to-day investment decisions of the Group are approved by 
an Investment Committee, chaired by the CFO. Similarly the treasury 
needs of the Group are managed by the Treasury Committee, chaired 
by the CFO, the other members are senior members of the finance 
and treasury teams.
The Board may establish other ad hoc committees of the Board to 
consider specific issues from time to time. No such committees were 
formed during the year.

Concerns
The Chairman seeks to resolve any concerns raised by the Board, 
whether raised in a Board meeting or in another forum. Where raised 
and unresolved in a Board meeting, the unresolved business can 
be recorded on behalf of a Director in the minutes of the relevant 
meeting. A resigning Non-Executive Director would also be able to 
raise any concerns in a written letter to the Chairman, who would 
bring such concerns to the attention of the Board. No such concerns 
have been raised throughout the period.
Effectiveness
Independence
The Board considers David Adams, Claudia Arney and Helen Jones 
to be independent in character and judgement in accordance with 
the requirements of the Code. The Chairman, Dennis Millard, was 
considered independent on his appointment. In compliance with the 
requirements of the Code for at least half of the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, to be independent, the Company confirms that 60% of its 
Board are independent.
The independent Non-Executive Directors bring a wide range of 
experience and expertise to the Group’s affairs and carry significant 
weight in the Board’s decisions. The independent Non-Executive 
Directors are encouraged to challenge management and help 
develop proposals on strategy.

Corporate Governance Report continued
Diversity 
The Board has a Diversity Policy and in applying this to the Board 
also considers that it is the background and experience brought to 
the Board by each individual that best secures and demonstrates 
its diversity and commitment to its Diversity Policy. The principle 
that candidates are considered “on merit and against objective 
criteria, and with due regard for the benefits of diversity on the Board, 
including gender” is established in the T erms of Reference of the 
Nomination Committee. 
No fixed quota is applied to decisions regarding recruitment, rather 
the Nomination Committee considers capability and capacity to 
commit the necessary time to the role in its recommendations to the 
Board. The intention is the appointment of the most suitably qualified 
candidate to complement and balance the current skills, knowledge 
and experience on the Board, seeking to appoint those who will 
be best able to help lead the Company in its long-term strategy. At 
Halfords 50% of the Board is female. The chart below demonstrate 
the gender split at Board level, within senior management and across 
the workforce as a whole.  
BOARD LEVEL 
50% Female    50% Male
SENIOR MANAGEMENT LEVEL 
31% Female    69% Male
ALL COLLEAGUES
22% Female    78% Male
The Board is well placed by the mixture of skills, experience and 
knowledge of its Directors to act in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders. 
Appointments to the Board
As reported last year, Jill McDonald was appointed as Chief Executive 
Officer on 11 May 2015. On 1 October 2015, Andrew Findlay, Group 
Chief Financial Officer resigned after four and a half years on the 
Board.  As reported in the Nomination Committee’s report, a thorough 
search was conducted to identify suitable candidates, both internally 
and externally to succeed him in this role. Upon the recommendation 
of the Nomination Committee, Jonny Mason joined the Board on 
12 October 2015 as Chief Financial Officer. Jonny was formerly CFO 
of Scandi Standard AB, a Scandinavian company, and was previously 
CFO of Odeon and UCI Cinemas and Finance Director of Sainsburys 
Supermarkets. Jonny brings a broad range of financial experience 
across consumer facing and retail businesses. Succession planning is 
not, however, confined to the Board itself and the Board pays a close 
interest in identifying and cultivating leaders of the future from within 
the business. On 18 January 2016, Tim O’Gorman was appointed as  
Company Secretary following the resignation of Justin Richards  
on 31 December 2015.
Directors’ Induction 
All new Directors receive a personalised induction programme, 
tailored to their individual requirements, to include briefings on the 
activities of the Group and visits to operational sites. They also meet 
all of the Company’s other Directors and Senior Executives. This 
facilitates their understanding of the Group and the key drivers of 
the business’ performance. Both Jill McDonald and Jonny Mason 
undertook a full induction programme prepared by the Chairman, with 
the assistance of the Company Secretary. Upon joining they were 
both provided with background materials covering the operational 
and organisational structure of the business, as well as the strategic 
aims and key initiatives of the Company. 
Training and Development
All current Directors have various opportunities for on-going 
development and support via:
•	 a programme of Support Centre, distribution centre, Retail store 
and Autocentre visits;
•	 reviews with the Chairman to identify any training and development 
needs;
•	 advice on governance, relevant legislative changes affecting the 
business or their duties as Directors from the Company Secretary; 
•	 access to independent professional advice at the Company’s 
expense; and 
•	 membership of the Deloitte Academy, a training and guidance 
resource for boards and directors.

Evaluation
The Code recommends that an evaluation of the effectiveness of 
the Board and its Committees is conducted annually and that this 
process is facilitated externally at least every third year. This year the 
evaluation process was carried out internally, having been externally 
facilitated last year by Linstock. 
This year’s evaluation required each Director to respond to a 
questionnaire devised by the Company Secretary and agreed with 
the Chairman. The process considered the Board’s composition, 
strengths and weaknesses, its range and balance of skills, 
experience, independence and knowledge of the Company, its 
diversity including gender diversity, how the Board works together as 
a unit, risk management, succession planning and any training issues. 
Following this review, the Chairman has considered the results of 
the performance evaluation and has taken steps to address any 
weaknesses. The Board will continue to take proactive steps to 
address recommended improvements. 
The two most significant actions to be taken as a result of the 
assessment are set out below:
•	 additional time with the other Non-Executive Directors and the 
Chairman; and
•	 additional Company specific training.
Re-election
In compliance with the Code and the Company’s Articles of 
Association, all Directors on the Board as at 6 June 2016, will seek 
re-election at the Company’s AGM. Jonny Mason will seek election 
for the first time. 
Directors and their Other Interests
Each Director is required to notify the Company of any situation in 
which he or she has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest that 
conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of the Company 
(a situational conflict). None was notified during the period. 
All Directors are aware of the need to consult with the Company 
Secretary should any possible situational conflict arise, so that prior 
consideration can be given by the Board as to whether or not such 
conflict will be approved.
Details of the Directors’ service contracts, emoluments, the interests 
of the Directors and their immediate families in the share capital of 
the Company and options to subscribe for shares in the Company are 
shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 58 to 72.
Internal Control and Risk Management
Overall responsibility for the system of internal control and reviewing 
its effectiveness rests with the Board. This involves ensuring that there 
is a process to identify, evaluate and manage any significant risks that 
may affect the achievement of the Group’s strategic objectives. 
The Board has conducted an annual review of the effectiveness of the 
systems of internal control during the year, under the auspices of the 
Audit Committee. The Audit Committee provides the Board with an 
independent assessment of the Group’s financial position, accounting 
affairs and control systems. In addition, the Board receives regular 
reports on how specific risks that are assessed as material to the 
Group are being managed. For further information on the Company’s 
compliance with the Code provisions relating to the Audit Committee 
and Auditor please refer to pages 54 to 57. 
The risk management and internal control system is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failing to achieve business 
objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The Board’s policy on internal 
control is implemented by management through a clearly defined 
operating structure with lines of responsibility and delegated authority. 
An on-going process for identifying, evaluating and managing the 
significant risks faced by the Group and assessing the effectiveness 
of related controls has been established by the Board to ensure an 
acceptable risk/reward profile across the Group. The process has 
been in place throughout the period ended 1 April 2016, and up to the 
date of approving the Annual Report and Financial Statements. 
Our process for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant 
risks faced by the Group and assessing the effectiveness of related 
controls routinely identifies areas for improvement, but the Board has 
neither identified nor been advised of any failings or weaknesses that 
it has determined to be material or significant.
The Board considered its appetite for risk in relation to the top 8 risks, 
determining that the risks and mitigating actions were appropriate to 
the level of risk that was both acceptable to, and incumbent within, 
a listed business. More information on the Company’s key risks and 
uncertainties is shown on pages 30 to 33. 
Relations with Shareholders
The Board is committed to effective communications between the 
Company and its shareholders and, accordingly, has a strong Investor 
Relations programme that seeks to actively engage with shareholders. 
This programme includes formal presentations of full year and interim 
results. These presentations, along with the Annual Report and 
Accounts, are the primary means of communication during the year with 
all of the Company’s shareholders. Additionally, the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive Officer and the Chief Financial Officer have met with analysts 
and institutional shareholders during the period to keep them informed 
of significant developments and help maintain a balanced understanding 
of their issues and concerns. Their views and feedback, as well as market 
perceptions gathered, are regularly communicated to the Board via a 
monthly report by the Investor Relations Officer. The Company Secretary 
also brings to the attention of the Board any material matters of concern 
raised by the Company’s shareholders, including private investors.
The primary method of communication with shareholders is by 
electronic means, helping to make the Company more environmentally 
friendly. Information available on the Company’s website includes current 
and historic copies of the Annual Report and Accounts, full and half-year 
financial statements, market announcements, corporate governance 
information, the T erms of Reference for the Audit, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees and the Matters Reserved for the Board. 
The Annual General Meeting gives all shareholders the opportunity 
to communicate directly with the Board and their participation is 
welcomed. The Chairmen of the Remuneration, Nomination and Audit 
Committees will be present at the AGM and will be in a position to 
answer questions relevant to the work of those Committees. It is 
the Company’s practice to propose separate resolutions on each 
substantial issue at the AGM. The Chairman will advise shareholders 
on the proxy voting details at the meeting.

Nomination Committee Report
Chairman’s Letter
This was a busy year for the Committee. In addition to its key 
responsibility of ensuring that effective Board and Committees 
and succession plan for key executives are in place, the Committee 
oversaw the process for the appointment of the Group’s new Chief 
Financial Officer, Jonny Mason.
I was delighted that Jonny agreed to join the Group and take up the 
role of CFO. He has brought a broad range of financial experience 
across consumer facing and retail businesses. Additional information 
on the activities of the Committee, including the details of the process 
leading to the appointment of the new CFO and the services provided 
by Russell Reynolds Associates executive search agency, are set out 
in this report.
There were three meetings held during the year, attended by all 
members and after each Committee meeting, I reported to the Board 
on the key issues that we had discussed. A number of informal 
discussions were also held between Committee members and me. 
The Committee’s T erms of Reference are available on the Company’s

Committee Composition
Dennis Millard (Chairman)
David Adams 
Claudia Arney
Helen Jones 
Matt Davies (resigned 30 April 2015)
Jill McDonald (joined 11 May 2015)
The Committee’s role is to review the size and 
structure of the Board, consider succession planning 
and make recommendations to the Board on potential 
candidates for the Board. Its key objective is to 
ensure that the Board comprises individuals with 
the necessary skill, knowledge and experience to 
ensure that the Board is effective in discharging its 
responsibilities. 
Principal Activities
The Committee’s focus during the year was 
overseeing the process for the appointment of a 
new CFO, following Andrew Findlay’s resignation. 
The Committee set out the types of skills and 
attributes it envisaged a new CFO would possess, 
which it captured in its briefing to executive search 
agency,  Russell Reynolds Associates, which identified 
potential candidates for the role. Committee members 
interviewed candidates for the role and thereafter 
recommended the recruitment of Jonny Mason to the 
Board. Russell Reynolds Associates does not have any 
other connection with the Company.
Diversity
The Committee and the Board have sought to ensure 
that appointments are of the best candidates to 
promote the success of the Group and are based on 
merit, with due regard for the benefits of diversity on 
the Board (while also meeting the requirements of the 
Equality Act 2013). Following the appointment of Jill 
McDonald as the Group’s CEO in May 2015, we have a 
Board where 50% of its members are female.
The Company does not currently publish specific 
diversity targets but in practice, it has created a more 
balanced Board and Executive Management T eam and 
continues to work to ensure this is replicated across 
the entire business, in particular in relation to gender 
diversity.
Further information regarding Board diversity can be 
found on page 46 and gender diversity in the Group as 
a whole on page 46 and 51.
Looking Ahead
In the year ahead, the Nomination Committee will 
continue to assess the Board composition and how it 
may be enhanced.

Corporate Social Responsibility  
Committee Report
An audit of our CSR activities revealed that although there is a huge 
amount taking place across the business it is sometimes isolated 
and fragmented. I was therefore delighted to be asked to Chair a 
new Board Committee: to bring all this activity together, to define our 
CSR strategy, to agree priorities; to set our objectives and agree our 
measurements of success. Our strategy now centres on the following 
four areas:

Finding, supporting and developing great people 
throughout their Halfords journey
We continue to aim to be an employer of choice, where colleagues 
enjoy equal opportunities to help customers and to prosper within a 
rewarding and inspiring team. We strive to ensure all colleagues enjoy 
their work and have opportunities to consistently amaze customers 
through their friendly expertise. As such, we continue to invest in our 
3-Gears, apprenticeship and leadership development programmes 
and actively look for ways in which we can promote and increase the 
diversity of our workforce.
3-Gears programme
Our ability to offer great service is one of our key differentiators and 
a central part of our strategy, under the ‘Service in our DNA’ pillar. 
3-Gears, a qualification programme that trains and rewards retail 
colleagues as they progress through the gears and gain expertise, 
has a fundamental role to play in helping us progress.
•	 Gear 1 applies to all colleagues and is completed over their first 
three-month period with Halfords. 
•	 Gear 2 involves a nine-month training programme which leads to 
an expert level of product knowledge, with a specialism in either 
Auto & Leisure or Cycling. 
•	 Gear 3 colleagues are our Gurus. They are product experts who 
are qualified to train others. In FY16 we introduced a new motoring 
Gear 3 colleagues in every car parts fitting store, alongside our 
existing Gear 3 colleagues in cycling. 
By the end of FY16 72% of our eligible colleagues had qualified for 
Gear 2 and we had over 600 Gear 3 level colleagues. 
Apprenticeships and Traineeships
Helping to get young people onto the career ladder is nothing new for 
our Halfords Autocentre business, which has now been operating its 
apprenticeship scheme for over 21 years, comprising of a three-year 
fully funded technician programme leading to the Institute of Motor 
Industry NVQ 3 and Diploma. There are currently 208 apprentices in 
the business with a further 187 planned for the year ahead. 
Building on Autocentres’ success, in FY16 Halfords Retail placed 
1152 apprenticeships in its first 12 months, going over and above 
the standard model by offering a pre-apprenticeship traineeship 
programme. Open to people who are unemployed, long-term 
unemployed and NEETS (not in education, employment or training), 
600 traineeships have been placed, with 178 candidates going on to 
full apprenticeships.
Diversity
We recognise the value that diversity brings, but also that we’re on 
a journey to redress the balance in some inherently male dominated 
areas and that this will take time. 
Getting a foot  
on the ladder
“At a time when we have record employment 
in the UK, traineeships not only provide life 
changing opportunities for young people, but 
they also deliver brilliant results for business. 
“This is why it is great to see a major retailer 
like Halfords make a real commitment 
to traineeships by not only running the 
programme, but increasing the number of 
places it has offered year on year. Initiatives 
like this will play a significant role in helping to 
reach the Government’s target to create  
three million apprenticeships by 2020.”

Committee Report continued
Helping to keep families safe on their journeys and 
encouraging an active lifestyle
There’s no doubt that the digital age has huge advantages, providing 
an opportunity to stay in touch with friends and family around the 
world, at the touch of a button. However statistics from UK Active, 
Cycling England, provide a shocking knock-on effect:
•	 Kids today are the least active in history
•	 Children in the UK spend an average of 6 hours per day in front of 
screens
•	 In England 71% of 12-year old boys and 81% of 12-year old girls 
do not meet minimum physical activity guidelines of 60 minutes 
per day
•	 Physical inactivity costs the UK £20bn per year *
* Statistics drawn from - https://
parliamentarycommissiononphysicalactivity.files.wordpress.
com/2014/04/move1_ig_long1.pdf
Just one hour of activity every day could make the difference of a 
lifetime. Getting out and about on a bike is a perfect opportunity to do 
just that, giving families the opportunity share valuable time together. 
From speaking with our customers, a major concern is safety and the 
confidence to fix things, as and when problems occur. 
Against that background, Halfords decided to share colleagues’ 
knowledge and expertise, giving customers the confidence to get out 
on their bikes more. The is done through workshops the majority of 
which focus on primary school children, an age when they are often 
starting to cycle without adults and are also doing Bikeability. Last 
year the workshops were extended to women, in association with 
British Cycling’s Breeze network; the company also trialled motor 
workshops, sharing basic car maintenance skills.
Last year 39,000 people benefited from our free maintenance 
workshops which helped them to cycle and drive more safely. Since 
their launch, these workshops have so far benefitted 104,000 people. 
Managing our impact on the environment in a responsible 
and ethical manner
In 2013 Halfords established a long-term partnership with Re~Cycle, 
a UK based charity that transforms lives through bicycle re-use. 
Providing a sustainable end-of-life solution, Re~Cycle diverts 
unwanted bikes from landfill/disuse and transforms the lives of people 
and communities both here in the UK and in Africa. 
The partnership provides opportunities for customers to donate 
unwanted bikes via national trade-in events and also at over 75 
stores on an on-going basis. Over 20,000 bikes have been donated 
so far, resulting in 300 tonnes of bikes being diverted from landfill /
disuse and benefitting an estimated 120,000 beneficiaries in Africa 
(household research in Ghana shows that each bike is used by an 
average of six people). Enthused Halfords’ colleagues have also 
raised over £295,000 to help support the charity’s costs. 
Some of the children’s bikes go to a cycle workshop we have set up 
at Onley prison (further details are found on page 12). Those bikes are 
re-conditioned and, along with new helmets, are donated to primary 
schools in disadvantaged areas, with over 330 donated so far. 
Halfords’ team takes part in  
the British Cycling challenge

During the year, we also complied with our obligations under the new Energy Savings Opportunity Scheme (“ESOS”). The energy audits 
required by large enterprises under this EU legislation, were completed in both the UK and the Republic of Ireland.

Maintaining the highest standards amongst our suppliers
We are strongly opposed to the exploitation of workers and we will 
not tolerate forced labour, or labour which involves physical, verbal 
or psychological harassment, or intimidation of any kind. We will not 
accept human trafficking or the exploitation of children and young 
people in our business and undertake all possible steps to ensure 
that these high standards are maintained. In compliance with the 
Modern Slavery Act 2015, which came into force in October 2015 we 
have published an anti-slavery and human trafficking statement and 
will continue to monitor our obligations in this regard.

We have a Code of Conduct on Ethical Trading which is also published 
on our website. We are committed to reviewing our policies each 
year to ensure they remain up to date and fit for purpose. In order 
to manage effectively the risks across our supply chain we have 
created a tiered system of adherence which recognises that products 
sourced from different locations carry different risks and therefore 
need managing in different ways.

Audit Committee Report
Chairman’s Introduction 
Throughout the year, the Audit Committee has continued its work 
of reviewing the effectiveness of Halfords’ corporate governance 
framework with particular emphasis on the quality of financial 
reporting, internal control, and risk management systems.
The Committee’s oversight of risk and internal control has been 
further strengthened this year through two significant ongoing 
initiatives. Firstly, recognising the usefulness of an earlier presentation 
on cybersecurity risk from KPMG, we have initiated a series of 
management briefings to the Committee. The briefings explain in 
detail how selected key areas of business risk are managed. The 
Committee has already received presentations on retail product 
quality and safety assurance processes, and on retail erosion 
management. Secondly, in response to the requirements of the 2014 
UK Corporate Governance Code, the Committee receives a specific 
update from Internal Audit at each meeting to allow it to monitor the 
Company’s risk management and internal control systems. These 
updates were provided throughout the year.
This report explains in detail how the Committee undertook its duties.

Membership and Remit of the Audit Committee
a. Membership
All the members of the Audit Committee are independent 
Non-Executive Directors. Having been the Deputy Chief Executive 
and Finance Director of House of Fraser Plc, and currently chairing 
two other listed companies’ Audit Committees, 
David Adams is considered by the Board to have recent and 
relevant financial experience and so the requisite experience 
to chair the Committee. Each of the other independent Non-
Executive Directors has, through their other business activities, 
significant experience in financial matters. 
The Chairman of the Company’s Board, Executive Directors, 
senior managers and key advisors are invited to attend 
meetings as appropriate in order to ensure that the Committee 
maintains a current and well-informed view of events within the 
business, and to reinforce a strong risk management culture. 
The Audit Committee meets according to the requirements of 
the Company’s financial calendar. The meetings of the Audit 
Committee also provide the opportunity for the independent 
Non-Executive Directors to meet without the Executive Directors 
present and to raise any issues of concern with the Auditor. There 
have been three such meetings in the period ended  
1 April 2016 and nothing of note was reported.
b. Remit
The Audit Committee’s responsibilities include:
•	 making recommendations to the Board on the appointment  
of the external Auditor, including on effectiveness, 
independence, non-audit work undertaken (against a formal 
policy) and remuneration;
•	 reviewing the accounting principles, policies and practices 
adopted throughout the period;
•	 reviewing and approving external financial reporting for 
adoption by the Board;
•	 assisting the Board in achieving its obligations under the  
UK Corporate Governance Code in areas of risk management 
and internal control, focusing particularly on compliance with 
legal requirements, accounting standards and the Listing 
Rules;
•	 ensuring that an effective system of internal financial and  
non-financial controls is maintained; 
•	 approving a formal whistleblowing policy whereby staff may, 
in confidence, disclose issues of concern about possible 
malpractice or wrongdoings by any of the Group’s businesses 
or any of its employees without fear of reprisal, and includes 
arrangements to investigate and respond to any issues raised;
•	 approving the Company’s systems and controls for the 
prevention of bribery and corruption, including the receipt of 
any reports on non-compliance; and
•	 approving the Group’s Treasury Policy, including foreign 
currency and interest rate exposure.
The Audit Committee has reviewed its T erms of Reference and its 
composition during the year and believes that both are appropriate. 
Copies of full T erms of Reference are available on the Company’s 
website or on request from the Company Secretary.

Audit Committee Report continued
The Committee also met on 26 May 2016. Amongst other pieces 
of business, the Committee reviewed the year-end Chief Financial 
Officer’s and external Auditor’s reports, and recommended the 
Preliminary Statement and Annual Report to the Board for approval. 
The Committee received a presentation from management 
addressing the commercial aspects and financial reporting issues 
associated with supplier rebates.
Significant Issues in Relation to the Financial Statements
In order to discharge its responsibility to consider accounting 
integrity, the Committee carefully considers key judgements applied 
in the preparation of the consolidated financial statements which 
are set out on pages 78 to 119. The Committee’s review included 
consideration of the following key accounting judgements:
•	 Impairment of Goodwill associated with Autocentres
 — Following the acquisition of Nationwide in 2010, the Group 
holds significant goodwill in the Halfords Autocentre business. 
There are a number of factors that could impact on the future 
profitability of the business (e.g. loss of key customer, change 
in market behaviour) and there is therefore a risk that the 
business may not meet the growth projections necessary to 
support the carrying value of the intangible asset (see note 11 
of the financial statements).
 — The Audit Committee has received detailed reports from 
Halfords’ finance team and external Auditor addressing this issue. 
Consideration has been given to ensuring that cash flow models, 
discount rates, sensitivity analysis and centre profitability are all 
reasonable. The Committee concluded that it is satisfied with the 
accounting treatment of impairment of goodwill.
•	 Valuation of inventory within the retail division
 — With the business holding a wide range of stock, it is likely that 
changing consumer demands will mean that some lines cannot 
be sold, or will be sold at below the carrying value. Provisions 
are made to reflect this. Given the difficulties in forecasting 
market trends, there is a risk that inventory provisions made 
will be inappropriate or incomplete (see note 13 of the financial 
statements). Management has an established methodology for 
assessing inventory provisions. Range reviews are regularly 
undertaken to ensure that all discontinued inventory is 
identified.
 — The Audit Committee has received detailed reports from 
Halfords’ finance team and external Auditor addressing this 
issue. After consideration of the accuracy of the provisioning 
model, the completeness and accuracy of range reviews, 
and the reflection of these reviews within the provisions, the 
Committee concluded that it is satisfied with the accounting 
treatment of the valuation of inventory.
External Auditors
a. Effectiveness of external audit
The effectiveness of the external audit is considered throughout 
the year through, amongst other factors, assessment of the 
degree of the audit firm’s challenge of key estimates and 
judgements made by the business, feedback from any external 
or internal quality reviews on the audit and the wider quality of 
communication with the Committee.
In addition at its meeting in March 2016, the Committee performed 
a specific evaluation of the performance of the external 
auditor considering the areas set out above and feedback from 
management. Following this, the Committee concluded that:
•	 The overall audit approach, materiality, threshold, and areas of 
audit focus were appropriate to the business; and
•	 The audit team possessed the necessary quality, expertise and 
experience to provide an independent and objective audit.
b Approach to appointment or reappointment
KPMG LLP (formerly KPMG Audit plc) was appointed as external 
Auditor to the Group in 2009 following a formal tender process. 
Since that time, KPMG LLP has complied with the partner rotation 
requirement set out in Ethical Standards for Auditors, with the 
most recent rotation taking place in 2014.
The Audit Committee considers that the relationship with the 
Auditor is working well and is satisfied with its independence, 
objectivity and effectiveness and has not considered it necessary 
to require KPMG LLP to re-tender for external audit work this year. 
The Audit Committee has recommended to the Board, for approval 
by shareholders at the AGM on 26 July 2016, the reappointment of 
KPMG LLP as external Auditor.
c Approach to safeguarding objectivity and independence 
if non-audit services are provided 
The Audit Committee has established a policy to ensure that 
any non-audit services delivered by the external Auditor will not 
jeopardise objectivity and independence. The policy is consistent 
with Ethical Standards for Auditors.
The policy specifies:
‘The external Auditor can be used to provide non-audit services 
subject to any non-audit engagement proposal provided by the 
external Auditor being formally approved by the Audit Committee 
before contractual arrangements are entered into, except for
i. Half year review; and 
ii. Internal support services supplied by the auditors in order to 
support the Company’s own internal audit function in determining 
and executing the Company’s annual Internal Audit plan.
Other than for the above, for each separate service proposed 
to be provided by the Auditor, the Group Chief Financial Officer 
will prepare a note either to be tabled and minuted at an Audit 
Committee meeting or to be circulated via email to the Audit 
Committee members and the CEO giving a description of the work 
to be undertaken, the reasons why the Auditor is involved in the 
proposal and how objectivity and independence has, and is seen 
to be, safeguarded.
Consent is required from the Audit Committee Chair on behalf of 
the Audit Committee before the Auditor can be engaged for non-
audit services.’
In addition, the external Auditor follows its own ethical guidelines 
and continually reviews is audit team to ensure that its 
independence is not compromised.
An analysis of the fees earned by the external Auditor is disclosed 
in note 3 to the Financial Statements.
56 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 1 April 2016 slugline
Role and Effectiveness of Internal Audit 
The Company has a dedicated in-house Internal Audit team, which 
is able to obtain advice from external specialists if necessary. 
The team principally reviews the effectiveness of the controls 
operating within the business by undertaking an agreed schedule 
of independent audits each year. The Audit Committee determines 
the nature and scope of the annual audit programme and revises it 
from time to time according to changing business circumstances and 
requirements. The Audit Committee also confirms that Internal Audit 
has appropriate resources available to it. The annual audit programme 
is derived from an audit universe including financial and commercial 
processes, governance issues, and key corporate risks.
Internal Audit reports on a day-to-day basis to the Group’s Chief 
Financial Officer, but is independent in action and reporting of issues, 
with direct line of communication to the Audit Committee Chairman. 
The findings of the independent audits are reported initially to 
executive management and any necessary corrective actions are 
agreed. Summaries of these reports are presented to, and discussed 
with, the Audit Committee along with details of progress against 
action plans as appropriate.
Whistleblowing 
A Whistleblowing Policy and Procedure enables colleagues to report 
concerns on matters affecting the Group or their employment, 
without fear of recrimination. Posters publicising whistleblowing 
channels are distributed to all stores, Autocentres, distribution 
centres and the Support Centre.
The Whistleblowing Policy and Procedure was reviewed and 
approved by the Audit Committee and was subject to an internal audit 
review during the year. The Company Secretary provides the Audit 
Committee with a regular summary of whistleblowing contacts and 
resolutions.
Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy  
The Group’s Anti-Bribery and Corruption Policy statement reinforces 
that the Halfords Board is committed to conducting its business 
affairs so as to ensure that it does not engage in or facilitate any 
form of corruption. It is Halfords’ policy to prohibit all forms of 
corruption amongst our employees, suppliers and any associated 
parties acting on our behalf. The Group has a detailed Anti-Bribery 
and Corruption Policy and maintains Gifts and Hospitality Registers. 
Anti-bribery expectations are set out in standard purchasing terms 
and conditions. Face-to-face and online training has been provided 
to colleagues to raise the awareness of anti-bribery and corruption 
legislation. 
The Audit Committee has requested that Anti-Bribery and Corruption 
safeguards are periodically reviewed by Internal Audit.
Internal Control and Risk Management 
Details of the Group’s internal control and risk management 
framework are set out on page 47.

Remuneration Committee Report
“Our approach to 
remuneration supports 
a strong focus on 
performance and reflects 
our key strategic 
objectives.”
Remuneration Committee Chairman’s Letter
Dear Shareholders 
On behalf of the Remuneration Committee, I am pleased to present the 
Remuneration Report for the financial period ended 1 April 2016.
The Report consists of three sections:
•	 this Annual Statement;
•	 our Policy Report, which sets out a summary of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy for all Directors of Halfords; and
•	 our Annual Report on Remuneration, which sets out the details 
of how the Company’s Directors were paid during FY16 and how 
our Policy will be implemented in FY17. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration is subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 
2016 AGM.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee was pleased that shareholders approved our 
Remuneration Policy at the AGM that took place on 30 July 2014. 
There are no proposals to amend the Policy at this time and it is 
intended that it continues to apply until 2017. 
Read more about the Remuneration Policy in the corporate 
governance section, the full policy is online at www.halfordscompany.
com/investors/governance/remuneration-policy
See more on our Remuneration Policy on pages 60 to 62.
Remuneration Structure and Philosophy
The Remuneration structure is comprised of the following elements: 
•	 fixed pay — base salary, benefits and pension; and 
•	 variable pay — annual cash bonus and Performance Share Plan.
Our approach to remuneration supports a strong focus on 
performance and reflects our key strategic objectives. Our 
remuneration philosophy aims to provide Executive Directors with 
incentive opportunities strongly aligned to growth, profitability and 
shareholder returns.
Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
T o ensure that the interests of the Executive Directors continue 
to align with the delivery of the strategy, the Committee again 
determined that the performance measure for the FY16 PSP would be 
based on 75% Group EBITDA growth and 25% Group Revenue growth.
The rules for the current PSP, which were approved by shareholders 
at the 2015 AGM, now contain clawback provisions in addition to the 
existing malus provisions. 
Annual Bonus 
PBT was £81.5m in 2015/16 and therefore 15% of this element of the 
bonus was achieved (80% of the total bonus being based on PBT). 
There has been strong progress against strategic objectives during 
the year particularly in relation to 50:39 store delivery, value added 
sales growth and retention of store colleagues. The Committee judged 
that 11.5% of this element should be paid. This resulted in an overall 
bonus of 23.5% of maximum.

Save As you Earn Scheme (“SA yE”)
The Committee believes that encouraging colleagues to own shares 
in the business encourages them to ‘think like an owner’ in their 
dealings with customers and colleagues, which is why the Company 
took advantage of the change in HMRC rules and doubled the monthly 
sum that colleagues are permitted to save. Share ownership is another 
factor that makes Halfords a great place to work, as it drives colleague 
motivation and commitment. At the AGM in 2014, shareholders 
approved the renewal of a UK SAYE Scheme, which led to the adoption 
of new rules for the UK SAYE. Shareholders also approved measures to 
allow overseas colleagues to participate in similar SAYE schemes.
Following the announcement of our new Moving Up A Gear strategy 
in November 2015, the Committee approved a new SAYE opportunity 
for colleagues to encourage further share ownership in alignment 
with the launch of the strategy.
Incentive/Remuneration Review
Jill McDonald was appointed as the Group CEO in place of Matt Davies 
on 11 May 2015. In order to ensure her appointment, the Board agreed 
it was necessary to award her 114,702 ordinary shares in the Company 
to compensate for awards made by her previous employer that lapsed 
on resignation. The value of these shares was £529,819. These share 
awards were announced on 23 March 2015 when her appointment 
was made public. The first tranche of 38,973 shares was awarded in 
February 2016, and it is expected that future tranches will be delivered 
in a similar way until the full commitment is satisfied. 
The Committee approved a 2% salary increase for Jill McDonald, 
mirroring that awarded to colleagues throughout the Support Centre 
in October 2015.  
Following the departure of Andrew Findlay, the Chief Financial 
Officer in October, the Committee recommended to the Board the 
approval of an appropriate CFO remuneration package to achieve 
the appointment of his successor. The Board was delighted to secure 
Jonny Mason as the Group CFO and agreed that, as part of his 
package, it was necessary to compensate him for an accrued but as 
yet unpaid bonus due from his previous employer as announced on  
2 July 2015, details of this appear on page 64. Jonny Mason was not 
eligible for the pay review as he was appointed after the review on  
12 October 2015. 
During the period the Committee set the performance targets for the 
2016 PSP and these were set to be consistent with, and supportive 
of,  the Moving Up A Gear strategy communicated in November 2015.
Our Remuneration Policy (approved in 2014) allowed the Committee 
to award a bonus of up to 150% for the CFO and we have taken the 
opportunity to increase his total potential award to this level.
The Executive Directors reviewed the Non-Executive Directors’ fees 
as detailed on page 62.
The Committee has previously approved the addition of malus and 
clawback provisions within the FY16 Executive Bonus and Deferred 
Bonus schemes and, as mentioned above, the introduction of 
clawback provisions into the new PSP rules, alongside existing malus 
provisions was approved at the FY15 AGM. In each case, these 
provisions give the Committee the ability to reduce awards prior to 
vesting or require repayment of awards that have vested or been paid 
in certain circumstances.
Concluding Remarks
I hope that you will find the Report clear, transparent and informative. 
The Committee has sought to set a remuneration environment 
that strongly aligns the commercial direction of the Group with 
the interests of shareholders, whilst reflecting best practice 
developments and market trends. I look forward to your support  
at the Company’s AGM. 
Yours faithfully
Claudia Arney 
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Remuneration Policy Summary
Remuneration policy summary
This section of the report sets out Halfords’ Remuneration Policy for all of the Executive Directors and Non-Executive Directors. It explains 
the purpose and principles underlying the structure of remuneration packages and how the Policy links remuneration to the achievement of 
sustained high performance and long-term value creation. 
As our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (the “Policy”) is unchanged from that approved by shareholders at the 2014 Annual General Meeting on 
29 July 2014, we have provided a summary of the Policy to give context to decisions taken by the Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) 
during the year. The full Policy was in the Report and Accounts for 2014 and it can also be found on our website. 
Read more online at 
www.halfordscompany.com/investors/governance/remuneration-policy
A summary of the Policy is provided in the following tables.
Key Elements of Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy
Base salary
Base salary is set at an appropriate level to attract and retain management of a high calibre with the necessary financial, retail, customer 
service and digital skill sets required to deliver a sustainable business model and drive shareholder returns.
Key Policy features Implementation of the Policy in the period
Base salaries are reviewed annually, typically with effect from  
1 October, with increases broadly aligned to those in the wider 
workforce. Occasionally, larger increases may be considered to 
take account of changes in an individual’s role or responsibilities, 
individual progression or experience or external market trends. 
With effect from 1 October 2015, the salary of the CEO was 
increased by 2%, mirroring the increase generally awarded to 
colleagues in the Support Centre. Salaries will next be reviewed 
from 1 October 2016.
Changes made
None
Benefits
T o provide Executive Directors with market competitive benefits consistent with the role.
Key Policy features Implementation of the Policy in the period
Executive Directors receive various benefits as part of their 
package, such as a fully expensed car (or a cash allowance and a 
fuel card), private health insurance and life assurance. Where an 
Executive Director relocates to take up a role, other benefits may 
be paid, such as relocation expenses, a housing allowance and 
school fees. 
Executive Directors continued to enjoy the same benefits package 
as their predecessors had in the prior year. No allowances or 
benefits were increased. 
Changes made
None
Pensions
T o provide Executive Directors with an appropriate allowance for retirement planning.
Key Policy features Implementation of the Policy in the period
Defined employer contribution funding to the Halfords Pension 
Plan or payments into a personal fund or a cash allowance for 
Executive Directors to make their own pension arrangements.  
The maximum payable by the Company will be 20% of  
base salary. 
The CEO and CFO will receive 15% of base salary.
Changes made
None
60 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 1 April 2016 slugline
Annual Bonus
T o incentivise Executive Directors to achieve annual financial targets and performance against strategic goals. 
Key Policy features Implementation of the Policy in the period
The maximum annual bonus opportunity is 150% of base salary. 
The annual bonus is based on a mix of financial and strategic 
measures. Measures are selected each year by the Committee to 
ensure continued focus on the Company’s strategy. At least 50% 
of the bonus will be based on financial measures.
Generally the annual bonus is paid in cash, but the Committee 
might determine that it be paid in shares or in a mixture of cash 
and shares.
The Committee may require a portion of any bonus earned to be 
deferred. Deferred bonus awards are normally made in the form of 
nil cost options, which normally vest three years from award. The 
Committee may decide to pay dividends on those shares during 
the vesting period, either as cash or as additional shares. 
Malus provisions apply to any deferred shares, allowing 
the Committee to scale back any award before exercise in 
circumstances that the Committee determines is appropriate 
such as a material misstatement of the Company’s results, serious 
reputational damage to the Company, or where the Company 
suffers serious losses.
In the period, the CEO’s maximum bonus opportunity was 150% 
of base salary, 1/3 of which will be paid in shares and deferred for 
three years (with dividends reinvested), and the remainder paid in 
cash. The CFO’s maximum bonus opportunity was 100% of base 
salary, paid in cash. 
Changes made
The FY16 Executive Bonus and Deferred Bonus Plan reinforced 
existing malus provisions in relation to any deferred element 
and introduced clawback provisions for any paid element, giving 
the Company the power to seek redress from any individual 
for material misstatement, employee misconduct, serious 
reputational damage or miscalculation of metrics leading to an 
award under either scheme. The principles set out in the FY16 
Executive Bonus and the Deferred Bonus Plan are continued in 
FY17. The CFO’s bonus opportunity will increase to 150% of salary 
for FY17 with one third paid in shares and deferred. 
PSP
T o attract and retain Executive Directors of a high calibre.
T o incentivise and reward long-term performance and align Executive Directors’ interests with those of our shareholders.
Key Policy features Implementation of the Policy in the period
The PSP comprises annual awards, usually in the form of nil-
cost options, with vesting based on performance against pre-
determined conditions over a minimum three-year period. 
The maximum core award is 150% of base salary. A participant 
has the opportunity to earn up to 1.5 × core award for exceptional 
performance and, therefore, the maximum annual face value of 
awards is 225% of base salary. Any award paid over the core 
award is subject to a two-year retention period.
Awards granted in 2016 will vest subject to the achievement of 
stretching Revenue and EBITDA targets. 
The vesting of 25% of the awards will be determined by the growth 
in the Group’s Revenue and the vesting of 75% of the award will be 
determined by the growth in the Group’s EBITDA  
over a three-year performance period.
In addition to achieving these targets, the vesting of awards will be 
subject to meeting a net debt underpin. 
The core award for the CEO and CFO in the period was 150% of 
base salary.
Changes made
The new PSP rules approved at the AGM in FY15 restated existing 
malus provisions and introduced clawback provisions, each 
giving the Company the power to seek redress from any individual 
for material misstatement, employee misconduct, serious 
reputational damage or miscalculation of metrics leading to an 
award under the PSP. During the period, the Committee set the 
performance targets for the 2016 PSP to be consistent with, and 
supportive of, the Moving Up A Gear strategy communicated in 
November 2015.

Remuneration Policy Summary continued
Key Elements of Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy
NED Fees
Fee levels are designed to attract and retain high-calibre individuals to serve as Non-Executive Directors.
Key Policy features Implementation of the Policy in the period
Fee levels are set to reflect the time, commitment and experience of 
the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, benchmarking fees 
against UK listed retail comparators. 
The fees of Non-Executive Directors are normally reviewed every 
two years by the Board, following a recommendation from the 
CEO. The Chairman’s fees are determined by the Remuneration 
Committee, again following a recommendation from the CEO.
The Chairman’s fee includes a sum for chairing the Nomination 
Committee but other Committee Chairmen may receive an 
additional fee for that role, as does the Senior Independent Director.
The fees are normally paid in cash quarterly but may be paid in 
shares if this is considered appropriate.
Fees for Non-Executive Directors remained unchanged in the 
period.  
Changes made
Given that fees for Non-Executive Directors have not been 
increased since 2008, it was felt appropriate for them to be 
reviewed at this time. For FY17, appropriate benchmarking data for 
the FTSE 250 was analysed and the following recommendations, 
which are consistent with market practice elsewhere, are proposed:
•	 for Non-Executive Directors basic fees, a 4% increase will be 
applied giving an increase in basic fee to £50,000;
•	 the fee for Chairing the Audit and Remuneration Committees will 
increase to £10,000 each;
•	 a fee for Chairing the new CSR Committee will be introduced and 
will commence at £5,000 as this is a new role;
•	 the fee for the Senior Independent Director to be reduced by 
£5,000 to £10,000. This is still ahead of the median and, when 
combined with the proposed increased fee for Chairing the Audit 
Committee, will mean that in practice, the recipient’s overall fee 
received is not reduced; and,
•	 the same principle as is used for basic Non-Executive Director 
fees (set out above) is also applied to the Chairman of the Board. 
This would give a 4% rise, which is fractionally less than the 
median.

Advisors 
During the year, the Committee has been supported by Jonathan 
Crookall, People Director and Justin Richards, Company Secretary 
until his departure in December 2015, and by his replacement 
Tim O’Gorman from January 2016. The CEO and CFO also attend 
Committee meetings on occasion, at the request of the Committee; 
they are never present when their own remuneration is discussed. 
The Committee also engaged with Deloitte LLP , which advised on 
performance measures for the PSP , remuneration reporting and 
other remuneration matters. Fees paid to Deloitte for this advice were 
£6,250, their fees are charged on a time and materials basis. Deloitte 
has also provided advice to management, to enable their support of 
the Committee, primarily in relation to remuneration reporting. 
Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and adheres to the Remuneration Consultants Group Code of 
Conduct when dealing with the Committee. We consider Deloitte’s 
advice to be independent and impartial. We are also satisfied that the 
Deloitte Engagement Partner and team, who provided remuneration 
advice to the Committee, do not have connections with the Company 
that might impair their independence. The Committee considered 
the potential for conflicts of interest and judged that there were 
appropriate safeguards against such conflicts.
Willis T owers Watson also provided the Committee with executive 
salary benchmark data. Willis T owers Watson is also a signatory of 
the Remuneration Consultants Code of Conduct. Fees paid to Willis 
T owers Watson for this advice were £3,500. Willis T owers Watson also 
provides insurance broking services to the Group.
Shareholder Dialogue
The voting outcome from the 2015 Annual General Meeting reflected 
very strong individual and institutional shareholder support. We 
continue to be mindful of the concerns of our shareholders and 
other stakeholders and welcome shareholder feedback on any 
issue related to executive remuneration. In the event of a substantial 
vote against a resolution in relation to Directors’ remuneration, we 
would seek to understand the reasons for any such vote, determine 
appropriate actions and detail any such actions in response to it in 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report.

a PSP award in 2012 as this was prior to his joining the Company.

Salary
In keeping with its usual cycle of reviewing Company-wide salaries in October, the Committee considered an executive pay report compiled for 
it by Willis T owers Watson and accordingly decided to increase the CEO salary by 2%, mirroring the increase generally awarded to colleagues 
in the Support Centre. The CFO did not join until 12 October 2015 and therefore his salary was not eligible for review. Salaries will next be 
reviewed from 1 October 2016.
2015/16 Annual Bonus 
Annual bonuses for FY16 for Executive Directors were based 80% on Group PBT and 20% on the delivery of key strategic initiatives crucial to 
the delivery of the Company’s strategy.

The performance conditions for 2013 awards are based on Group revenue performance and Group EBITDA growth. The CAGR and EBITDA 
performance are assessed on an independent basis. However, to ensure that the PSP continues to support sustainable performance, the 
performance levels are set on a stepped basis, where vesting on the revenue measure can only be one step above the EBITDA measure.

In addition to achieving these targets, the vesting of awards will be subject to meeting an underpin of net debt to EBITDA ratio no greater 
than 1.5x throughout the three-year performance period. This will ensure that net debt remains at appropriate levels and management is not 
incentivised to increase net debt levels to meet targets; the focus is to maximise the return on cash investments. The Core Award shares that 
vest will become exercisable in August 2018. T o the extent that awards vest in line with the performance multiplier outlined above, these shares 
will only become exercisable in August 2020, following a retention period of two years. Please note, the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts had 
a typographical error, the correct figures as agreed by the Remuneration Committee on 3 June 2015 are shown in the table above.

Shareholding Guidelines (Audited)
The Committee believes that it is important that Executive Directors’ interests are aligned with those of our shareholders to incentivise them 
to deliver the corporate strategy, thus creating value for all shareholders. Executive Directors are encouraged to acquire and retain shares 
with a value equal to 100% of their annual base salary. Executive Directors have a five-year period to build this shareholding following their 
appointment.

These figures include those of their spouse or civil partner and infant children, or stepchildren, as required by Section 822 of the Companies 
Act 2006. There was no change in these beneficial interests between 1 April 2016 and 1 June 2016.
Outside Appointments
Halfords recognises that its Executive Directors may be invited to become non-executive directors of other companies. Such non-executive 
duties can broaden experience and knowledge which can benefit Halfords. Subject to approval by the Board, Executive Directors are allowed 
to accept non-executive appointments and retain the fees received, provided that these appointments are not likely to lead to conflicts of 
interest. Jill McDonald received fees of £72,600 as a non-executive director of Inter Continental Hotels Group plc in the period.
Leaving Arrangements  
Matt Davies left on 30 April 2015, Andrew Findlay left on 1 October 2015. Neither received a termination payment and any outstanding

Annual Remuneration Report continued
How Remuneration Policy will be Implemented for 2016/17 — Executive Directors
Salary
Base salaries were reviewed with effect from 1 October 2015 and increases were made as per the details on page 60. Current salaries for the 
Executive Directors are as follows:
CEO £510,000
CFO £350,000
Salaries will next be reviewed with effect from 1 October 2016.
Annual Bonus
The annual bonus opportunity for 2016/17 will be as follows:
CEO •	 Maximum opportunity of 150% of base salary
•	 2/3	paid	in	cash
•	 1/3	paid	in	Halfords	shares	deferred	for	three	 years
CFO •	 Maximum opportunity of 150% of base salary
•	 2/3	paid	in	cash
•	 1/3	paid	in	Halfords	shares	deferred	for	three	 years
The annual bonus will continue to be based 80% on Profit Before Tax (‘PBT’) performance and 20% based on performance against strategic 
objectives. PBT targets range from 90% of budget, where payment is 15% to 110% of budget for maximum payment. The Committee reviews 
the goals included in the strategic objectives portion of the bonus to ensure that they remain appropriate. These objectives include metrics in 
relation to customer service and colleague engagement.
In determining whether any bonuses are payable, the Committee retains the discretionary authority to increase or decrease the bonus to 
ensure that the level of bonus paid is appropriate in the context of performance. Bonus targets are considered by the Board to be commercially 
sensitive as they could reveal information about Halfords’ business plan and budgeting process to competitors which could be damaging to 
Halfords’ business interests and therefore to shareholders.
Performance Share Plan
For the Executive Directors we intend to continue granting awards under the Performance Share Plan of 150% of base salary. If exceptional 
performance is achieved up to 1.5x the core award can be earned (‘performance multiplier’). The vesting of awards will be subject to meeting 
the following performance conditions:
Group Revenue  
Growth – CAGR 
(25% of the award)
Group EBITDA  
Growth 
(75% of the award)
Award “Multiplier” 
(up to 1.5× initial award) 
i.e. 225% of salary
1.5× initial award vesting 6.7% or more 7.5% or more
Straight-line vesting Between 5.5% and 6.7% Between 6.0% and 7.5%
Core Award
(150% of salary)
100% vesting 5.5% 6.0%
Straight-line vesting Between 4.0% and 5.5% Between 4.0% and 6.0%
30% vesting 4.0% 4.0%
0% vesting Below 4.0% Below 4.0%
In addition to achieving these targets, the vesting of awards will be subject to meeting an underpin of net debt to EBITDA ratio no greater 
than 1.5× throughout the three-year performance period. This will ensure that net debt remains at appropriate levels and management is not 
incentivised to increase net debt levels to meet targets; the focus is to maximise the return on cash investments. The Core Award shares that 
vest will become exercisable in May 2019. T o the extent that awards vest in line with the performance multiplier outlined above, these shares 
will only become exercisable in May 2021, following a retention period of two years. 
70 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 1 April 2016 slugline
While committed to the use of equity-based performance-related remuneration as a means of aligning Executive Directors’ interests with 
those of shareholders, we are aware of shareholders’ concerns on dilution through the issue of new shares to satisfy such awards. Therefore, 
when reviewing remuneration arrangements, we take into account the effects such arrangements may have on dilution. Halfords intends to 
comply with the Investment Association guidelines relating to the issue of new shares for equity incentive plans.

Directors’ Responsibilities
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN 
RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL 
STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
Group and parent Company financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and regulations. Company law requires the Directors 
to prepare Group and parent Company financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law they are required to prepare the Group 
financial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU 
and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent Company 
financial statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Group and parent Company and of 
their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and 
parent Company financial statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
•	 for the Group financial statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
•	 for the parent Company financial statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the parent 
Company financial statements; and
•	 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the parent Company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are 
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to 
prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that complies with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and 
dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view 
of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken 
as a whole; and
•	 the Annual Report and Accounts include a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the position 
of the issuer and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks 
and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, 
balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, 
business model and strategy.
Approved by order of the Board.

Independent auditor’s report to the 
members of Halfords Group plc only 
Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit 
1. Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Halfords Group plc (“the Group”) for the 52 week period ended 1 April 2016 set out on pages 79 to 
118. In our opinion: 
•	 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 1 April 2016 and of the 
Group’s profit for the 52 week period then ended; 
•	 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by 
the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
•	 the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework; and 
•	 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2. Our assessment of risks of material misstatement 
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, in 
decreasing order of audit significance, were as follows (unchanged from FY15): 
Valuation of Inventory within the Retail division: £156.5million (FY 2015: £147.8 million) 
Refer to pages 54 to 57 (Audit Committee Report), page 88 (accounting policy) and page 101 (financial disclosures). 
•	 The risk – Inventories are carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value with the result that the directors apply judgement in 
determining the appropriate provisions for obsolete stock based upon a detailed analysis of stock levels and discontinued inventory, the 
future usage of stock, net realisable value below cost based upon product strategy and stock loss at stores. There is a risk that the Group’s 
assessment of the level of these provisions is insufficient or inaccurate. 
•	 Our response – Our procedures in this area included testing the design and effectiveness of controls across the division, including those 
identifying slow moving or discontinued products. We also considered sales subsequent to year-end to see whether the sale proceeds 
were sufficient to cover the net realisable value of inventories at year-end. In particular we focus on those inventory lines which are slow 
moving, have been replaced or are approaching the end of life. 
We used our own specialists to critically challenge the arithmetic model that underpins the obsolescent stock provision and compared the 
assumptions applied to available market data and met with management to understand both the current purchasing strategy and the key 
drivers for demand such as the sales plans for the coming financial year, new product launches and the level of expected discounting, as well 
as considering any product ranges that are forecast to be phased out or replaced against the Group’s purchasing plans. We also analysed 
stock holding and movement data to identify product lines with indicators of low stock turn or stock ageing with reference to the above, and 
assessed the historical accuracy of inventory provisioning, with reference to the level of inventory write-offs during the year. 
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in respect of inventory. 
Carrying amount of Goodwill associated with the Nationwide Autocentres acquisition: £69.7 million (FY 2015: £69.7 million) 
Refer to pages 54 to 57 (Audit Committee Report), page 90 (accounting policy) and page 99 (financial disclosures). 
•	 The risk – Following the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres in 2010, the Group holds significant goodwill in this business. The business 
operates in a competitive market, and commercial factors, such as loss of a significant customer, changes to market share or changes 
to the frequency with which customers replace their cars, may lead to a risk that the business does not meet the growth projections 
necessary to support the carrying value of the goodwill. Due to the inherent uncertainty involved in forecasting these cash flows, this is one 
of the key judgemental areas that our audit is concentrated on. 
•	 Our response – We determined the key sensitivities within the impairment and associated budgeting model, which we considered to be the 
discount rate and the growth rate. Our procedures included challenging certain assumptions used through discussion with the directors 
and comparison to recently available market data, and also assessing the Group’s performance against budget in the current and prior 
periods to evaluate the historical accuracy of overall forecasts. We have also performed our own sensitivity analysis including, among 
others, applying the actual last two year average EBITDA growth to the impairment analysis, which still indicates that no impairment is 
required. 
We considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures about the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in key 
assumptions. 
3. Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit 
Materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £4.0 million (FY15: £4.0 million), determined with reference to a benchmark 
of Group profit before tax, of which it represents 5.0% (FY15: 5.0%). 
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £0.2 million (FY15: £0.2 million) in addition 
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
76 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 1 April 2016 24421.02     13 June 2016 1:51 PM     proof 2
The Group team performed the audit of the Group as if it was a single aggregated set of financial information. The audit was performed using 
the materiality set out above and covered 100% of total Group revenue, Group profit before taxation, and total Group assets. 
4. Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion: 
•	 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
•	 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared 
is consistent with the financial statements. 
5. We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks 
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
•	 the directors’ Viability Statement on page 39, concerning the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the directors’ 
assessment and expectations of the group’s continuing in operation over the 3 years to March 2019; or 
•	 the disclosures in the accounting policies of the financial statements concerning the use of the going concern basis of accounting. 
6. We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
•	 we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the directors’ statement that they 
consider that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position and performance, business model and strategy; or 
•	 the Audit Committee report, as set out on pages 54 to 57 does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the Audit and 
Risk Committee. 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
•	 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
•	 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
•	 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
•	 the directors’ statement, set out on page 39 in relation to going concern and longer term viability; and 
•	 the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on pages 40 to 47 relating to the company’s compliance with the eleven provisions of the 
2014 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review. 
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities. 
Scope and responsibilities 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 73, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. A description of the scope of an audit of financial statements 
is provided on the Financial Reporting Council’s website at www.frc.org.uk/auditscopeukprivate. This report is made solely to the company’s 
members as a body and is subject to important explanations and disclaimers regarding our responsibilities, published on our website at www.

Accounting Policies
General Information
Halfords Group plc is a company domiciled in the United Kingdom. The consolidated financial statements of the Company as at and for the 
period ended 1 April 2016 comprise the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. 
Statement of Compliance 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
EU (“adopted IFRSs”).
Basis of Preparation
The consolidated financial statements of Halfords Group plc and its subsidiary undertakings (together “the Group”) are prepared on a going 
concern basis for the reasons set out in the Directors’ Report on page 39, and under the historical cost convention, except where adopted 
IFRSs require an alternative treatment. The principal variations relate to financial instruments (IAS 39 “Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement”) and share based payments (IFRS 2 “Share-based payment”). 
The financial statements are presented in millions of UK pounds, rounded to the nearest £0.1m.
The accounts of the Group are prepared for the period up to the Friday closest to 31 March each year. Consequently, the financial statements 
for the current period cover the 52 weeks to 1 April 2016, whilst the comparative period covered the 53 weeks to 3 April 2015. 
Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiary Undertakings 
A subsidiary is an entity controlled by Halfords.  Control is achieved when Halfords is exposed, or has rights, to variable returns from its 
involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power, directly or indirectly, over the investee.  
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on transactions between Group companies are eliminated on consolidation. 
Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
The financial statements of all subsidiary undertakings are prepared to the same reporting date as the Company. All subsidiary undertakings 
have been consolidated.
The subsidiary undertakings of the Company at 1 April 2016 are detailed in note 4 to the Company balance sheet on page 116.
Business Combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the 
fair values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree. Acquisition related costs are recognised as expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred.
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of the acquired entity that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 ‘Business 
Combinations’ are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business 
combination over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after 
reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair value of these elements exceeds the cost of the business combination, the excess is 
recognised immediately in the income statement.
Revenue Recognition
Retail 
Retail revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates, promotions 
and returns. Revenue is recognised on the sale of goods when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to the 
buyer and the amount of revenue can be measured reliably. Revenue on goods delivered is recognised when the customer accepts delivery 
and on services when those services have been rendered.
Car Servicing
Car Servicing revenue comprises the provision of servicing to external customers, net of value added tax, rebates and promotions. Revenue is 
recognised at the point at which those services have been rendered. 
Promotions and Returns
The Group operates a variety of sales promotion schemes that give rise to goods and services being sold at a discount to standard retail price. 
Revenue is adjusted to show sales net of all related discounts. A provision for estimated returns is made representing the profit on goods sold 
during the year which are expected to be returned and refunded after the year end based on past experience. Revenue is reduced by the value 
of sales returns provided for during the year.

Accounting Policies continued
Finance Income
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested. Income is recognised, as it accrues in profit or loss, using the effective interest 
rate method.
Non-recurring Items
Non-recurring items are those items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence. The Group’s management consider that these 
items should be separately identified within their relevant income statement category to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results.
Earnings Per Share
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for its ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the profit or 
loss attributable to ordinary shareholders of the Company by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period, 
adjusted for own shares held. Diluted EPS is determined by adjusting the profit or loss attributable to ordinary shareholders and the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares outstanding, adjusted for own shares held, for the effects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares, which 
comprise share options granted to employees.
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items. A reconciliation 
of this alternative measure to the statutory measure required by IFRS is given in note 9.
Foreign Currency Translation
Functional and Presentation Currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling, which is the Group’s presentation currency and are rounded to the 
nearest hundred thousand, except where it is deemed relevant to disclose the amounts to the nearest pound. Items included in the financial 
statements of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (the 
functional currency).
Transactions and Balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date. 
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are subject 
to effective cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are measured at fair value are retranslated at the exchange rate 
at the date that the fair value was determined. Foreign currency differences arising on retranslation are recognised in profit or loss, except for 
differences arising on qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations are translated to sterling at the exchange rate at the reporting date. The income and expenses of 
foreign operations are translated to sterling at an average exchange rate. Foreign currency differences are recognised in other comprehensive 
income and a separate component of equity. When a foreign operation is disposed of, the relevant amount in equity is transferred to profit  
or loss.
Employee Benefits
i) Pensions
The Halfords Pension Plan is a contract based plan, where each member has their own individual pension policy, which they monitor 
independently. The Group pays fixed contributions and has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. The costs of 
contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement in the period that they arise.
ii) Share based Payment Transactions
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share based compensation plans.
The fair value of the employee services received under such schemes is recognised as an expense in the income statement. Fair values are 
determined by use of an appropriate pricing model and incorporate an assessment of relevant market performance conditions.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is adjusted to reflect the number of awards for which the related service and non-market 
vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an expense is based on the number of awards that 
meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the 
revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
86 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 1 April 2016 24421.02     13 June 2016 1:51 PM     proof 2
Taxation
Income tax expense comprises current and deferred tax. Current tax and deferred tax are recognised in profit or loss except to the extent that 
it relates to a business combination, or items recognised directly in equity or in other comprehensive income. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted, at the reporting date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
The tax base of an asset is the amount that will be deductible for tax purposes against any taxable economic benefits that will flow to an 
entity when it recovers the carrying amount of the asset. If those economic benefits will not be taxable, the tax base of the asset is equal to its 
carrying amount.
The tax base of a liability is its carrying amount, less any amount that will be deductible for tax purposes in respect of that liability in future 
periods. In the case of revenue which is received in advance, the tax base of the resulting liability is its carrying amount, less any amount of the 
revenue that will not be taxable in future periods.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities 
and their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an asset 
or liability in a transaction other than a business combination, that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or 
loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred taxation is calculated using rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred asset is realised or 
the deferred taxation liability is settled.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary 
differences can be utilised.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. Interim 
equity dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.
Intangible Assets
i) Goodwill 
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Goodwill is subsequently measured at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. An impairment charge is recognised in profit or loss for any amount by which the carrying value of 
goodwill exceeds its recoverable amount.
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the 
synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more 
frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired.
For acquisitions prior to 3 April 2010 costs directly attributable to business combinations formed part of the consideration payable when 
calculating goodwill. Adjustments to contingent consideration, and therefore the consideration payable and goodwill, are made at each 
reporting date until the consideration is finally determined.
Acquisitions after this date fall under the provisions of ‘Revised IFRS 3 Business Combinations (2009)’. For these acquisitions transaction 
costs, other than share and debt issue costs, will be expensed as incurred and subsequent adjustments to the fair value of consideration 
payable will be recognised in profit or loss.
ii) Computer Software
Costs that are directly associated with identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will generate economic 
benefits beyond one year are recognised as intangible assets. These intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and 
impairment losses. Software is amortised over three to five years depending on the estimated useful economic life.
iii) Acquired Intangible Assets
Intangible assets that are acquired as a result of a business combination are recorded at fair value at the acquisition date, provided they are 
identifiable and capable of reliable measurement. 
Amortisation is recognised in profit or loss on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets, other than goodwill, from 
the date that they are available for use, since this most closely reflects the expected pattern of consumption of the future economic benefits 
embodied in the asset. The estimated useful lives for the current and comparative periods are as follows:
•	 Brand names and trademarks 2 years, in respect of Autocentres, and 10 years in respect of cBoardman;
•	 Customer relationships 5 to 15 years; and
•	 Favourable leases over the term of the lease.
Amortisation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted if appropriate.

Accounting Policies continued
Property, Plant and Equipment
Property, plant and equipment is held at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation of property, plant and equipment is provided to write off the cost, less residual value, on a straight-line basis over their useful 
economic lives as follows:
•	 Leasehold premises with lease terms of 50 years or less are depreciated over the remaining period of the lease;
•	 Leasehold improvements are depreciated over the period of the lease to a maximum of 25 years;
•	 Motor vehicles are depreciated over 3 years;
•	 Fixtures, fittings and equipment are depreciated over 4 to 10 years according to the estimated life of the asset;
•	 Computer equipment is depreciated over 3 years; and
•	 Land is not depreciated. 
Depreciation is expensed to the income statement within operating expenses.
Residual values, remaining useful economic lives and depreciation periods and methods are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate. 
Impairment of Assets
Tangible and intangible assets that are subject to amortisation and depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the 
asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and 
value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash 
flows (cash-generating units). For goodwill, an annual impairment review is performed at each balance sheet date.
Leases
Finance Leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance 
leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease’s inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the 
minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the 
finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in borrowings. The interest element 
of the rental is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability for each period. 
Operating Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases. 
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease. The benefit 
of incentives from lessors are recognised on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Landlord Surrender Payments
Payments received from landlords in respect of the surrender of all or part of units previously occupied by the Group that do not represent 
an incentive for future rental commitments are recognised in the income statement on the exchange of contracts, where there are no further 
substantial acts to complete.
Sublease Income
The Group leases properties from which it no longer trades. These properties are often sublet to third parties. Rents receivable are recognised 
by offsetting the income against rental costs accounted for within selling and distribution costs in the income statement.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost of inventories is based on the weighted average cost principle 
and includes expenditure incurred in inventories, adjusted for rebates, and other costs incurred in bringing them to their existing location.
Provisions 
A provision is recognised if, as a result of a past event, the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation that can be estimated reliably, 
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined by discounting the 
expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
liability. The unwinding of the discount is recognised as a finance cost.
Details of the provisions recognised and the significant estimates and judgements can be seen in note 18.
88 Halfords Group plc Integrated Annual Report for the period ended 1 April 2016 24421.02     13 June 2016 1:51 PM     proof 2
Where the Group expects a provision to be reimbursed, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when the reimbursement is 
certain.
A provision for vacant properties is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the expected 
cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the Group 
recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract. The main uncertainty is the quantum and/or timing of the amounts 
payable, and the time value of money has been incorporated in to the provision amount to take account of this sensitivity.
Provision is also made for onerous contracts in loss-making stores and autocentres which management do not expect to become profitable.
A rent review provision is recognised when there are expected to be additional obligations as a result of the rent review, which forms part of the 
Group’s unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the lease contracts. The provision is based on management’s best estimate of the 
rent payable after the review. Key uncertainties are the estimate of the rent payable after the review has occurred.
A dilapidations provision is recognised when there are future obligations relating to the maintenance of leasehold properties. The provision is 
based on management’s best estimate of the obligation which forms part of the Group’s unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the 
lease contracts. Key uncertainties are the estimates of amounts due.
Provisions for employer and product liability claims are recognised when an incident occurs or when a claim made against the Group is 
received that could lead to there being an outflow of benefits from the Group. The provision is based on management’s best estimate of the 
settlement assisted by an external third party. The main uncertainty is the likelihood of success of the claimant and hence the pay-out however 
a provision is only recognised where there is considered to be reasonable grounds for the claim.
Financial Instruments
Financial Assets
The Group’s financial assets include cash and cash equivalents and trade and other receivables. All financial assets are recognised when the 
Group becomes party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
i) T rade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice amount less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all 
amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is determined as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, and is recognised in the income statement in operating expenses. 
ii) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, and other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less. For the purpose of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents includes bank 
overdrafts in addition to the definition above.
Financial Liabilities and Equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise trade and other payables and borrowings. All financial liabilities are recognised initially at their fair 
value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method. 
i) Bank borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. 
Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption 
value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method.
Finance cost comprises interest expense on borrowings, unwinding of the discount on provisions and the cost of forward foreign exchange 
contracts. 
ii) T rade payables
Trade payables are initially measured at fair value, and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
iii) Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds are received, net of direct issue costs. Own share consist of shares 
held within an employee benefit trust and are recognised at cost as a deduction from shareholders’ equity. Subsequent consideration received 
for the sale of such shares is also recognised in equity, with any difference between the sale proceeds from the original cost being taken to 
revenue reserves. No gain or loss is recognised in the Group Income Statement on transactions in own shares held.

Accounting Policies continued
iv) Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency exchange rates relating to the purchase 
of overseas sourced products. The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for trading purposes. The Group uses the 
derivatives to hedge highly probable forecast transactions and therefore the instruments are designated as cash flow hedges. 
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured at their fair value. The effective 
element of any gain or loss from remeasuring the derivative instrument is recognised directly in the hedging reserve.
The associated cumulative gain or loss is reclassified from the Group Statement of Changes in Equity and recognised in the Group Income 
Statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged transaction affects the Group Income Statement. Any element of the 
remeasurement of the derivative instrument that does not meet the criteria for an effective hedge is recognised immediately in the Group 
Income Statement within finance income or costs.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in other comprehensive income at that time remains in other comprehensive income and is recognised when the forecast transaction 
is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that 
was reported in other comprehensive income is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The full fair value of a hedging derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is more than 
twelve months or as a current asset or liability, if the remaining maturity of the hedged item is less than twelve months.
Estimates and Judgements
The preparation of the consolidated financial statements requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect 
the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions 
are based on historical experience and various other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which 
form the basis of making judgements about the carrying value of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual 
results may differ from the estimates.
The judgement and key sources of estimation uncertainty that have a significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements 
are detailed below:
Allowances Against the Carrying Value of Inventories
The Group reviews the market value of and demand for its inventories on a periodic basis to ensure that recorded inventory is stated at the 
lower of cost and net realisable value. In assessing the ultimate realisation of inventories, the Group is required to make judgements as to future 
demand requirements and to compare these with the current or committed inventory levels. Assumptions have been made relating to the 
timing and success of product ranges, which would impact estimated demand and selling prices.
Sensitivities to the assumptions for specific product lines are not expected by management to result in a material change in the overall 
allowances.
Intangible Asset Valuations
The measurement of fair values on a business combination requires the recognition and measurement of the identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities. The key judgements involved are the identification of which intangible assets meet the recognition criteria as set 
out in IAS 38, the fair values attributable to those intangible assets, excluding any buyer-specific synergies, and the useful lives of individual 
intangible assets. The useful lives of intangible assets relating to customer relationships involves judgement as to customer retention rates 
applicable. 
Impairment of Assets
Goodwill and other assets are subject to impairment reviews based on whether current or future events and circumstances suggest that their 
recoverable value may be less than their carrying value. Recoverable amount is based on a calculation of expected future cash flows, which 
includes management assumptions and estimates of future performance. Details of the assumptions used in the impairment review of goodwill 
and other assets are explained in note 11.
The carrying amount of these assets and liabilities can be seen in the notes to the financial statements on pages 92 to 118.

Adoption of new and revised standards
The following standards and interpretations are applicable to the Group and have been adopted in the current period as they are mandatory for 
the year ended 1 April 2016 but either have no material impact on the result or net assets of the Group or are not applicable.
•	 IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ (Amendment) — the amendments reverse the unintended requirement in IFRS 13 to disclose the recoverable 
amount of every cash-generating unit to which significant goodwill or indefinite-lived intangible assets have been allocated. Under the 
amendments, recoverable amount is required to be disclosed only when an impairment loss has been recognised or reversed.
•	 IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and measurement’ — amendments relating to novation of derivatives and continuation of hedge 
accounting.
•	 Annual improvements to IFRS 2010-2012 Cycle.
•	 Annual improvements to IFRS 2011-2013 Cycle.
•	 IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’.
New standards and interpretations not yet adopted
The following standards and interpretations have been published, endorsed by the EU, and are available for early adoption, but have not yet 
been applied by the Group in these financial statements. The Group does not believe the adoption of these standards or interpretations would 
have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
•	 IAS 1 ‘Presentation of financial statements’ — amendments relating to the Disclosure Initiative.
•	 IAS 16 ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’ — amendments relating to clarification of acceptable methods of 
depreciation and amortisation.
•	 IAS 27 ‘Separate financial statements’ — amendments relating to Equity method in separate financial statements.
•	 IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’ and IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’ — amendments relating to sale or 
contribution of assets between an investor and its associate or joint venture.
•	 IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ — amendments relating to acquisitions of interests in joint operations.
•	 Annual improvements to IFRS 2012–2014 Cycle.
The following standards and interpretations have been published but not yet endorsed by the EU. The Group does not believe the adoption of 
these standards or interpretations would have a material impact on the consolidated results or financial position of the Group.
•	 IAS 7 ‘Statement of cash flows’  — amendment relating to the Disclosure Initiative.
•	 IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ — amendment relating to recognition of deferred tax assets for unrealised losses.
•	 IFRS 9 ‘Financial instruments’ — finalised version, incorporating requirements for classification and measurement, impairment, general 
hedge accounting and derecognition.  
•	 IFRS 14 ‘Regulatory deferral accounts’ — new standard.
•	 IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ — new standard and amendments.
In addition to the above, IFRS 16 ‘Leases’, has been published but not yet endorsed by the EU. The Group is undertaking an impact assessment 
of the likely effect on the consolidated results and financial position of the Group, given that all operating leases with a contract life over 12 
months will be treated in much the same way as a finance lease on balance sheet.

Notes to the  
Financial Statements
1. Operating Segments
The Group has two reportable segments, Retail and Car Servicing, which are the Group’s strategic business units. Car Servicing became a 
reporting segment of the Group as a result of the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010. The strategic business units 
offer different products and services, and are managed separately because they require different operational, technological and marketing 
strategies. 
The operations of the Retail reporting segment comprise the retailing of automotive, leisure and cycling products through retail stores. The 
operations of the Car Servicing reporting segment comprise car servicing and repair performed from Autocentres. 
The Chief Operating Decision Maker is the Executive Directors. Internal management reports for each of the segments are reviewed by the 
Executive Directors on a monthly basis. Key measures used to evaluate performance are Revenue and Operating Profit. Management believe 
that these measures are the most relevant in evaluating the performance of the segment and for making resource allocation decisions. 
The following summary describes the operations in each of the Group’s reportable segments. Performance is measured based on segment 
operating profit, as included in the management reports that are reviewed by the Executive Directors. These internal reports are prepared in 
accordance with IFRS accounting policies consistent with these Group Financial Statements. 
All material operations of the reportable segments are carried out in the UK and all material non-current assets are located in the UK. The 
Group’s revenue is driven by the consolidation of individual small value transactions and as a result Group revenue is not reliant on a major 
customer or Group of customers. All revenue is from external customers.

a. In the current year organisational restructuring was undertaken across Autocentres and Retail, to better align resource to the requirements 
of the business. This resulted in a non-recurring redundancy expense of £1.7m.
b. A non-recurring expense of £7.5m was incurred in 2011. This expense related to the creation of a provision for the potential liabilities arising 
from lease guarantees provided by Halfords prior to July 1989. The guarantees were provided to landlords of properties leased by Payless 
DIY (now part of Focus DIY) when both Halfords and Payless DIY were under ownership of the Ward White Group. Focus DIY entered into 
administration in May 2011. In the prior year the continued settlement of the Group’s guarantor obligations resulted in a release of £0.2m of 
the original amounts provided, which resulted in no further outstanding provision in relation to this issue.
c. A charge was incurred in prior periods relating to stores where the present value of expected future cash flows was deemed to be 
insufficient to cover the lower of cost of exit or value in use. During the prior year a release of £0.2m occurred following the finalisation of an 
exit agreement for the Wembley store.
d. Impairment charge in respect of property, plant and equipment, in respect of the Stores Fit T o Shop initiative, where the carrying amount of 
these assets has been deemed to exceed the recoverable amount.
e. The tax credit of £0.3m represents a tax rate of 20% applied to non-recurring items. The prior period represents a tax charge at 21% applied 
to non-recurring items after adjusting for the non-deductibility of the asset impairment charge and settlements to release Halfords from its 
guarantor obligations under the leases.

The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 21% to 20% (effective 1 April 2015) and will be further reduced to 19% (effective from 1 April 2017) 
and 18% (effective from 1 April 2020) following changes substantively enacted on 26 October 2015.  This will reduce the Company’s future 
current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax asset at 1 April 2016 has been calculated based on the rate of 18% substantively enacted at 
the balance sheet date. 
In the Chancellor’s March 2016 budget he announced plans to further reduce the corporation tax rate to 17% from 1 April 2020, however this 
was yet to be substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.  
In this financial period, the UK corporation tax rate was 20% (2015: 21%).
The effective tax rate of 20.5% (2015: 21.5%) is higher than the UK corporation tax rate principally due to the non-deductibility of depreciation 
charged on capital expenditure.
The tax charge on profit for the financial period was £16.3m (2015: £18.0m), including a £0.3m credit (2015: £0.1m charge) in respect of tax on 
non-recurring items.
An income tax credit of £0.4m (2015: £1.2m charge) on other comprehensive income relates to the movement in fair valuing forward currency 
contracts outstanding at the year end. No other items within other comprehensive income have a tax impact.
In addition to the above a £0.7m (2015: £nil) current tax credit and a £1.4m deferred tax debit (2015: £0.3m credit) is recognised in reserves in 
relation to employee share options.
The Group engages openly and proactively with tax authorities both in the UK and internationally, where it trades and sources products, and 
is considered low risk by HM Revenue and Customs (“HMRC”). The Company is fully committed to complying with all of its tax payment and 
reporting obligations. 
In this period, the Group’s contribution to the UK Exchequer from both taxes paid and collected exceeded £150m (2015: £149.0m) with the 
main taxes including corporation tax £17.2m (2015: £16.1m), net VAT £50.2m (2015: £53.1m), employment taxes of £45.3m (2015: £42.8m) and 
business rates £36.9m (2015: £37.0m).

In addition, the Directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial period ended 1 April 2016 of 11.34p per share (2015: 11.00p 
per share), which will absorb an estimated £22.0m (2015: £21.4m) of shareholders’ funds. It will be paid on 28 August 2016 to shareholders who 
are on the register of members on 7 August 2016.
9. Earnings Per Share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary 
shares in issue during the period. The weighted average number of shares excludes shares held by an Employee Benefit Trust (see note 22) 
and has been adjusted for the issue/purchase of shares during the period. 
For diluted earnings per share, the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue is adjusted to assume conversion of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. These represent share options granted to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price 
of the Company’s ordinary shares during the 52 weeks to 1 April 2016. 
The Group has also chosen to present an alternative earnings per share measure, with profit adjusted for non-recurring items because it better 
reflects the Group’s underlying performance.

10. Acquisition of Subsidiary
In the prior year the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Boardman Bikes Limited and Boardman International Limited for cash 
consideration of £14.7m (excluding transaction costs). The two Boardman companies retail cycles and cycle accessories under the brand 
name ‘cBoardman’ nationally and internationally. The purpose of this acquisition was to benefit from operating synergies. This transaction has 
been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.
The acquisition had the following effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities:

The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Boardman business is attributable to a) operating synergies and increased control of operations, 
b) the value of immaterial other intangible assets and c) future income to be generated from new retail customer contracts and related 
relationships. None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.
The fair value adjustments relate to the best estimate of the contractual trade receivable cash flows not expected to be collected and aligning 
intangible asset policies with the Halfords Group. There have been no adjustments to goodwill during the current period.

Goodwill of £253.1m (2015: £253.1m) arose on the acquisition of Halfords Holdings Limited by the Company on 31 August 2002 and is 
allocated to the Retail segment. The goodwill relates to a portfolio of sites within the UK which management monitors on an overall basis as 
a group of cash-generating units being Retail. Goodwill of £69.7m arose on the acquisition of Nationwide Autocentres on 17 February 2010 
and is allocated to the Car Servicing segment. The goodwill relates to a portfolio of centres within the UK which management monitors on an 
overall basis as a group of cash-generating units being Car Servicing. Goodwill of £10.7m arose on the acquisition of Boardman Bikes Limited 
and Boardman International Limited on 4 June 2014 and is allocated to the Retail segment. The goodwill relates to the two Boardman entities 
which management monitors on an overall basis as a group of cash-generating units within Retail.
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of the Nationwide Autocentres is attributable to: a) future income to be generated from new retail, fleet 
customer contracts and related relationships; b) the workforce; c) the value of immaterial other intangible assets; and d) operating synergies. 
The goodwill on acquisition of the Boardman Bikes is attributable to: a) operating synergies and increased control of operations; b) the value of 
immaterial other intangible assets; and c) future income to be generated from new retail customer contracts and related relationships.
The recoverable amount of goodwill is determined based on “value-in-use” calculations for each of the three groups of cash-generating 
units, being Retail, Car Servicing and Boardman Bikes. This is the lowest level within the Group at which the goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes, which is not higher than the Group’s operating segments prior to aggregation. These calculations use cash flow 
projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering a three year period with growth no higher than past experience and 
after consideration of all available information, incorporating the strategies and risks of each segment. 
The value-in-use of the goodwill held at 1 April 2016 and 3 April 2015 is driven by, and is most sensitive to, the key assumptions underlying the 
Group cash-generating units’ recoverable amounts as follows:
Note
Retail Car Servicing
2016 2015 2016 2015
Discount rate 1 8.5% 7.3% 7.7% 8.3%
Growth rate 2 0.0% 0.0% 1.0% 1.0%
Notes:
1 Pre-tax discount rate applied to the cash flow projections.
2 Growth rate used to extrapolate cash flows beyond the three year budget period.
The Directors are confident that a reasonably possible change in the key assumptions, including a +/- 1.0% change in the discount rate, would 
not cause the carrying amounts to exceed the recoverable amounts.

The Group does not have any individually significant customers and so no significant concentration of credit risk.
Based on historic default rates and extensive analysis of the underlying customers’ credit ratings, the Group believes that no impairment 
allowance is necessary in respect of trade receivables not past due or past due by up to 30 days.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. Financial assets in the scope of 
IAS 39 include all trade receivables and £3.3m (2015: £2.9m) of other receivables.

that date. The facility carries an interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin which is variable based on the gearing measures as set out in the facility 
covenant certificate and which is currently 125 basis points. Both utilisation and non-utilisation fees are also applicable being charged when 
utilisation rises above a set percentage with non-utilisation based on a set percentage of the applicable margin. These charges are based on 
market rates as are the commitment fees as mentioned below.

20. Financial Instruments and Related Disclosures
Treasury Policy
The Group’s treasury department’s main responsibilities are to:
•	 Ensure adequate funding and liquidity for the Group;
•	 Manage the interest risk of the Group’s debt;
•	 Invest surplus cash; 
•	 Manage the clearing bank operations of the Group; and
•	 Manage the foreign exchange risk on its non-sterling cash flows.
Treasury activities are delegated by the Board to the Chief Financial Officer (“CFO”). The CFO controls policy and performance through the 
line management structure to the Group Treasurer and by reference to the Treasury Committee. The Treasury Committee meets regularly to 
monitor the performance of the Treasury function. 
Policies for managing financial risks are governed by Board approved policies and procedures, which are reviewed on an annual basis. 
The Group’s debt management policy is to provide an appropriate level of funding to finance the Business Plan over the medium term at 
a competitive cost and ensure flexibility to meet the changing needs of the Group. Details of the Group’s current borrowing facilities are 
contained in note 16.
The key risks that the Group faces from a treasury perspective are as follows:
Market Risk
The Group’s exposure to market risk predominantly relates to interest, currency and commodity risk. These are discussed further below. 
Commodity risk is due to the Group’s products being manufactured from metals and other raw materials, subject to price fluctuation. The 
Group mitigates this risk through negotiating fixed purchase costs or maintaining flexibility over the specification of finished products 
produced by its supply chain to meet fluctuations.
Interest Rate Risk
The Group’s policy aims to manage the interest cost of the Group within the constraints of the Business Plan and its financial covenants. The 
Group’s borrowings are currently subject to floating rate interest rates and the Group will continue to monitor movements in the swap market. 
If interest rates on floating rate borrowings (i.e. cash and cash equivalents and bank borrowings which attract interest at floating rates) were to 
change by + or – 1% the impact on the results in the Income Statement and equity would be a decrease/increase of £0.4m (2015: £0.5m).
Interest rate movements on deposits, obligations under finance leases, trade payables, trade receivables, and other financial instruments do 
not present a material exposure to the Group’s balance sheet.
Capital Risk Management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt. 
The Group manages capital by operating within debt ratios. These ratios are net debt to Earnings Before Interest, Tax, Depreciation and 
Amortisation (“EBITDA”) and fixed charge cover. Fixed charge cover is calculated as being EBITDA plus operating lease charges as a multiple of 
interest and operating lease charges. The Group also uses a ratio of lease adjusted net debt to EBITDA; this is calculated as being net debt and 
leases capitalised at eight times, as a multiple of EBITDA plus operating lease charges. 
Fair Value Disclosures
The fair values of each class of financial assets and liabilities is the carrying amount, based on the following assumptions:
Trade receivables, trade payables and finance lease obligations, 
short-term deposits and borrowings
The fair value approximates to the carrying amount because of the short 
maturity of these instruments, using an interest rate of 7.1% for long term 
finance lease obligations.
Long-term borrowings The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates to the carrying 
value reported in the balance sheet as the majority are floating rate where 
payments are reset to market rates at intervals of less than one year.
Forward currency contracts The fair value is determined using the market forward rates at the reporting 
date and the outright contract rate.

Fair Value Hierarchy
Financial instruments carried at fair value are required to be measured by reference to the following levels:
•	 Level 1: quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•	 Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
•	 Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
All financial instruments carried at fair value have been measured by a Level 2 valuation method.
The fair value of financial assets and liabilities are as follows:
2016
£m
2015
£m
Cash and cash equivalents 11.9 22.4
Loans and receivables 20.7 18.4
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging (assets) 4.2 3.9
T otal financial assets 36.8 44.7
Trade and other payables – held at amortised cost (154.2) (157.6)
Borrowings at amortised cost (27.0) (53.0)
Unsecured bank overdraft (22.7) (22.3)
Finance leases (11.7) (11.2)
Forward exchange contracts used for hedging (liabilities) — (0.1)
T otal financial liabilities (215.6) (244.2)
Trade and other payables within the scope of IAS 39 include all trade payables, all other payables and £44.4m (2015: £40.1m) of accruals and 
deferred income.
Credit Risk
The carrying amount of financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date 
was £36.8m (2015: £44.7m) as detailed in the table above.
Foreign Currency Risk
The Group has a significant transaction exposure with increasing direct-sourced purchases from its suppliers in the Far East, with most of the 
trade being in US Dollars. The Group’s policy is to manage the foreign exchange transaction exposures of the business to ensure the actual 
costs do not exceed the budget costs by more than 10% (excluding increases in the base cost of the product). 
The Group does not hedge either economic exposure or the translation exposure arising from the profits, assets and liabilities of non-sterling 
businesses whilst they remain immaterial.
During the 52 weeks to 1 April 2016, the foreign exchange management policy was to hedge via forward contract purchase between 75% and 
80% of the material foreign exchange transaction exposures on a rolling 24-month basis. Hedging is performed through the use of foreign 
currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The carrying amount of the Group’s foreign currency denominated monetary assets and monetary liabilities at the reporting date is as follows:

The table below shows the Group’s sensitivity to foreign exchange rates on its US dollar financial instruments, the major currency in which the 
Group’s derivatives are denominated.

(decrease) in 
equity
£m

10% appreciation of the US dollar 10.2 13.0
10% depreciation of the US dollar (8.4) (4.0)
A strengthening/weakening of Sterling, as indicated, against the USD at 1 April 2016 would have (decreased)/ increased equity and profit 
or loss by the amounts shown above. This analysis is based on foreign currency exchange rate variances that the Group considered to be 
reasonably possible at the end of the reporting period. The analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular interest rates, remain 
constant. 
The movements in equity relates to the fair value movements on the Group’s forward contracts that are used to hedge future stock purchases.
Pension Liability Risk
The Group has no association with any defined benefit pension scheme and therefore carries no deferred, current or future liabilities in respect 
of such a scheme. The Group operates a number of Group Personal Pension Plans for colleagues.
Liquidity Risk
The Group ensures that it has sufficient cash or loan facilities to meet all its commitments when they fall due by ensuring that there is sufficient 
cash or working capital facilities to meet the cash requirements of the Group for the current Business Plan. The minimum liquidity level is 
currently set at £30m, such that under Treasury policy the maximum drawings would be £140m of the £170m available facility, to include the 
Overdraft Facility of £20m.
The process to manage the risk is to ensure there are contracts in place for key suppliers, detailing the payment terms, and for providers of 
debt, the Group ensured that such counterparties used for credit transactions held at least an ‘A-’ credit rating at the time of the amend and 
extend agreement (November 2014). Ancillary business is currently being tendered with the five banks within the new banking group. Following 
the completion of the amend and extend agreement, at the year end the banks within this new group maintained a credit rating of A- or above, 
in line with Treasury policy. The counterparty credit risk is reviewed in the Treasury report, which is forwarded to the Treasury Committee and 
the Treasurer reviews credit exposure on a daily basis.
The risk is measured through review of forecast liquidity each month by the Treasurer to determine whether there are sufficient credit facilities 
to meet forecast requirements, and through monitoring covenants on a regular basis to ensure there are no significant breaches, which would 
lead to an “Event of Default”. Calculations are submitted biannually to the Group banking agent. There have been no breaches of covenants 
during the reported periods.
The contractual maturities of finance leases are disclosed in note 12. All trade and other payables are due within one year.

The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at 
meetings of the Company. All shares rank equally with regard to the Company’s residual assets.
During the current period the Company’s share capital increased by 53,410 shares (2015: no movement) following the issue of shares in 
relation to the exercise of options under the Company’s Sharesave Scheme. There has been no significant impact on share premium as a result 
of the transaction, which has remained at £151.0m (2015: £151.0m).
In total the Company received proceeds of £2.7m (2015: £0.7m) from the exercise of share options.
Investment in Own Shares
At 1 April 2016 the Company held in Trust 2,984,289 (2015: 4,745,633) of its own shares with a nominal value of £29,843 (2015: £47,456). The 
Trust has waived any entitlement to the receipt of dividends in respect of its holding of the Company’s ordinary shares. The market value of 
these shares at 1 April 2016 was £11.7m (2015: £21.7m). In the current period nil shares (2015: nil) were repurchased and transferred into the 
Trust, with 1,761,344 (2015: 271,569) reissued on exercise of share options.
Other Reserves
Capital Redemption Reserve
The capital redemption reserve has arisen following the purchase by the Company of its own shares and comprises the amount by which the 
distributable profits were reduced on these transactions in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Hedging Reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to 
hedged transactions that have not yet occurred. 
22. Share Based Payments
The Group has three share award plans, all of which are equity-settled schemes. The Group Income Statement charge recognised in respect of 
share based payments for the current period is £3.0m (2015: £1.4m).
1. Halfords Company Share Option Scheme (CSOS)
The CSOS was introduced in June 2004 and the Company has made annual grants since. Options are granted with a fixed exercise price equal 
to the market price of the shares under option at the date of grant. The contractual life of an option is 10 years.
Options granted before August 2013 will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the achievement of a 
three year performance condition. For grants up to 150% of basic salary the options can only be exercised if the increase in earnings per share 
(“EPS”) over the period is not less than the increase in the Retail Price Index (“RPI”) plus 3.5% per year. In the case of grants in excess of 150% 
of basic salary, the excess can only be exercised in full if the increase is not less than RPI plus 10% per year. Exercise of an option is subject to 
continued employment. 
Changes to the performance criteria of the CSOS scheme in relation to the awards granted from August 2013 onwards were made by the 
Remuneration Committee. These changes were made in order to create better alignment with the Group’s three year strategic priorities 
following the Moving Up a Gear programme. The awards are dependent on EBITDA performance and are only exercisable if EBITDA growth 
exceeds a compound annual growth rate of 2.5% over the three year performance period, or a total growth rate of 8.4%. Exercise of an option 
is subject to continued employment.

22. Share Based Payments continued
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies since the IPO in June 2004. The expected life is the 
average expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds.
Options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing models. No performance conditions were included in the fair value calculations.
2. Halfords Sharesave Scheme
The SAYE is open to all employees with eligible employment service. Options may be exercised under the scheme if the option holder 
completes his saving contract for a period of three years and then not more than six months thereafter. Special provisions allow early exercise 
in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the company or business which employs the option holder is 
transferred out of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding up of the Company. 
Options were valued using the Black–Scholes option-pricing models.
3. Performance Share Plan
The introduction of a Performance Share Plan (“PSP”) was approved at the Annual General Meeting in August 2005 awarding the Executive 
Directors and certain senior management conditional rights to receive shares. Annual schemes have been approved for each year from 2005.
The extent to which such rights vest will depend upon the Company’s performance over the three year period following the award date. The 
vesting of 50% of the awards will be determined by the Company’s relative total shareholder return (“TSR”) performance and the vesting of the 
other 50% by the Company’s absolute EPS performance against RPI. The Company’s TSR performance will be measured against the FTSE 350 
general retailers as a comparator group. No retesting will be permitted. 
The TSR element of the options granted under the schemes has been valued using a model developed by Deloitte. The Deloitte model uses 
the Group’s share price volatility, the correlation between comparator companies and the vesting schedule attaching to the PSP tranche rather 
than generating a large number of simulations of share price and TSR performance to determine the fair value of the award using a Monte Carlo 
model. 
For 2009 awards onwards, the Committee has recommended the reinvestment of dividends earned on award shares, such shares to invest 
in proportion to the vesting of the original award shares. This is in line with best practice as contained in the ABI guidelines on executive 
remuneration. Following this recommendation the shares awarded in 2011, 2012 and 2013 under the Performance Share Plan earned final 
dividends of 9.1p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of £4.82 per share. Shares awarded in 2012, 2013 and 2014 under the PSP 
earned interim dividends of 5.5p per share and were reinvested in shares at a cost of £4.59 per share.
Changes to the performance criteria of the PSP in relation to the awards granted during the prior year were made by the Remuneration 
Committee. These changes were made in order to create better alignment with the Company’s three year strategic priorities following the 
Getting Into Gear programme. The awards are weighted 25% towards Group revenue growth targets and 75% towards Group EBITDA growth 
targets. The core award remains at 150% of base salary with a multiplier being introduced of 1.5x the core award if exceptional levels of 
performance are achieved. The shares vesting as part of this multiplier calculation will attract a retention period of two years. In order to focus 
management the awards will be underpinned by a minimum Group EBITDA, and a net debt to EBITDA ratio no greater than 1.5x throughout the 
three year performance period. 
The following tables reconcile the number of share options outstanding and the weighted average exercise price (WAEP) for all share award 
plans except for the Co-Investment Plan, details of which are covered above.

The Group leases a number of stores and warehouses under operating leases of varying length for which incentives/premiums are received/
paid under the relevant lease agreements. Land and buildings have been considered separately for lease classification. The operating lease 
commitments are shown before total future minimum receipts of sublet income, which totalled £20.0m (2015: £23.0m).
24. Pensions
Employees are offered membership of the Halfords Pension, which is a contract based plan, where each member has their own individual 
pension policy, which they monitor independently. The costs of contributions to the scheme are charged to the income statement in the period 
that they arise. The contributions to the scheme for the period amounted to £5.7m (2015: £5.1m).
In accordance with Government initiatives Halfords operates an automatic enrolment process with regards to its pension arrangements. 
Employees who are aged between 22 and state pension age, earn more than £10,000 a year, and work in the UK are automatically enrolled into 
the Group pension arrangement. Employees retain the right to withdraw from this pension arrangement, however election of this choice must 
be made.
25. Contingent Liabilities 
The Group’s banking arrangements include the facility for the bank to provide a number of guarantees in respect of liabilities owed by the 
Group during the course of its trading. In the event of any amount being immediately payable under the guarantee, the bank has the right to 
recover the sum in full from the Group. The total amount of guarantees in place at 1 April 2016 amounted to £3.9m (2015: £3.9m).
The Group’s banking arrangements are subject to a netting facility whereby credit balances may be offset against the indebtedness of other 
Group companies.

The Group has no off balance sheet arrangements to disclose as required by S410A of the Companies Act 2006.
28. Post Balance Sheet Events 
On 24 May 2016, after the year end, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Tredz Limited and Wheelies Direct Limited, for a 
total capped consideration of £31.6m which includes £12.5m contingent consideration.  Tredz Limited is an online and shop-based cycling 
retailer and Wheelies Direct Limited is a cycling insurance replacement company.
The contingent consideration payable for the acquisition is dependent on an EBITDA multiple, calculated over a 12 month period ending 28 
February 2017.
Given the timing of the acquisition we are not able to disclose information regarding the assets and liabilities acquired, the fair values of these 
and any associated goodwill as these are subject to fair value assessments.

Accounting 
Policies
Accounting Convention
The accounts of the Company are prepared for the period up to the Friday closest to 31 March each year. Consequently, the financial 
statements for the current period cover the 52 weeks to 1 April 2016, whilst the comparative period covered the 53 weeks to 3 April 2015. The 
accounts are prepared under the historical cost convention, except where Financial Reporting Standards requires an alternative treatment in 
accordance with FRS 101 and specifically in accordance with the accounting policies set out below. The principal variation to the historical 
cost convention relates to share based payments. 
Basis of Preparation
The Company meets the definition of a qualifying entity under the Financial Reporting Standard 100 (“FRS 100”).  Accordingly, in the year 
ended 1 April 2016, the Company has adopted FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework” and has ceased to apply all UK Accounting 
Standards issued prior to FRS 100.  Therefore the recognition and measurement requirements of EU-adopted IFRS have been applied, with 
amendments where necessary in order to comply with the Companies Act 2006.
As permitted by FRS 101, the Company has taken advantage of the disclosure exemptions available under that standard in relation to share 
based payments, standards not yet effective, impairment of assets and related party transactions.  Where required, equivalent disclosures 
have been given in the Group financial statements.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, no profit or loss account or cash flow statement is presented for this Company.  The 
profit for the year is disclosed in note 1 to the financial statements.
Employee Benefit Trusts (‘EBT s’) are consolidated on the basis that the parent has control, thus the assets and liabilities of the EBT are included 
on the Company balance sheet and shares held by the EBT in the Company are presented as a deduction from equity.
First Time Adoption of FRS 101
The Company’s date of transition to FRS 101 is 29 March 2014 and all comparative information in the financial statements has been restated 
to reflect the Company’s adoption of FRS 101, except where otherwise required or permitted by paragraphs 6 to 33 of International Financial 
Reporting Standard 1 - “First Time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards” (IFRS 1).  Details of this transition are given in note 
13.
The Group adopted IFRS for the first time in its consolidated financial statements in the year ended 31 March 2006.  In accordance with IFRS 1, 
the Company has measured its assets and liabilities at the carrying amounts that would be included in the consolidated financial statements of 
the Group.
Share Based Payments
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share based compensation plans that are awarded to employees of the Company’s 
subsidiary undertakings.
In accordance with FRS 101 ‘Group and treasury share transactions’ the fair value of the employee services received under such schemes is 
recognised as an expense in the subsidiary undertaking’s financial statements, which benefit from the employee services. The Company has 
recognised the fair value of the share based payments as an increase to equity with a corresponding adjustment to investments.
Fair values are determined using appropriate option pricing models. The total fair value recognised is adjusted to reflect the number of awards 
for which the related service and non-market vesting conditions are expected to be met, such that the amount ultimately recognised as an 
expense is based on the number of awards that do meet the related service and non-market performance conditions at the vesting date.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of 
the revision of original estimates, if any, is recognised as an adjustment to equity, with a corresponding adjustment to investments, over the 
remaining vesting period. 
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at the original cost of the investments. Provision is made against cost where, in the opinion 
of the Directors, the value of the investments has been impaired.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends are approved by shareholders. 
Interim equity dividends are recognised in the period they are paid.

During the current period the Company’s share capital increased by 53,410 shares (2015: no movement) following the issue of shares in 
relation to the exercise of options under the Company’s Sharesave Scheme. There has been no significant impact on share premium as a result 
of the transaction, which has remained at £151.0m (2015: £151.0m).
In total the Company received proceeds of £2.7m (2015: £0.7m) from the exercise of share options.
Potential Issue of Ordinary Shares
The Company has three employee share option schemes, which were set up following the Company’s flotation. Further information regarding 
these schemes can be found in note 22 of the Group’s financial statements.
Investment in Own Shares
At 1 April 2016 the Company held in Trust 2,984,289 (2015: 4,745,633) of its own shares with a nominal value of £29,843 (2015: £47,456). The 
Trust has waived any entitlement to the receipt of dividends in respect of its holding of the Company’s ordinary shares. The market value of 
these shares at 1 April 2016 was £11.7m (2015: £21.7m). In the current period nil shares (2015: nil) were repurchased and transferred into the 
Trust, with 1,761,344 (2015: 271,569) reissued on exercise of share options.
9.  Reserves
The Company settled dividends of £32.4m (2015: £28.4m) in the period, as detailed in note 8 of the Group’s financial statements. 
Included in the profit and loss account is £nil of reserves that are not distributable (2015: £166.0m).
During the prior year, the Company received a dividend-in-specie, being a receivable due from another Group company, which was not 
expected to be settled in the near future.  As a result the value of the Company’s investment in the IreCo 1 company (wound up during the prior 
year) fell below the amount at which it was stated in the Company’s accounting records.  Schedule 1 to the Companies Act 2006, The Large 
and Medium sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (SI 2008 No 410) required that the investment be written 
down accordingly and that the amount be charged as a loss in the Company’s profit and loss account.  However, the Directors considered that, 
as there has been no overall loss to the Company, it would fail to give a true and fair view to charge that diminution to the Company’s profit and 
loss account and the cost of the investment of £280.3m was reallocated to the carrying amount of the holding Company’s receivable.  Given 
that the receivable had a fair value of £328.3m, the Company recognised an unrealised gain of £48.0m through the Statement of Recognised 
Gains and Losses (“STRGL”).  The effect of this departure was to increase the holding Company’s total recognised gains for the financial year 
and the carrying amount of the receivable in the holding Company’s balance sheet by £280.3m.  
In the current year, the receivable of £280.3m recognised in the Company balance sheet as a result of the prior year dividend-in-specie was 
settled in return for another receivable with a Group company.  This resulted in the realisation of the £166.0m non-distributable reserves 
disclosed in the prior year accounts.
10.  Related Party Disclosures
Under FRS 101 “Related party disclosures” the Company is exempt from disclosing related party transactions with entities over which it wholly 
owns.

11.  Contingent Liabilities
The Group’s banking arrangements include the facility for the bank to provide a number of guarantees in respect of liabilities owed by the 
Group during the course of its trading.  In the event of any amount being immediately payable under the guarantee, the bank has the right to 
recover the sum in full from the Group.  The total amount of guarantees in place at 1 April 2016 amounted to £3.9m (2015: £3.9m).  
The Company’s banking arrangements are subject to a netting facility whereby credit balances may be offset against the indebtedness of 
other Group companies.
12.  Off Balance Sheet Arrangements
The Company has no off balance sheet arrangements to disclose as required by S410A of the Companies Act 2006.  
13. Transition to FRS 101 
This is the first year that the Company has presented its financial statements under FRS 101 (Financial Reporting Standard 101) issued by the 
Financial Reporting Council. The last financial statements under a previous GAAP (UK GAAP) were for the year ended 3 April 2015 and the date 
of transition to FRS 101 was therefore 29 March 2014.

Transitional adjustments
Under FRS 101, the Company applies the recognition and measurement requirements of EU-adopted IFRS, with the exception of where the 
Companies Act 2006 has different requirements.  Adoption of FRS 101 had no impact on the cash flows of the Company.
1. Investments
Halfords Group plc issued loans to Halfords Holdings (2006) Limited and Halfords Finance Limited which attracted 0% interest. The interest 
free element means that these loans are treated as a capital contribution and so the difference between the loan principal and a discounted 
market rate of interest (£0.9m) is capitalised as an investment in the entity. An increase in retained earnings has also been recognised.   
This adjustment reduced the previously reported Company profit by £0.5m in 2015 as the fair value adjustment unwound and was charged  
to the profit and loss account as an interest charge.
2. Intercompany balances
The intercompany debtor and creditor balances have been reassessed and deemed to be repayable on demand, therefore aged as due within 
12 months.  This adjustment had no impact on the profit and loss account as previously reported.

Extracting collagen
Collagen used for casing and gel  
is taken from the hides of carefully 
selected animals – officially approved 
for human consumption.
WE AIM TO MANUFACTURE  
BETTER CASING FOR  
EVERY SAUSAGE
Devro at a glance
Our mission: Operating safely, to provide  
the world’s food manufacturers with a safe and  
secure supply of consistently better collagen  
products, helping them optimise efficiency  
and enhancing the value of their offering.
Our business process
Manufacture
Devro is a world leader in the 
manufacturing technology of this 
highly sophisticated process. Our 
casings are consistent, reliable and 
versatile to suit the needs of both 
sausage manufacturers and 
consumer preferences.
Applied technology
The production of collagen casing  
is a complex technological process. 
Devro combines expertise and 
innovation to produce casings that 
allow our customers to make  
better sausage.
Why our business exists
Devro’s collagen casing is used to 
manufacture all varieties of sausage. 
Historically, animal intestines were used 
as casing for sausage, but over the past 
50 years the use of collagen casing has 
significantly increased, as it enables 
food manufacturers to automate 
production and reduce costs. It is better 
suited to contemporary food hygiene 
and traceability requirements, and 
technical specifications can be 
determined in advance.  
What our customers do
Devro’s customers manufacture  
branded and own-label sausage products 
worldwide, reaching consumers through 
retail and food service outlets.
How we create value
Devro creates value by converting a  
basic raw material, collagen, from the  
inner layer of cattle and sow hides, into  
a homogeneous gel and extruding it to 
tightly controlled dimensions, before being 
compressed and packed for supply to 
customers. Devro’s manufacturing 
processes are unique and have evolved 
over many years of technical development. 
Who we sell to
Devro’s revenue comes primarily from 
the sale of collagen products directly  
to food manufacturers and, in some 
markets, local distributors. Devro sells  
to over 1,500 customers in more than 
100 countries, with a product range in 
excess of 500 individual items, covering 
eight principal types of application. 
Approximately one-third of Devro’s 
sales are in emerging markets and 
two-thirds are in developed markets. 
Over 100 Devro employees work in 
customer-facing operations as sales  
and technical advisers.
Our business model 3
Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report Strategic Report 
Sales, marketing  
& distribution
Devro products are sold across all 
continents in over 100 countries. We 
sell directly to food manufacturers 
and via agents and distributors.
Reinvesting in  
our business
Devro has a successful track record  
of applied research and development 
and focused capital investment.
Customer products  
to consumers
Devro’s innovation and casing 
performance allow our customers to 
produce differentiated products for the 
consumer. Our casings consistently 
score highly for appearance, colour, bite 
and overall acceptance in independent 
research and consumer testing.
The market we are in
Devro is one of five significant global 
producers of collagen casing in the 
world market, with a number of smaller 
local or regional competitors. Additional 
value is created for the customer by 
collaborating with specialist food 
machinery manufacturers and  
suppliers of food ingredients to  
optimise product performance.
What makes us different
Devro differentiates itself from 
competitors by developing innovative 
new products, by working closely  
with customers to enhance their 
manufacturing efficiencies and by 
providing high-quality technical  
support to customers.
Why our customers choose Devro
To satisfy our customers’ demands,  
we use our knowledge of how to 
manipulate the complex chemistry of 
collagen to balance the requirements  
of food producers for strength and size 
stability with consumer preferences  
for tenderness and bite.

A GLOBAL FOOTPRINT  
IN CHANGING TIMES
Understanding our markets
From our creation over 50 years ago, Devro  
has evolved into an established leading supplier  
of edible collagen casing throughout the world.
INTRODUCTION
There have been many improvements  
in edible collagen casing over the past 
50 years; some as a result of technical 
developments and others as a result of 
improved plant manufacturing systems. 
The continued significant investment 
over many years by Devro has enabled 
the provision of a unique, modern, safe 
and secure edible collagen casing that 
runs more efficiently on sausage 
production lines at much higher speeds 
and produces better sausage products 
that are widely accepted by consumers. 
Today, Devro products are sold by  
our dedicated commercial teams, in 
association with our experienced 
distributor network, to over 100 
individual markets and are used in the 
production of a huge variety of regional 
and national sausage types.
Maintaining a detailed understanding  
of our markets and our customers has 
been, and continues to be, a key aspect 
of our business philosophy. 
GROWTH
Lower cost opportunities for sausage 
producers and consumer acceptance 
continue to drive the demand for edible 
collagen casings.
Over the past ten years there has  
been a steady increase in the volume  
of edible collagen casing used in 
sausage production.
TRENDS
There are numerous social and 
demographic factors that are 
contributing to the growth in the 
consumption of sausage, and 
consequently an increased growth in the 
use of edible collagen casings, across 
both developed and emerging markets.
The growth in global population 
continues to be a key driver, particularly 
in relation to the rapid increase in the 
rate of urbanisation. Consumers are 
being exposed to a much wider choice 
and better availability of sausage within 
the urban environment, compared to 
those who are living in rural areas.
The global population living in an urban 
environment has surpassed that of rural 
and is forecast to continue to rise 
steeply. This urbanisation trend 
contributes significantly towards 
improved living standards and rising 
incomes which in turn influence the 
affordability of sausage and processed 
meat products.
The improvement in the availability of 
sausage and processed meat products 
gives rise then to increased average 
meat consumption across both 
developed and emerging markets.

Americas
The Americas remains a strong market 
for edible collagen casing, particularly  
in the small calibre snack stick sector  
in North America. Rapid growth in 
demand in a number of Latin American 
countries continues, driven by 
increasing meat consumption and 
improving economic conditions. 
Europe, Middle East & Africa (EMEA)
EMEA continues to be a major market 
for the use of edible collagen casing  
and remains a market where there is 
excellent potential for future growth, 
including further conversion of gut 
(animal intestines) to edible collagen 
casing. Many markets within Europe, 
including Germany, are highly 
developed, sophisticated and mature 
markets for sausage manufacture. 
However, traditional techniques are  
still widely employed, and many of the 
premium products remain in gut.  
As Devro’s new generation of edible 
collagen products are introduced, more 
and more producers and retailers are 
looking closely at the cost savings that 
can be made by converting to edible 
collagen casing.
Asia-Pacific
In Asia and the Pacific regions, growth 
in the use of edible collagen casing 
continues strongly. Asia-Pacific has  
the largest single edible collagen casing 
market, that being China. Use of the 
product has grown considerably, 
primarily due to the increase in 
urbanisation and the growing popularity 
of Western-style sausage. The need for 
efficient manufacturing of safe and 
secure quality sausage has driven 
producers to explore more urgently  
the benefits of edible collagen casing.

The collagen casing market in  
China now accounts for around  
40% of the total global demand.
Devro is investing £60 million to 
establish a manufacturing facility 
in the city of Nantong, primarily 
to supply the domestic Chinese 
market which has seen significant 
investment in new sausage 
manufacturing capacity.
With the construction phase now 
complete, the local team will be 
supported by colleagues from 
Devro’s operations in Scotland 
to carry out commissioning and 
commence commercial production 
during the second half of 2016.
Devro’s strong product portfolio 
and international reputation 
position it well to compete in  
this key strategic market over  
the long-term.

As the new facility takes shape, the 
company has been recruiting a new 
workforce to join the Devro family.  
They will support the commissioning 
and ongoing operation of the new 
facility in Nantong, China.
Jason Lu shares his vision for Devro’s new facility 
in China. He has worked for the company for two 
years and played his part as Utility and 
Environmental Manager as the newest facility in 
the group has gone from blueprints in the office  
to a fully fitted out factory now entering the 
commissioning phase.
 “I am excited to have the stage to demonstrate  
my skills and knowledge to add value to the new 
Devro operation in Nantong. The company is 
bringing the best technology for manufacturing 
collagen casing to China and we look forward to 
making high quality products for the domestic and 
wider Asian market.
 “I have learned so much from working with 
colleagues from the other Devro locations and 
helping to bring the vision to a reality. The project 
team combines many local people who are new  
to the industry but keen to learn and develop,  
and experienced colleagues, mainly from Scotland, 
with huge knowledge that they are now passing 
on to us. We have a shared passion and ambition 
to produce the best products and help Devro  
take advantage of the opportunities in China  
and beyond.”

The capital investment of 
£50 million in a new manufacturing 
facility in Sandy Run, South Carolina, 
USA forms a key part of a three-year 
programme to transform our global 
manufacturing footprint.
The new state of the art facility sits 
adjacent to the existing 37-year-old 
plant which uses markedly different 
technology to our other facilities 
and is less efficient.
Installing the latest high-speed 
technology, already used in 
facilities in Europe, will allow us to 
significantly improve the efficiencies 
and yields and deliver consistent, 
high quality products to a broad 
customer base across North and 
Latin America. 
We expect the transition to the new 
facility to deliver cost savings of 
c.£8 million per annum, which will 
start to come through during 2016. 
Over the coming years, Devro plans 
to increase its market share in 
North and Latin America and lead 
the market in all three key product 
categories: snack sticks, fresh and 
cooked sausage. This will require 
increased focus and expenditure 
on new product development and 
close working relationships with 
existing and new customers.

With over 30 years’ experience working 
for Devro, firstly in Scotland and then 
relocating to the US, Robert Ralston 
was perfectly placed to help deliver a 
new manufacturing facility in the Devro 
Inc. business.
Robert explains:
 “I joined Devro back home in Scotland in 1983  
as a maintenance apprentice in my teens and like 
to think I have faced my fair share of challenges 
over the last 30 years. Until now, none of those 
challenges has been quite as big as the new 
factory we have been building in Sandy Run over 
the past 18 months or so.
 “The collagen casings industry provides a dynamic 
and challenging marketplace that Devro operates 
in. There is always something new to learn and 
something to improve, which in effect means 
Devro can provide its entire workforce with a great 
environment to work in. 
 “The investment by Devro in the new state of the 
art manufacturing hall in Sandy Run shows the 
clear commitment by Devro to manufacturing 
casings in North America and, as importantly in 
our community here in South Carolina. 
 “The construction, installation and commissioning  
of the new facility has been a unique and great 
experience. Working on a project from breaking 
ground through to seeing finished product leaving 
the completed facility for delivery to our customers 
is simply amazing and hugely rewarding. 
 
 “It was something I only dreamed that I could be 
part of sometime in my life, but now it is a reality.  
The best part of this project for me was the 
privilege of working with an incredible design and 
construction team, both locally and globally, a real 
team effort.”

Our strategy in action
We’re focused on  
the most advanced  
product and process  
development
In October 2015 we welcomed 
a new facility into the Devro 
family following the acquisition 
of PV Industries B.V. Based in the 
Netherlands and employing a 
team of 21, Devro has acquired a 
leading manufacturer of collagen 
gel products to the global meat 
processing industry.
The business will now be known 
as Devro B.V. and boasts a brand 
new manufacturing hall producing 
co-extrusion gel for a range of 
customers around the world. 
This acquisition supports Devro’s 
strategy by growing sales of 
collagen products through product 
differentiation and enhancing value 
for customers.
Co-extrusion using collagen has 
been around for a considerable 
time, but in the last few years, 
significant growth opportunities 
have started to appear. With 
innovation in gels and machinery,  
we expect this trend to continue.
Devro B.V. will strengthen the 
company’s presence in Europe, 
providing product knowledge  
and technical expertise in a 
specialist sector.

In conversation with Paul Kempers,
Plant Manager, Devro B.V.
The integration of Devro B.V., formerly 
known as PV Industries B.V. (“PVI”)  
into the Devro group has brought 
a wealth of experience in the co-
extrusion gel sector.
An acquisition can be an unsettling time for all the 
staff involved, but plant manager Paul Kempers 
and his team have embraced this period of change 
which coincided with the move to a brand new 
manufacturing facility in Gendt, Netherlands.
Paul explains:
 “I have been part of the PVI family for over 17 years 
and now we have all been welcomed into the 
Devro family which presents many exciting 
opportunities. The companies share many of the 
same values, most importantly around health and 
safety and of course the quality of our products. 
This has helped to ensure a smooth transition from 
PVI to Devro B.V.
 “Devro has shown a lot of respect for what PVI has 
built over the years. We are excited to be part of 
the group and believe together we have a great 
future. The global activities of Devro and 
knowledge of PVI, combined with our new facility, 
provide exciting new opportunities for growth  
and development.”
ION 14
Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Strategic Report 
We entered 2015 with three main areas 
of focus for the executive team: to 
develop our market position; to 
complete the restructuring of our 
operations in Scotland and Australia; 
and to maintain momentum on the 
implementation of our major investment 
projects in the USA and China.
In tough market conditions, overall 
volumes of casings sold increased, most 
notably in key markets such as Japan, 
North America and South East Asia, and 
many key accounts have been retained 
elsewhere in the face of strong 
competing offers. Sales of co-extrusion 
gel in North America continued to grow 
well and the acquisition of PV Industries 
has now firmly established Devro as the 
market leader for gel in Europe as well.
As part of our restructuring we took  
out capacity of older, less efficient 
technology at one of our factories in 
Scotland, which was an important step 
in aligning our product portfolio with 
market opportunities. In Australia we 
initiated the outsourcing of hide 
preparation operations. There was some 
disruption as we worked through the 
planned actions, but I am pleased to 
report that we have delivered 
annualised cost savings of £5.8 million, 
slightly ahead of the targeted amount.
In the USA and China we are 
undertaking two strategic investment 
projects to build new plants in these 
locations. It has been challenging to 
support two such significant projects  
in parallel, but we have made good 
progress this year and the projects 
remain on track for completion as 
planned in 2016.
FINANCIAL HIGHLIGHTS
Operating profit before exceptional 
items was £33.3 million (2014: £30.3 
million), representing 10% growth over 
2014, primarily relating to the delivery  
of cost savings from the restructuring 
actions. Profits would have increased 
more had it not been for adverse foreign 
exchange movements of £2.1 million 
(2014: adverse of £4.3 million). Whilst I 
am pleased with the growth in profits, 
there is clearly more to do on sales and 
this will be an area of focus for 2016.
A more complete explanation of the 
financial performance for the year, 
including a breakdown of the £14.1 million 
of exceptional items, is set out in the 
Financial Review on pages 18 to 21.

STRATEGIC INVESTMENTS
The construction and launch of the  
new plants in the USA and China are 
central to the transformation of the 
manufacturing footprint for the group. 
The new factory in the USA will improve 
manufacturing efficiency by establishing 
an advanced technology production 
facility. This will enable us to largely 
decommission the existing plant, which 
has continued to underperform in 2015 
as it reaches the end of its useful 
economic life. 
As previously indicated we expect  
an additional contribution to annual 
operating profit of £8 million from this 
USA investment, with the benefits 
starting mid-2016. A key component  
of this improvement will be the 
decommissioning of the old production 
lines, and the realisation of the 
associated cost savings. 
In China the new plant will establish a 
manufacturing presence in the world’s 
largest collagen casing market, adding 
capacity to support future sales growth. 
The new factory continues to progress 
well, with construction now complete 
and commissioning of the newly-
installed equipment due to commence 
in the first half of 2016. Demand for 
premium products has continued to 
increase in China during 2015, despite 
the overall market in China declining, 
reflecting the ongoing development  
and segmentation of the market. 
BOARD
As announced last year, Simon Webb, 
Group Finance Director, will retire in 
March 2016. The Board sincerely thanks 
Simon for his significant contribution to 
the business over the past five years. 
Rutger Helbing will join us as Group 
Finance Director on 4 April 2016.
EMPLOYEES
Devro’s success is built upon the 
commitment of our employees. 
Supporting two major projects in 
parallel has tested this commitment and 
has significantly stretched our global 
resources. I have been impressed by the 
way our employees have stepped up 
and delivered at this critical time. On 
behalf of the whole Board, I would like 
to thank all of our employees for their 
contribution across our business. 
2016 will be another important year  
as we complete the fundamental 
transformation of the manufacturing 
footprint of our business. To be 
successful we will again need to call 
upon the dedication and experience of 
our employees, but I am confident that 
the team will rise to the challenge.
I would like to take this opportunity  
to acknowledge the large number of 
employees leaving the business as part 
of the transition to more efficient 
manufacturing technology. I am very 
grateful for the professionalism they 
have demonstrated throughout the 
transformation and wish them well for 
the future.
DIVIDEND
The Board is proposing to maintain  
the final dividend at 6.1p per share 
(2014: 6.1p) bringing the total for the

RETURN ON INVESTMENTS
With our transformation programme 
nearing completion we must now 
demonstrate a return on the £110 million 
in capital investments we have made 
over the past three years. 2016 will be 
the year in which we start to see this 
return reflected in our profits with the 
new plant in the USA completing in the 
first half. Additional profit growth will 
follow in 2017 from the new plant in 
China, enabling us to increase capacity 
and support further revenue growth.
2016 is an important year for Devro 
given the complexities of starting up 
two new factories, but with the detailed 
planning in place we are on course to 
develop into the most advanced 
collagen casings company in the world. 
Devro will then be well placed to benefit 
from a dynamic and expanding global 
market, to create long-term value for 
our shareholders.

Chief Executive’s Review
SUMMARY
2015 was a year of notable progress for 
Devro, with sales volumes growing in a 
number of key markets, the completion 
of two restructuring programmes 
resulting in substantial cost reductions, 
significant progress in our investment 
projects in the USA and China and the 
acquisition of a specialist European 
collagen gel business. 
Our three-year transformation 
programme, to ensure that the business 
has high-tech manufacturing assets 
capable of supplying future demand, 
progressed well and will complete in 2016. 
MARKETS OVERVIEW
Devro supplies collagen casings, films 
and gel to a worldwide market that has 
long-term volume growth averaging 
3-4% per year. Growth comes from the 
global trend towards urban living and 
rising levels of disposable income, with 
related increases in protein consumption, 
as well as the expansion of high-tech 
food manufacturing processes, which 
tend to use collagen casings.
In 2015, many regions reported volume 
growth, with an estimated global 
increase of 3% excluding China. Growth 
areas include meat-based snacks in the 
USA, snacks and confectionery in Japan 
and rising consumption in several South 
East Asian markets. After several years 
of remarkable growth, the total market 
in China contracted in 2015 due to a 
combination of economic and industry 
factors; however the premium casings 
segment continued to grow. Production 
of meat products in Russia declined in 
the earlier part of the year, as a result of 
economic, political and currency issues.
STRATEGY
Devro’s three-part strategy focuses  
on revenue growth, manufacturing 
efficiency and product differentiation. 
The business made good progress in all 
three elements during 2015.
Revenue growth
Devro’s sales volumes grew 1% in 2015. 
Strong increases were reported for the 
first half of the year, which were partially 
offset in the second half by declines  
in some markets, in part related to  
local economic factors but also short-
term capacity constraints linked to  
the transformation of our  
manufacturing footprint. 17
Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial Statements Shareholder Information Directors’ Report Strategic Report 
Sales volume growth remained strong  
in Japan (7%), particularly in the snack 
and confectionery sector. Volumes 
across South East Asia increased 13%  
as capacity from the recently-expanded 
Czech and Australian plants enabled 
higher levels of supply. Latin America 
sales volumes, excluding Brazil, 
increased 5% having benefited from the 
launch of recently developed products.
Growth continued in the major markets 
of Continental EU and North America, 
with both markets increasing sales 
volumes by 3%. Volumes were broadly 
maintained in the mature and 
established markets of the UK and 
Australia, as well as in China where 
Devro sales were moderately 
constrained in the short-term by 
available capacity.
Russia and surrounding markets  
were affected by the geopolitical and 
economic factors, leading to a 16% sales 
volume decrease for Devro. Sales to 
Brazil, where prices are generally lower, 
were constrained by supply.
Demand for collagen gel in the 
manufacturing of large volume brands 
in the USA and Europe continues to 
grow as major food manufacturers  
make significant capital investments  
in co-extrusion technology to reduce 
operating costs.
Manufacturing efficiency
Input costs reduced in 2015, due to an 
improved market for hides and the 
benefits of lower energy costs passing 
through the global supply chain. 
The Czech operation ran at full capacity, 
benefiting from the high levels of 
investment we have undertaken  
since 2005.
The businesses in Scotland and  
Australia both completed substantial 
restructuring projects to reduce 
overhead costs whilst at the same time 
maintaining full operating activities.  
This proved challenging, particularly in 
the first half, but over the course of the 
year annualised cost savings of £5.8 
million were successfully realised, 
slightly ahead of expectations.
Over the three years from 2014-2016, 
Devro has been restructuring its 
manufacturing operations worldwide  
in order to have lower cost capacity 
located to supply both established  
and emerging markets with competitive 
products. From a total of 2,200 
employees in 2014, 350 roles in higher-
cost locations in the USA, the UK and 
Australia have become redundant,  
whilst 180 roles have been created at  
a new plant in China. This change  
reflects the scale of the cost reduction 
and reorganisation that has been 
undertaken at the same time that 
capacity is being increased.
In the USA construction and 
commissioning of the new £50 million 
plant in South Carolina is now 
approaching completion. The old USA 
plant saw its last full year of production 
in 2015. The permanent shutdown of the 
old, inefficient capacity commenced in 
December 2015, and will complete in the 
first half of 2016, as customers are 
transferred to enhanced products from 
the USA and Europe. Once the dual-
running of the old and new capacity 
ceases during 2016, the expected annual 
cost saving of £8 million will start to  
be realised.
In China, construction of a £60 million 
new plant in Jiangsu province was 
completed. Commissioning will run 
through the first half of 2016, with 
commercial production due to 
commence during the second half.  
This plant represents the first stage  
of an investment to supply directly  
into the world’s largest market for 
collagen casings.
Start-up of the new plants involves a 
large amount of specialist input and 
fine-tuning to achieve efficient output. 
In view of the scale of both projects, this 
will require significant input from all 
parts of the business during 2016.
Product differentiation
Effective research and development is 
key to product differentiation. During 
2015 the priority for development was  
to ensure that products coming from 
the new capacity will be effective 
replacements of predecessors and, 
where possible, will provide enhanced 
performance to customers. 
A single group research team is now 
established, with appropriate expertise 
recruited and a range of collaborative 
external research projects now starting 
to extend knowledge and opportunities.
The acquisition of PV Industries B.V.,  
a specialist European collagen gel 
business, has provided Devro with access 
to a strong technical skills base and an 
innovative and developing product 
portfolio. This will further strengthen our 
ability to differentiate our products and 
enhance value for customers.
OUTLOOK
For current trading, some markets  
are positive and providing good 
opportunities for growth, whilst others 
face continuing economic and political 
pressures that limit demand. In China, 
Devro continues to pursue the strategy 
of supplying differentiated products for 
the premium sector, which is growing, 
whereas in the standard casings sector 
there has been a contraction in volumes 
recently along with high levels of 
availability leading to price erosion. 
For Devro in 2016, it is the timely and 
efficient commissioning of our new 
plants that will most significantly 
contribute to improved profitability  
and, whilst we anticipate inevitable 
challenges in this phase, we are confident 
in the ability of our local management 
teams to reach successful conclusions.
Our transformation will complete in 
2016, after which Devro will be well 
positioned to supply all of our markets 
with competitive products from efficient 
manufacturing operations. The benefits 
from this transformation will begin to 
flow through to profits in 2016 and the 
long term growth prospects are strong.

Financial Review 
REVENUE 
Sales volumes in 2015 grew 0.9% for 
Devro. Volumes of edible casings grew 
strongly in North America, Japan and 
South East Asia. Political and economic 
volatility in Russia and surrounding 
markets contributed to volumes 
declining in these markets and were 
partly responsible for holding back 
overall group sales growth, particularly 
in the second half. Sales in Brazil, where 
prices are generally lower, were 
constrained by supply resulting in a year 
on year decline in volumes in this region.
There was also an extra week of trading 
in the first half of the year, due to 
changes in the manufacturing calendar, 
and consequently a week less trading  
in the second half. This contributed to 
the movement in trading volumes 
between the two halves. Adjusting for 
this, underlying growth would have been 
2% in the first half and a decline of 1%  
in the second half. 
Sales of gel continue to grow well in the 
USA, as customers transition from 
cellulose applications to collagen 
co-extrusion. The acquisition of PV 
Industries B.V. (“PVI”), which was 
completed in October 2015, has helped 
to expand the group’s expertise in this 
area as well as our sales into Europe.
Revenue, excluding the impact of 
foreign exchange, grew by 1.2% in 2015, 
predominantly as a result of improved 
volumes, particularly in Japan, North 
America and South East Asia. The 
acquisition of PVI contributed 0.4%  
of the revenue growth from gel sales  
in Europe. 
Pricing was relatively neutral during  
the year with a small positive mix effect 
which reflects the geographical split  
of sales. Pricing in China remains 
competitive, which underlines the 
importance of focusing on the  
premium segment.

Operating profit before exceptional items 2015 £33.3m
Restructuring savings
The planned cost reductions have been realised following the 
restructuring of operations in Scotland in 2014, as the group 
closes its older and less efficient capacity, alongside the 
outsourcing of hide preparation operations in Australia. 
Together these actions contributed £5.8 million of cost 
savings, which was slightly ahead of target.
Input costs
Input costs reduced £3.0 million during the year following a 
number of years of increases. The group benefited from lower 
raw material costs in the USA and Australia, alongside lower 
energy costs across all locations.
Manufacturing 
Manufacturing was especially challenging in the existing USA 
factory, which is nearing the end of its useful life, ahead of the 
transition to the new manufacturing plant. The updated 
equipment in the new plant is currently being commissioned 
and is expected to be fully operational in the first half of 2016. 
As both this investment project and the new manufacturing 
site in China are completed during 2016 overall manufacturing 
costs for the group will be further reduced.
Foreign exchange
Devro has operations around the world in multiple currencies. 
There was an adverse foreign exchange impact on the results 
of £2.1 million which reflects the strengthening of sterling 
against most other key trading currencies of the group 
compared to 2014, particularly against the euro and  
Czech koruna.

Exceptional items incurred during 2015 comprise incremental 
costs associated with the two investment projects to establish 
new plants in the USA and China, an adjustment to the 
decommissioning provision related to restructuring actions 
and costs related to the acquisition of PVI. 
Investment projects exceptional items include staff retention 
costs and redundancy provisions, accelerated depreciation, 
incremental costs attributable to the transition to the new 
plant and decommissioning costs related to the assets being 
made redundant by the USA investment, together with 
project management costs, training costs and professional 
fees for the two projects. 
The non-cash exceptional item of £1.4 million comprises 
accelerated depreciation and the write-off of raw materials 
which will not be usable once production has ceased at the 
existing USA factory.
2016 will be the final year of exceptional items associated with 
the three-year transformation programme. Exceptional items 
in 2016 are expected to be at a similar level to those incurred 
in 2015, which reflects the start-up costs of the two new 
plants prior to full scale commercial production.

Financial Review continued
This is approximately £15 million higher than the amount 
originally planned for the two projects in order to provide 
additional functionality in both the USA and China plants to 
support future expansion, including investment in waste water 
treatment, product kitchens and the base infrastructure.
These two strategic projects are both on plan to commence 
commercial production in 2016.
ACQUISITION
The group acquired 100% of the shares in PV Industries B.V. 
(“PVI”) on 5 October 2015. Based in the Netherlands, PVI is  
a leading manufacturer of high quality collagen gel products 
for the meat processing industry. 
Cash consideration of €9.2 million (£6.8 million) was paid, 
with a further €0.2 million (£0.2 million) contingent 
consideration expected to be paid dependent upon revenues 
earned by PVI to the end of 2016. Including cash and debt 
acquired with PVI the acquisition increased group net debt  
by £8.8 million.
The fair value of net assets purchased (including net 
borrowings) was £3.9 million which included £2.1 million 
recognised as an intangible asset in respect of customer 
contracts and relationships. Additionally £3.1 million was 
recognised as goodwill.

to the group’s operating cash flow. £3 million of the increase 
in trade and other receivables related to payment of input 
taxes on equipment installed in our new plant in China, which 
will be recovered as sales and profits are generated from the 
new plant.
Operating cash flow, before capital expenditure and 
exceptional items, improved to £49.9 million 
(2014: £48.1 million), in line with operating profits. 
Cash outflow from exceptional items was £15.5 million 
(2014: £6.5 million).
FINANCING AND NET DEBT
Key financial measures are as follows:
2015 2014
Net debt £125.5m £69.2m
Net debt/EBITDA 2.6 times 1.5 times
Gearing 95.7% 52.0%
Return on capital employed (ROCE) 11.5% 11.8%
Net debt increased as expected during the year, principally 
due to expenditure on the group’s two major investment 
projects which are expected to commence commercial 
production during 2016. Additionally net debt increased 
£8.8 million upon the acquisition of PVI in October 2015,  
and we negotiated a temporary increase in the key net debt/
EBITDA covenant on our funding facility from 3 times to 
3.25 times as a result. The covenant reverts to 3 times in 
September 2016.
The group remained within its funding facilities which include 
the US$100 million US private placement that took place in 
the first half of 2014, and the £110 million revolving credit 
facility which was negotiated in December 2014 and will be  
in place until 2019. 
Net debt/EBITDA ended the year at 2.6 times and is expected 
to peak in the first half of 2016 as the two investment projects 
are completed but will remain within the banking covenants. 
ROCE reduced from 11.8% to 11.5% which reflects the 
significant investment programme currently being undertaken 
by the group.

reflecting the capital invested in the group’s two major 
investment projects. As these projects are completed the 
capitalisation of interest will cease and the net interest cost 
will increase as a result.
The small increase in net finance cost on pensions over 2014 
reflects the increase in the opening net pension liability.  21

The decrease in the pension liability during the year largely 
reflects the increase in scheme discount rates.
During the year discussions with trustees of the UK scheme 
were completed following the triennial valuation as at 
31 March 2014, and as a result annual contributions to fund  
the deficit were increased by £1 million for the next 12 years.

GOING CONCERN
At 31 December 2015 the group was operating within the 
banking covenants related to its revolving credit facility and 
US private placement facilities. The group’s detailed financial 
forecasts indicate that there is sufficient headroom in the 
facilities for the foreseeable future and that they can be 
repaid in line with the expected terms.
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the group has adequate resources to 
continue in operation for the foreseeable future. For this 
reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.

INCREASED COMPETITIVE 
PRESSURES
The group operates in competitive 
markets throughout the world.
A major change in the production capacities, 
pricing policies or behaviour of our competitors,  
or consolidation between either competitors or 
major customers, could have a significant adverse 
effect on sales revenues and profitability. 
In addition to substantial capital investment,  
the group invested over £6 million in research  
and development activities in 2015 to extend and 
differentiate the product range and improve the 
quality of our products.
We also expand the total collagen casings market 
by developing products which convert gut casing 
applications to collagen.
Devro provides a high level of technical support 
to key customers.
Increased
DOWNTURN IN  
CONSUMER DEMAND
Consumer preferences evolve  
over time, and are influenced by  
a number of issues outside our 
control, including economic 
factors and health considerations. 
A decline in consumer demand could lead to 
increased competition in the marketplace and 
reduced sales revenue/profitability.
Devro’s wide range of products allows flexibility  
to respond to customer and market demands.
We continue to invest heavily in our products and 
processes with the aim of increasing quality while 
reducing our cost base to remain competitive.
Increased
OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION
The group is at risk of disruption to 
its manufacturing capability from 
poor operational performance, or 
major disruptive events such as 
fire or flooding.
Prolonged operational disruption could result in 
sustained loss of capacity or capability, and could 
impact on our ability to deliver to customers. 
This, in turn, could adversely affect the group’s 
financial performance. 
The group maintains industry-leading operational 
processes and procedures to ensure effective 
operational management at each of our plants.
With seven facilities in various locations, the 
group has manufacturing flexibility, and this 
enables effective contingency planning.
Our business continuity and disaster recovery 
plans are regularly tested and continually updated. 
Appropriate insurance policies are in place. 
Unchanged
BREXIT
The June 2016 referendum on the 
UK’s continued membership of the 
European Union could result in a 
vote to exit.
The EU single market for goods, services  
and people is beneficial to Devro’s European 
operations. Trading and regulatory relationships 
beyond Europe are in many cases facilitated by  
EU membership.
A vote to leave would result in these 
arrangements lapsing, thereby leading to a  
period of uncertainty while new relationships 
were negotiated. New arrangements may not be 
secured before the existing framework falls, or 
may be on disadvantageous terms compared to 
the current conditions.
With seven manufacturing plants across the  
world, the group’s diversity provides significant 
protection against this risk. Exports from our 
Scottish plants amount to c.10% of group turnover.
Increased
FINANCIAL RISKS
The main financial risks relate to 
foreign exchange rate movements, 
and the availability of short and 
long-term funding.
Adverse foreign exchange rate movements could 
reduce revenues and the sterling value of 
reported profits. Almost 90% of the group’s 
revenues are currently invoiced in currencies 
other than sterling.
Failure to operate within the agreed financial 
framework could lead to inability to support 
long-term investment or to raise capital for  
funding growth.
The financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
within our operating units is mitigated by a policy 
of hedging a substantial portion of transactional 
foreign exchange risk for periods of up to 12 
months using forward contracts. 
All term debt is arranged and managed centrally 
and appropriate covenant headroom is maintained.

IN 2015 WE  
REVIEWED OUR  
RISK MANAGEMENT 
PROCESS AND  
RELA TED REPORTING
The directors have carried out a robust 
assessment of the principal risks facing 
the company, including those that would 
threaten its business model, future 
performance, solvency or liquidity.  
The main risks identified are set out in 
the following pages. Additional risks 
which are not presently known to 
management could also have an adverse 
effect on the company.
The Board has taken into consideration 
the principal risks when considering the 
adoption of the going concern basis of 
accounting, and when assessing the 
prospects of the company for the 
purpose of the viability statement. 
The going concern and viability 
statements can be found on page 41.
In addressing and overseeing risk,  
the Board is supported by the Risk 
Committee. In 2015, the Board asked 
that the Committee submit to it four 
formal reports in the course of the year, 
and this practice will be continued.  
A report from the Committee can be 
found on page 40.
The Committee’s remit includes  
the following:
1) Assess and monitor
To assess and monitor risk across the group and to recommend mitigating 
strategies in respect of the key risks;
2) Risk Register review
To review and update the Risk Register four times a year;
3) Process review
To review the group process for evaluating risk to ensure it remains appropriate 
and relevant; and
4) “Bottom Up” review
To co-ordinate an annual ‘bottom up’ review of risk across the group, culminating 
in formal reports to the Audit Committee and the Board in the fourth quarter  
of each year.

A decline in consumer demand could lead to 
increased competition in the marketplace and 
reduced sales revenue/profitability.
Devro’s wide range of products allows flexibility  
to respond to customer and market demands.
We continue to invest heavily in our products and 
processes with the aim of increasing quality while 
reducing our cost base to remain competitive.
Increased
OPERATIONAL DISRUPTION
The group is at risk of disruption to 
its manufacturing capability from 
poor operational performance, or 
major disruptive events such as 
fire or flooding.
Prolonged operational disruption could result in 
sustained loss of capacity or capability, and could 
impact on our ability to deliver to customers. 
This, in turn, could adversely affect the group’s 
financial performance. 
The group maintains industry-leading operational 
processes and procedures to ensure effective 
operational management at each of our plants.
With seven facilities in various locations, the 
group has manufacturing flexibility, and this 
enables effective contingency planning.
Our business continuity and disaster recovery 
plans are regularly tested and continually updated. 
Appropriate insurance policies are in place. 
Unchanged
BREXIT
The June 2016 referendum on the 
UK’s continued membership of the 
European Union could result in a 
vote to exit.
The EU single market for goods, services  
and people is beneficial to Devro’s European 
operations. Trading and regulatory relationships 
beyond Europe are in many cases facilitated by  
EU membership.
A vote to leave would result in these 
arrangements lapsing, thereby leading to a  
period of uncertainty while new relationships 
were negotiated. New arrangements may not be 
secured before the existing framework falls, or 
may be on disadvantageous terms compared to 
the current conditions.
With seven manufacturing plants across the  
world, the group’s diversity provides significant 
protection against this risk. Exports from our 
Scottish plants amount to c.10% of group turnover.
Increased
FINANCIAL RISKS
The main financial risks relate to 
foreign exchange rate movements, 
and the availability of short and 
long-term funding.
Adverse foreign exchange rate movements could 
reduce revenues and the sterling value of 
reported profits. Almost 90% of the group’s 
revenues are currently invoiced in currencies 
other than sterling.
Failure to operate within the agreed financial 
framework could lead to inability to support 
long-term investment or to raise capital for  
funding growth.
The financial impact of exchange rate fluctuations 
within our operating units is mitigated by a policy 
of hedging a substantial portion of transactional 
foreign exchange risk for periods of up to 12 
months using forward contracts. 
All term debt is arranged and managed centrally 
and appropriate covenant headroom is maintained.

DISRUPTION TO SUPPLY OR 
INCREASE IN PRICE OF KEY 
RAW MATERIALS
The group’s most important 
raw material is collagen, a 
naturally occurring animal 
protein obtained from cattle 
and sow hides.
There is a risk that changes  
may occur in the supply or 
demand for food grade 
collagen, resulting in 
significant cost increases  
for the group’s business.
Raw collagen represents  
approximately 15% of the group’s  
total operating costs.
Increase in price would adversely 
impact the group’s operating costs.
Disruption to supply could 
adversely affect manufacturing 
performance.
The group manages the collagen 
sourcing risk by, where possible, 
entering into long-term arrangements 
with specialised suppliers in various 
parts of the world.
We monitor developments and 
changes in the global abattoir and 
leather Industries to maintain and 
develop appropriate relationships.
Decreased
DEVELOPMENT  
OF NON-CASING 
TECHNOLOGIES
More than 85% of the group’s 
revenue is derived from the 
manufacture and sale of 
edible collagen casing, 
primarily for sausages.  
For many years, several 
manufacturers of machinery 
used in the food industry have 
been promoting “co-
extrusion” systems for 
sausages which do not  
require casing.
If there were to be a significant 
conversion to co-extrusion, there 
could be an adverse effect on the 
sale of casing, revenues and profits.
The group makes substantial 
investments in product development 
and manufacturing processes to 
sustain competitive advantage.
Where there have been conversions to 
co-extrusion in the past, the group 
has often been successful in obtaining 
the business to supply the collagen 
gel required for such applications, 
and, following the 2015 acquisition of 
PV Industries B.V. (now “Devro B.V.”), 
continues to be a world leader in this 
specialist category.

IMPACT OF CHANGES  
IN REGULATIONS AFFECTING 
FOOD PRODUCTION
As a supplier to the food 
industry, the group complies 
with all relevant food safety 
regulations. These regulations 
are not only those of the 
jurisdictions where products 
are manufactured (the 
European Union, the USA  
and Australia), but also the 
regulations of the many 
countries in which products 
are sold. Regulatory authorities 
routinely enact changes to 
food safety legislation.
Changes to food safety regulations 
could result in restrictions on the 
movement of the group’s products, 
or its raw materials, between 
territories, or necessitate changes 
to the production processes at  
one or more of the group’s 
manufacturing facilities.
The Global Quality and Regulatory 
Affairs Director actively monitors 
planned and actual changes to 
regulations in all relevant jurisdictions 
in order to minimise disruption to  
our business.
The group is a founder member of the 
Collagen Casings Trade Association, 
which represents the industry and 
promotes its excellent record in 
regulatory and health issues. Supplier 
approval and traceability are under 
constant review.

INCREASED FUNDING 
REQUIREMENTS OF  
PENSION SCHEMES
Estimates of the amount  
and timing of future funding 
obligations for the group’s 
defined benefit pension 
schemes are based on various 
assumptions, including the 
projected investment 
performance of the pension 
scheme assets, future bond 
yields, changes to assumptions 
about the longevity of the 
schemes’ members and 
statutory requirements.
Any significant deterioration  
in the schemes’ asset values or 
unforeseen increases in scheme 
liabilities might increase the 
group’s funding obligations and 
could adversely affect the group’s 
profits and financial strength.
The position and performance of  
each of the pension schemes are 
continually monitored by the group,  
in conjunction with pension trustees 
and professional advisers.
All defined benefit schemes are  
closed to new entrants, and the group 
is actively working to match assets to

PEOPLE
Shortage of people with 
relevant expertise.
There is considerable competition  
for highly trained staff in certain  
areas. Devro’s strategy of 
significant investment in the

retention of highly-skilled technical 
managers and employees.
A number of internal programmes  
have been introduced to train and 
develop key employees. Unchanged
PRODUCT CONTAMINATION
Raw materials and ingredients 
may contain impurities, 
contamination or disease.
Contamination could lead to a 
product recall, loss of reputation, 
or significant costs of 
compensation.
All of our manufacturing sites have 
achieved FS22000 approval. This 
requires a Hazard Analysis and  
Critical Control Point programme

A key element underpinning the group’s strategy is 
to deliver growth in sales revenue. There are several 
components to revenue growth, including changes in 
sales volumes and in price/mix. As a result, the group 
monitors sales volume growth separately, and 
changes in price/mix are monitored through revenue 
growth. Devro sells to markets around the world 
from strategically located commercial operations 
and through an extensive network of distributors  
and agents.
Operating cash flow before exceptional items is the 
amount of cash generated by the group through its 
trading activities and manufacturing operations 
before investment in capital expenditure. This 
measure is used to evaluate the performance of  
each business and to assist the management of 
working capital.

Revenue is monitored on the basis of operating 
segments as follows: Americas, Asia-Pacific and 
Europe. Given the significant distorting effects of 
movements in exchange rates, revenue growth is 
monitored in constant currency.**
Health and safety matters are discussed further 
on pages 28 and 29 of this Annual Report. Safety 
performance is measured in various ways at a 
local level. At group level, it is measured by the 
rate of injuries requiring treatment by a health 
professional, which is calculated as the number of 
injuries per million hours worked, comprising both 
lost working day injuries and recordable injuries.
Net debt/earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation, and amortisation (EBITDA) 
measures the liquidity of the group. EBITDA/net 
interest measures our ability to service our  
net debt.
Net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA/net interest  
are the two key covenants for the short and 
long-term funding for the group, and are 
therefore monitored on an ongoing basis.
Return on capital employed (ROCE) represents 
operating profit before exceptional items as a 
percentage of average capital employed. Capital 
employed is defined as fixed assets plus current 
assets less current liabilities, excluding all 
balances related to interest-bearing assets and 
liabilities, any derivative financial instruments, any 
deferred tax balances, and any pension assets or 
liabilities. It is a key indicator of how the company 
is making use of its available capital, and is a good 
reflection of the performance of the company in 
terms of both earnings and cash flow.

BEING A  
RESPONSIBLE BUSINESS
As a global manufacturing business, we inevitably have  
an impact on the wider world. We take our responsibilities  
to society and the environment seriously and make sure  
they are reflected in all our group policies.
Corporate Social Responsibility Report
The Board’s Health and Safety 
Committee reviews and monitors safety 
performance in each of the regions. All 
sites have an annual safety and training 
plan in place. These are submitted to the 
Committee for review at the start of  
the year. 
The Committee met five times in 2015  
to review progress and met with the 
regional safety committees on four of 
those occasions.
In 2015, as part of Devro’s efforts to 
reinforce our philosophy of making the 
health and safety of every colleague  
our number one priority and 
consistently improving safety 
performance throughout the group,  
we launched a set of global mandatory 
safety rules. Their focus is on modifying 
worker and supervisor behaviours in the 
workplace by raising awareness.
We created a new Devro mascot,  
Nina (“No Incidents No Accidents”),  
as a means of keeping our colleagues 
informed of all the latest safety updates 
and improvements. 
HEALTH AND SAFETY
Devro believes in strong health and 
safety principles. One of our core beliefs 
is that all accidents are preventable. Our 
overarching aim is to make Devro a safer 
place to work and ensure everybody 
goes home safely at the end of the 
working day. 
Safety underpins all our operational 
procedures with accountability for 
safety at every level of the organisation.
Our strategy and objectives are to:
• Promote health and safety, to work 
towards a target of zero accidents of 
employees, contractors, visitors and 
the public.
• Deliver zero “high potential” incidents 
in our businesses; i.e. events that 
could have resulted in significant 
harm, through ensuring all of our 
manufacturing sites have robust 
process safety management controls 
in place.
• Implement a proactive and visible 
safety-management culture founded 
on leading indicators.
• Ensure that health and safety training 
remains at the forefront of the 
development of our staff and the 
needs of the company, both today 
and in the future.
• Ensure each of the regions has a 
comprehensive risk assessment 
programme in place for both new 
and existing operations. 
• Assess and ensure compliance with 
our company “Golden Rules”.
• Deliver “best in class” health and 
safety performance. ‘10

How we did in 2015
The reported rate of lost working day 
injuries (“LWDIs”) increased in the past 
year. We recorded nine LWDIs in 2015 
compared to seven in 2014. The number 
of working days lost due to injury was 
206 (2014: 144).
This demonstrates the need for 
continuous improvement in the 
management of health and safety  
risks in the workplace. Through our 
programme of change, we will  
continue to target the underlying  
causes of such incidents in order to 
achieve our objectives.
Following every LWDI, a full report is 
drafted with all remedial actions put  
in place as soon as is practical, and the 
circumstances shared with all sites to 
ensure the chance of recurrence 
elsewhere in the group is minimised.  
The Chief Executive meets personally 
with every colleague who has been 
involved in an LWDI.
We also measure our performance by 
looking at the number of “recordable 
injuries”, defined as those that need 
more attention than basic first aid and 
require the attention of a health 
professional. In 2015, there were 20 
recordable incidents reported which 
was a decrease from 21 reported in 2014.

ENVIRONMENT
As a manufacturing company  
operating on a global platform, the  
main environmental impacts of our 
processes continue to be the emission 
of carbon dioxide and the generation of 
the solid waste from process which we 
send to landfill.
Within four of our major locations, 
including our new plant in Nantong, 
China, we operate our own waste water 
treatment plants. In the fifth, Scotland, 
we partially treat our effluent to ensure 
we meet the outflow parameters before 
discharging directly into the public 
sewerage system, where our waste is 
combined with domestic effluent and 
treated by Scottish Water.
Our world-wide operations are subject 
to a variety of regulatory regimes and 
cultures. As a consequence, we deal 
with environmental issues through a 
network of field and regional specialists 
operating within the business units. 
There is active co-operation between 
our sites, and many country-specific 
solutions have now been adopted across 
several business units where common 
solutions are practical.
While the individual business units 
measure the relevant environmental 
impacts aligned to the specific country 
or regional legislation, we also 
collectively monitor our group level 
performance via three main measures:
• carbon dioxide (CO
2
) emissions from 
the use of fuels and electricity in  
our factories;
• water consumption; and
• solid waste produced in our 
processes disposed of via landfill.
All three are important to us but our 
major concern, and as such, a main area 
of focus, remains climate change and 
the twin issues of fuel consumption  
and electricity-related CO
2
 emissions. 
Our capital projects in the USA and 
China have incorporated the best 
available technologies to minimise  
our emissions and energy usage per 
kilometre of product.
Global targets
In 2011 we set ourselves the target  
of making 10% reductions in each  
of these measures per kilometre-
equivalent-product by the year 2015.  
We have surpassed these targets 
through a combination of targeted 
energy-reduction programmes and 
increased manufacturing volume in  
our plants.

Having evaluated the legislative 
requirements in the countries where

opportunities presented by technology, 
new targets (against 2014 baseline) have 
been adopted that by 2020 we will:
• reduce emissions (tonnes CO

million metres production) by 30%;
• reduce energy usage (GJ per million 
metres production) by 15%;
• reduce water usage (cubic metres 
per million metres production) by 
10%; and
• reduce landfill (tonnes of solids sent 
to landfill from process) to zero.
These targets demonstrate our 
aspirations in making a step-change  
in environmental performance into  
the next decade and underline our 
commitment and resolve to manage 
our environmental impacts and 
responsibilities.

attain the targets that we have set for 
our business out to 2020 and beyond.

Water
Overall water use has reduced in 2015  
at all four production locations. Changes 
in the USA process will also help 
strengthen this performance measure 
although the full effect has not been 
reflected in 2015 figures. The 2015 
performance demonstrates a 32% 
reduction from the baseline, and our 
new targets reflect our determination to 
drive the agenda of resource efficiency 
in our business in the next target period.
Solid waste to landfill
In the various regions in which we 
operate, local legislation governs landfill 
use and is quite diverse. However, there 
is a common message to reduce the 
impact wherever and whenever 
possible. In most areas, landfill from 
inert sources (bricks, concrete, building 
waste) is under less restrictive control. 
In 2015 some changes in the regulatory 
framework meant that some of our 
process waste in Scotland had to go 
back to landfill. This was, however, offset 
by good performances in other regions. 
We remain focused on finding new 
streams for our process waste and 
continue to evaluate new technologies 
with our business partners. This is 
wholly consistent with our strategic aim 
to reduce waste from our manufacturing 
processes in the short-term and find 
new avenues for disposal in the longer 
term, thus achieving our stated goal of 
zero landfill from process waste by 2020.
Environmental  
management systems
All our manufacturing sites employ 
environmental management systems, 
based around the ISO 14001 model. Four 
of the plants have now been accredited 
with the ISO 14001 Standard and, both 
the remaining plant, and the Chinese 
operation, are currently evaluating the 
accreditation process as part of their 
environmental strategies.

a number of vehicles and rent offices. 
The figures above cover all of these 
activities except where we rent an office 
where the energy use is not measured 
separately. The impact of this on our 
numbers is not material.
We started collecting information in  
this format in 2012 as part of our 
responsibilities as a FTSE4Good company.
Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission 
sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and

members. It is now common practice  
to bring together multi-cultural teams  
to work on strategically important 
projects. This has many benefits, not 
least of which is creating a more unified 
and consistent business culture. 
Employee representatives are consulted 
regularly on a wide range of matters 
affecting their current and future 
interests. Particular focus this year has 
been the development of new factories, 
refresh of the talent management 
process across the group and 
developing the Devro Academy, our 
in-house knowledge-sharing initiative,  
to make technical knowledge easily 
available in all regions.
Devro is an equal opportunities 
employer and our employees and 
job-applicants are treated fairly and 
equally regardless of their age, colour, 
creed, disability, full or part-time status, 
gender, marital status, nationality or 
ethnic origin, race, religion or sexual 
orientation. Applications from disabled 
people are always fully considered, 
bearing in mind the aptitudes of the 
applicant concerned. In the event of 
members of staff becoming disabled, 
every effort will be made to ensure that 
their employment with the group 
continues and the appropriate training  
is arranged. It is the policy of the group 
that the training, career development 
and promotion of disabled persons 
should, as far as possible, be identical 
with that of other employees.
We employed 2,174 people, on  
average, around the world during 2015 
(2014: 2,226). As at 31 December 2015 
the group employed 2,258 people 
(2014: 2,162). The number of employees 
is expected to fall during 2016 as the 
investment project in the USA is 
completed and the existing facility  
is closed.
We encourage the development of 
employees through training and invest 
both time and money in this in order  
to provide benefits for both the group, 
through a more highly skilled workforce, 
and the individual employees, who gain 
both qualifications and experience that 
they can use to further their careers 
whilst with the group and in any future 
roles elsewhere. As at 31 December 2015 
we were training ten apprentices around 
the world. During the course of the year 
four apprenticeships were completed. 
As at 31 December 2015, 26 people  
who had successfully completed 
apprenticeships with us were still 
employed by the group.
The group continues to support 
employees in their Professional 
Certificate in Management accreditation 
and MBAs through the Open University 
Business School, with another intake 
planned for 2016. This is supplemented 
with professional education in other 
disciplines such as NEBOSH International 
Diploma, Level 6, an equivalent honours 
degree in Health and Safety.
Devro does not have a specific human 
rights policy. However, we have judged 
that human rights are not a material risk

for the business due to the existing 
regulatory requirements in the regions 
where the group’s significant operations 
are based and our recruitment practices 
that support these requirements. We 
run our business responsibly and ensure 
that all our employees, customers, 
suppliers and other stakeholders are

regions that the group may base 
operations in the future, and adhere to 
the highest standards, even where local

Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance Report 
From 1 January 2015 until 31 December 2015, the company 
applied the 2014 edition of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code (the “Code”).
1. BOARD COMPOSITION
Mr G J Hoetmer, Chairman, Mr P W B Page, Chief Executive, 
Mr S C Webb, Group Finance Director, Ms J A Lodge, Non- 
Executive Director, Mr P A J Neep, Non-Executive Director, 
and Mr P N Withers, Non-Executive Director, served as 
directors throughout 2015.
The Non-Executive Directors are considered to be 
“independent” directors. This opinion is based primarily on 
careful consideration of their character and judgement and 
their contribution to the work of the Board and its 
committees. None holds any external position which would 
impinge upon his or her independence or objectivity, nor  
are there any relationships or circumstances such as are 
envisaged by Provision B.1.1 of the Code, other than as set  
out in the following paragraph.
Mr P A J Neep has held the position of “Senior Independent 
Director” since October 2005. The Board recognises in terms 
of Provision B.2.3 of the Code that the independence of any 
Non-Executive Director may be compromised if he or she has 
been in that role for a long period of time. The Board has 
therefore rigorously evaluated Mr P A J Neep’s performance, 
and the Chairman is satisfied that he continues to be effective 
and to demonstrate commitment to the role. The Board has 
therefore decided to recommend the re-election of Mr P A J 
Neep at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (“AGM”).
The Board views the Senior Independent Director’s role 
generally as a passive one, but acknowledges that there can 
be occasions where there may be a need for shareholders to 
convey concerns to the Board other than through the 
Chairman or the Chief Executive. The company’s major 
shareholders are reminded that the Senior Independent 
Director is willing to meet with them if they wish.
As previously announced, Mr S C Webb will step down from 
the Board in March 2016, and Mr Rutger Helbing will join as 
Group Finance Director on 4 April 2016.
All current directors, other than Mr S C Webb, will stand for 
re-election at the 2016 AGM, and Mr Helbing will stand for 
election. As in previous years, brief biographies of Board 
members, giving details of their experience and other main 
commitments, can be found on pages 34 and 35, allowing 
shareholders to make an informed decision on the question  
of re-election. All the directors have had their performance 
reviewed recently, as described on page 39 below, and the 
Chairman is satisfied that each continues to be effective and 
to demonstrate commitment to the role.
Details of Mr Helbing’s experience can be found on page 121. 
There is a clear division of authority and responsibility 
through the separation of the roles of the Chairman and Chief 
Executive. This demarcation is set out in writing and was 
reviewed by the Board in 2014.
Chairman’s introduction
The leadership and effectiveness  
of the Board are primarily the 
Chairman’s responsibility. We 
recognise the importance of, and 
are committed to, high standards 
of corporate governance, aligned 
with the needs of the company and 
the interests of all our stakeholders.
My fellow directors and I fully 
appreciate the importance of 
sound governance in the efficient 
running of the company, and in 
particular to the effectiveness and 
independence of the Board and the 
management of risks faced by the 
group. The following report sets 
out how we do this. It covers how 
the Board and its committees 
operated in 2015. 
Gerard Hoetmer
Chairman 37
Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report Shareholder Information
Directors of the company and its subsidiaries have the benefit of a directors’ and officers’ liability insurance policy.
The directors believe that it is essential that the group should be led and controlled by an effective board. The Board has 
adopted a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved to it including:
• the setting of corporate strategy;
• approval of the annual budget; and
• major decisions on capital expenditure.
In 2015, the Board broadly divided its time as follows:
 Strategy and planning
 Performance review
 Corporate governance
20%
45%
35%
The day-to-day management of the business is the responsibility of executive management.
Balance and diversity 
The Chairman and the Board understand the need to ensure that the balance of the Board is appropriate for the requirements 
of the business, and the benefits of diversity in its broadest sense are clearly understood. However, for a relatively small Board, 
it remains difficult to set targets for members of any particular background, and this applies to the issue of women on the 
Board. The Board’s policy is therefore to actively encourage women to apply to join the Board whenever a vacancy exists, and 
the report from the Nomination Committee on page 39 sets out how we do this. Ultimately, however, any appointments must 
be made on merit, taking account of the specific needs of the business at the relevant times, for the benefit of the company 
and its stakeholders.
Information flow
On appointment to the Board, directors are provided with an induction programme to familiarise themselves with the group’s 
businesses and the risks and strategic challenges facing the group, as well as the economic, competition, legal and regulatory 
environments in which the group operates.
The directors are supplied with detailed papers covering the group’s operating functions in advance of all Board meetings and 
a secure web-based portal is used to disseminate additional relevant information on a regular basis.
Members of the executive management team attend and make presentations as appropriate at meetings of the Board.  
A programme of strategic and other reviews, together with training provided during the year, ensures that the directors 
continually update their skills, knowledge and familiarity with the group’s businesses, as well as their awareness of industry, 
risk, legal, regulatory, financial and other developments to enable them to fulfil their role on the Board and committees of the 
Board effectively.
The directors are authorised to obtain independent professional advice at the company’s expense in performance of their 
duties as directors, although none has done so in the period under review. In addition, all directors have access to the services 
of the Company Secretary, who is also responsible for ensuring that Board procedures are observed and for advising the 
Board on corporate governance matters.
Board and committee proceedings
The Board acknowledges that it is collectively responsible for the success of the company by providing entrepreneurial 
leadership, setting the company’s strategic aims, ensuring that the necessary financial and human resources are in place and 
reviewing management performance. 38
Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance Report continued
A number of committees carry out detailed independent oversight on behalf of the Board in relation to the audit of the 
company, health and safety issues, the remuneration of directors, appointments to the Board and the risks facing the group.
In order to discharge these responsibilities, the Board and its committees meet on a regular basis throughout the year. In 2015, 
the Board held eight meetings. Full details of the Board and committee attendance are shown in the table below:
G J Hoetmer P W B Page J A Lodge P A J Neep S C Webb P N Withers
Board – 8 meetings 8 8 8 8 8 8
Audit Committee – 4 meetings – – 4 4 – 4
Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Committee – 4 meetings 4 – 4 4 – 4
Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Committee – 1 meeting – 1 – – 1 –
Nomination Committee – 1 meeting 1 – 1 1 – 1
Health and Safety Committee – 5 meetings – 5 – – – 5
Risk Committee – 4 meetings – 4 – – 4 –
Board papers are generally circulated one week before the meetings. Comprehensive monthly management accounts in an 
agreed format are also sent to directors in a timely manner.
The Audit, Remuneration, Nomination, Health and Safety and Risk Committees, all appropriately resourced, met a total of 19 
times during the year.
The Chairman and the other Non-Executive Directors met informally during the year, providing an opportunity to review the 
business without the Executive Directors being present.
Board evaluation
In December 2015, the Board conducted an evaluation process based on a detailed questionnaire which was distributed to the 
directors for their consideration. Results were collated confidentially by the Company Secretary, and reviewed by the 
Chairman. Individual and collective discussions on the Board’s performance then followed.
The questionnaire examines the balance of the skills of the directors, the operation of the Board in practice, including 
governance issues, and the content of Board meetings. Feedback from the process is used to identify opportunities to improve 
the performance of the Board and the directors.
This process also addresses the effectiveness of the Board committees, covering such matters as meeting arrangements, and 
information provision. The results of the 2015 process were discussed by the Board and, where areas of improvement were 
identified, actions were agreed.
A satisfactory review of the performance of the Chairman was completed by the Non-Executive Directors, led by the Senior 
Independent Director.
2. RELATIONSHIP WITH SHAREHOLDERS
The company communicates with institutional investors primarily though analysts’ briefings and meetings with major 
shareholders, as well as timely Stock Exchange announcements. The Board, and in particular the Non-Executive Directors, are 
kept informed of investors’ views in the main through distribution of analysts’ and brokers’ briefings. The Chairman is willing to 
meet with shareholders to discuss matters such as strategy and governance and, as mentioned above, the Senior Independent 
Director is available in the event of shareholder concerns which cannot be addressed through the usual channels.
Broader shareholder communication takes place through the company’s website, which contains significant company 
announcements and other relevant information, and also through the Annual Report and AGM. All directors attend the AGM, 
and shareholders have the opportunity to hear presentations on the group’s financial and business performance as well as to 
question any member of the Board on any relevant topic.
Votes at the AGM are conducted by way of a poll to ensure that the votes of shareholders who are unable to attend may be 
taken into account. The results are announced to the Stock Exchange.
Each substantial issue is proposed as an individual resolution of the AGM. Notice of the meeting is sent to shareholders at least 
20 working days before the meeting. 39

3. DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
Details of the level of remuneration received by the directors in 2015 are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on 
pages 45 to 58. The Board believes that the current levels of remuneration are at the right level to attract and retain the 
directors needed to run the company successfully, without being excessive. Base salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed 
against those paid for similar positions in comparable companies. Professional advice from independent advisers is sought 
each year in this regard by the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee.
An explanation of the company’s incentive schemes, including how these are linked to the company’s strategy, is set out in the 
Remuneration Report on pages 45 to 58.
The Executive Directors’ service contracts provide for notice periods of one year. Due to the technical nature of the business, 
these contracts contain restrictive covenants which will be rigorously applied and, taking this into account, the Board and the 
Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee believe that the notice periods are reasonable and in the best interests of the 
company, having regard to prevailing market conditions and current practice among public companies.
Non-Executive Directors’ remuneration is reviewed annually by the Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee, taking 
independent external advice as appropriate.
Mr P A J Neep chaired the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee throughout 2015. The other members of the 
Committee were Mr G J Hoetmer, Ms J A Lodge and Mr P N Withers. The Committee met four times in 2015.
Throughout 2015, the Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee was chaired by Mr P W B Page, with Mr S C Webb as the 
other member. This Committee met once in 2015 to review the remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors for the current year.
The Remuneration Report contains a detailed statement of the remuneration of each director for 2015, including details of the 
company’s pension policy for Executive Directors.
The written remit of the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee is available on the company’s website.
4. REPORT FROM THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
The members of the Committee during the year were Mr G J Hoetmer (Committee Chairman), Ms J A Lodge, Mr P A J Neep 
and Mr P N Withers. The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee has written terms of reference which can be found on the company’s website. These include the regular review 
of the structure, size and composition of the Board. In 2015, the Committee met formally on one occasion.
During the course of the year, the Committee sought a new Group Finance Director following Mr S C Webb’s decision to step down. 
After a comprehensive search of external candidates using independent consultants, a number of strong contenders were 
identified. The Committee then reviewed the various candidates against the agreed specification before unanimously agreeing 
to nominate Mr Rutger Helbing to the Board for the post. Mr Helbing will take up the position on 4 April 2016.
The question of succession planning for senior management below Board level is primarily the responsibility of the  
Chief Executive.
Following a review of the Davies Report by the Board in the course of 2011, the Committee will continue to facilitate the 
candidature of women for Board appointments, and recruitment consultants will be instructed to ensure, whenever possible, 
that a significant proportion of any longlist put forward should be women. Shortlists will, where possible, be drawn up in a way 
which forces diversity amongst the final candidates.
5. REPORT FROM THE HEALTH AND SAFETY COMMITTEE
This Committee was formed in 2009, reflecting the Board’s commitment to health and safety matters.
The members of the Committee during the year were Mr P N Withers, who chaired the Committee, Mr P W B Page and 
Ms F L Curran, the company’s Group Health and Safety Manager. 
The Committee has written terms of reference which can be found on the company’s website.
The Committee convened five times in 2015 and on four of these occasions met (either by video, telephone or in person) with 
representatives of the safety committee of one of the group’s main manufacturing facilities. 
The safety performance of the group is reviewed at each meeting, and the Committee receives and reviews reports on all 
serious safety incidents. The Committee also reviewed and endorsed the safety plans for each of the main sites at the 
beginning of the year. 40

Directors’ Report
Corporate Governance Report continued
6. REPORT FROM THE RISK COMMITTEE
An ongoing process is in place to identify, evaluate and manage the significant risks the group faces, which accords with the 
FRC’s 2014 guidance and the Code. A Risk Committee was formed in 2010, chaired by the Group Company Secretary and 
comprising the Executive Directors and other members of the Executive Board, as listed on pages 34 and 35. This Committee 
meets four times a year and is charged with reviewing risk throughout the group and reporting thereon to the Board. As part 
of the process, risk assessment procedures are applied across the group. Each group operating company prepares a risk 
assessment for its business. This involves each company preparing a report identifying the relevant risks to both current 
operations and future strategy, the process for managing and mitigating these risks and the means by which management 
might be assured that the processes are effective. A similar exercise is also conducted at group level, taking account of any 
significant risks identified by each of the individual operating companies. The risk assessment reports are collated and 
considered by the Risk Committee, and then the Audit Committee, before being reviewed and finalised by the Board. The 
Board and the Risk Committee also agree a number of key risks for in-depth review by the Committee in the course of the 
following year. The system is designed to manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.  
The principal risks identified as part of the group risk assessment process, and how they are managed or mitigated, are 
summarised on pages 22 to 25.
7. FINANCIAL REPORTING
The Board acknowledges its responsibility to present a fair, balanced and understandable assessment of the company’s 
position and prospects. The Annual Report contains a Strategic Report on pages 2 to 33, including a Chairman’s Statement, 
Chief Executive’s Review and Financial Review. The Board believes that this additional narrative sets the accounts in context 
and promotes a better understanding of the current status of the business and its outlook.
To ensure consistency of reporting, the group has an established consolidation process as well as formal financial and 
operational procedures manuals. Management monitors the publication of new reporting standards and works closely with  
the statutory auditors in evaluating the impact of these standards.
8. INTERNAL CONTROL 
The Board of Directors, being ultimately responsible for the group’s system of internal control, has established an internal 
financial control structure which is designed to provide the Board with reasonable, but not absolute, assurance that it can rely 
on the accuracy and reliability of the financial records.
The structure, which is based on an assessment of material financial risks, can be described under the following headings:
Financial reporting 
There is a budgeting system in place which includes an annual budget approved by the Board. Monthly actual results are 
reported against budget. Revised forecasts for the year are prepared regularly. The company reports formally to shareholders 
twice a year, with two additional trading updates.
Operating controls
Financial and operational policies and procedures are set out in formal procedures manuals. Business directors and senior 
financial staff are responsible for ensuring that all relevant staff are familiar with their content and application.
Treasury 
Formal written treasury procedures are in operation, covering banking arrangements, hedging instruments, investment of cash 
balances and borrowing procedures. Individual staff responsibilities and levels of delegated authority in relation to treasury 
matters are defined.
Internal audit
The company has an internal audit function, provided by the Business Controls and Financial Analyst, who has a reporting line 
to the Chairman of the Audit Committee and also direct access to the Chairman of the Board. The Business Controls and 
Financial Analyst normally attends Audit Committee meetings and makes a formal report to the Committee annually.
Capital investment appraisal
The company has clearly defined guidelines for the approval and review of capital expenditure projects, which include annual 
budgets and designated levels of authority. 41
Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report Shareholder Information
Integrity of personnel
The company has a Policy on Business Conduct which sets out specific requirements for all staff to meet the company’s 
standards of conduct and integrity in their business dealings.
The Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the system of internal control and considers that the group has an established 
system of internal control which the directors believe to be appropriate to the business.
9.  GOING CONCERN 
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 33, along with the financial position of the group, its debt levels and borrowing facilities.
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the 
group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue 
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Key factors to support the going concern basis of accounting include the following:
• As at 31 December 2015, the group was operating within the £110 million revolving credit facility negotiated in December 
2014, and due to expire in 2019, and the US$100 million US private placement, completed in June 2014 and due to expire 
between 2021 and 2026, and related key covenants.
• Forecasts of profits and cash flow have been prepared which indicate that the group is expected to operate within its key 
covenants and funding facilities for the foreseeable future.
 
10. VIABILITY STATEMENT
In accordance with the Code, the directors have assessed the viability of the group over a three-year period, taking into 
account the group’s current position and the potential impact of the principal risks.
The group’s strategy is focused on long-term growth through revenue growth in developed and emerging markets, optimising 
the use of existing manufacturing assets and investment in new technology, and differentiation through product and process 
research and development. Whilst the directors have no reason to believe the group will not be viable over a longer period, 
given the inherent uncertainties involved and the higher level nature of longer-term forecasting, the directors have determined 
that a three-year period to 31 December 2018 constitutes an appropriate period over which to provide its viability statement. 
This three-year period aligns with the period focused on by the Board during the strategic planning process. 
In making this statement, the Board carried out a robust assessment of the principal risks facing the group, including those 
that would threaten its business model, future performance, solvency and liquidity. The group’s principal risks, and how these 
are managed, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 33, and the group’s capital and financial risk management 
policies and exposures are set out in Note 23 to the financial statements.
The three-year strategic plan is constructed on a “bottom up” basis and is reviewed by the Board annually. This process 
involves input from individual group operating companies and includes assumptions regarding expected sales volumes by 
region, production levels by manufacturing site and timing of the commencement of commercial production at the group’s 
two new manufacturing facilities in the USA and China. The plan is reviewed continuously throughout the year and is updated 
as circumstances evolve.
The output from this planning is used to perform central debt and headroom analysis, which includes a review of sensitivity to 
‘business as usual’ risks and also stress testing using ‘severe but plausible’ events. The analysis takes account of the availability 
and likely effectiveness of the further mitigation actions that could be taken to avoid or reduce the impact or occurrence of the 
identified risks or events.
Based on this assessment, the directors confirm that they have a reasonable expectation that the group will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities as they fall due over the period to 31 December 2018.  42

12.  STATEMENT ON COMPLIANCE
This statement, together with the Directors’ Remuneration Report set out on pages 45 to 58, and the Audit Committee report 
on pages 43 to 44, describes how, in respect of the year ended 31 December 2015, the company has applied the provisions 
and principles of corporate governance as set out in the 2014 edition of the Code. The company has complied with all the 
Code’s provisions throughout the period in question, with one exception. The company’s remuneration committee structure 
does not fully comply with Provision D.2.2, as the remuneration of the Chairman is set by the Non-Executive Directors’ 
Remuneration Committee comprising the Executive Directors instead of by a committee of Non-Executive Directors, as 
proposed by the Code. The company’s two-committee approach, which is more fully described and explained in the 
Remuneration Report, is designed to ensure that no director is involved in setting his or her own remuneration, thus avoiding 
any potential conflict of interest, while ensuring that the experience of the Chairman is available to the Executive Directors’ 
Remuneration Committee. The Board believes that this arrangement is an appropriate and effective use of the available 
resources and is fully aligned with the spirit of the Code.

Audit Committee Report
The Audit Committee (the “Committee”) has written terms of 
reference, which are available on the company’s website, and 
include the responsibilities set out in Provision C.3.2 of the Code.
Ms J A Lodge chaired the Committee throughout the period 
under review. The other members of the Committee 
throughout 2015 were Mr P A J Neep and Mr P N Withers.  
The Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Board views Ms J A Lodge as the Committee member 
with both recent and relevant financial expertise as stipulated 
in Provision C.3.1 of the Code.
In the course of the year there were four meetings, that  
were attended as required by the Group Finance Director, 
management and the Business Controls and Financial Analyst, 
as invitees. Representatives of the statutory auditors also 
attend as appropriate.
The Committee and the statutory auditors operate 
procedures to ensure that the auditors remain objective and 
independent. These procedures include the pre-approval of 
the scope of the audit by the Committee.
CHANGE OF STATUTORY AUDITORS
In view of the previous incumbent’s long period of tenure,  
and following emerging best practice, the Committee 
recommended that the audit contract be put out to tender  
in 2014. Following the conclusion of this process, KPMG LLP 
(“KPMG”) were formally appointed as the company’s 
statutory auditors at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.
STATUTORY AUDIT
KPMG conducted limited non-audit work for the company  
in 2015, generating £41,000 in fees. Details are shown on  
page 81. The ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees is 0.13:1.  
The Committee noted the relatively low level of non-audit 
work when reviewing the statutory auditors’ independence 
and concluded that, in view of the safeguards in place, this 
would not impinge upon their objectivity or independence.
Following completion of the 2015 audit, a number of 
processes were used to judge the perceived effectiveness  
of the statutory auditors:
• The Committee received a detailed audit plan from the 
statutory auditors at the beginning of the annual audit 
process which included an outline of the proposed scope 
of the audit, and identification of key audit risks and  
areas of focus. This was discussed and agreed with  
the Committee.
• The Committee challenged the work done by the statutory 
auditors to test management’s assumptions and estimates 
in relation to the significant issues.
• A survey was conducted of all businesses within the group 
to assess the effectiveness of the group and local statutory 
audit teams.
• At the completion of the statutory audit the Committee 
received feedback from the Group Finance Director on 
how effectively issues were addressed at the statutory 
audit clearance meetings.
Committee Chairman’s introduction
As Chairman of the Audit 
Committee, I am pleased to  
present the report in respect of 
2015. This report summarises the 
work of the Committee in the 
course of the year.

Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Directors’ Report
Audit Committee Report continued
Based on the above processes and feedback, and its own ongoing assessment of the statutory auditors’ performance (for 
example through consideration of the statutory auditors’ reports and interactions with the group audit partner) the Committee 
was satisfied with the independence, objectivity and overall effectiveness of the statutory auditors with regard to the 2015 
audit process.
SIGNIFICANT ISSUES
The significant issues considered by the Committee during 2015, and how these were addressed, are as follows:
Investment projects and exceptional items
During the course of 2015 there was significant further work undertaken in respect of the group’s two major investment 
projects to construct new manufacturing plants in the USA and China, which has caused some disruption to the ongoing 
operations of the group. These projects have generated a significant level of costs and judgement has been required by 
management to determine which costs should be expensed as incurred and which should be capitalised, particularly as the 
projects move towards completion which is expected during 2016 for both. Where costs have been expensed as incurred 
further judgement has also been required to determine whether these amounts should be disclosed as exceptional items, 
taking account of their nature and size, and, in particular, whether they are incremental to normal operations. In some cases 
the costs incurred during the year will actually be settled in future periods and a provision for the estimated liability is held on 
the balance sheet at the end of the year. The Committee has addressed these matters through reviewing and discussing 
reports from management outlining the nature and amount of the relevant costs, the amounts settled during the year for 
provisions held at the end of 2014, the estimates involved, and the proposed accounting treatments, in particular reviewing the 
disclosure of amounts as exceptional items, and the associated descriptions included in the financial statements. The external 
auditors have also carefully examined this area and have reported their assessment to the Committee.
Carrying value of inventory
The perishable nature of the group’s inventory holdings means it is appropriate to hold a provision for obsolescence based  
on age. The group will make additional specific provisions in response to any quality issues or damaged inventory that become 
apparent. The group’s two major investment projects also represent an significant change to the group’s supply chain.  
During the course of the year inventory levels have fallen compared to the end of 2014. The level of inventory provisions  
has also fallen, although due to the factors noted above the carrying value of inventory remains a significant issue. The 
Committee has assessed the judgements of management over the carrying value of inventory, both with respect to the 
continued appropriateness of the group’s accounting policy in providing for inventory obsolescence based on age, and for  
any additional specific provisions. The statutory auditors have also focused on this area and reported their findings to  
the Committee.
WHISTLEBLOWING PROCEDURE
The company’s whistleblowing procedures are also reviewed regularly. Following a decision by the Committee in 2013,  
a confidential, multi-language system, entitled ‘SpeakUp’, was set up and communicated to everyone in the group. The 
Committee believe that these arrangements will facilitate a proportionate and independent investigation of such matters. 
FAIR, BALANCED AND UNDERSTANDABLE
The Committee acknowledges that, taken as a whole, the Annual Report and Accounts should be fair, balanced and 
understandable. The Committee advises the Board on whether it believes that the Annual Report and Accounts meet this 
requirement. In order for the Committee to make this assessment, it considers reports from management received during  
the year, monitoring financial performance and at year end in support of the financial statements, and also reports from the 
statutory auditors on the findings of their annual audit. Formal review processes are in place to ensure that the Annual Report 
and Accounts are factually accurate.
The Committee also satisfies itself that the key messages in the narrative are consistent with the financial reporting, and that 
the Annual Report and Accounts as a whole are clear and understandable both in terms of the language used, and the layout 
and framework.
Following its review, the Committee was satisfied that the 2015 Annual Report and Accounts present a fair, balanced and 
understandable overview, including the necessary information for shareholders to assess the group’s position, performance, 
business model and strategy.
The responsibility statement of the directors in respect of the Annual Report and Accounts is on page 61.

Directors’ Remuneration Report 
OVERVIEW OF POLICY AND LINK TO  
OUR BUSINESS STRATEGY
The Committee sets the strategy, structure and levels of 
remuneration for the Executive Directors and reviews the 
remuneration of other members of senior management in  
the group generally. It does so in the context of the group’s 
overall strategy and performance to align the financial 
interests of the Executive Directors and other senior 
managers with the achievement of the group’s objectives,  
and with shareholder returns.
How we do this is set out in the policy table on pages 47 and 48.
The Committee believes that the policy, which was approved 
at the 2014 AGM, remains appropriate and should continue  
for 2016, and we have included it again for reference on pages 
47 to 51. The Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 52  
to 58 sets out how our policy was operated in 2015 and will  
be operated in the current year. The Annual Report on 
Remuneration will be subject to an advisory vote at the 
2016 AGM.
BASE SALARY
Our long-standing approach is for base salaries of Executive 
Directors to be around mid-market levels. In 2015, the 
Committee awarded both Executive Directors an increase  
of 2%, a little less than the average of other pay rises 
elsewhere in the group. 
For 2016, an increase of 1.5% will be made for the Chief 
Executive, effective from 1 April 2016. Again, this is consistent 
with average increases made for the group’s UK employees.
ANNUAL BONUS 
The Committee believes annual bonus targets should be 
challenging, clearly linked to the company’s strategy and 
performance, and designed to align the interests of executives 
and shareholders. 
In 2015, the bonus targets were largely focused on profit 
growth, but for the first time we introduced non-financial 
targets, accounting for a maximum of 20% of the award. 
These targets were designed to support delivery of key 
milestones in our strategy. The Committee made this change 
for 2015 recognising that the company is at a crucial point in 
its strategic development. The objectives included delivery  
of the two major capital projects underway in Nantong, China 
and South Carolina, USA, on which much of our strategic 
planning is based, and delivering the benefits of restructuring 
in Scotland and Australia, which was crucial to reversing the 
profit decline of the previous three years. The objectives were 
underpinned by a condition requiring underlying profit 
growth for the group in 2015. 
We also agreed that, for the purpose of the profit-focused 
metric in the annual bonus, we would restate the results using 
the exchange rates we adopted for our 2015 budget. The idea 
here is to strip out the vagaries of currency fluctuations. The 
Committee intends to use this approach going forward.
The Committee reviewed performance against these targets 
in February 2016. Full details are set out on pages 54 and 55.
Committee Chairman’s introduction
On behalf of the Board, I am 
pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for 2015.  
This report explains the group’s 
remuneration policy and provides 
details of the remuneration paid  
to Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors for services to the 
company during the year, as well  
as how our remuneration policy  
will be operated in 2016. 
Paul Neep, Chairman,
Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee 46
Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Directors’ Report
We have adopted a similar approach to the 2016 bonus metrics, provisional details of which are set out on page 52 of this report.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director received conditional awards under the Devro Performance Share Plan in 2013. 
The performance targets for these awards were partly based on EPS growth and partly on relative TSR measured across a 
three-year performance period ending on 31 December 2015. The Committee reviewed the performance of the group against 
these conditions in February 2016, and concluded that neither threshold had been met. As a result, the awards in question 
have lapsed. A full explanation of the performance metric is shown on page 55.
SIMON WEBB EXIT PACKAGE
In October 2015, the company agreed with Simon Webb, Group Finance Director, that he would leave the company in 2016. 
The Committee reviewed and agreed an exit package with Simon, in line with the shareholder-approved policy.
In respect of the Performance Share Plan (“PSP”), the Committee exercised its discretion in Simon’s favour: he will be treated 
as a “good leaver” and while his two outstanding awards will still be subject to the original performance conditions, they will 
not be pro-rated for time in post. The Committee believes this is a fair approach, taking account of the tough performance 
conditions pertaining to these awards. 
Simon was informed that it may be necessary for him to work his full 12 month notice period depending on the time required  
to identify a successor. The Committee agreed, given the difficulty of providing Simon with a likely leaving date, that if a 
successor was identified and he left before the notice period expired, the balance of his base salary would be paid as a lump 
sum. In the course of settlement discussions with Simon in October 2015, the Committee agreed that the non-financial targets 
in his 2015 Annual Bonus Plan would be deemed to be achieved in full.
The Committee accepts that discretion in these situations should be exercised judiciously and is satisfied that this settlement is 
fair, having regard to the overall quantum, and taking account of Simon’s performance and his flexibility on his departure date.
Details are shown on page 55.
RUTGER HELBING PACKAGE
Rutger Helbing, the new Group Finance Director, will take up the post on 4 April 2016. His base salary is consistent with that of 
the outgoing Group Finance Director and other elements of his package are in line with our shareholder-approved policy.
On joining, Rutger will receive a one-off additional award under the PSP, equivalent to 100% of salary, reflecting the fact that 
he forewent substantial unvested long-term incentive awards on leaving his former employer. Details are shown on page 52  
of this report.
SUMMARY
We continue to monitor our approach to remuneration to ensure it remains relevant and consistent both with our strategy and 
performance, and is aligned to shareholder value. I look forward to your support of the advisory vote on our 2015 Annual 
Report on Remuneration at the forthcoming AGM.

Policy report 
This part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report sets out the remuneration policy for the company directors, approved at  
the 2014 AGM. It has been prepared in accordance with The Large and Medium-sized Companies and groups (Accounts and 
Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the “Regulations”).
THE REMUNERATION POLICY
The company’s remuneration policy must enable it to attract and retain leaders with the skills, experience and drive to execute 
the company’s business strategy within a framework which is aligned to the interests of the company’s shareholders, for 
example, through the deferral of bonuses and the requirement to hold shares. The Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Committee (the “Committee”) believes that a significant proportion of Executive Directors’ remuneration should be 
performance related.
Each year, the Committee conducts a formal review of risk in the context of remuneration. A review of pay for other employees 
across the group, particularly salary increases, is also carried out each year when reviewing overall remuneration policy and 
this is taken into account when setting policy for the Executive Directors. No consultation process with employees was 
conducted in 2015 in respect of the directors’ remuneration policy.
The Committee welcomes dialogue with shareholders and consults with its major investors and investor bodies regarding 
changes to Executive Director remuneration policy. Any views and feedback on arrangements from our investors will be 
considered by the Committee as part of its annual review of directors’ remuneration.

NOTES TO THE POLICY TABLE
1. Annual Bonus Plan performance metrics
Performance measures, the weighting between them and stretching targets will be set at the start of each year by the 
Committee, based on the company’s financial KPIs and strategic priorities for the year and taking account of the business plan, 
budget for the year and market conditions. At least 80% will be based on relevant financial targets and up to 20% may be 
attributed to a relevant non-financial target. Together, these targets are intended to incentivise and reward shorter-term 
performance, consistent with the interests of the shareholders and the overall strategy of the company.
2. PSP metrics
The Committee selects performance measures for the PSP awards that are aimed at incentivising and rewarding performance 
over the medium term, aligned with the interests of the shareholders and consistent with the group strategy. For a 
comparative TSR measure, the targets are as set out in the policy table with the Committee selecting the most appropriate 
comparator group at the time awards are made. For EPS growth and any other relevant financial targets, the Committee will 
set stretching targets based on the company’s budget, business plan, and external economic environment at that time.
3. Deferred Share Bonus Plan
The Deferred Share Bonus Plan contains no additional performance conditions as any awards arise from an annual bonus 
which was itself subject to performance conditions.
4. Comparison with employees’ remuneration policy
The key differences between Executive Directors’ remuneration policy and that of employees generally is that, for the 
Executive Directors, there is significantly more weighting to variable performance-related pay. Variable pay is seen as more 
relevant for senior executives because of their greater ability to influence the overall performance of the company.
SHAREHOLDING GUIDELINES
To provide alignment between shareholders and directors, the Executive Directors are required to build up a holding of 100% 
of salary over time. Any shares vesting from share incentive plans must be retained (subject to sales to meet tax and incidental 
costs of sale) until the target is reached.
REMUNERATION AWARDED PRIOR TO THE EFFECTIVE DATE
For the avoidance of doubt, following approval of this Policy Report, authority was given to the company to honour any 
commitments entered into with current or former directors that have been disclosed to shareholders in previous remuneration 
reports including those share plan awards set out on page 57. Details of any payments to former directors will be set out in the 
Annual Report on Remuneration as they arise.
ANNUAL BONUS PLAN AND PSP POLICY
The Committee will operate the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP according to the rules of each respective plan and consistent  
with normal market practice and the Listing Rules of the London Stock Exchange, including flexibility in a number of aspects. 
How the Committee will retain flexibility includes (albeit with quantum and performance targets restricted to the descriptions 
detailed above):
• Who participates in the plans.
• When to make awards and payments.
• How to determine the size of an award, a payment, or when and how much of an award should vest.
• How to deal with a change of control or restructuring of the group.
• Whether a director is a “good/bad” leaver for incentive plan purposes and whether and what proportion of awards vest  
at the time of leaving or at the original vesting date(s).
• How and whether an award may be adjusted in certain circumstances (e.g. for a rights issue, a corporate restructuring or  
for special dividends).
• What the weighting, measures and targets should be for the Annual Bonus Plan and PSP from year to year.
The Committee also retains the discretion within the policy to adjust targets and/or set different measures and alter weightings 
for the Annual Bonus Plan and to adjust targets for the PSP if events happen that cause it to determine that the metrics are 
unable to fulfil their originally intended purpose, provided the new metrics are not materially less difficult to satisfy. Any 
adjustments will be fully disclosed in the following year’s Annual Report on Remuneration.
All historic awards that were granted under any current or previous share schemes operated by the company but remain 
outstanding, detailed on pages 57 and 58, remain eligible to vest based on their original award terms. 50

PAYMENT UNDER DIFFERENT SCENARIOS
Under the Regulations, we are required to show a bar-chart indicating the level of remuneration which would be received by 
the Executive Directors in 2016 under different scenarios. Three scenarios are shown below:
• “Fixed pay” is based on salary, benefits and pension contributions;
• “Target pay” is fixed pay, plus 50% of the maximum of variable pay; and
• “Maximum pay” is fixed pay, plus the maximum of variable pay.
The Group Finance Director bar-chart is based on the annualised pay of the new Director, who will start on 4 April 2016, 
assuming the normal level of long-term incentive awards (i.e. 100%) per the remuneration policy.

SERVICE AGREEMENTS AND PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE OF EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
It is the company’s policy that Executive Directors should have contracts with an indefinite term, which are subject to one 
year’s notice by the company and the director. In the event of early termination (including following a change of control in the 
company), the directors’ contracts provide for compensation in line with their contractual notice period. In summary, the 
contractual provisions are as follows:
Provision Detailed terms
Notice period 12 months by the company, 12 months by the director
Termination payment There is no provision for specific payment. If any existing contract is breached by the company, 
it would be liable to pay, as damages, an amount approximating to the net loss of salary and 
contractual benefits for the unexpired notice period, subject to mitigation and phased 
payments where appropriate. Any statutory amounts would be paid as necessary. 
Remuneration entitlements Pro-rata bonus may also become payable for the period of active service along with vesting for 
outstanding share awards (in certain circumstances – see below). 
In all cases performance targets would apply. 
Change of control No Executive Director’s contract contains additional provisions in respect of change of control. 
Any share-based entitlements granted to an Executive Director under the company’s share plans will be determined based on 
the relevant plan rules. The default treatment under the PSP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, in certain prescribed circumstances, such as death, ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement or other 
circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, “good leaver” status may be applied. For good leavers, awards will normally 
vest on cessation, or on the original vesting date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance conditions at that 
time and reduced pro-rata to reflect the proportion of the three-year period actually served. However, the Committee has 
discretion to determine that awards vest at a later date and/or to disapply time pro-rating.
The default treatment under the 2009 Deferred Share Bonus Plan is that any awards lapse on cessation of employment. 
However, good leavers are entitled to retain their awards, and to vest after leaving, subject to the rules of the Plan.

RECRUITMENT AND PROMOTION POLICY FOR DIRECTORS
The remuneration package for a new Executive Director would be set in accordance with the terms of the company’s prevailing 
approved remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into account the skills and experience of the individual, the 
market rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as is required to attract the most appropriate candidate. It may be set initially at a 
below mid-market level on the basis that it may progress towards the mid-market level once expertise and performance has 
been proven and sustained. The annual bonus potential would be limited to 100% of salary, and conditional awards under the 
Devro plc Performance Share Plan may be up to the Plan maximum of 150% of salary or 200% on recruitment in exceptional 
circumstances. In addition, the Committee may offer additional cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or 
incentive pay forfeited by an executive leaving a previous employer. It would seek to ensure, where possible, that these awards 
would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal Executive Director appointment, any variable pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be allowed 
to pay out according to its terms, adjusted as relevant to take into account the appointment. In addition, any other ongoing 
remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment may continue. For external and internal appointments, the Committee 
may agree that the company will meet certain relocation and other incidental expenses as appropriate.
If appropriate, the Committee may agree on the recruitment of a new executive to a notice period in excess of 12 months but  
to reduce to 12 months over a specified period.
The fees for a new Chairman or Non-Executive Director will be reflective of experience, time commitment, responsibility and 
scope of the role and will be consistent with the approved remuneration policy at the time.
CHAIRMAN AND NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS
The Non-Executive Directors are engaged for fixed terms, with no notice period, with an entitlement to accrued fees and 
expenses only up to the date of termination. These appointments are subject to the company’s Articles of Association.
All directors submit themselves for re-election at the Annual General Meeting in accordance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The dates of the initial letters of appointment for the Non-Executive Directors are as follows:

How the policy will be implemented in 2016:
EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ SALARIES
Current salaries for Executive Directors at the date of this report are as follows:
Chief Executive: £460,918
Group Finance Director: £297,147
From 1 April 2016 the Chief Executive’s salary will be increased by 1.5% as follows: 
Chief Executive: £467,832
The new Group Finance Director will join on 4 April 2016 at a salary of £305,000.
NON-EXECUTIVE DIRECTORS’ FEES
The fees for Non-Executive Directors in 2016 are as follows:
Name
Base annual  
remuneration
Additional for  
committee chairmanships
Total annual  
remuneration
G J Hoetmer £132,000 N/A £132,000

P N Withers £42,500 £5,000 £47,500
J A Lodge £42,500 £5,000 £47,500
ANNUAL BONUS
For 2016, 80% of the annual bonus for the Chief Executive and our new Group Finance Director will be determined by growth 
in group operating profit and 20% by non-financial strategic targets. The Group Finance Director’s bonus will be pro-rated for 
2016 to reflect actual service as a proportion of the year. The non-financial targets are linked to key milestones in our strategy, 
including the delivery of the two major investment projects underway in Nantong, China and South Carolina, USA. They are 
underpinned by a condition requiring underlying profit growth in 2016.
Mr S C Webb will receive a pro-rated bonus for his actual service determined by the group operating profit targets only. 
When reviewing the profit performance condition for 2016, the Committee will again look at operating profit before 
exceptional items and will restate the actual figures using the budgeted exchange rates in order to strip out the effect of 
currency fluctuations, which are, in the main, outside of the control and performance of management.
The Board considers that the actual targets for the 2016 bonus are commercially sensitive, but full details will be disclosed  
in the 2016 report.
 
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
Awards will be made in 2016 to the Chief Executive to the extent of 110% of base salary; and to the newly-appointed Group 
Finance Director to the extent of 200% of base salary. As explained in the Committee Chairman’s letter on page 46, and in  
line with the policy, the additional 100% award to the new Group Finance Director reflects the fact that he will lose significant 
long-term incentive awards when he leaves his current employer. The performance measures for these awards will be reviewed 
by the Committee when the awards are made.
PENSION AND OTHER BENEFITS
The pension and benefits arrangements are as set out in the policy table above.
EXTERNAL APPOINTMENTS
None of our Executive Directors has any external paid directorships. Executive Directors are permitted to accept external 
board or committee appointments provided they do not interfere with the Executive Directors’ obligations to the company. 
The Board will decide at the time of appointment whether an Executive Director may retain the fees for such appointments.
THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEES
The members of the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) throughout 2015 were Mr P A J Neep 
(Committee Chairman), Mr G J Hoetmer, Ms J A Lodge and Mr P N Withers. 
Directors’ Remuneration Report continued 53
Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report Shareholder Information
The Committee received advice from:
• The Company Secretary (as Secretary to the Committee) and the Chief Executive.
• New Bridge Street (a trading name of Aon Hewitt Limited being a group company of Aon plc) as independent adviser to  
the Committee. New Bridge Street were appointed as advisers by the Committee in view of their expertise in this area.
No director is involved in any part of a meeting of the Committee when their individual remuneration or contractual terms  
are being decided.
The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman is set by the Non-Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Committee, whose members in 2015 were Mr P W B Page and Mr S C Webb. The two-committee approach ensures that no 
director is involved in setting his or her own remuneration.
ADVISERS TO THE COMMITTEE
New Bridge Street is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ Code of Conduct and has confirmed to the Committee that 
it adheres in all respects to the terms of the Code. The Committee has satisfied itself that advice from New Bridge Street is 
objective. As disclosed on page 34, Mr G J Hoetmer is Chairman of the supervisory board of Aon Groep Nederland B.V. While 
that company and New Bridge Street are both part of the Aon plc group, the Committee has been advised that the two are 
operated independently from each other, and therefore is satisfied that the relationship does not impinge on the objectivity or 
independence of the advice provided by New Bridge Street. The total fees paid to New Bridge Street for the advice provided 
to the Committee during the year were £21,320. Fees are charged on a ‘time spent’ basis. Neither New Bridge Street, nor any 
other company in the Aon Group, has provided any other services to the company during the year.
STATEMENT OF SHAREHOLDING VOTING AT AGM

ENGAGEMENT WITH INVESTORS
The Committee understands the need to engage with major investors when considering significant changes to remuneration 
policy. In view of the support for the remuneration report at the AGM, and considering no change to the remuneration policy 
was required, this was not deemed necessary in 2015. The Chairman of the Committee is always available to talk to investors 
should they have any concerns.

Summary of 2015 annual bonus
Under the remuneration policy, any bonus above 50% is deferred into shares, using the Devro 2009 Deferred Share Bonus 
Plan, as shown in the table below:
Director
Cash bonus Deferred bonus Total bonus
% of salary £’000 % of salary £’000 % of salary £’000

The notional Group Operating Profit figure for the purpose of the bonus calculation and the resulting level of vesting is shown 
in the table at the foot of page 54. The Committee agreed for the first time in 2015 that for 2015 and future years, for the 
purposes of the bonus calculation, currency exchange rate fluctuations would be excluded. It did this by agreeing at the outset 
that the Group Operating Profit would be re-stated using the company’s budgeted exchange rates for the various currencies  
in which the group trades.
The non-financial targets in the 2015 Annual Bonus Plan were focused on out-performance milestones on the two major  
capital projects underway – the factory builds in the USA and China – and the delivery of cost-savings from restructurings in 
Scotland and Australia. Of the five separate targets, the Committee judged that, while two had been met, three were not fully 
completed. Under the rules of the Plan, this resulted in no pay-out under this heading, as shown in the table on page 54, but 
note the arrangement for Mr S C Webb explained below.
LEAVING ARRANGEMENTS FOR MR S C WEBB
Mr S C Webb has a 12 month notice period and the company will make a payment in respect of his unexpired notice period as 
at the date his employment terminates in late March 2016.
Mr S C Webb will be entitled to receive an annual bonus payment in respect of 2016. This bonus will be calculated by reference 
to the applicable financial performance targets and will be reduced on a pro rata basis to reflect his departure date. Any bonus 
will be paid in 2017.
All unvested awards made to Mr S C Webb under the company’s PSP will vest, subject to performance, at their normal vesting 
date, in accordance with the “good leaver” provisions of the PSP.
As explained in the Committee Chairman’s letter on page 46, in October 2015 the Committee agreed in the course of 
settlement discussions, that Mr S C Webb would receive the full bonus in respect of the non-financial targets in his 2015 Annual 
Bonus. This results in the bonus shown in the table above.
THE DEVRO PLC PERFORMANCE SHARE PLAN
The three-year performance period for the awards under the Devro plc Performance Share Plan made to Mr P W B Page and 
Mr S C Webb on 12 September 2013 ended on 31 December 2015. The performance conditions which applied, and performance

1. These shares lapsed following a review of the relevant performance conditions by the Committee in February 2016.
Conditional nil-priced options under the Devro plc Performance Share Plan are considered annually, with earliest vesting 
occurring generally after three years and normally being dependent on both continued employment with the group and the 
extent to which the performance conditions set out below are met. Vesting of 50% of shares awarded is based upon the 
group’s Earnings Per Share before exceptional items (“EPS”) growth over the relevant performance period, with the other  
50% being dependent upon the group’s Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) performance measured over the same period 
against the 100 listed companies (excluding Investment Trusts) closest to the company in terms of market capitalisation  
(i.e. 50 higher and 50 lower).
The awards made since 2013, including the year under review, were granted as nil-priced options subject to the performance 
conditions below.

At the same AGM, shareholders granted the company authority to make market purchases of up to 16,600,000 of its issued

termination rights for those banks upon a change of control of the company.
The company does not have agreements with any director or employee that would provide compensation for loss of office or

approval of the items of business which are explained in the notes on pages 120 to 123.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO STATUTORY AUDITORS
So far as each person who is a director at the date of approval of this Annual Report is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the auditors are unaware. Each of the directors has taken all the steps that he or she ought to have taken 
as a director in order to make him or herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the company’s 
statutory auditors are aware of that information.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors have 
prepared the group and company financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) 
as adopted by the European Union. Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they 
are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the company and the group and of the profit or loss of 
the group for that period. In preparing these financial statements, the directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain the company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the company and the group and enable 
them to ensure that the financial statements and the directors’ remuneration report comply with the Act and, as regards the 
group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the company 
and the group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of corporate and financial information published on the 
company’s website (www.devro.com). Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 62

DIRECTORS’ STATEMENT PURSUANT TO THE DISCLOSURE AND TRANSPARENCY RULE 4.1
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on pages 34 and 35, confirms that, to the best of his or her 
knowledge and belief:
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, give a true and fair view of 
the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the company and of the group included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole; and
• the management report required by DTR4.1.8R (set out in the Strategic Report and this Directors’ Report) includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the company and group included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
In addition, each of the directors considers that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and understandable  
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess the company’s position, performance, business model  
and strategy.

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2015
Devro plc (“the company”) and its subsidiaries (“the group”) is one of the world’s leading manufacturers of collagen products 
for the food industry. The company is a public limited company, which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is 
incorporated and domiciled in Scotland. The address of its registered office is Moodiesburn, Chryston, Glasgow G69 0JE.
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of these consolidated and individual company financial statements 
are set out below. These policies have been consistently applied to the years presented, unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
These consolidated and individual company financial statements have both been prepared in accordance with European  
Union endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”), IFRS IC interpretations and the Companies Act 2006 
applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, under 
the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments and pension scheme assets.
The group’s reporting currency is sterling and unless otherwise stated the financial statements are rounded to the nearest 
£0.1 million.
Going concern
The group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set 
out in the Strategic Report on pages 2 to 33, along with the financial position of the group, its debt levels and borrowing facilities.
In addition, note 23 includes the group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a reasonable expectation that the company and the 
group have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue  
to adopt the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial statements.
Key factors to support the going concern basis of accounting include the following:
• As at 31 December 2015 the group was operating within the £110m revolving bank facility negotiated in December 2014 and 
due to expire in December 2019, and US$100m US private placement, completed in June 2014 and due to expire between 
2021 and 2026.
• Forecast of profits and cash flows have been prepared which indicate that the group is expected to operate within its key 
covenants and funding facilities for the foreseeable future.
Critical estimates and judgements
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRSs requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and 
expenses during the reporting year. Although these estimates are based on management’s best assessments of amounts, 
events or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates. The key uncertainties that have a significant risk of 
causing material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are the accounting 
for the group’s investment projects and carrying value of inventory. 
Investment projects
The group’s two major investment projects, to construct new manufacturing plants in the USA and China require judgement 
including whether related costs should be expensed as incurred or capitalised, and whether any existing assets should be 
impaired or their useful lives amended. The new plant in the USA involves elements which will be implemented over a number 
of months or longer, including redundancy programmes and decommissioning of equipment. Provisions are made when the 
obligation arises and judgement is applied relating to the timing of recognition of provisions and the estimation of the amount 
of the provision. Where amounts are expensed, judgement is also required to determine whether these amounts should be 
disclosed as exceptional items, taking account of their nature and size, and in particular whether they are incremental to 
normal operations. An analysis of exceptional items recognised is included in notes 3 and 4. Details of provisions are included 
in note 21.
Carrying value of inventory
Determining the carrying value of inventory involves a degree of judgement as to whether the group will be able to sell the 
inventory it has on hand for more than the value recorded in the balance sheet, which is typically the cost of production. The 
group adopts a policy of providing for inventory when it reaches a certain age, and also for any inventory where there are 
specific concerns. These estimated provisions are based on management’s best assessments of future sales volumes and the 
likely selling prices, and actual results may differ from these estimates.  70

1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Critical estimates and judgements continued
Although not considered significant issues the following are considered to be other key areas of judgement and estimation:
Pension obligations
The cost of defined benefit pension schemes is determined using actuarial valuations. The actuarial valuation involves certain 
key assumptions and complex calculations. The key assumptions include discount rates, expected rates of return on assets, 
future salary increases, mortality rates and future pension increases. Due to the long-term nature of these schemes, such 
estimates are subject to uncertainty. An analysis of the sensitivity of the pension obligation to changes in key assumptions is 
provided based on movements in key variables that could reasonably occur. Further details are provided in note 25.
Tax
The group’s tax charge is based on the profit for the year and tax rates effective at the balance sheet date. In addition to 
corporation tax, the group is subject to indirect taxes such as sales and employment taxes across the tax jurisdictions in the 
countries in which it operates. The varying nature and complexity of these tax laws requires the group to review its tax 
positions and make appropriate adjustments at the balance sheet date. In addition the recognition of deferred tax assets is 
dependent upon an estimation of future taxable profits that will be available against which deductible temporary differences 
can be utilised. In the event that actual taxable profits are different, such differences may impact the carrying value of such 
deferred tax assets in future years. Further details are provided in notes 9 and 24.
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures 
(a) New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations effective in 2015
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations became mandatory for the first time during the 
financial year beginning 1 January 2015. All were either not relevant for the group or had no material impact on the financial 
statements of the group:
 Effective date
• IAS 19 (amendment) – Employee benefits 1 January 2015
• Annual improvements 2012 1 January 2015
• Annual improvements 2013 1 January 2015
(b) New standards, amendments to standards and interpretations not applied
At the date of approval of these financial statements, the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations 
were in issue but have not been applied in these financial statements:
 Effective date
• IFRS 9 – Financial instruments 1 January 2018
• IFRS 10 (amendment) – Consolidated financial statements 1 January 2016
• IFRS 11 (amendment) – Joint arrangements 1 January 2016
• IFRS 12 (amendment) – Disclosure of interests in other entities 1 January 2016
• IFRS 14 – Regulatory deferral accounts 1 January 2016
• IFRS 15 – Revenue from contracts with customers 1 January 2018
• IFRS 16 – Leases 1 January 2019
• IAS 1 (amendment) – Presentation of financial statements 1 January 2016
• IAS 12 (amendment) – Income taxes  1 January 2016
• IAS 16 (amendment) – Property, plant and equipment  1 January 2016
• IAS 27 (amendment) – Separate financial statements 1 January 2016
• IAS 28 (amendment) – Investments in associates 1 January 2016
• IAS 38 (amendment) – Intangible assets 1 January 2016
• Annual improvements 2014 1 January 2016
It is expected that the group will adopt these amendments to standards on their effective dates. The directors do not 
anticipate that the adoption of these amendments to standards will have a material impact on the financial statements of  
the group, apart from that IFRS 9 will impact both the measurement and disclosures of financial instruments.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of the company and all its subsidiary undertakings 
made up to 31 December 2015. Intra-group sales and profits are eliminated fully on consolidation. The purchase method  
of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings by the group. The results of subsidiary 
undertakings acquired or disposed of are consolidated for the period from or to the date on which control passed. Uniform 
accounting policies are applied across the group.
The subsidiaries are entities over which the group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies. The cost of 
acquisition is measured as the fair value of assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred. Any identifiable 
assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured at their fair values  
at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-controlling interest. Any unrealised losses are also eliminated 
unless the transaction provides evidence of an impairment of the asset transferred.
Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2015 continued 71
Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report Shareholder Information
Business combinations
Acquisitions of subsidiaries and businesses are accounted for using the purchase method. The consideration transferred in  
a business combination is measured at fair value, which is calculated as the sum of the acquisition-date fair values of assets 
transferred by the group and liabilities incurred by the group to the former owners of the acquiree in exchange for control  
of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. 
At the acquisition date, the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value. 
Goodwill is measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred over the net of the acquisition-date amounts  
of the identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed. 
When the consideration transferred by the group in a business combination includes assets or liabilities resulting from a contingent 
consideration arrangement, the contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the 
consideration transferred in a business combination. Changes in fair value of the contingent consideration that qualify as 
measurement period adjustments are adjusted retrospectively, with corresponding adjustments against goodwill. Measurement 
period adjustments are adjustments that arise from additional information obtained during the measurement period’ (which 
cannot exceed one year from the acquisition date) about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. 
Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or a liability is remeasured at subsequent reporting dates at fair value 
with the corresponding gain or loss being recognised in profit or loss. 
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially recognised and measured as set out above. 
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill  
is allocated to each of the group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-
generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is  
an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying 
amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit 
and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. 
On disposal of a cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss 
on disposal.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately that meet the recognition criteria of IAS 38 Intangible Assets, are capitalised at cost  
and when acquired in a business combination are capitalised at fair value at the date of acquisition. Cost includes the original 
purchase price of the asset and the costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for its intended use. 
Following initial recognition, finite life assets are amortised on a straight-line basis and indefinite life assets are not amortised. 
Finite life intangible assets have a residual value of £nil and are amortised over their estimated useful lives as follows:
Computer software 4-5 years
Development costs 15 years
Customer contracts and relationships 12 years
Costs associated with developing or maintaining computer software programmes are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Costs incurred on development projects are recognised as intangible assets when it is probable that the project will be a 
success, considering its commercial and technological feasibility, and costs can be measured reliably. External and internal 
costs are capitalised to the extent that they enhance the future economic benefit of the asset.
Intangible assets with indefinite lives are tested annually for impairment. The useful lives of finite life intangible assets are 
examined on an annual basis and adjustments, where applicable, are made on a prospective basis. Finite life assets are 
reviewed for impairment where indicators of impairment exist.
The group’s only indefinite life intangible asset is goodwill.
Research and development
In general, research and development expenditure is charged to the income statement in the year in which it occurred. 
However, as set out above, under certain conditions development expenditure is capitalised as an intangible asset. 72

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2015 continued
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. The cost of property, plant and equipment is  
its purchase cost, together with any incidental costs of acquisition and directly attributable costs. Provision for depreciation is 
made so as to write off the costs of the assets on a straight-line basis over their expected useful economic lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 50 years
Plant and machinery 8-15 years
Computer equipment 4-5 years
Motor vehicles 4 years
Fixtures and fittings 10 years
No depreciation is provided on freehold land or on assets under construction.
Assets under construction are transferred to the appropriate asset category when they come into use. Depreciation on assets 
so transferred is provided with effect from the month following the date of transfer.
Asset residual values and useful lives are reviewed and adjusted, if appropriate, at each balance sheet date, or more frequently 
if there have been indications of any significant change in either.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the proceeds with carrying amounts and are recognised within 
other operating income or expense in the income statement. 
Repairs and maintenance costs are charged to the income statement during the year in which they are incurred.
Impairment of non-financial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested for impairment annually or whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. Assets that are subject to 
depreciation or amortisation are tested for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement for the amount by which 
the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less 
costs to sell and its value in use. 
Grants
Grants relating to property, plant and equipment are included in current and non-current liabilities as appropriate and credited 
to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the expected useful lives of the related assets.
Grants relating to costs are deferred and recognised in the income statement over the period necessary to match them with 
the costs they are intended to compensate.
Fixed asset investments
The company’s investments in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating 
leases. Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on a first in, first out basis and includes 
transport and handling costs. In the case of manufactured products, cost includes all direct expenditure and production 
overheads based on the normal level of activity. Net realisable value is the price at which inventories can be sold in the normal 
course of business after allowing for the costs of realisation and, where appropriate, the cost of conversion from their existing 
state to a finished condition. Provision is made, where appropriate, for obsolete, slow-moving and defective inventories.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised 
cost, less provision for estimated irrecoverable amounts. Estimated irrecoverable amounts are based on historical experience, 
together with specific amounts that are not expected to be collectible. The amount of the provision is the difference between 
the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the effective interest rate. 
Individual trade receivables are written off when management deems them not to be collectible. 73
Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report Shareholder Information
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and short-term deposits with maturity dates of less than three months which 
are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value. For the purposes of the 
cash flow statement, net cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and cash equivalents net of bank overdrafts. 
Offsetting of financial assets and liabilities
Financial assets and liabilities are offset and the net amount presented in the balance sheet when, and only when, the group 
has a legally enforceable right to offset the amounts and intends either to settle them on a net basis or to realise the asset and 
settle the liability simultaneously.
Impairment of non-derivative financial assets
Financial assets, other than those held at fair value through profit or loss, are assessed for indicators of impairment at each 
balance sheet date. Financial assets are impaired where there is objective evidence of impairment which could include 
significant financial difficulty for the issuer or counterparty or observable data indicating there is a measurable decrease  
in the cash flows expected from a group of financial assets.
Foreign currencies
Items included in the financial statements of each of the group’s subsidiary undertakings are measured using the currency  
of the primary economic environment in which the entity operates (“the functional currency”). The consolidated financial 
statements are presented in sterling, which is the company’s functional and presentation currency. 
Foreign currency transactions in each entity are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing  
at the dates of the transactions or valuation where items are re-measured. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in other comprehensive 
income as qualifying cash flow hedges. 
Other gains and losses arising from foreign currency transactions are included in the income statement.
The trading results of foreign currency denominated subsidiaries are translated into sterling, the presentation currency of  
the group and functional currency of the parent, using average rates of exchange for the year. The balance sheets of foreign 
currency denominated subsidiaries are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the year end and exchange 
differences arising are taken directly to the translation reserve in equity. On disposal of a foreign denominated subsidiary, the 
deferred cumulative amount recognised in the translation reserve (since 1 January 2004 under the transitional rules of IFRS 1) 
relating to that entity is recognised in the income statement. All other translation differences are taken to the income 
statement, with the exception of differences on foreign currency borrowings and forward foreign currency contracts which are 
used to provide a hedge against the group’s net investments in foreign enterprises. These are taken directly to equity or other 
comprehensive income until the disposal of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the income statement. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received or receivable for the sale of goods in the ordinary course of the 
group’s activities. Sales revenue, which is net of returns, rebates and discounts, and which excludes value added tax and sales 
between group companies, represents the net invoiced value of goods supplied and is recognised when the goods have either  
been delivered to or collected by the customer and the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have been transferred to them. 
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
Dividend income is recognised by the company when payment is made by subsidiary undertakings.
Tax
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowable.  
It is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax base of assets  
and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax is determined using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when the related asset is realised or  
the liability is settled. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged  
or credited directly to equity or other comprehensive income, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with within equity  
or other comprehensive income.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised. 74
Devro plc 
Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial Statements
1. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
Tax continued
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except for deferred tax liabilities 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either 
the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the balances on a net basis.
Pensions 
The group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. All defined benefit pension plans are 
now closed to new entrants.
Payments to defined contribution pension plans are charged as an expense as they fall due.
The group’s obligations in respect of defined benefit pension plans are valued by independent actuaries using the projected 
unit credit method. All group plans are funded externally, with the exception of Germany, where, in line with local practice, 
obligations are supported by insurance policies. Plan assets are valued at fair market value and are held completely separate 
from the group’s assets. Full formal actuarial valuations of obligations are carried out at frequencies of not more than three 
years and are updated regularly for reporting purposes. 
Amounts recorded in the balance sheet represent the fair value of external plan assets less the present value of the defined 
benefit obligations. 
Amounts recorded in the income statement represent the current service cost over the reporting year, which is included in 
operating profit, and net finance income or cost , i.e. interest income on assets less interest cost on liabilities calculated using  
the discount rate, which is included as a separate component of finance income and cost. Other income statement credits or 
charges can arise for special events, such as a past service benefit improvement or settlement and curtailment of plan liabilities.
Re-measurements of the net defined benefit liabilities which comprise actuarial gains and losses, the gains or losses on plan 
assets excluding interest, and the effect of the asset ceiling (if any) are recognised immediately in other comprehensive 
income. Actuarial gains and losses on liabilities occur due to changes in actuarial assumptions at the balance sheet date  
and also due to any differences between assumptions and actual outcomes. Gains and losses on plan assets represent the 
difference between interest income over the year, and the actual return achieved. 
Share schemes
The group operates a number of equity-settled share-based incentive plans as consideration for services received from 
employees. The fair value of services received in exchange for the grant of share awards is recognised as an expense with  
the total amount to be expensed being determined by reference to the fair value of the awards granted. The fair value of  
the awards includes any market performance conditions, but excludes the impact of any service or non-market performance 
vesting conditions and is reduced by any consideration received from employees. Any non-market performance or service 
conditions are included in assumptions over the number of awards expected to vest, and the total expense is recognised over 
the full vesting period in the income statement with a corresponding credit made to equity. At the end of each year the group 
revises its estimates of the number of awards expected to vest based on non-market vesting conditions and recognises the 
impact of any revision in the income statement, with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
The social security contributions payable on share awards granted is recognised in the income statement over the vesting 
period and is treated as a cash-settled transaction.
Dividends payable
The liability for final dividends is recorded when the dividends are approved by the company’s shareholders. Interim dividends 
are recorded when paid.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transactions costs incurred, and subsequently re-measured at fair value 
where associated risks are hedged by derivative financial instruments. Un-hedged borrowings are subsequently carried at 
amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in  
the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest method. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense in the year in which they are incurred, except where they are directly attributable to 
the acquisition, construction or production of a qualifying asset, in which case they are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset.

Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective  
interest method.
Provisions for other liabilities and charges
Provisions are recognised when the group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is 
probable that the group will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the 
obligation. The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present 
obligation at the balance sheet date, with the present value of estimated cash flows used if the effect of the time value of 
money is material.
Restructuring provisions are recognised when the group has a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has either started 
implementing the plan or announced its main features to those affected by it. The measurement of the obligation comprises 
costs which are directly related to the restructuring.
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments used to hedge risks associated with interest rate and foreign currency fluctuations are initially 
and subsequently re-measured at fair value.
The fair values of forward exchange contracts are calculated by reference to market forward rates at the balance sheet date. 
The fair values of interest rate swap contracts are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using market forward rates.
Gains or losses arising from the movement to fair value are taken to the income statement except where the derivative is 
designated as a cash flow hedge or net investment hedge. 
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the group is required to document in advance the relationship between the item 
being hedged and the hedging instrument, and demonstrate that the hedge will be highly effective on an ongoing basis.  
This effectiveness testing is re-performed at each reporting date to ensure that the hedge remains highly effective.
Cash flow hedges
The group has designated forward foreign exchange contracts and the interest rate differential of cross-currency interest rate 
swaps as cash flow hedges.
For cash flow hedges, the effective part of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive 
income. Gains or losses relating to any ineffective part of changes in fair value are taken immediately to the income statement. 
Amounts accumulated in equity are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the hedged transaction occurs, 
for example, when the forecast sale or purchase transaction takes place. 
Any movements in fair value occurring after the time when hedging contracts cease to be cash flow hedges are taken directly 
to the income statement. 
Fair value hedges
The group has designated the exchange element of cross-currency interest rate swaps as fair value hedges. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives that are designated and qualify as fair value hedges are recognised in the income 
statement immediately, together with any changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability that are attributable to the 
hedged risk. The fair value adjustment to the carrying amount of the hedged risk is amortised in the income statement from 
the time the hedging contracts cease to be fair value hedges.
Net investment hedges
Hedges of net investments in foreign operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Gains or losses on the 
hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in other comprehensive income. Gains or 
losses relating to any ineffective portion are taken immediately to the income statement. Amounts accumulated in equity are 
transferred to the income statement when the foreign operation is partially disposed of or sold. 
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-
maker. The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Board, which is responsible for allocating resources and 
assessing the performance of the operating segments. 
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those significant items which are incremental to normal operations and are separately disclosed by 
virtue of their nature or size to enable a better understanding of the group’s underlying financial performance. 76

2. SEGMENT INFORMATION
The chief operating decision-maker has been identified as the Board. The Board reviews the group’s financial results on a 
geographical segment basis with three identifiable operating segments:
• Americas: which includes North America and Latin America.
• Asia-Pacific: which includes Australia, New Zealand, Japan, China and the rest of South East Asia.
• Europe: which includes Continental Europe, UK, Ireland and Africa.
The Board assesses the performance of the operating segments based on operating profit. This measurement basis excludes 
the effects of exceptional income and expenditure from the operating segments. The Board assesses the operating segments 
based on group profit for external sales in each region, rather than statutory profit for the region which also includes profit on 
intercompany sales.
Finance income and cost, and net finance cost on pensions, are not included in the segment results that are reviewed by the Board.
Segment assets exclude tax assets, which are managed on a central basis.
Segment liabilities exclude tax liabilities and non-current borrowings, which are managed on a central basis. 
Information provided to the Board is consistent with that in the financial statements.

(0.3) 16.9
Total exceptional items 14.1 23.9
Exceptional items comprise incremental costs that are directly related to the actions being taken to transform the business. 
During 2015 this principally comprises the two investment projects to establish new plants in the USA and China. Over the 
course of 2014 exceptional costs were also incurred in relation to the significant restructuring of existing operations, 
particularly in Scotland and Australia. The restructuring of operations in Scotland involved older, less efficient lines being 
permanently shut down and the restructuring in Australia related to the closure of the hide preparation plant. 
(i)   During 2015 costs have been incurred in the USA where the completion of the new plant will require significantly fewer 
operators compared with the existing less efficient operation. The redundancy programme was initially announced during 
2014. During the year an extension to the programme was announced resulting in further redundancy costs and retention 
payments. Redundancy costs in 2014 principally related to the restructuring of operations in Scotland, where 130 roles 
were impacted, and the outsourcing of hide preparation operations in Australia.
(ii)   Costs incurred related to training staff prior to the commencement of production, in the use of the group’s latest 
technology that will be used in the new manufacturing facilities.
(iii)  Costs related to the projects to establish new manufacturing plants in the USA and China, including project management, 
legal and professional fees, and other incremental costs incurred prior to the commencement of commercial production that 
are not eligible for capitalisation. The increased costs during 2015 are a reflection of the more advanced stages of the projects.
(iv)  Accelerated depreciation charge incurred on assets that will be replaced earlier than their previously estimated useful 
economic lives due to the group’s planned investment in the new USA plant. The 2014 charge also included amounts 
related to the restructuring actions in Scotland and Australia. 
(v)   Estimate of the costs that will be incurred to ensure the affected sites are made safe and that food hygiene and 
environmental standards are maintained, for which a constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date. During 2014 
an estimate was made relating to the removal of equipment that would no longer be used once the restructuring was 
complete in Scotland and Australia, and the new manufacturing plant is operational in the USA. Some costs have been 
settled during 2015 with the remainder expected to be settled over the next two years. The cost/(credit) recognised in 
2015 reflects the latest estimate of the ultimate costs that will be incurred.
(vi)  Estimate of the incremental UK pension liability recognised in 2014 that was expected to arise related to people leaving 
the business as part of the restructuring of operations in Scotland. 
(vii)  Costs (including professional fees) incurred in relation to the acquisition of PV Industries B.V. in October 2015.
(viii)   Costs in 2015 relate to the write-off of raw materials which are specific to the old manufacturing process in the USA and 
cannot be re-used. The costs incurred during 2014 related to the write-off of raw materials that were specific to some of 
the equipment being decommissioned in Scotland. 80

During the year, the UK corporation tax rate changed from 21% to 20%, effective from 1 April 2015. Further reductions to 19% 
from 1 April 2017 and to 18% from 1 April 2020 were substantively enacted in October 2015. This will reduce the company’s 
future current tax charge accordingly. The deferred tax liability at 31 December 2015 has been calculated based on these rates. 
Permanent differences have principally arisen due to an investment incentive scheme in the Czech Republic.

Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to owners of the parent of £14.6m (2014: £4.4m) 
by 166,928,534 (2014: 166,866,949) shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue throughout the year.
Shares arising from the Performance Share Plan are only treated as dilutive where the effect is to reduce earnings per share. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit for the year attributable to ordinary shareholders of £14.6m 
(2014: £4.4m) by the average number of shares, including the effect of all dilutive potential shares, of 168,406,376 
(2014: 167,899,401).
Earnings per share before exceptional items is calculated in order to eliminate the effect of exceptional items after tax in 2015 
of £11.0m (2014: £18.5m) on the results. Basic earnings per share before exceptional items is calculated by dividing the profit 
attributable to ordinary shareholders before exceptional items, after attributable tax, of £25.6m (2014: £22.9m) by 166,928,534 
(2014: 166,866,949) shares, being the weighted average number of shares in issue throughout the year.

In the income statement, amortisation of £0.3m (2014: £0.2m) is included in cost of sales and £0.8m (2014: £0.9m) in 
administrative expenses.
The group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The group’s goodwill entirely relates to the acquisition of PV Industries B.V. which was completed during the year, and 
represents a single cash-generating unit. The recoverable amount of this cash-generating unit is determined from value in use 
calculations, and the key assumptions are those regarding the discount rate, profit margin and sales growth rates.
The group prepares cash flow forecasts for the next five years derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by 
management, based on expected market growth rates and prior experience, with an estimated long-term growth rate of 1.5% 
per annum assumed at the end of the five year forecast period. The rate used to discount the forecast cash flows is 11.3%. 
Based on these calculations there is sufficient headroom over the book value of goodwill.

At 31 December 2015, trade receivables of £0.2m (2014: £0.2m) were impaired and fully provided. It was assessed that none  
of the impaired receivables would be recovered. The ageing of these receivables was as follows:

The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the carrying value of each class of receivable mentioned above. 
The group does not hold any collateral as security.
At 31 December 2015, trade receivables of £5.0m (2014: £5.5m) were past due but not impaired. The group believes that the 
unimpaired amounts are collectible in full based on historical payment behaviour and an analysis of customer credit risk. The 
ageing of these receivables was as follows:

Formal procedures are in place to minimise, as far as possible, losses from non-collection of receivables. These procedures, 
which include designated levels of authority, cover the opening of new accounts, payment terms and the setting up and review 
of credit limits. Where considered appropriate, payment in advance or confirmed letters of credit are required before product 
is released to customers.
There have been no significant losses due to the impairment or non-collection of receivables in recent years.

23. CAPITAL AND FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT, AND FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
Financial risk management
The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of the risks associated with capital, interest rates, foreign exchange, 
credit, and liquidity. It is the group’s policy that no speculative trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken. These 
policies have remained unchanged throughout the year, are consistent with the previous year, and are summarised below:
Capital
When managing capital, the group’s objectives are to safeguard the business as a going concern, provide returns to 
shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, and maintain an efficient capital structure. The group’s capital structure 
consists of net debt and equity of the group. In order to maintain its capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of 
dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
The covenants related to the group’s bank loan facilities determine a minimum EBITDA to net interest payable ratio and a 
maximum net debt to EBITDA ratio. EBITDA is measured as operating profit before exceptional items excluding depreciation, 
amortisation and profit or loss on disposal of assets. The group had adequate headroom within both covenants throughout the 
years ending 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014.
Another measure used to monitor the strength of the group’s balance sheet is the gearing ratio, which expresses the group’s 
net debt as a percentage of its equity. Net debt is total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Equity comprises issued 
share capital, reserves and retained earnings. The covenant and gearing ratios at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 
were as follows:
2015  
£’m
2014  
£’m
Total borrowings (note 22) 135.1 80.3
Less: cash and cash equivalents (note 18) (9.6) (11.1)
Net debt (note 32) 125.5 69.2
Equity 131.1 133.2
Bank loan covenant ratios:
Net debt to EBITDA (times) 2.6 1.5
EBITDA to net interest payable (times) 11.3 21.7
Gearing ratio 95.7% 52.0%
Market risk
a) Interest rate risk
The group’s interest rate risk arises from borrowings, cash and short-term deposits, together with currency swaps used to 
hedge intercompany loans.
The group borrows in the desired currencies at both floating and fixed rates of interest and may use forward rate agreements 
or interest rate swaps to generate the desired interest rate profile and manage the group’s exposure to interest rate 
fluctuations. The US dollar private placement completed during 2014 means that around half of the group’s debt is currently  
at a fixed rate of interest. The group entered into cross-currency interest rate swaps of US$40 million during 2014 to convert  
a portion of the US dollar private placement into synthetic sterling denominated debt at a fixed rate of interest. The foreign 
exchange element of these swaps are measured at fair value through profit and loss, with any gains or losses being taken 
immediately to the income statement to offset any fair value gains or losses on the hedged portion of the US dollar private 
placement. The interest rate differential element of these swaps have been designated as a cash flow hedge with movements 
in fair value recognised in other comprehensive income to be transferred to the income statement as the hedged interest 
payment occurs. 
Cash is held in interest-bearing current accounts where practicable with any excess cash placed on deposit. Any deposits 
made are for periods of less than three months.
The sensitivity of net finance costs to a movement in interest rates is restricted by the level of fixed rate borrowing now in 
place. A variation of, for example, 100 basis points in interest rates, applied to the group’s borrowings, cash and short-term 
deposits at 31 December 2015, would result in a movement in finance costs of £0.7m (2014: £0.2m) and finance income of 
£0.1m (2014: £0.1m). This would result in an adverse post-tax impact on the group’s income statement of £0.5m (2014: £0.1m) 
and a post-tax impact on the group’s equity of £0.5m (2014: £0.1m). 95

Annual Report and Accounts 2015
Financial Statements Directors’ Report Strategic Report Shareholder Information
b) Foreign exchange risk
The group has several significant overseas subsidiary undertakings whose revenues and expenses are denominated in a variety 
of currencies. Group policy dictates that foreign currency exposures arising from future commercial transactions are reviewed 
by Group Treasury and hedging activities are undertaken as appropriate in order to manage the net foreign exchange risks 
arising. Group policy permits the hedging of up to a maximum of 80% of the net external currency transaction exposures for 
periods of up to a maximum of fifteen months forward. It is not group policy to routinely hedge translation exposures apart 
from those created by intercompany loans or where foreign currency denominated assets are planned to be returned to the 
UK in the form of a dividend. Specific Board approval is required for any other translation exposure hedging. The group’s 
investment in its Czech subsidiary, Devro s.r.o., is hedged by a Czech koruna foreign exchange forward contract which mitigates 
the foreign currency risk arising from the subsidiary’s net assets. The forward contract is designated as a net investment hedge.  
No ineffectiveness was recognised from the hedge. The group’s investments in other subsidiaries are not hedged.
The table below details the impact changes in foreign exchange rates would have had on the group’s operating profit before 
exceptional items and post-tax profit for the years ended 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 due to the translation of 
both subsidiary profits from their functional currency into sterling, and also underlying currency transactions and balances 
within group companies which are denominated in currencies other than the reporting currency of that group company. The 
movements in equity as at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 includes the impact changes in foreign exchange rates 
would have on the translation of subsidiary net assets, as well as the effect of cash flow currency and net investment hedges.
In each case, it is assumed that the named currency is strengthening or weakening against all other currencies, while all the 
other currencies remain constant. The percentage foreign currency movement is based on the maximum annual percentage 
movement against sterling during the previous four years. Results are shown for all currencies where the impact on group 
post-tax profits would be more than £25,000.

The group monitors its credit exposure using credit ratings, where applicable, and through its policy of requiring appropriate 
credit checks on potential customers before sales commence. These procedures limit the group’s exposure to any one party  
to approved levels. Exposure to banking counterparties is only permitted with approved banks which have one minimum  
short-term rating of A1/P1/F1 with rating agencies S&P, Moody’s or Fitch. At the reporting date no single banking exposure  
was greater than £2.4m (2014: £2.4m). The group does not hold any collateral as security. 96

Liquidity risk
Alongside the longer-term funding provided by the US dollar private placement completed during 2014, which was put in place 
to support the group’s two major investment projects, the group has medium-term loan facilities which are regularly reviewed 
to ensure that they provide adequate liquidity for the group. The facilities are managed on a centralised basis with appropriate 
local availability. Details of the undrawn committed borrowing facilities available at 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014 
are shown below:

At 31 December 2015, the group had in place unsecured floating rate committed loan facilities totalling £110.0m 
(2014: £110.0m). These facilities consist of a single syndicated revolving credit facility with four banks, negotiated in December 
2014 and expiring on 19 December 2019. 
In addition to the committed facilities, local uncommitted working capital facilities of £5.0m (2014: £9.5m), US dollars 2.0m 
(2014: US dollars 2.0m), Czech koruna 120.0m (2014: Czech koruna 120.0m) and Australian dollars nil (2014: Australian dollars 
0.5m) were also in place at 31 December 2015. These facilities are renewable within one year.

Derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value are disclosed by level of the following fair value  
measurement hierarchy:
Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either 
directly (that is, as prices) or indirectly (that is, derived from prices)
Level 3 Inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (that is, unobservable inputs)
All of the group and company’s derivative financial instruments that are measured at fair value were classified as Level 2 as at 
31 December 2015 (2014: Level 2). They have been valued using publicly available data, such as forward foreign exchange rates. 
There are no financial instruments measured as Level 3. 
At 31 December 2015, the net fair value losses on open forward foreign exchange contracts that hedge the foreign currency 
risk of anticipated future sales and purchases amounted to £0.7m (2014: £1.2m). These will be transferred to the income 
statement and recognised in other operating income or expense when the forecast sales and purchases occur during 2016.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset to the extent that there is a legally enforceable right to do so, as permitted  
by IAS 12.
The unrecognised deferred tax in respect of losses in China is £1.3m (2014: £0.5m) which has not been recognised due to 
uncertainty. The unrecognised deferred tax in respect of the USA is £2.9m (2014: Nil) due to uncertainty associated with 
available tax capacity.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of any withholding or other taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings 
of subsidiaries. There are no unremitted earnings on which UK tax is expected to become payable if repatriated (2014: Nil).

The group operates a number of pension schemes throughout the world. The major schemes are of the defined benefit type 
and, with the exception of Germany where book reserves are supported by insurance policies, the assets of the schemes are 
held in separate trustee-administered funds. The defined benefit schemes are closed to new entrants. The total pension 
obligation cost for the group was £7.5m (2014: £8.9m), of which £3.2m (2014: £3.0m) related to the overseas schemes. 
On the advice of the actuaries, cash contributions to the group’s defined benefit schemes are expected to be £5.0m for the 
year ending 31 December 2016.  103

The most significant defined benefit scheme within the group is the Devro Limited (UK) Pension Plan, which operates in the 
United Kingdom. The latest triennial valuation of the UK scheme as at 31 March 2014 was finalised during 2015. The other major 
defined benefit schemes operate in Australia and the USA. 
Actuarial assumptions appropriate for each country have been used.
The last formal actuarial valuations of the group’s material defined benefit schemes have been updated to 31 December 2015 
by qualified independent actuaries. The major assumptions used by the actuaries in the following principal countries were:

*  As part of the changes to the United Kingdom plan agreed in 2010, future pensionable salary increases are capped at 1% per annum. No rate of increase in salaries 
has been assumed in respect of the USA plan as the plan is now frozen.
Demographic assumptions, such as mortality rates, are set having regard to the latest trends in life expectancy plan 
experience. These assumptions are under continual review. The mortality assumptions at 31 December 2015 are based on the 
following tables:
2015 2014
Years of life expectancy for current pensioners aged 65 Male Female Male Female
United Kingdom – SAPS ‘Normal’ (YOB)* 22.4 24.7 22.4 24.7

*  Adjusted by -0.2 years for male non-pensioners and -1.1 years for female non-pensioners (-0.4 for female pensioners) with CMI 2013 improvements using a long-term 
rate of 1.25% per annum.
The Australian defined benefit scheme provides only for a lump sum payment on retirement.
In addition to the above schemes, the group operates a defined benefit pension plan in Germany which, in common with 
typical practice in that country, is supported by insurance policies. At 31 December 2015, the value of the insurance asset was 
£2.0m (2014: £2.2m) and the value of the liability was £3.0m (2014: £3.5m). A proportion of the assets and liabilities of the 
German plan, relating to the period when the business operated as a branch of Devro Inc or Devro (Scotland) Limited, was 
retained by the group after the sale of Devro GmbH in September 2011.
In addition, the group has benefit arrangements in respect of two former executives in the USA for which the group has made 
adequate provisions on the advice of the actuaries. There is also an individual pension arrangement in Japan in respect of 
which appropriate contributions are made annually. The plan in Germany and these additional arrangements in the USA and 
Japan are included under the “other” heading in this note.

25. PENSION OBLIGATIONS continued
Investments in each of the main schemes are well diversified. Strategy is split between liability matching and return generating 
assets with the split determined depending on the duration of the scheme, the funding position and the relevant country’s 
pension rules. For the UK, the scheme invests 60% of the portfolio in growth assets with the remainder in UK government 
bonds matched to scheme liabilities. For the US scheme a defensive approach is taken given the shorter maturity of the 
scheme liabilities with around 70% of the portfolio invested in fixed income assets and the remainder in growth assets, 
principally equities. For the Australian scheme the strategy is for 70% of the portfolio to be invested in growth assets, with the 
remainder invested in defensive, primarily fixed income assets. In all three schemes, the investment approach will be de-risked 
over time as the funding position improves and market conditions allow.

The net deficit position has decreased during the year. The discount rate increased for all of the group’s schemes, reducing  
the present value of the liabilities in each of the schemes. The impact of the increase in the discount rate on the net deficit of 
the UK scheme was mitigated by the performance of the scheme assets with actual returns being below estimated interest 
income. The group continues to pay contributions to pension schemes in accordance with local regulatory requirements and 
on the advice of qualified independent actuaries. The latest triennial valuation of the UK scheme as at 31 March 2014 was 
finalised during 2015 and resulted in contributions increasing by a further £1.0m per annum.

The schemes’ funds have been invested in a range of assets which are due to be realised in line with the associated liabilities. 
The trustees review the schemes’ assets and adjust the weighting between short-term and long-term assets to combine 
security and growth with the liquidity required to meet the obligations as they fall due.  107

Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure defined benefit obligations:
Assumption Change in assumption
Indicative impact on defined benefit 
obligation (before deferred tax)
Discount rate Increase by 0.25% Decrease by £11.4m
Decrease by 0.25% Increase by £12.0m
Rate of salary increase Increase by 0.25% Increase by £0.2m
Decrease by 0.25% Decrease by £0.2m
General inflation Increase by 0.25% Increase by £3.2m
Decrease by 0.25% Decrease by £3.7m
Life expectancy Increase by 1 year Increase by £7.9m
The above sensitivity analyses are based on the same change in assumption in each of the group’s schemes (except where 
changes are limited through the individual scheme rules), while holding all other assumptions constant. In practice, this is 
unlikely to occur, and changes in some of the assumptions may be correlated. When calculating the sensitivity of the defined 
benefit obligation to significant actuarial assumptions the projected unit credit method is applied in the same way as for the 
calculation of the pension liability recognised in the financial statements.
Risks
Through its defined benefit pension obligations, the group is exposed to a number of risks, the most significant of which are 
detailed below:
Market volatility
The accounting estimate of net pension obligations is very sensitive to changes in market conditions. The discount rate used  
to estimate the defined benefit obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds, or similar, whilst scheme assets are 
invested in a range of other assets, which are themselves subject to fluctuations in value. Changing market conditions and 
movements in the discount rate will lead to volatility in the net pension obligation on the group’s balance sheet, in other 
comprehensive income and in the income statement.
Choice of accounting assumptions
The value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by actuarial valuations over long-term cash flows. The actuarial 
valuation involves making assumptions about discount rates, future salary increases, mortality rates and future inflation. Due  
to the long-term nature of these schemes these estimates are subject to significant uncertainty, and the final outcome could 
be significantly different to the assumptions used. 
However, the risk is limited in certain respects for some schemes. The Australian scheme allows for a lump sum payment on 
retirement, so is not sensitive to changes in mortality assumptions, whilst the US scheme is frozen so that it is not sensitive to 
inflation or salary rises. Similarly the rate of increase in UK salaries is limited to 1% per annum.

11,490 ordinary shares of 10 pence each were issued during the year in connection with the Devro 2003 Performance Share 
Plan (2014: 141,812).
27. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
Under the Devro plc Performance Share Plan and its predecessor (together “the plans”), the Executive Directors’ Remuneration 
Committee made provisional allocations of ordinary shares in the company to employees of the group, including executive 
directors. No payment for an allocation is made by a participant. Allocations normally vest over a three-year period, are 
conditional on the continued employment of the participant and are subject to certain performance conditions. These 
performance conditions relate to growth in the company’s earnings per share and the company’s Total Shareholder Return 
in comparison to its peer group. 
For awards where vesting is subject to the growth in earnings per share the fair value of an allocation represents the market 
value of the ordinary shares in the company on the date of the provisional allocation, less the discounted value of estimated 
dividends expected to be paid during the vesting period. A participant is not entitled to receive dividends during this period.  108

Notes to the financial statements 
for the year ended 31 December 2015 continued
27. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS continued
The fair value of awards subject to the company’s Total Shareholder Return performance is determined using a Monte Carlo 
option valuation methodology. The weighted average fair value of options granted during the year using this method was £2.01 
(2014: £1.69) with the significant inputs to the model being the share price at the grant date, an expected volatility in the share 
price of 25.5% (based on historic trends), the term of three years, risk free interest rate of 0.51% and expected dividend yield.
Amounts provided in the accounts are based on an estimate of the probability of the targets in respect of allocations  
being achieved.
During the year 11,490 shares vested under the Devro 2003 Performance Share Plan (2014: 141,812).
At 31 December 2015, the maximum number of shares which may vest under the plans is as follows:

37. ACQUISITION 
On 5 October 2015 the group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of PV Industries B.V. (“PVI”). Based in the Netherlands, 
PVI is a leading manufacturer of high quality collagen gel products for the meat processing industry. The acquisition gives the 
group access to PVI’s strong technical skills base together with an innovative and developing product portfolio. PVI has since 
been re-named Devro B.V.
The amounts recognised in respect of identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed are set out in the table below:
£’m
Identifiable intangible assets 2.1
Property, plant and equipment 4.0
Inventory 0.3
Trade and other receivables 0.7
Cash and cash equivalents 0.4
Trade and other payables (0.8)

Cash consideration 6.8
Contingent consideration arrangement 0.2
Total consideration 7.0
Net cash outflow arising on acquisition
Cash consideration 6.8
Less: cash and cash equivalents balances acquired (0.4)
6.4
Identifiable intangible assets solely relate to customer contracts and relationships. 
The goodwill of £3.1m arising from the acquisition consists of PVI’s technological expertise, including the expertise of its staff 
and potential new customer relationships.
The contingent consideration arrangement requires further payment to be made to the previous owners of PVI dependent 
upon the level of revenue generated by PVI up to 31 December 2016. The fair value of the contingent consideration 
arrangement of £0.2m was estimated based on the latest financial projections for PVI. The potential undiscounted amount  
of all future payments the group could be required to make under the arrangement are up to £0.7m.
Acquisition related costs (included in operating expenses) amount to £0.3m.
PVI contributed £1.0m revenue and £0.1m operating profit to the group for the period between the date of acquisition and 
31 December 2015. It contributed £0.1m to group profit after tax. If the acquisition had been completed on 1 January 2015, 
group revenues for the year would have been £233.8m, group operating profit after exceptional items would have been 
£19.5m and group profit after tax would have been £14.7m. 114

2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest 
effect on our audit were as follows:
Carrying value of inventory (£28.5m)
(Refer to page 44 of the Audit Committee Report, pages 69 and 72 for accounting policies and note 16 on page 89 for  
financial disclosures).
The risk: The risk is that the carrying value of inventory exceeds its net realisable value due to the perishable nature of 
inventory held and the quality of finished goods. The group adopts a policy of providing for inventory when it reaches a certain 
age, and also for any inventory where there are specific quality concerns. Establishing a provision for slow-moving, obsolete 
and damaged inventory involves estimation and judgment, taking into account forecast sales and product quality issues based 
on history. 
Our response: Among our audit procedures in this area, we tested the inventory provision calculations against the group’s 
policy for aged, obsolete and slow-moving inventory. We evaluated management’s inventory quality reports which supported 
the provisions. We assessed the provisions for inventory loss compared to historical trends. We considered the manufacturing 
performance of each of the factories reported within the monthly management reports, including the production yields in our 
assessment of the quality provision. We attended stock counts close to the year-end to challenge and understand the group’s 
procedures for identifying obsolete inventory and we observed such inventories at the count. We also tested a sample of 
inventory to sales subsequent to the year end and assessed that they were sold at more than net book value.
Capitalisation of assets relating to capital projects 
(Refer to page 44 of the Audit Committee Report, page 69, 71 and 72 for accounting policies and notes 13 and 14 for  
financial disclosures).
The risk: The group is progressing two significant investment projects, one in the USA and one in China. The total capital 
spend in the year of £55.4m principally related to the capital projects, with other costs incurred of £14.4m which have been 
expensed and are included in exceptional items on the face of the income statement. We focused on this area as the amounts 
are significant and involve judgment in terms of the nature of certain internal costs capitalised, such as employee costs, and 
whether they are appropriately capitalised in relation to the stage of completion of the capital projects.
Our response: Among our audit procedures in this area, we considered whether the group’s policies and principles for 
recording capital project costs are in line with the relevant accounting standards. We assessed whether the processes and 
controls in place to capture and analyse project costs in accordance with these policies were sufficient. We performed detailed 
testing on a sample basis (e.g. by comparing to third party contractual agreements) and considered whether costs were 
capital in nature and appropriately capitalised with reference to the stage of completion of the project. As part of this testing, 
we sought to test whether a sample of internal costs relating to capitalised intangible assets were related directly to the 
development of new products for the new factories. We also inspected the group’s disclosures over the capitalisation of assets 
to determine whether the accounting policies accurately reflect the judgement involved in determining the costs.

Exceptional items (£14.1m)
(Refer to page 44 of the Audit Committee Report and pages 69 and 75 for accounting policies and note 4 on page 79 for  
financial disclosures).
The risk: The financial statements include costs of £14.1m which are disclosed as exceptional and primarily comprise the 
incremental costs associated with building the two new factories in the USA and China which include expenses of 
decommissioning existing plant, redundancy in relation to employees and other direct costs associated with the projects.  
The classification of income and expenditure as exceptional is an area of judgement and it is not a term defined under IFRS. 
There is a risk that items are inappropriately described as exceptional, thus not providing an accurate reflection of the 
underlying performance of the group within the narrative sections of the financial statements. Further, there is a risk that 
amounts are inconsistently classified as exceptional year on year. 
Our response: Among our audit procedures in this area, we have considered in detail the group’s policies and principles  
for recognising elements of income and expenditure as exceptional. We challenged management over the inclusion of costs 
and expenses within the exceptional categorisation, with particular focus on the non-recurring nature of any amounts.  
We also performed detailed testing on a sample basis (e.g. by comparing to purchase invoices), and have considered the 
appropriateness of recognising these items as exceptional with reference to the aforementioned group policies. We assessed 
the consistency of the items classified as ‘exceptional’ year on year and in accordance with the group’s accounting policy.
We assessed the group’s disclosures for exceptional items and assessed that amounts classified as exceptional are described 
within the financial statements with reference to either their nature or function as appropriate and that exceptional items in 
consecutive periods are classified consistently. 
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the group financial statements as a whole was set at £1.2m, determined with reference to a benchmark  
of group profit before tax adjusted for exceptional items, of £29.2m (of which it represents 4%).
The group audit team approved the component materialities, which ranged from £0.1m to £1.0m, having regard to the mix  
of size and risk profile of the group across the components. 
We report to the Audit Committee any corrected or uncorrected identified misstatements exceeding £60,000, in addition  
to other identified misstatements that warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
The group team instructed component auditors as to the significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed 
above and the information to be reported back. The group team and component auditors performed audits for group 
reporting purposes at three of the group’s ten reporting components and the head office function, and performed specified 
audit procedures at a further two components. The latter were not individually financially significant enough to require an 
audit for group reporting purposes, but did present specific individual risks that needed to be addressed. For the remaining 
components, we performed analysis at an aggregated group level to re-examine our assessment that there were no significant 
risks of material misstatement within these.
The components within the scope of our work accounted for the following percentages of the group’s results:
% Components subject to audit
Components subject to  
specified audit procedures Total
Revenue 54 28 82
Profit before tax 90 7 97
Total assets 48 41 89
The remaining 18% of total group revenue, 3% of group profit before tax and 11% of total group assets is represented by five 
reporting components, none of which individually represented more than 9% of any of total group revenue, group profit before 
tax or total group assets. The group team visited component locations in Scotland, Czech Republic and Nantong, China. to 
assess the audit risk and strategy. Video and telephone conference meetings were also held with these component auditors 
and certain others that were not physically visited. At these meetings, the findings reported to the group team were discussed 
in more detail, and any further work required by the group team was then performed by the component auditor.

agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
1. Appointment of proxies
A member of the Company is entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any of his/her rights to attend, speak and vote at a 
general meeting of the Company. A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to the meeting, provided that each 
proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A proxy need not be a 
member of the Company but must attend the meeting in person. 
Members may register their appointment of a proxy either electronically or by returning the hard copy proxy form (where 
supplied) in accordance with the instructions set out below.
To be valid, the instrument appointing a proxy, together with the power of attorney or other authority, if any, under which  
it is signed (or a copy of such power or authority, certified by a notary) must be deposited at the office of the Company’s 
registrars, Computershare Investor Services PLC, The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS99 6ZY, not later than 11am on 
25 April 2016. Completion and return of a form of proxy will not preclude shareholders from attending or voting in person at 
the AGM, if they wish to do so. 
Shareholders can also register their appointment of a proxy to attend the AGM electronically via the internet by visiting 
https://www.investorcentre.co.uk/eproxy where full instructions are given. A proxy appointment made electronically will not 
be valid if sent to any address other than that provided or, if received after 11am on 25 April 2016 or, if the meeting is adjourned, 
if received less than 48 hours (excluding any part of a day which is a non-working day) before the time of the adjourned 
meeting. Please note that any electronic communication found to contain a computer virus will not be accepted. 
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies by utilising the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may  
do so for the AGM and any adjournment(s) of it by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual (available via  
www.euroclear.com). CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have 
appointed a voting service provider, should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider, who will be able to take 
the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment made by means of CREST to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a CREST Proxy 
Instruction) must be properly authenticated in accordance with specifications of Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited (“EUI”) and 
must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message must be 
transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID number 3RA50) no later than 48 hours before the time appointed for 
holding the AGM. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to 
the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to 
CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that EUI does not make 
available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply 
in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the 
CREST member is a CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure 
that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is 
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, 
their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
2. Nominated persons
Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Act to enjoy information rights  
(a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between him/her and the registered shareholder by whom he/she was 
nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the meeting. If a Nominated 
Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a 
right to give instructions to the registered shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in section 1 above does not apply to 
Nominated Persons. The rights described in that section can only be exercised by registered shareholders of the Company.
3. Corporate representatives
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of 
the same powers as the corporation could exercise if it were an individual member provided they do not do so in relation to the 
same shares. 121

4. Entitlement to attend and vote
To be entitled to attend and vote at the meeting (and for the purpose of the determination by the Company of the votes they 
may cast), shareholders must be registered in the register of members of the Company at 6pm on 25 April 2016 (or, in the 
event of any adjournment, not less than 48 hours (excluding any part of a day that is not a working day) before the time of the 
adjourned meeting). Changes to the register of members of the Company after the relevant deadline shall be disregarded in 
determining the rights of any person to attend and vote at the meeting.
5. Poll vote
All resolutions at the AGM will be taken on a poll rather than on a show of hands, so as to reflect accurately the view of all of 
the Company’s shareholders by ensuring that every vote is recognised, including the votes of shareholders who are unable to 
attend the AGM but who have appointed a proxy. On a poll, each shareholder has one vote for each share held.
6. Website publication of audit concerns
Under section 527 of the Act, members meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section have the right to require  
the Company to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to the audit of the Company’s accounts 
(including the Auditors’ Report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the meeting. The Company may not 
require the shareholders requesting any such website publication to pay its expenses in complying with section 527 or 528 of 
the Act. Where the Company is required to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the Act, it must forward the 
statement to the Company’s Auditors not later than the time when it makes the statement available on the website. The 
business which may be dealt with at the meeting includes any statement that the Company has been required under section 
527 of the Act to publish on a website.
7. Shareholders’ right to ask questions
Any member of the Company attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must cause to be answered 
any such question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so 
would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information; (b) the answer 
has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or (c) it is undesirable in the interests of the 
Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
8. Documents available for inspection
Copies of all service contracts of the Executive Directors, and all appointment letters of the Non-Executive Directors are 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office, Gartferry Road, Moodiesburn, Chryston, G69 0JE and at the offices 
of Clifford Chance LLP, 10 Upper Bank Street, London E14 5JJ during usual business hours. They will also be available at the 
place of the AGM from 10.45am until the close of the meeting.
9. Issued share capital and total voting rights
At 4 March 2016 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this notice) the issued share capital of the 
Company consists of 166,932,532 Ordinary Shares, carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in the Company 
as at 4 March 2016 are 166,932,532.

The resolution will authorise the Directors to allot Relevant Securities up to a maximum nominal amount of £5,500,000 which 
represents approximately one-third of the Company’s issued Ordinary Shares (excluding treasury shares) as at 4 March 2016.
The Directors have no present intention to use this authority, which will expire at the earlier of the conclusion of the next AGM of 
the Company and 30 June 2017. As is normal practice, the Directors intend to seek renewal of this authority at subsequent AGMs.
In this resolution, Relevant Securities means: 
• shares in the Company, other than shares allotted pursuant to:
• an employee share scheme (as defined in section 1166 of the Act);
• a right to subscribe for shares in the Company where the grant of the right itself constituted a Relevant Security; or
• a right to convert securities into shares in the Company where the grant of the right itself constituted a Relevant Security; 
and
• any right to subscribe for or to convert any security into shares in the Company other than rights to subscribe for or convert 
any security into shares allotted pursuant to an employee share scheme (as defined in section 1166 of the Act). References 
to the allotment of Relevant Securities in this resolution include the grant of such rights.
Resolution 13: Pre-emption rights
This resolution, if passed, will give the Directors power, pursuant to the authority to allot granted by resolution 12, to allot 
equity securities (as defined by section 560 of the Act) or to sell treasury shares for cash without first offering them to existing 
shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings (a) in relation to pre-emptive offers and offers to holders of other equity 
securities if required by the rights of those securities or as the Directors otherwise consider necessary, up to a maximum 
nominal amount of £5,500,000 which represents approximately one-third of the Company’s issued Ordinary Shares (excluding 
treasury shares) as at 4 March 2016; and (b) in any other case, up to a maximum nominal amount of £1,669,000 which 
represents slightly less than 10% of the Company’s issued Ordinary Shares (excluding treasury shares) as at 4 March 2016, 
which is the latest practicable date before publication of this notice.
This resolution is in line with guidance issued by the Investment Association and the Pre-emption Group’s Statement of 
Principles, as updated in March 2015 (“the Statement of Principles”).
In compliance with the Statement of Principles, the Directors confirm that they will not allot shares for cash on a non-pre-
emptive basis pursuant to the authority in this resolution:
• in excess of an amount equal to 5% of the issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares); or
• in excess of an amount equal to 7.5% of the issued share capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) within a rolling 
three-year period, without prior consultation with the Company’s shareholders,
in each case other than in connection with an acquisition or specified capital investment which is announced 
contemporaneously with the issue or which has taken place in the preceding six-month period and is disclosed in the 
announcement of the allotment.
The power granted by this resolution will expire at close of business on 30 June 2017 or, if earlier, the conclusion of the next 
AGM of the Company.
The Directors have no present intention to exercise this authority. 123

Resolution 14: Authority for market purchases by the Company of its own shares
The authority for the Company to purchase its own Ordinary Shares granted at last year’s AGM will expire on the date of the 
forthcoming AGM. The Directors wish to renew this authority and a special resolution will be proposed to give the Company 
the authority to purchase its own Ordinary Shares in the market as permitted by the Act. The resolution gives authority for the 
Company to purchase up to 16,600,000 of its Ordinary Shares, representing just under 10 per cent of the Company’s issued 
Ordinary Share capital (excluding treasury shares) as at 4 March 2016.
The resolution specifies the minimum and maximum prices which may be paid for any Ordinary Shares purchased under this 
authority. The authority will expire on the earlier of close of business on 30 June 2017 and the end of the Company’s 2017 AGM.
Although the Directors have no present intention of exercising the authority to purchase the Company’s Ordinary Shares, they 
consider that it is in the best interests of the Company to have available this authorisation, in case of circumstances when it 
would be appropriate to use it. They would only use it when satisfied that this would result in an increase in earnings per share 
and was in the best interests of shareholders generally.
Any Ordinary Shares purchased pursuant to this authority may either be held as treasury shares or cancelled by the Company, 
depending on which course of action is considered by the Directors to be in the best interests of shareholders at the time.
As at 4 March 2016, there were share scheme award options over 1,764,336 Ordinary Shares in the capital of the Company, 
which represents 1.1% of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital. If the authority to purchase the Company’s Ordinary 
Shares were exercised in full, these options would represent 1.2% of the Company’s issued Ordinary Share capital. As at 
4 March 2016, the Company did not hold any treasury shares in the Company and no warrants over Ordinary Shares in the 
capital of the Company existed.
Resolution 15: General meeting notice
Changes made to the Act by the Shareholders’ Rights Regulations increased the notice period required for general meetings 
of the Company from 14 clear days to 21 days, unless shareholders approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be 
less than 14 clear days, and certain requirements are satisfied. In accordance with the Act, AGMs will continue to be held on at 
least 21 clear days’ notice.
At the last AGM, the shareholders approved a notice period of not less than 14 clear days (other than for AGMs) effective until 
the forthcoming AGM. The Directors believe it is in the best interests of shareholders to preserve this ability and this resolution, 
which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks such approval. The approval will be effective until the Company’s next 
AGM, when it is intended that a similar resolution will be proposed.
It is intended that this flexibility will only be used for non-routine business and where merited in the interests of  
shareholders generally.
It should also be noted that in order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, the Company must 
make a means of electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting. This condition is met if there is a facility to 
appoint a proxy by means of a website. 124

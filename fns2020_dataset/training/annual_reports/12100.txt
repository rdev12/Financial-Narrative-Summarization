Business 
model
Clear market leader
Pets At Home is the UK’s leading national 
specialist retailer of pets, pet food, pet-
related products and pet accessories, as well 
as operating the UK’s largest small animal 
services business, through our Vets4Pets 
and Companion Care veterinary practices 
and Groom Room grooming salons. Pets At 
Home also owns and operates Ride-away, an 
equestrian products multi-channel retailer. 
Our retail footprint is larger than the closest 
five competitors combined and we are the only 
provider in the UK market offering a full suite of 
both pet products and services.
Unique ‘one stop shop’
Pets At Home offers a unique omni-channel 
proposition for UK pet owners, including a large 
retail store footprint, multiple websites across 
our different brands, innovative and exclusive 
products, and pet services through our vet 
practices and grooming salons. Our primary 
retail website, petsathome.com, captures the 
highest levels of traffic in the UK online pet 
retail market and drives brand engagement and 
further customers to stores.
Differentiated products 
Through our UK network of 377 stores, Pets 
At Home provides a differentiated product 
offering for pet owners. On our website, over 
50% of products are unique to Pets At Home. 
We know that our customers value a wide and 
varied range of high quality products, which we 
can provide through our exclusive brands, own 
label and private label products. Our innovation 
team provides design and creative input to a 
large number of the products we introduce each 
year, with a strong focus on the development of 
our own brand and private label ranges, which 
accounted for 42% of total revenues in the year.
UK’ s leading pet services provider 
Veterinary care and grooming services are 
another way in which Pets At Home stores 
offer more than typical pet shops. The majority 
of the veterinary practices are operated as 
Joint Ventures with our vet partners, under two 
brands: Companion Care and Vets4Pets, which 
form the UK’s largest branded small animal 
veterinary surgery group. The 277 veterinary 
practices are located within stores, as well 
as in standalone locations throughout the 
UK, giving customers access to services in 
locations where the nearest store may not be 
convenient.
Groom Rooms provide a wide range of services 
including full grooming, bath and blow dry, 
microchipping, puppy grooming and nail 
clipping. There are currently 129 Groom  
Room salons throughout the UK.
In addition to veterinary care and grooming, 
our in-store colleagues deliver a wide range of 
services to customers and their pets. These 
services include micro-chipping, nutrition 
consultations, weight checking and advice on 
licensed medicines from Suitably Qualified 
Persons (specially trained colleagues, able to 
advise on such products). 
Highly engaged customers and colleagues
Engagement is a key driver of our success and 
both our customers’ and colleagues’ passion 
for pets drives high levels of service, sales and 
loyalty. The Pets At Home loyalty card scheme, 
VIP Club, was voted ‘Loyalty Scheme of 2013’ 
by the Direct Marketing Association and gives 
us a unique channel through which to engage 
and interact with its 2 million members and 
their pets. 
Community engagement
Pets At Home values engagement with the 
local community and has established local 
relationships with schools, colleges and hobby 
groups including scouts, cubs and beaver 
groups. In conjunction with the charity Support 
Adoption For Pets, which Pets At Home helped 
to establish, we support national animal  
re-homing charities such as the Royal Society 
for the Prevention of Cruelty to Animals, The 
Dogs Trust and Battersea Dogs and Cats Home 
on behalf of the Charity. At the end of 2014, 
Pets At Home had adoption centres in 325 
stores, which had facilitated the adoption of 
over 60,000 pets during the year, making the 
Charity the number one pet re-homing charity 
in the UK.

Dear Shareholder
2014 was an historic year for the business, 
culminating in our listing on the premium 
segment of the London Stock Exchange. 
At the same time, we delivered record 
financial results, successfully executed on 
our growth strategy, continued to engage our 
colleagues and pet customers and enhanced 
our governance with an expanded Board of 
Directors.
Pets At Home is the leader in the highly 
attractive UK pet care market. We stand 
uniquely placed as the only UK retailer offering 
a full suite of pet products and services 
across both stores and the Internet. We offer 
customers a truly differentiated range, which 
drives engagement and loyalty in a one stop 
shop environment.
During the year, we believe we have benefited 
both from positive market dynamics as well 
as the successful execution of our plans. 
Historically, the UK pet care market has 
experienced growth levels above those of the 
overall non-food sector, driven by pet owners’ 
continued demand for innovative, premium 
products, the increased uptake of pet services 
and the desire for owners to treat and care for 
their pets as one of the family. We believe this 
dynamic continues.
In the financial year 2014, revenues grew by 
11.2% to £665.4m. We experienced another 
year of like-for-like growth, at 2.4%, driven by VIP 
Club success, strength in Advanced Nutrition, 
omni-channel and the increasing maturity of  
pet services.
Nick Wood and our executive management 
team have continued to execute our growth 
strategy for the business. We are very proud 
to have become the UK’s largest small animal 
veterinary services provider, with 277 practices 
operating under the Companion Care and 
Vets4Pets brands at year end. Our Groom Room 
services expanded at a rapid rate, with 42 
salons added to our store portfolio, the largest 
expansion we have seen in a single year. We 
also opened 32 stores, bringing our portfolio 
to 377, larger than the five closest specialist 
competitors combined. Our success is driven 
by our highly engaged colleagues who deliver 
outstanding service to our pet customers. 
This high level of colleague engagement was 
recognised by being awarded the Sunday Times 
Best Place To Work, for large companies,  
in 2013.
As a public company, our vision remains the 
same, to be the best pet shop in the world. We 
have always sought to deliver superior returns 
to our shareholders through the continued 
growth, profitability and cash flows of the 
Company. At listing, we enhanced our corporate 
governance framework with an expansion of the 
Board and the appointment of five Independent 
Non-Executive Directors: Paul Coby, Tessa 
Green, Amy Stirling and Paul Moody. And we 
welcomed Dennis Millard as Deputy Chairman 
and Senior Independent Non-Executive Director. 
Each Director has been chosen to bring a 
range of retail, public company, commercial and 
charitable skills to Pets At Home. Brian Carroll 
has been appointed as a Non-Executive Director 
of the Board and representative of our principal 
shareholder.
Looking ahead, our performance in 2014 has 
given us a solid platform to build upon. We 
remain confident in the business and anticipate 
a further year of growth for Pets At Home.
Finally, on behalf of myself and the Board, I 
would like to thank all our colleagues for their 
substantial contribution during this historic year. 
Their continued passion and enthusiasm for the 
business are integral to our success.
We will continue to live our values in driving the 
Company forward, working together as a team 
and taking great pride in what we do.

Unique Joint Venture veterinary business
Pets At Home operates the only large-scale joint venture veterinary services business in the UK market, 
under our two veterinary brands – Vets4Pets and Companion Care. The JV model allows each vet 
practice to operate as an independent business, owned by Pets At Home and a veterinary JV partner, 
and is funded by small loans into the business by the JV partner and Pets At Home, alongside a larger, 
independent bank loan. The JV partner pays a service charge if operating from an in-store practice, 
reflecting the cost of the space occupied, and a percentage of their revenue in the form of fee income 
to Pets At Home. We provide all the administrative and back office support, allowing the vet partner and 
their colleagues to focus on clinical excellence and delivering the best possible service to pets and their 
owners. The JV Partner also receives the benefit from the profit stream in the form of a dividend, as well 
as potential capital accretion from growing the practice.
Companion Care is our original in-store veterinary brand, whilst Vets4Pets, acquired in March 2013, 
added 92 standalone vet practices to the Group. The Group successfully integrated the two businesses, 
ahead of schedule during the course of FY14, which included the implementation of new Joint Venture 
contracts for new practices, combining support office functions and the commencement of rebranding 
of practices to Vets4Pets. We are working with our JV partners to migrate all practices to the Vets4Pets 
brand over time, as well as a single veterinary practice management system across all JV surgeries.
Whilst Pets At Home operates its vets practices principally on a JV basis, the Group is committed to 
maintaining ten wholly owned Group Venture veterinary practices. One of the functions of such Group 
Ventures is to allow potential JV partners to experience working as part of the Group, before committing 
fully to a JV practice. Another function of the Group Ventures is to allow us to trial new initiatives prior to 
launching them across the JV practices.

Market 
review
The UK pet care market is large, resilient and growing
 The UK pet care market is a large, resilient market worth around £5.4 billion, supported by a stable pet population. 
 Future growth will be driven by the continued humanisation of pets, customers’ increased desire for premium and innovative 
products, a shift to Advanced Nutrition food and the increasing use of pet services.
 In the online channel, penetration of pet products has been increasing at around 1% per annum. Future growth will be driven 
by Click & Collect, where customers are able to order products online for collection in store.
 The market has shown resilience to periods of economic challenge, with no individual year of negative growth from 2006 to 
2012, outpacing the broader UK retail sector over the same period.

Chief Executive Officer
Strategic overview
During the financial year 2014, we continued to make strong progress on our strategy to leverage our  
leading position in the UK pet care market and develop new opportunities for growth.
This strategy is reflected in the Pets At Home PawPrint, the internal 
articulation of our strategy to all colleagues across the business: To 
be the best pet shop in the world; by providing world class shops; 
colleagues who are friendly experts; being at the heart of every 
community; always new and exciting; offering the best vets and 
groomers; being a truly amazing place to work and putting pets  
before profit. 
The operational delivery of the strategy is achieved through three 
growth levers: 
 Expanding like-for-like sales
 Space rollout and footprint development
 Continued focus on gross margin improvement
We saw good progression against all three growth levers during the 
financial year.

Chief Executive Officer’ s review
continued
Like-for-like growth
Product and innovation
Differentiated and unique product is critical 
to the Group’s strategy, driving both customer 
loyalty and visit frequency. We refreshed our 
product range with more than 2,750 new SKUs 
(Stock Keeping Units) in 2014, representing 
over a third of our total range. During the year, 
a number of new Advanced Nutrition (AN) 
brands were introduced to stores, including 
Barking Heads for dogs and Meowing Heads 
for cats. AN foods have superior health and 
nutritional benefits to pets and are the fastest 
growing segment of the pet food market. New 
launches within Wainwright’s, our private label 
AN range, also saw strong sales after launch, 
which included Wainwright’s for cats, as well as 
Wainwright’s Grain Free for dogs. 
VIP Club
Our VIP Club continues to grow at a rapid rate, 
reaching 2 million members and capturing 
over 50% of all revenues spent in stores by 
the end of March 2014. Increasing use of 
the loyalty card is also being seen within our 
in-store veterinary practices and Groom Room 
salons. VIP allows us to send personalised and 
targeted marketing to owners and their pets 
and will continue to be one of the key levers 
through which we can take further market 
share. This year, ahead of the Wainwright’s cat 
food launch, we were able to target cat owners 
within the VIP Club database, particularly those 
who were already purchasing Wainwright’s 
dog food. These members were sent targeted 
emails, resulting in 55% of Wainwright’s cat 
food launch sales being attributable to VIP 
Club members. Our VIP Club also creates 
charity lifelines each time a card is swiped 
and generated over £1 million for customer 
nominated charities in FY14.
Omni-channel
PetsAtHome.com was relaunched in January 
2014. The website now features only four clicks 
to checkout, richer content and offers more 
than 8,100 SKUs, higher than in-store ranges. 
Post new site launch, as expected, the website 
experienced slightly lower levels of traffic as 
re-indexing within search engines occurred, 
but more recent data shows that visits to the 
site have now recovered to pre-launch levels. 
We have also seen less activity from some 
competitor websites, meaning our overall share 
has increased slightly and we remain the highest 
traffic pet website in the UK, with more than 
three times the traffic levels of our nearest 
competitors. 
Our food subscription service, which enables 
customers to receive their fifth order for free, 
remains in trial. Our Click and Collect (C&C) 
service, which allows customers to place an 
order on the website for collection in store 
within two hours, continues to perform well. 
C&C sales, as a precentage of total website 
sales, have been maintained since the new 
website launch. This is just one lever through 
which we seek to drive footfall to stores via the 
website, and we continue to view our online 
strategy as far more than simply a platform for 
customer purchases, but as a portal to drive 
engagement and cross-selling activities. 
Looking ahead, we plan to launch mobile and 
tablet friendly website versions and increase 
our online product range towards a target of 
10,000 SKUs. We will rollout Deliver To Store, 
which enables customers to order any product 
available online for delivery into a local store. 
We are also enabling the redemption of VIP 
vouchers online. This will create a seamless 
store and online shopping experience for VIP 
customers, as well as allowing us to track offer 
redemption rates and measure success and 
returns more easily.

Services
Retrofitting of veterinary practices and Groom 
Room salons to existing stores drives like-
for-like store sales, by enhancing our overall 
proposition, driving store footfall and enabling 
cross-selling of products. During the year, 
18 veterinary practices and 11 Groom Room 
salons were added to existing stores.
Engagement
Customer and colleague engagement is central 
to the Group’s success, creating loyalty and like-
for-like sales growth. Through our highly trained 
and engaged colleagues, we seek to increase 
our share of spend with current customers and 
extend the Pets At Home experience to new 
customers.
colleague engagement levels, which are 
measured through an internally collated survey, 
were 93% in FY14 (FY13: 93%). Being able to 
maintain such a high level of engagement is 
reflective of our rewards system, the specialist 
training offered, and the opportunity for 
colleagues to change roles and diversify their 
skill sets within the business. 
Colleague retention rates decreased marginally 
in FY14 to 81% (FY13: 83%), but such a rate 
still places Pets At Home as a leader within the 
retail industry. 
Pets At Home measures customer advocacy 
through the Net Promoter Score (“NPS”), 
gathered through Fish4opinion.co.uk, a 
customer service survey website operated 
by the Group. With over 110,000 customer 
feedback points over the year, FY14 NPS levels 
were maintained at 84% (FY13: 84%). During 
the year, we implemented some changes to 
the way in which NPS is measured, effectively 
raising the threshold at which we consider 
scores given by customers to represent a 
positive experience. If we had maintained the 
same criteria as the previous year, NPS would 
have been 86%. This is a key example of our 
values in action: challenging our standards and 
getting better every day.
Our fundraising initiatives on behalf of our 
nominated charity, Support Adoption For Pets, 
also grew strongly during the year. Support 
Adoption For Pets, which is the largest animal 
re-homing charity in the UK, raised £2.65m for 
national animal welfare charities and local re-
homing organisations during the year and has 
raised over £10m since its inception in 2006. 
Space and footprint expansion
A key part of the Group’s strategy is to increase 
the number of stores, in-store and standalone 
veterinary practices, and Groom Room salons.
During FY14, Pets At Home opened 32 new 
stores, bringing the total store portfolio to 377 
across the UK. The portfolio includes the new 
trial high street store format, Barkers. ‘Barkers 
of Wilmslow’ opened in Wilmslow, Cheshire, 
in March 2014, featuring high end exclusive 
luxury dog products, at the premium end of the 
market.

Chief Executive Officer’ s review
continued
During the year, we became the largest provider 
of small animal veterinary services to pet 
owners in the UK, with a vet portfolio at year 
end of 277 practices. Of the 69 new veterinary 
practices opened, 18 were retrofits to current 
stores, 29 were new in-store locations and 
22 were standalone practices. Pets at Home 
operates the only large scale Joint Venture 
veterinary services model in the UK market, 
under our two veterinary brands – Companion 
Care, our original veterinary brand, and 
Vets4Pets, acquired in March 2013. The Joint 
Venture (JV) model allows each vet practice to 
operate as an independent business, jointly 
owned by Pets At Home and a veterinary 
JV partner, funded by small loans into the 
business by the JV partner and Pets At Home, 
alongside a larger, independent bank loan. The 
ownership structure enables all profits and 
capital accretion within the JV to accrue to the 
vet partner. This structure gives us the ability 
to work closely with the partner to develop their 
business and overcome any challenges, which 
is key to the success of the business model. 
The JV vet partner pays a service charge, 
reflecting the cost of the space occupied in 
store, and a percentage of their revenue in the 
form of fee income to Pets At Home, whilst we 
provide all the administrative and back office 
support, allowing the vet partner and their 
colleagues to focus on clinical excellence and 
delivering the best possible service to pets and 
their owners.
The current vet portfolio has 119 Companion 
Care practices and 158 Vets4Pets practices 
(of which 92 were acquired in 2013). Going 
forward, we are opening all new surgeries 
under the Vets4Pets brand and working with 
our current Joint Venture partners to move 
to Vets4Pets branding, which will enable 
advertising synergies across the Vet Group, 
leveraging national brand awareness with 
potential new customers.
Groom Room rollout was particularly strong 
during the year, with 42 new openings, of which 
11 were retrofits and 31 within new stores. 
The UK grooming services market is highly 
fragmented and the Groom Room is positioned 
as the only branded chain in the market, ideally 
positioned to benefit from increased demand.

Going forward, Pets At Home has a strong 
store and services rollout programme. Current 
analysis, conducted in conjunction with CACI, 
shows the potential for over 500 stores, 45 
in-store vets, over 250 standalone vets and 
over 300 grooming salons in the UK market.
Focus on gross margin
The Group remains focused on innovation, 
increasing brand choice for customers and 
developing its own brand and private label 
offerings in order to improve margins. Higher 
margin Advanced Nutrition (AN) and private 
label products, such as Wainwright’s, are an 
important contributor. During the year, we 
launched a number of new AN brands to stores, 
helping to drive AN revenues to 56% of total 
dog and cat food revenues, excluding food 
treats (FY13: 53%). Wainwright’s dog food also 
continued to gain popularity, growing by 26.7% 
to £27.2m (FY13: £21.4m). Own brand and 
private label products represented 42.4% 
of gross store revenues during the year  
(FY13: 42.1%).
As our vet practices and Groom Room salons 
continue to mature, we have begun to see an 
increasing contribution to Group profitability. 
The JV vet practices take up to seven years 
to mature, although they are profitable to the 
Group from opening, through the percentage 
of revenue payment and start-up fees. As the 
JVs mature and reach higher utilisation rates 
there is an opportunity for our revenue stream 
to increase without a significant increase in 
our cost base, delivering margin leverage. 
Within the Groom Room business, new salons 
are dilutive in the first two years, with maturity 
achieved after five years. We remain excited 
about the further maturation and potential 
margin benefit the services opportunity 
presents.
Summary and outlook
Pets At Home has delivered excellent results 
in the past financial year, increasing like-
for-like sales, improving underlying EBITDA 
margin, delivering on the rollout programme, 
strengthening our pet services offer and 
increasing the profile of the brand.
The pet care market outlook remains good. 
Whilst economic indicators for the UK are 
positive, the lack of a sustained increase in 
consumer disposable incomes gives some 
caution to the outlook. We remain comfortable 
with market expectations for the coming 
financial year.
The Group will continue to execute its strategy, 
leveraging a number of growth opportunities: 
improving like-for-like sales, increasing space 
and optimising our footprint through the 
inclusion of pet services, and maintaining a 
focus on gross margin. We expect to open 
around 25 stores, 60 veterinary practices and 
50 Groom Room salons in FY15.
The Board and executive management team 
remain confident in the future prospects of the 
Group.

VIP Club experiencing rapid growth
Our VIP Club provides another avenue for 
engagement with customers. Launched in 
November 2012, the scheme has a number of 
unique features which differentiate it from other 
loyalty programmes. Each time a card is swiped, 
lifelines are generated for the customer’s 
chosen animal charity. Lifelines then convert 
to charity donations, in the form of gift cards, 
funded by Pets At Home. 
We encourage our customers to register all 
their pets as part of their VIP membership, 
which allows us to deliver communications 
and offers directly related to their pet – 
including birthday letters! Membership also 
allows customers to receive a copy of the 
VIP magazine, with a broad range of relevant 
content and a great range of discounts and 
vouchers in each issue, which has a readership 
of over 1 million. 
VIP Club communications and targeted 
marketing allow us to cross promote relevant 
products and services, as well as increase 
our share of own and private label products. 
This year, ahead of the Wainwright’s cat food 
launch, we were able to target cat owners within 
the VIP Club database, particularly those who 
were already purchasing Wainwright’s dog food. 
These members were sent targeted emails, 
resulting in 55% of Wainwright’s cat food launch 
sales being attributable VIP Club members.

Responsible retailing is at the heart of our business 
and is guided by our three pillars: caring for the 
environment, sourcing with integrity and our  
pets people.
Responsible retailing
Goals
Our goals are to be a low-carbon, low-waste and low energy 
company. To achieve this we need to inspire and engage our 
colleagues, our customers, our suppliers and our communities.

As we expanded over the years, we recognised that our weight of 
responsibility in these areas grew, so we developed our Responsible 
Retailing plan.
For us, Responsible Retailing is supported by three pillars:
 Caring for the Environment
 Sourcing with Integrity
 Our Pets People
Pets At Home recognises the importance of environmental and social 
issues and has in place a dedicated corporate social responsibility 
(CSR) committee. Under the direction of the CSR committee, we 
scrutinise every aspect of our business operations and seek to 
balance the competing aims of the business to ensure that we are 
fostering the preservation and protection of the environment, whilst at 
the same time recognising our wider social responsibility through all 
of our commercial activities and operations. 
What this means for Pets At Home
Caring for the Environment
Caring for the environment means looking at every area of our business and analysing ways 
in which we can be greener . Climate change is the greatest environmental challenge facing 
the world today so we have stepped up efforts to address our impact on the environment. In 
reaching our environmental objectives, Pets At Home is committed to:
Corporate social 
responsibility
Recycling our rubbish
Taking action on waste is essential. This year, 
the Pets at Home diversion from landfill target 
was 80%. Pets At Home exceeded this target 
by achieving 83% diversion from landfill. The 
majority of waste produced by Pets At Home, 
such as cardboard, plastic and animal bedding, 
is recyclable and in total 6,219 tonnes was 
recycled. Pets At Home also produced 2,431 
tonnes of general waste, and working with our 
service provider, we diverted 964 tonnes to 
various treatment facilities, such as Refuge 
Derived Fuel (RDF) where waste is shredded 
and bulk burned as an alternative to fossil 
fuels. General waste has also been sent to 
biomass and incineration. 
We are always looking for new ways in which 
to divert our waste from landfill and this year, 
we introduced dry mixed recycling (DMR) in 
those stores where we have both a vet and 
Groom Room so that we could recycle the 
plastic bottles, cans, cardboard, paper and 
other dry general waste produced. This waste 
is then sent to a waste recovery plant where 
it is recycled so that it can be used again. We 
trialled this initiative in 48 stores and we have 
had some great results which can be seen in 
our total recycling figures so we are now rolling 
this out to all stores with the same format.

Using less electricity
In 2007, we asked the Carbon Trust to look at 
ways we could use less energy. Since then, we 
have implemented a number of their ideas. This 
year, we recruited Green Paws Champs in all of 
our stores to educate other colleagues in-store 
on energy reduction and possible measures 
that can be taken to reduce consumption. 
Green Paws Champs have been contacted on a 
regular basis with the store energy performance 
figures, and advised on ways in which to bring 
down usage. 
Together with the work carried out by our Green 
Paws Champs, we have also rolled out LED 
lighting into all of our stores in the aquatics 
fish tanks and also the small animal villages 
which will reduce the amount of electricity we 
use in these units. The projected annual saving 
on this rollout is 1,155,314 kWh on aquatics 
and 190,944 kWh on small animal villages. 
The saving on consumption was not the only 
driver for the project, there are also pet welfare 
benefits. Using LED lights in the fish tanks 
means that less algae builds up so our fish 
have a much better environment to live in. In 
the small animal villages, the LEDs do not 
generate as much heat 
(a reduction from 59 to 
28 degrees centrigrade), 
resulting in a cooler and 
better environment for the 
pets (and air conditioning 
not having to work as hard). LEDs have been 
incorporated into the new store specification 
to ensure that they are installed in both the 
aquatics and the small animal villages on all 
new stores. 
A signage refurbishment programme was also 
launched throughout the year so that when 
the existing fluorescent tubes on sign lights 
fail, they are now replaced with equivalent LED 
lamps, with the average payback at less than 
one year. This will be installed in all new and 
refurbished store signage going forward.
Next year, we will start measuring the impact 
of these new fittings on our electricity 
consumption in stores.
Becoming more fuel-efficient
We continuously focus on getting more miles 
out of every litre of fuel used in our vehicles. 
In 2008 we were getting 2.65 kilometres per 
litre (KPL). In September 2013, we insourced 
the dedicated transport operations based at 
our Stoke and Northampton distribution centres 
(DCs). As part of the engagement programme 
for the drivers involved in the transition to in-
house, we relaunched our fuel efficiency drive 
(including the driver training) which has resulted 
in an improved KPL performance from 2.79 KPL 
in October 2013 to 2.82 KPL in March 2014. 
In October 2011, the Department of Transport 
(DoT) announced that it was preparing the 
industry to trial 900 trailers in the UK that 
would be an additional 2 metres in length from 
the current provisions. This would allow the 
area of a vehicle that carries the payload (in 
our case picked pallets of stock for stores) 
from 13.6 to 15.65 metres. Our main haulage 
service provider applied to the DoT on our 
behalf for permission to be part of this trial 
and in January 2012 we were given the green 
light. We commissioned four new extra length 
trailers. These trailers, as with most of the 
fleet, are double deck trailers but instead of 
a carrying capacity of 52 pallets, they can 
carry 60 pallets of stock at a time. Even 
though we have insourced the majority of our 
transport fleet, we have retained, through a 
rental arrangement, with our lead third party 
provider, the extra length trailers for our inter 
site trunking operation and this, combined with 
continued scheduling improvements for the 
expanding store estate, has further reduced 
the number of kilometres run per 1,000 cases 
shipped from 137.7 in FY13 to 126.1 in FY14, 
an improvement of 8.4%.

Pets Before Profit
Pets Before Profit has been a core value at Pets 
At Home since the business was established in 
1991. We have implemented many changes over 
the years to ensure that we are doing our best to 
achieve this aim, including making ‘We Put Pets 
before Profit’ our number one value.
We have a dedicated pet team in place 
consisting of an experienced veterinary surgeon 
as our Head of Pets, who also sits on the board 
of the Pet Industry Federation and chairs their 
Pet Ethics Group and is a trustee of The Pet 
Charity. She is ably assisted by two vet nurses, 
one with a diploma in nursing exotic species, a 
Coldwater & Marine Biologist to look after the 
aquatics, a reptile expert, a pet supply manager 
who audits our suppliers, and a Pet Operations 
Manager who manages the team of nine Field 
Pet Managers, who audit the pet standards in 
our stores. 
In addition to all our in-house expertise, we use 
a leading Exotic Specialist Vet as a consultant, 
who also performs an annual welfare audit 
on our primary suppliers and the Ex-Chief 
Prosecution Officer for the RSPCA, who advises 
us on welfare issues.
At the heart of our business is responsible pet 
ownership and it underpins the way in which we 
do business. We remain committed to supplying 
small animals, fish and reptiles that are 
sourced legally, ethically and with due regard for 
the environment. 
We continue to challenge and revise the codes 
of practice we have in place for each of our pet 
suppliers to ensure that they reflect the high 
standards we expect to be maintained. 
This year we retained the services of a leading 
Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons Vet who 
will start performing an annual audit of our 
primary breeders as an extra level of external 
verification in FY15, and SAI Global, who 
perform the Red Tractor Audits, will also be 
carrying out annual audits of our primaries from 
FY15. These are in addition to the inspections 
already carried out by our own Pet Team. Red 
Tractor is a food assurance scheme which 
covers production standards developed by 
experts on safety, hygiene, animal welfare and 
the environment.
We have revamped our Store Pet Audit in FY14 
to place even more emphasis on reptiles 
and increased the number of store audits 
carried out by our Field Pet Managers. All 
stores continue to receive a strict annual audit 
from SAI Global under the Pet Care Trust QA 
standard as we believe external verification is 
vital to maintaining standards. 
We have introduced an iPad for the pet sales 
process called PetPad, which ensures that 
certain questions must be answered correctly 
or the sale of the pet cannot proceed, to help 
ensure that we sell responsibly and match 
the owner to the right pet. All colleagues are 
empowered to refuse to sell a pet if they have 
any concerns about the home to which it would 
be going. We have also introduced this year 
a three-day temperature check when selling a 
reptile, to ensure the environment they will be 
going into is correct, thus preventing impulse 
buys of reptiles.

Our colleagues, 95% of whom own pets, have to 
complete a certain level of training before they 
are even allowed to sell a pet. Our training is 
industry leading and pet welfare is so important 
to us that all store colleagues, irrespective of 
their background or previous animal related 
qualifications, have to complete our training 
programme to ensure that we offer consistent 
knowledge and the latest thinking and advice to 
our customers. 
The Steps programme underpins our training, 
which comprises four levels of detailed training, 
with options to specialise in various areas 
such as ‘wet’ or ‘pet’ as you progress. Step 4 
was introduced this year and is taking selected 
colleagues to a high level of expertise in their 
chosen area. We also have Suitably Qualified 
Persons (SQPs), who are trained to sell certain 
medicinal products and Nutritional Consultants 
who can advise customers on the best diet 
for their pet. We have introduced compulsory 
continuing personal development CPD to 
ensure we stay up to date with our information.
As part of our strategic partnership with the 
RSPCA, we launched a range of co-branded pet 
care leaflets which are available free in-store 
and are given away with every pet purchased.
Our colleagues keep a close eye on the diet 
and eating habits of our in-store pets, with 
centrally ordered fruit and vegetables helping 
to provide nutritional balance. Their homes are 
carefully monitored, too: we recently changed 
our rabbit and guinea pig housing from all-wood 
to glass in order to reduce the risk of infection, 
while our reptiles are housed in the most up-to-
date vivariums. We also constantly review the 
products we sell to make sure that we have pet 
welfare at heart. We recently phased out the 
sale of rabbit muesli in our store due to the 
potential negative effects it could have on the 
health of our customers’ rabbits.
As detailed above in the section on energy 
usage, we regularly invest in pet welfare and 
during the year, we completed an upgrade of our 
in-store fish system. We have introduced LED 
lighting in fish tanks and small animal villages 
as these lights reduce heating in the tanks and 
enclosures and reduce the growth of algae in 
tanks, thereby reducing cleaning frequency and 
pet stress.
Ethical Trading
Our responsible sourcing approach is not 
limited to our pet suppliers. We have a team 
of technical experts in both our UK support 
office and Asian sourcing office. In the UK we 
have four technical colleagues and a further 
five in Hong Kong. On top of this, we work very 
closely with two independent third party quality 
providers both in the UK and across Asia.
In the UK the technical team develops all the 
product standards that we believe allow us to 
sell products to pets that are safe, legal and 
fit for purpose. The role of the Asian technical 
team is to ensure that these standards are 
understood and delivered against by the 
factories manufacturing our products. The 
Asia team, alongside the aforementioned 
independent third parties, is also accountable 
for ensuring that all the factories we buy from 
are audited in line with both our ethical and 
technical requirements.

The Asia team have also held (and will continue 
to do so) a number of supplier education 
workshops, by product type, with our Asian 
supplier base. These interactive workshops 
allow Pets At Home to ensure its suppliers 
are fully aware of the technical and ethical 
standards required, and how these link into 
our core value of pets before profit. From a 
supplier’s perspective the workshops are a 
forum to ask questions, seek clarification and 
also suggest ideas that may help to further 
improve the quality of our products.
On the food side of our business the UK 
technical team is also completing random 
testing on products, with the help of an 
independent third party. These tests allow us 
to ensure that declared ingredients, nutritional 
values and various on-pack claims are correct 
and in line with all legislation including DNA 
testing on our meat-based products to verify the 
source of the raw ingredients.
Basic level reporting, developed within Pets At 
Home, allows us to monitor the performance 
of our suppliers, categories and products on 
a frequent basis. This data is shared with our 
suppliers on a regular basis, and allows us 
to receive feedback from our customers as 
they use our products with their pets. This 
information has enabled us to make changes to 
a number of our products such as our Ruffer n 
Tuffer range that ensure we get better every day 
and offer continually improved safe, legal and  
fit for purpose products.
Animal Testing
We are committed to ensuring that our products 
meet the highest quality and safety standards 
in the UK Pet Care Market and so in FY13, 
we developed and implemented two animal 
testing policies for food and non-food suppliers. 
These only allow non-intrusive testing of Pets 
At Home’s products such as tasting trials on 
pet foods plus destruction testing on dog 
toys. These policies are now appended to the 
latest version of Pets At Home’s quality manual 
and have been issued to all suppliers. During 
FY14, we continued to seek confirmation of 
adherence of our suppliers with the  
relevant policy.

Cutting Down on Packaging Waste
Over the last year, the packaging team 
has worked to reduce packaging material 
volume by continually looking to optimize 
packaging solutions whilst maintaining the 
primary function of protecting the product, 
clearly providing customer information and 
communicating product propositions. 
One of the most significant changes this 
year has been the move of our largest brand 
Wainwright’s dry dog food from a paper 
laminated bag to a plastic laminate material. 
This has resulted in a reduction in packaging 
volume by weight in excess of 30% and 
delivered a significant reduction in product 
wastage in distribution and at store level due 
to split bags. Currently this material is not 
recyclable through kerb-side collection in the UK 
however we are continuing to pursue a material 
solution that provides widespread recyclability, 
product suitability and structural integrity to 
hold 15kg.
Our Pets At Home cat litter range has made 
a similar move from paper bags into plastic 
laminate leading to a 38% reduction in material 
volume across the premium range delivering a 
volume saving of over 8,000 kilos (8 tonnes) 
each time the range is reprinted.
We continue to support the application on 
all packaging of the WRAP OPRL Guidelines 
through the application of on pack recycling 
icons. The icons communicate the component 
level recyclability of the packaging helping 
consumers to separate waste effectively and 
recycle as much as possible.

Our Pets People
Great Place to Work
The role that highly engaged, highly trained 
colleagues play in the business is fundamental 
to the success of the Group’s business model. 
The retention and engagement of colleagues 
are key performance indicators within the 
business. colleague retention was 81% in 
FY14, having increased from 54.1% in the 2007 
financial year, and has been maintained at an 
average in excess of 80% over the past four 
financial years.
Pets At Home participated in The Sunday Times 
Best Companies awards, and was recognised 
as The Best Big Company to Work For in the 
UK in FY14, after having been placed second 
in the same awards in 2012. In 2014, we have 
entered the Great Place to Work survey and 
will be participating in the Best Workplaces in 
the UK later in the year. As this survey is also 
conducted across the world, the results will 
establish international benchmarks.
Colleagues are recruited for their passion for 
both pets and people, for their ability to work 
as a team and their desire to share their love 
of pets with customers. As detailed above, 
for our retail colleagues, a structured training 
programme known as ‘Steps’ is mandatory and 
takes a minimum of nine months to complete. 
To encourage our trained pet experts to 
stay with the Group, a culture of reward and 
recognition has been built known as the ‘Carrot 
Culture’. Rewards include the ‘Earn As You 
Learn’ scheme and an all colleague bonus 
scheme alongside short-term incentives, reward 
vouchers and thank you cards. Birthday Leave 
allows colleagues to take their birthday off, 
and long service is rewarded with certificates, 
presents and extra holiday. 
Bringing the Group’s values to life is a key way 
of working, and creating many opportunities for 
the colleagues across the business to have fun 
whilst they work is regarded as an essential 
element in the creation of an engaged culture. 
Delivery of the engagement score via ‘We’re All 
Ears’ is a key performance indicator included in 
senior managers’ bonus schemes.
Management development for the retail 
business follows a structured programme from 
‘Rising Stars’ to ‘FastTrack’, allowing colleagues 
to progress from colleague to store manager. 
Within the Group’s support offices and 
distribution centres, there is a range of 
development programmes from the ‘WOW’ 
day (a feedback and communication day 
with colleagues), and structured induction 
programme to the ‘LEAD’ programme, a 
development programme for the senior rising 
stars led by the executive team.
We are also committed to ensuring a safe 
environment for all of our colleagues and 
customers, and actively encourage positive 
Health and Safety Culture throughout the 
Group.
Support Adoption for Pets At Home  
and other pet charities
The Group continues to support the charity 
‘Support Adoption For Pets’ (“Charity”) through 
extensive fundraising activities in Stores, the 
Support Office and both Distribution Centres. 
The Charity raised over £2.5m last year with its 
largest income stream of £1.5m raised through 
three main fundraising events run throughout 
the year. The Spring and October Fundraising 
Drives have contributed the greatest levels of 
income and are well supported by colleagues, 
customers and our suppliers. The popularity 
of the raffle and the volume of ticket sales 
enabled a car to be offered as the top 
prize, raising awareness and interest in the 
fundraising event, which was widely promoted in 
the local press. The car raffle contributed over 
£358,260 towards the £457,350 raised over 
the four weeks. 
At Christmas every store supported the new 
Santa Paws Appeal, when all of our customers 
were asked to donate 50p to provide a pet in 
a rescue with a Christmas dinner. This was 
incredibly well supported with 553,120  
dinners being donated from 1st December  
to Christmas Eve. 
60,616 pets have also been re-homed 
through the Adoption Centres operated in 
our stores with £563,826 in donations being 
received from their new owners. The Group 
continued to support the charity by investing 
in providing adoption centres in each of its 
new superstores, bringing the total number 
of Adoption Centres to 352. The increase in 
donations and fundraising has enabled the 
Charity to award £2,150,475 in grants over 
the last 12 months ranging from £300 to 
£120,000 to fund a variety of projects for a 
wide range of rescues and re-homing centres.

This was an increase from the £1,400,000 in 
grants awarded in the previous year. In addition, 
the Charity has also been able to fund the 
development of two further RSPCA re-homing 
centres within our Friern Barnet and Newport 
South Wales stores, bringing the RSPCA’s 
centres to three and also the first Battersea 
Dogs and Cats ‘Home from Home’ centre in the 
Sydenham store providing a further centre for 
the local charity with an international following. 
These areas are manned by the Charities with 
the remainder of the operating costs being paid 
for by Pets At Home. 
The damaged stock scheme operated by both 
DCs whereby damaged stock from our two 
Centres is distributed to stores for collection 
by local rescues continues to increase in 
popularity with re-homing centres. Since the 
introduction of the scheme over 435 rescues 
have registered and received donations. This 
support is invaluable to rescues since they 
often need more than just financial help.
The other Charity supported over the last 
12 months was Children in Need. A week of 
fundraising in stores using the ‘Round up to 
£1’ function on our tills, where customers are 
asked to round their shopping to the nearest 
pound with the difference being donated to the 
Charity raised £12,722. 
The advent of the VIP Club, whose reward 
currency for shopping is ‘Lifeline’ points, allows 
the Group to further support its customers’ 
nominated pet charities, as the points convert 
into gift cards which the customers’ nominated 
charities can spend in Pets At Home stores. 
Due to the success of the Lifelines programme, 
the Group entered into an agreement in 
July 2013 to provide £2 million worth of 
Wainwright’s food (at retail value) to feed dogs 
awaiting re-homing at The Dogs Trust re-homing 
centres across the UK over a three-year period.
Our Community
In order to promote involvement in the local 
community and competition between stores, 
a few years ago, we put in place ‘My Pond 
League’ where each store earns points for 
the level of customer service and the number 
of local events that they hold in-store. This 
continues to be an important part of the 
Group’s engagement with the local community. 
We have worked closely with scouting 
organisations for years with our sponsorship of 
their animal care badge and to help members 
to gain this badge, we offer free workshops in 
all of our stores. In the year we have more than 
doubled the number of Beaver and Cub events 
in-store. In FY13, we held 277 events and 
this increased to 622 in FY14. We have also 
become the number one downloaded resource 
pack in the Scouts organisation.

Our colleagues also visit local schools with 
our store pets to help educate children about 
responsible pet ownership in line with the 
national curriculum. We have also doubled the 
number of school visits from 204 in FY13 to 
417 in FY14.
For the first time in FY14 we included local work 
experience in ‘My Pond League’ and recorded 
855 local school children being given the 
opportunity to experience working life in our 
stores.
All these initiative have a combined benefit 
to both the store and the business since they 
ensure that each of our stores is seen as a 
part of the local community and it also allows 
us to promote responsible pet ownership to the 
pet owners of the future.
The Group recognises its responsibility for 
Health and Safety and there is accountability 
throughout the various management levels with 
the business.
Our Commitment to health and safety is best 
evidenced as follows:
 The Health and Safety Department are 
responsible for interpreting health and 
safety legislation and advising and guiding 
managers and colleagues in how to manage 
safely across the Group.
 The Department is also responsible for 
assisting in the development of Safety 
Management Systems and advising on 
safety procedures and standards across the 
Group. 
 The Vet Group has its own dedicated 
Health and Safety Manager who reports 
to the Health and Safety Department, who 
oversees an external Health and Safety 
service provider and carries out Inductions 
at all new Practices as well as being the 
key contact for day-to-day health and safety 
issues. 
 All Vets Practices receive an annual audit 
from our External service provider. 
 The Vet Group is now incorporated into the 
Group Accident Reporting procedure. This, 
together with an improved awareness of 
the reporting process across the business, 
has resulted in a 20% increase in the total 
number of reported accidents for the Group. 
However, our accident reporting system 
continues to aid the in-depth analysis of 
our accident statistics and will allow us to 
identify causes of accidents and take further 
steps to prevent them.

Chief Financial Officer’ s review
continued 
Sales and revenue
Total revenues in FY14 grew by 11.2% to 
£665.4m (FY13: £598.3m), with strong growth 
seen across all revenue categories: food, 
accessories and services. 
Like-for-like sales grew by 2.4% in the period, 
driven by VIP Club success, strength in 
Advanced Nutrition (AN), omni-channel, and 
the growing maturity of our Groom Rooms 
and vet practices. Cannibalisation as a result 
of new store rollout had a dilutive impact of 
around 1.8% on like-for-like sales growth, and 
we expect a similar cannibalisation impact in 
the coming year. In addition, sales in June/
July 2013, were adversely impacted by around 
£2.6m, from the sustained hot weather across 
the UK. Hot weather results in lower footfall and 
accessories sales, as shopping trips focus on 
necessities, principally food.
Total merchandise revenues, which includes 
food and accessories, grew by 8.6% in the year 
to £615.1m (FY13: £566.4m). 
We saw solid growth in food revenues, 
increasing by 9.8% to £327.1m (FY13: 
£297.9m), reflective of strong performance in 
AN, where revenues grew 17.8%. During the 
year, we launched a number of new AN brands 
to stores, including Barking Heads for dogs 
and Meowing Heads for cats. These new brand 
launches, as well as the continued success of 
brands such as Eukanuba, Arden Grange and 
Burns, helped to drive AN revenues to 56% 
of total dog and cat food revenues, excluding 
treats (FY13: 53%). Our private label brand, 
Wainwright’s dog food, also continued to gain 
in popularity, growing by 26.7% to £27.2m 
(FY13: £21.4m), supported by the launch 
of Wainwright’s Grain Free. Weaker areas in 
food revenues included wild bird food sales, 
which were negatively impacted by a mild 
autumn/winter with birds feeding adequately 
from natural sources, and the discontinuation 
of rabbit muesli following research from 
Edinburgh University Veterinarian School which 
demonstrated negative health impacts in 
rabbits.
In Accessories, revenues grew by 7.3% to 
£288.0m (FY13: 268.5m), driven by innovative 
product launches across dog collars, leads, dog 
fashion and toys. In particular, the ‘Summer 
Brights’ dog bed collection and ‘Platinum 
Space’ dog range performed well, as well as our 
‘Rustic Charm’ cat collection. We experienced 
some weakness in areas which are subject to 
greater discretionary spend, such as live pets, 
and small animal and aquatics accessories. 
Services revenues grew by 57.4% to £50.3m 
(FY13: £31.9m), reflective of a full year of 
Vets4Pets revenues, following its acquisition 
in March 2013. This partly accounts for the 
increased proportion of services revenues, 
at 7.6% of total revenues in FY14 (FY13: 
5.3%). Removing the impact of the Vets4Pets 
acquisition, services revenues still grew 
strongly, by 25.0%, reflecting in part the 
maturation from new veterinary practices and 
grooming salons, as well as strong performance 
from established veterinary practices which we 
believe continue to grow at above market rates. 
Like-for-like revenues generated within the Joint 
Venture veterinary practices grew by 14.0% 
during the year.
Gross margin
Overall FY14 gross margin contracted by  
32bps to 53.8% (FY13: 54.1%), which is 
attributable to a mix effect, as relatively lower 
gross margin services became a larger part of 
the overall business. 
Gross margins within Merchandise grew 
by 14 bps compared with the prior year, at 
56.1% (FY13: 56.0%). Positive contributors 
to the Merchandise gross margin included 
a continued benefit from improvements in 
terms negotiations, as well as global sourcing 
agreements, where we saw margin gains from 
the procurement of accessories through Asia. 
Higher margin AN and private label products, 
such as Wainwright’s, were also an important 
positive contributor to margin expansion. 
Whilst we grew gross margins in both Food and 
Accessories, a 59 bps sales mix shift from 
higher margin accessories to food diluted the 
overall Merchandise margin gain to 14 bps 
during the year. 
Gross margin within the services business 
expanded to 26.3% (FY13: 22.5%), mainly 
attributable to higher gross margin veterinary 
services being a larger part of the overall 
mix, resulting from the Vets4Pets acquisition 
and strong like-for-like growth within existing 
practices. Margin synergies have been achieved 
since the acquisition, combining three support 
offices into one and leveraging the significant 
scale increase, resulting in the delivery of 
£2.7m of synergy benefits during the year. 
This benefit outweighed the dilutive impact of 
increasing the number of wholly owned Group 
Venture (GV) veterinary practices by five during 
the year, as well as the significant Groom 
Room salon rollout, where recently opened 
wholly owned vet practices and newer salons 
are initially margin dilutive. Services and other 
gross margin was also negatively impacted by 
our investment in live pet care within stores, 
where we continually invest to improve welfare 
standards.
Looking forward, at a total gross margin level 
for the Group, we expect to begin to see a 
benefit from services maturation and growth, 
whilst continuing to see modest Merchandise 
margin expansion.
Operating costs
Selling and distribution expenses of £233.9m 
were 35.2% of revenue (FY13: 36.0%) reflecting 
efficiency improvements in the two distribution 
centres that serve our growing store base. 
Rent costs continued to benefit from a 
relatively benign rental market, as well as the 
expansion of the Vets Group, with the opening 
of 18 retrofit practices in-store generating 
incremental service charge income. Offsetting 
these improvements, we have seen increased 
marketing costs from the expansion of our VIP  
Pets At Home Group Plc

Club, alongside increased costs from ‘auto 
enrolment’ pension legislation and in-store 
colleagues progressing through our ‘Steps’ 
training programme.
Administration expenses of £34.8m, before 
exceptional items, were 5.2% of revenue (FY13: 
5.0%), reflecting increased support for our 
Ride-Away business in its first full year in the 
Group and higher depreciation, colleague and 
licence costs in business systems following the 
successful implementation of SAP .
Underlying EBITDA
Underlying EBITDA of £110.7m represented a 
12.4% increase on the previous year (FY13: 
£98.5m) attributable in part to the acquisition 
of Vets4Pets and Ride-away at the end of 
FY13. We also saw expansion in our underlying 
EBITDA margin, to 16.6%, reflecting the 
leverage from our growing services business, 
which is accretive at an EBITDA level. All direct 
costs, principally colleague costs, associated 
with the delivery of the veterinary and Groom 
Room services are allocated at a cost of sales 
level, representing the majority of the cost base 
associated with the delivery of our services. 
Around £1.9m of indirect costs are allocated 
within operating expenses.
Exceptional expenses of £10.6m during the 
year were attributable to costs associated 
with the Initial Public Offering on 17th March 
2014 (£9.4m), and costs associated with the 
integration of the Vets4Pets business (£2.3m) 
net of a significant VAT refund (£1.1m).

Underlying finance expense for the year was

£19.2m represent accelerated amortisation

Going forward, under the new post-IPO capital 
structure, we expect net financing costs of 
around 3.0% per annum.
Taxation and profit after tax
Total tax expense for the period was £9.0m, 
representing a tax expense of £13.7m on 
underlying trading profit before tax of £52.2m, 
offset by a tax credit of £4.7m attributable 
to exceptional items related to the Group 
restructuring as part of the IPO process. 
The tax deductible items included within 
exceptionals include the amortisation of 
finance costs in relation to finance which has 
been repaid, and redundancy costs associated 
with the Vets4Pets acquisition. Also included 
in exceptional costs are transaction costs 
in relation to the IPO process, for which no 
corporation tax relief is assumed.

Chief Financial Officer’s review 42
Risks and uncertainties 48 23410.04    17 July 2014 5:32 PM    PROOF 9
Within the underlying trading profit before tax of 
£52.2m, there are some items which are non-
deductible for corporation tax purposes, which 
have resulted in an effective tax rate of 26%, 
higher than the statutory corporation tax rate 
for the period of 23%. These items include an 
element of non-deductible related party interest 
and non-deductible depreciation in respect 
of capital expenditure. In addition, prior year 
adjustments of £0.9m, in respect of current tax 
and deferred tax, have increased the effective 
tax rate further. Our expected effective tax rate 
for the current financial year is 22%. 
Profit for the period, after tax, was £13.5m 
(FY13: £20.5m). The year-on-year movement 
is representative of a £14.7m increase 
in exceptional costs, offset by a £7.7m 
improvement in the profit for the period 
associated with underlying trading.
Net income and earnings per share
Underlying trading net income for the 
period was £38.6m (FY13: £30.8m). After 
subtracting a dividend of £37.6m payable as a 
consequence of the pre IPO capital structure, 
basic underlying Earnings Per Share, calculated 
on an average weighted 175.1m shares in 
issue, was 1 pence. The weighted average 
share count for FY14 is reflective of the 166m 
shares outstanding pre IPO, with 500m shares 
in issue post listing.
Cash flows
Pets At Home continues to deliver strong cash 
flow generation. In FY14, the Group generated 
£124.6m (FY13: £115.0m) of net cash from 
operating activities. Underlying unlevered free 
cash flow before interest, tax and acquisitions 
was £92.4m (FY13: £96.8m), representing a 
cash conversion rate of 83.5% (FY13: 98.2%). 
Underlying free cash flow has been adjusted 
through the removal of a  
£25.2m increase in other payables, reflecting 
payments associated with IPO costs 
outstanding at year end. 
Borrowings and net debt
The Group’s underlying net debt position at 
year end was £259.1m, adjusted for a timing 
difference in IPO and Plc related costs due 
to be paid from cash received as a result of 
primary proceeds raised from the IPO. This 
represents a leverage ratio of 2.34× underlying 
EBITDA.
We expect our leverage ratio to decline to 
under 2.0× underlying EBITDA by the end of the 
current financial year, and to decrease by 0.5× 
per annum in the following years, as our cash 
flows remain adequate to fund our space rollout 
programme, invest for future growth, deliver 
future returns to shareholders and service debt.

Working capital
Working capital improved by £9.7m in the 
year (FY13: £19.3m), excluding a £25.2m 
increase in other payables, reflecting payments 
associated with IPO costs outstanding at 
year end. The movement in working capital is 
made up of additional investment in inventory 
of £4.0m and an increase in receivables of 
£8.0m offset by an increase in trade and other 
payables of £21.7m.
The increase in inventory of £4.0m reflects the 
growth in the business, specifically the opening 
of 32 new stores. This increase in inventory 
is more than offset by an increase in trade 
creditors. 
£5.1m of the increase in trade and other 
receivables relates to the timing of a 
refinancing within the Vets Group to ensure 
the Group had sufficient facilities for new JV 
partners to draw upon, to deliver our growth 
plans over the next two years. This required the 
group to temporarily fund a number of practice 
openings in the latter stages of the 2014 
financial year. The remaining increase in trade 
and other receivables relates to the impact 
from integrating Vets4Pets which is more than 
offset by a corresponding movement within 
trade and other payables, as the integration 
overall delivered a net working capital benefit of 
£3.1m to the Group.
The significant increase in trade and other 
payables of £21.7m is partially offset by the 
increase in inventory and the integration of the 
Vets4Pets business as outlined above. Also 
contributing to the movement in trade and other 
creditors are further improvement to supplier 
terms in the Group, particularly in relation to 
products sourced through our sourcing office 
in Asia. The Group also saw a working capital 
benefit in FY14 relating to the timing of Easter 
in 2013 when the Easter weekend fell in the 
first weekend of FY14 accelerating payments 
pre-year end due to the timing of the Easter 
bank holidays.
Going forward, we expect a modest 
improvement in our working capital.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure was £30.0m for the FY14 
(FY13: £22.0m), reflective of our new store 
openings, store refurbishment programme to 
facilitate pet services retrofitting (including the 
installation of mezzanines where necessary), 
new services rollout and the introduction 
of SAP . During the year, 32 new stores were 
opened with a capital expenditure cost of 
£10.9m (FY13: 32 stores at £10.7m). Major 
refurbishment capital expenditure totalled 
£5.1m as 20 stores were upgraded to facilitate 
the addition of vets and groomers, with two 
mezzanine floors added.
In order to support the vet and Groom Room 
retrofit programme, including mezzanine 
additions to stores, we expect total capital 
expenditure requirements to increase to around 
£34–35m per year going forward, which will be 
funded from operating cash flows. 
Dividend
The Board’s current intention is to adopt a 
progressive dividend policy whilst maintaining 
an appropriate level of dividend cover, allowing 
us to retain sufficient capital within the Group 
to execute our growth strategy and meet our 
working capital needs, whilst at the same time 
returning value to shareholders. We still expect 
to target the commencement of a dividend 
payment in the FY15, with a payout ratio of 
30–40%, split one-third and two-thirds between 
interim and final dividends respectively.

Risks and 
uncertainties
An effective risk management process has been adopted to help the 
Group achieve its strategic objectives and enjoy long-term success.
Our risk management process
The Board and Senior Management team are collectively responsible for managing risk across the 
Group. On a department by department basis risks are reviewed regularly and risk registers are 
updated at least three times a year. The teams meet to discuss and agree:

Reputation
Risk
The Group recognises the need to protect its 
reputation
Impact
Failure to do so could result in a loss of 
trust and confidence by both customers and 
colleagues.
Mitigation 
As a retailer of small pets across a large 
number of stores, the highest possible 
welfare standards must be maintained at 
all times. This also extends into the supply 
chain with our pet suppliers. We operate a 
comprehensive pet welfare audit process, 
utilising internal and external resources, 
where all stores receive unannounced visits 
on a regular basis. This helps ensure our 
high standards are maintained across the 
chain. With our suppliers, we expect the same 
high standards of welfare and all suppliers 
are visited regularly by vets, third party 
assessors, our field pet team and an animal 
welfare organisation and assessed against a 
comprehensive set of welfare and standards 
criteria.
The Group also deals with customers’ pets on 
a daily basis through its veterinary surgeries, 
Groom Room salons and Support Adoption 
centres, which may on occasion result in the 
death or injury of pets whilst in our care. We 
have a clear set of operational protocols, 
with the veterinary practices subject to the 
professional standards mandated by the 
Royal College of Veterinary Surgeons. We also 
have highly visible field operations resource 
in respect of in-store pets, grooming and 
veterinary surgeries. Each area has specific 
resource focused on ensuring the highest pet 
welfare standards are maintained.
A ‘Reputational Risk forum’ meets regularly 
to discuss this important area. Areas for 
further improvement are identified and actions 
implemented to ensure appropriate risk 
mitigation strategies are in place to protect 
our brand.
Competition
Risk 
The Group competes with a wide variety of 
retailers and vet practices, including other pet 
specialists, supermarkets and discounters. 
Online competition is also a risk, as large 
well known internet businesses expand into 
pet products and the established pet product 
sites improve and expand their offer.
Impact
Failure to keep abreast of, and respond to, 
developments by our competition in the areas 
of price, range, quality and service could have 
an adverse impact on the Group’s financial 
performance and impact opportunities for 
growth.
Mitigation
We continue to evolve our proposition through 
the addition of Vets and Groomers into our 
existing store estate whilst continuing to 
innovate with the regular introduction of new 
and exclusive products into our food and 
accessory ranges. As a specialist retailer, the 
delivery of friendly expertise through our highly 
engaged/trained store colleagues is a key 
element of our proposition and we continue 
to invest to ensure our service standards, 
as measured by our customers through 
Fish4opinion, are continually improved. The 
Pets At Home website was successfully 
upgraded in January 2014 to ensure we have 
a technology platform capable of supporting 
our online strategy. New site features include: 
click and collect, quick checkout, subscription 
services and improved site layout and content. 
The VIP (Very Important Pet) Club was 
launched in November 2012 and has been 
incredibly successful – attracting just under 2 
million members at Financial year end. This 
customer database enables more targeted 
marketing, which helps drive up basket values 
and enables us to build a stronger sense of 
engagement with our customers and their 
pets.
Continuous market research is carried out 
to review the pet market both at home and 
abroad and understand what our competitors 
are doing worldwide. This helps identify 
further changes/initiatives that need to be 
implemented to help keep Pets At Home 
ahead of the competition here in the UK and 
remain a leader in the market.
Stores and Services Expansion
Risk
A key part of the Group’s growth strategy is to 
increase the number of stores and to grow its 
in-store and standalone veterinary practices 
and Groom Room grooming salons.
Impact
If we are unable to deliver the number of 
sites necessary to fulfil the stores and 
service expansion laid out in our strategy, 
our expected financial performance could be 
adversely impacted.
Mitigation
To successfully open a new store, we have to, 
in the first instance, identify an appropriate 
location with lease terms that are acceptable. 
Any proposed new store investment has to 
deliver an appropriate financial return after 
taking into account any financial impact on 
the existing store portfolio. These processes 
are equally applicable when the Group looks 
to open a standalone veterinary practice. 
However, in common with our in-store 
veterinary practice opening programme, 
we also need to recruit a joint venture 
veterinary partner with the ability to fund their 
investment into the joint venture and with the 
ability to provide the personal guarantee to 
the bank providing the third party financing to 
the joint venture veterinary practice.
The business maintains new store and new 
joint venture partner pipelines which identify 
potential locations and potential partners at 
each stage of our process. This enables the 
Board to monitor progress in delivering the 
expected number of new stores, veterinary 
practices and groom rooms.

Risks and uncertainties
continued
Our People
Risk
As a specialist retailer, retaining highly 
trained and engaged colleagues is 
fundamental to our continued success and 
the delivery of our future growth.
Impact
If we do not retain and train our colleagues, it 
is unlikely that we will be able to deliver the 
outstanding customer service which is a key 
element of our proposition.
Mitigation
We continue to invest in training to broaden 
the skill base of colleagues across the 
business. We also closely monitor colleague 
retention rates and engagement, the 
latter through our annual ‘We’re All Ears’ 
engagement survey which is followed up by 
‘We’re All Action’ to ensure the business 
responds appropriately to opportunities 
for improvement raised by colleagues. We 
also have a rolling programme of listening 
groups across the business to ensure we are 
addressing issues on an ongoing basis.
As well as focusing on the development 
of existing talent within the business, we 
recognise that the retention of high calibre, 
talented, senior management with the skills 
necessary to deliver our growth plans is 
key to our future success. In this regard, 
our remuneration policy, as set out on 
pages 84 to 103, is designed to ensure 
executives of the necessary calibre are 
attracted and retained and that through our 
Long Term Initiative Plans and Company 
Share Option Plan, colleagues across the 
business can share in our success. Similarly 
we continually review the remuneration and 
benefits packages available to all colleagues 
to ensure our colleagues are appropriately 
rewarded for the substantial contribution they 
make to our growth and success.
Business Systems
Risk
We are aware of the need to keep core 
business systems up to date, with the 
capability to support the Group’s growth 
plans.
Impact
If our investments in both systems and 
infrastructure do not keep pace with the 
growth of the business there may be a 
consequent limitation to our ability to trade 
and expand. 
Mitigation
We are in the process of upgrading our 
business critical systems to industry leading 
packages, the first of which was SAP which 
successfully went live this financial year. Our 
warehouse management system is being 
replaced with JDA in the next financial year.
Disaster recovery is a key part of our 
systems strategy, enabling us to continue 
to trade in the event of a system outage. 
Disaster Recovery plans have been reviewed 
and updated and a schedule for regular 
testing is now in place. The business also 
undertakes regular system penetration 
testing.
Supply Chain/Sourcing
Risk
During the financial year, the Group imported 
approximately 17% of its total merchandise 
via Pets At Home Asia, the Group’s global 
sourcing company based in the Far East, 
and as a consequence we are exposed 
to the risks associated with international 
trade, such as inflation, changing regulatory 
frameworks and currency exposure. We are 
also exposed to the risks associated with 
the quality and safety of products produced 
globally on behalf of the Group, many of 
which are own branded or exclusive private 
labels.
Impact
A failure to adequately manage this risk 
could lead to reputational damage, reflected 
in a lack of confidence by customers and 
colleagues in the Group brands.
Mitigation
Having Pets At Home colleagues on the 
ground working collaboratively with suppliers 
enables us to monitor closely compliance 
with the Group’s Code of Ethics and Business 
Conduct policy, as well as compliance with 
our Supplier Quality Manual. In addition, 
unannounced visits are undertaken by an 
independent third party to further monitor 
compliance with Group policies.

p erformance and Financials 23410.04    17 July 2014 5:32 PM    PROOF 9
Liquidity and Credit Risk
Risk
The business requires adequate cash 
resources to enable it to fund its growth 
plans through its capital projects and/or an 
expansion of the Group’s working capital 
requirement.
Impact
Without adequate cash resources the Group 
may be unable to deliver its growth plans, 
with a consequent impact on future financial 
performance.
Mitigation
A key workstream undertaken as part of 
the IPO was the assessment of the Group’s 
financing requirement in the context of its 
growth plans.
As a result the Group is confident that it has 
adequate medium-term financing in place, 
with a broad syndicate of nine banks.
The Group’s growth plans in respect of joint 
venture veterinary practices is predicated 
on the availability of finance for new joint 
venture veterinary partners to fund both the 
capital cost and working capital requirement 
for each new practice opening. The Group 
has two revolving facilities in place with 
two major high street lenders which give us 
confidence that our medium-term growth 
plans are financed adequately.
The Group ensures that all cash surpluses 
are invested with banks which have credit 
ratings and investment criteria that meet the 
requirements set out in the Group Treasury 
policy, which has been approved by the 
Board.
The Group’s key suppliers are exposed to 
credit risk and as part of the Group’s overall 
risk management programme, the business 
has identified alternative suppliers and 
developed contingency plans, particularly in 
respect of Own Label and Private Label food 
products.
Treasury and Financial Risk
Risk
The Group has an exposure to exchange 
rate risk in respect of the US dollar which 
is the principal purchase currency for goods 
sourced from the Far East.
Impact
If we do not adequately manage this 
exposure there could be an impact on 
the Group’s financial performance with a 
consequential impact on operational and 
growth plans.
Mitigation
This exposure to FX fluctuation is managed 
via forward foreign currency contracts which 
are designated as cash flow hedges.
The Group has borrowings with floating 
interest rates linked to LIBOR, thereby 
exposing the Group to fluctuations in LIBOR 
and the consequent impact on interest cost. 
To manage this risk the Group has interest 
rate swaps in place which fix the interest 
rate on a significant proportion of the Group 
borrowings. Further details can be found on 
page 139.
All hedging activity is undertaken by the 
Group Treasury function in accordance with 
the Group Treasury policy which sets out the 
criteria for counterparties with whom the 
Group can transact and clearly states that 
all hedging activities are undertaken in the 
context of known and forecast cashflows, 
with speculative transactions specifically 
prohibited.

by the Nomination and Corporate Governance 
Committee in accordance with its terms of 
reference for approval by the Board. 
Pursuant to the Relationship Agreement,

Director. In the absence of such a resolution,

the shareholders at the AGM each year. The 
authorities conferred on the Directors prior to 
the IPO at a general meeting of the Company 
held on 27 February 2014, expire on the 
date of the forthcoming AGM.  Since Listing, 
the Directors have not exercised any powers 
to issue or purchase ordinary shares in the 
Company.

over ordinary shares in the Company are shown

page 100. In line with the requirements of the 
Companies Act, each Director has notified the 
Company of any situation in which he or she 
has, or could have, a direct or indirect interest 
that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with 
the interests of the Company (a situational 
conflict). These were considered and approved 
by the Board in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association and each

on the transfer of ordinary shares in the 
Company other than the usual restrictions 
applicable where any amount is unpaid on a

Company require Board approval to deal in the 
Company’s securities.

Amendment of the Articles
The Articles of Association may only be amended 
by a special resolution of the Company’ s 
shareholders in a general meeting, in accordance 
with the Companies Act.
Dividend
The Directors are not proposing to recommend 
any dividend in respect of FY14.
Change of Control
There are no agreements between the Company 
and its Directors or employees providing for 
additional compensation for loss of office or 
employment (whether through resignation, 
redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because 
of a takeover bid.
The only significant agreements to which the 
Company is a party that take effect, alter or 
terminate upon a change of control of the 
Company following a takeover bid, and the 
effect thereof, are as follows:
 The Relationship Agreement with the 
Principal Shareholder contains a provision 
allowing the Principal Shareholder to 
terminate the agreement with immediate 
effect if any person acquires control of the 
Company (namely holding and/or ownership 
of the beneficial interest in and/or the ability 
to exercise the voting rights applicable to 
shares or other securities in the Company 
which confer, in aggregate on the holders, 
whether directly or indirectly, more than 50% 
of the voting rights exercisable at general 
meetings of the Company) or the Company 
ceases to be on the official list of the UK 
Listing Authority.
 The SFA contains customary prepayment, 
cancellation and default provisions 
including if required by a lender, mandatory 
prepayment of all utilisations provided 
by that lender upon the sale of all or 
substantially all of the business and assets 
of the Group or a change of control.
Political Donations
The Company’s policy is not to make any 
political donations and no political donations  
or expenditure were made or incurred during 
the year.
Suppliers
The Group understands the importance of 
maintaining good relationships with suppliers 
and it is Group policy to agree appropriate 
terms and conditions for its transactions with 
suppliers (ranging from standard written terms 
to individually negotiated contracts) and for 
payment to be made in accordance with these 
terms, provided the supplier has complied with 
its obligations. Average Trade creditors of the 
Group’s UK operations for FY14 were 38 days 
(FY13: 32 days).
Events Post Year End
In the Company’s IPO Prospectus, the Company 
noted its intention to reduce its share capital 
by means of a court sanctioned reduction in 
capital. The capital reduction was approved 
by a special resolution passed at the general 
meeting of the Company on 27th February 
2014 and will require court approval. It is 
envisaged that the final court hearing to 
formally approve the proposed reduction of 
capital will take place before September 2014.
Going Concern
On the basis of current financial projections and 
facilities available, the Directors are satisfied 
that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks successfully and therefore have 
a reasonable expectation that the Group has 
adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the financial statements continue 
to be prepared on a going concern basis.
Branches outside of the UK
The Company has no branches outside of  
the UK. 
Auditors
So far as each Director is aware, there is 
no relevant audit information of which the 
Company’s Auditors are unaware and the 
Directors have taken all the steps which 
they ought to have taken as Directors to 
make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s 
Auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be 
interpreted in accordance with the provisions of 
s418 of the Companies Act.
On behalf of the Board, the Audit Committee 
has reviewed the effectiveness, performance, 
independence and objectivity of the existing 
external Auditors, KPMG LLP , for the year ended 
27th March 2014 and concluded that the 
external Auditors were in all respects effective. 
KPMG LLP has expressed its willingness to 
continue in office as Auditors. Accordingly, a 
resolution proposing the reappointment of 
KPMG LLP will be proposed at the forthcoming 
AGM and will be put to the shareholders at the 
meeting.

Governance Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
in respect of the Annual Report and the 
Financial Statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the Annual Report, and the Group and parent 
company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare 
the Group and parent company financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that 
law they are required to prepare the Group’s 
financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards 
(“IFRS”) (as adopted by the European Union 
(EU)) and applicable law and they have elected 
to prepare the parent company financial 
statements on the same basis. Under company 
law the Directors must not approve the financial 
statements unless they are satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and their parent company 
financial statements and of the profit or loss 
of the Group for that period. In preparing each 
of the Group and parent company financial 
statements for each financial year, the Directors 
are required to: 
 select suitable accounting policies and then 
apply them consistently;
 make judgements and accounting estimates 
that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether they have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
EU; and
 prepare the financial statements on 
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Company 
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping 
adequate accounting records that are sufficient 
to show and explain the parent company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position 
of the parent company and enable them to 
ensure that its financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as 
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the 
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the 
Directors are also responsible for preparing 
a Strategic Report, Directors’ Report, 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement that complies with that 
law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate and 
financial information included on the Company’s 
Group website. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement of the Directors 
in respect of the annual financial report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the applicable set of 
accounting standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position and profit or loss of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 the Strategic Report/Directors’ Report 
includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the 
position of the issuer and the undertakings 
included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that they 
face.

Governance Dear Shareholders
Welcome to our first Corporate Governance 
Report. The shares of Pets At Home Group Plc 
were admitted to the premium listing segment 
of the Official List maintained by the Financial 
Conduct Authority and to trading on the London 
Stock Exchange (Listing) on 17th March 2014. 
The Board recognises the importance of, and is 
committed to, high standards of Plc corporate 
governance and all Directors are fully aware of 
their duties and responsibilities under the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Disclosure 
and Transparency Rules and the Listing Rules. 
Save as set out in this report, the Board 
considers that the Group has complied with the 
requirements of the Code from Listing to the 
financial year end on 27th March 2014.
In preparation for Listing, we carried out a 
review of the existing governance structure 
in conjunction with our advisers KPMG LLP , 
in order to identify any measures that would 
need to be implemented prior to Listing. The 
review also enabled the Directors to provide 
the confirmation that was required on Listing 
that Pets At Home has established procedures 
in place which provide a reasonable basis for 
the Board to make proper judgements on an 
ongoing basis as to the financial position and 
prospects of the Group. Based on the findings 
of the review, we found that the following 
actions would need to be taken pre IPO:
 Strengthen the independence of the Board 
and the Committees through the addition of 
five independent Non-Executive Directors;
 Set up a formal induction process for new 
Non-Executive Directors joining pre-IPO and 
post-IPO;
 Amend the current Board and Committee 
terms of reference to ensure suitability for a 
Plc Board and all its sub-committees;
 Agree an approach to Investor Relations with 
the Plc Board; and
 The Remuneration Committee to set a 
formal Executive remuneration evaluation 
process.
We undertook a rigorous process with Korn 
Ferry to identify suitable Independent Non-
Executive Directors with Dennis Millard, 
Amy Stirling, Tessa Green and Paul Coby 
being appointed prior to Listing with the final 
appointment of Paul Moody taking place shortly 
after. Dennis Millard was appointed Deputy 
Chairman and Senior Independent Director. 
Each Independent Non-Executive Director has a 
proven track record in business at a senior level 
and expertise of relevance to the Company.
In the period leading up to the IPO, the new 
Directors received a full induction process so 
that they could familiarise themselves with 
the Group through a combination of personal 
meetings with the Senior Executives and 
members of the Operating Board, a store and 
veterinary surgery visit and time spent reviewing 
and approving on the IPO offer documents.

Following the IPO, we have put in place a more 
tailored induction process for each of the new 
Directors, including Paul Moody, and the Board 
calendar has been planned to ensure that 
Directors are briefed on a wide range of topics, 
have the opportunity to visit the Group’s various 
business locations and discuss aspects of the 
Group’s activities with colleagues across the 
business. 
We have implemented a Committee structure 
in accordance with the requirements of a 
premium listed Plc. The membership, roles and 
activities of the Committees are detailed in 
separate sections of this report together with 
reports of the Audit and Risk Committee and 
Remuneration Committee. There is no separate 
report of the Nominations Committee as the 
Board of Directors was newly appointed, and 
as a consequence there has been no need for 
the Committee to meet on a formal basis in the 
short period between Listing and the year end. 
We recognise the importance of communicating 
to our shareholders and so shortly after Listing, 
we appointed a dedicated Head of Investor 
Relations, Amie Gramlick. Investor relations will 
be led by the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer with support from Amie. A full 
programme of regular meetings and dialogue 
with major institutional shareholders, fund 
managers, analysts, retail brokers and credit 
investors has been established and the Board 
will receive regular updates at Board meetings. 
During the IPO process, Deloitte LLP were 
engaged as the remuneration adviser. They 
advised on the remuneration policy which sets 
down the Group’s forward-looking policy on the 
remuneration of Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors and is contained at pages 82 to 103 
of this report.
I look forward to continuing with the Company 
as Non-Executive Chairman as we continue with 
the transition from private company to a Plc. We 
believe that good corporate governance allows 
boards to direct their companies effectively 
and we are pleased to present our report on 
the governance arrangements the Board has 
adopted since the IPO on 17th March 2014.

Governance Corporate governance report
Introduction
The Board is committed to the 
highest standards of corporate 
governance. Save as set out in the 
paragraphs below, since Listing, 
the Board has complied with and 
intends to continue to comply 
with the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 
published in September 2012 by 
the Financial Reporting Council 
(the “UK Corporate Governance 
Code”). The Company will also 
report to its Shareholders on its 
compliance with the UK Corporate 
Governance Code in accordance 
with the Listing Rules (“LRs”). 
Board balance and independence
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommends that at least half the board of 
directors of a UK-listed company, excluding 
the chairman, should comprise non-executive 
directors determined by the Board to be 
independent in character and judgement and 
free from relationships or circumstances 
which may affect, or could appear to affect, 
the director’s judgement. The Pets At Home 
Group Plc Board consists of five independent 
Non-Executive Directors, one Non-Executive 
Chairman, one non-independent Non-Executive 
Director appointed by KKR My Best Friend 
Limited, an affiliate of, Kohlberg Kravis Roberts 
& Co L.P . (the “Principal Shareholder”) and two 
Executive Directors. A list of the Directors is 
provided on pages 54 to 57.
Chairman 
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommends that, on appointment, the 
chairman of a company with a premium 
listing on the Official List should meet the 
independence criteria set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. Tony DeNunzio 
joined Pets At Home in 2010 and has been 
Non-Executive Chairman of the Group since 
March 2010. Notwithstanding that the Board 
considered at the time of Listing, and continues 
to believe, that Tony DeNunzio does not meet 
the independence criteria set out in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code, the Board believes 
that in order to ensure maximum continuity 
in the Company’s transition from a privately 
owned company to a listed company, Tony 
should remain as Non-Executive Chairman of 
the Group. The Board believes Tony brings vast 
retail experience and knowledge to the Pets At 
Home team. Tony is Non-Executive Chairman 
of Maxeda, a major Benelux DIY retailer, and 
is a Non-Executive Director of Alliance Boots 
Group. Tony is a senior adviser to affiliates of 
the Principal Shareholder and was appointed 
as Non-Executive Chairman by the Principal 
Shareholder, KKR My Best Friend Limited, 
an affiliate of Kohlberg Kravis Roberts & Co. 
L.P ., pursuant to the terms of the relationship 
agreement entered into as part of the IPO 
process to avoid potential future conflicts of 
interest (Relationship Agreement).
Senior Independent Director
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommends that the board of directors of a 
company with a premium listing should appoint 
one of the Non-Executive Directors as a Senior 
Independent Director to provide a sounding 
board for the Chairman and to serve as an 
intermediary for the other directors when 
necessary. The Senior Independent Director 
should be available to shareholders if they have 
concerns, when contact through the normal 
channels of the Chief Executive Officer has 
failed to resolve, or for which such contact is 
inappropriate. 
Dennis Millard has also been appointed Deputy 
Chairman as well as Senior Independent 
Director and has considerable experience 
of acting as an independent Non-Executive 
Director on plc boards. Dennis is currently the 
chairman of Halfords Group plc, and is the 
chairman of Smiths News plc. Dennis is also 
currently a Non-Executive Director and Senior 
Independent Director of each of Premier Farnell 
plc and Debenhams plc.
Appointment of Directors by the  
Principal Shareholder
Pursuant to the Relationship Agreement, 
the Company has agreed with the Principal 
Shareholder that it may appoint two Non-
Executive Directors to the Board for so long 
as the Principal Shareholder (and/or any of its 
associates, when taken together) holds 20% or 
more of the voting rights over the Company’s 
Shares and one Non-Executive Director to 
the Board for so long as it (and/or any of its 
associates, when taken together) holds 10% 
or more but less than 20% of the voting rights 
over the Company’s Shares. The Principal 
Shareholder has appointed Brian Carroll as 
a Non-Executive Director of the Board. The 
Chairman, Tony DeNunzio, is a senior adviser 
to affiliates of the Principal Shareholder and 
therefore is not deemed to be independent of 
the Principal Shareholder. Although he has not 
been appointed as a Director by the Principal 
Shareholder, the Principal Shareholder has 
agreed that for so long as it has the right to 
appoint two Directors to the Board and Tony 
is a Director, the Principal Shareholder shall 
not exercise its right to appoint a second 
Director to the Board. For further details of the 
Relationship Agreement, see page 63.
Board Observers
Each of Sally Hopson, Peter Pritchard and 
Phil Hackney have been appointed as Board 
observers with rights to receive notice of 
(including all Board papers), attend and speak 
at, Board meetings. The Principal Shareholder 
also has the right to appoint one Board 
observer for so long as it holds voting rights 
over more than 10% of the Company’s Shares. 
Such Board observers shall have the right to 
receive notice of, attend and speak at, Board 
meetings. No Board observer shall be entitled 
to vote on any matter requiring a resolution of 
the Board.

Appointment Terms and  
Elections of Directors
All Directors have service agreements or letters 
of appointment in place and the details of their 
terms are set out in the Remuneration Report 
on pages 93 to 95. The service agreements 
and letters of appointment are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office 
during normal business hours. 
The UK Corporate Governance Code 
recommends that directors of companies in the 
FTSE 350 index should be subject to annual  
re-election. The Company intends to comply 
with these recommendations.
How the Board operates
Pets At Home Group Plc has established a 
clear division of responsibilities between the 
respective responsibilities of the Non-Executive 
Chairman of the Board and the Chief Executive 
Officer. This separation of responsibilities 
between the Chairman and the Chief Executive 
Officer, coupled with the reserved matters 
described below, ensures that no individual has 
unfettered powers of decision-making.
The matters reserved for the Board include:
 Agreement of the Group’s strategy;
 Changes to the structure and capital of the 
Group;
 Reviewing the effectiveness of internal 
controls;
 Approval of the Annual Report and 
Accounts, Interim Reports, and Interim 
Management Statements together with any 
announcements;
 Approving significant expenditure, material 
transactions and contracts;
 Reviewing and agreeing Group tax and 
treasury policy;
 Delegation of authority to the Chief 
Executive Officer;
 Board and Senior Management 
appointments, arrangements and 
succession planning;
 Communication with shareholders;
 Review of the Group’s overall corporate 
governance matters.
It is important to the Board that Non-Executive 
Directors have the ability to influence and 
challenge appropriately. New Directors receive 
a full, formal and tailored induction on joining 
the Board, including meeting with the Executive 
Management and other members of the Group’s 
Operating Board and advisers. The induction 
includes visits to the Group’s stores, veterinary 
surgeries and other operational locations.
As a result of the short period between Listing 
on 17th March 2014 and the year end on  
27th March 2014, the current Board held one 
meeting. In future, the Board intends to meet at 
least eight times per year, with additional  
ad hoc meetings as required. 
Topics for the Board meetings are determined 
at the beginning of the year and new items are 
added to this as and when appropriate.
All Directors receive papers in advance of 
Board meetings. These include a monthly 
Board report with updates from each of the 
Executive Management Team and the Operating 
Board, which monitors the achievements of 
the Group’s key performance indicators, both 
financial and strategic. The Group’s Operating 
Board are also invited to present at Board 
meetings so that Non-Executive Directors keep 
abreast of developments in the Group.

Governance Board Evaluation and Effectiveness
The Group Legal Director and Company 
Secretary ensures the Board is made aware 
of new laws, regulations and other information 
appropriate to the Group to ensure that 
all Directors continually update their skills, 
knowledge and familiarity of the Group in order 
to fulfil their roles. Additionally, each Director 
has access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary and also has the ability to 
take independent external advice if required.
Considering Diversity
At the time of the IPO, the process of recruiting 
independent Non-Executive Directors with 
a broad range of skills to complement the 
business took into account diversity. The 
Board understands the importance of having 
a diverse membership and recognises that 
diversity encompasses not only gender but also 
background and experience. The Board believes 
that appointments should be made solely on 
The Chairman intends to meet regularly with the 
Non-Executive Directors without the Executive 
Directors present. This ensures that any 
concerns can be raised and discussed outside 
formal Board meetings. The Senior Independent 
Director will also attend these sessions where 
possible and, if required, will discuss any 
pertinent matters with the other independent 
Non-Executive Directors.
It is important to the Group that all Directors 
understand external views of the Group. It 
is the intention that regular reporting will be 
provided to the Board by the Company’s Head 
of Investor Relations, covering broker reports 
and the output of meetings with significant 
shareholders. As stated below, the Board has 
also delegated certain matters to a number of 
Board Committees.
Number of meetings attended

merit, the key criterion being whether or not 
the appointee can add to or complement the 
existing range of skills and experience on the 
Board. Notably, two of the five newly appointed 
independent Non-Executive Directors, Tessa 
Green and Amy Stirling, are females together 
with the Group Legal Director and Company 
Secretary, Louise Stonier and a member of the 
Executive Management Team, Sally Hopson. 
These appointments were made on merit, and 
not on gender, the appointees being by far the 
strongest candidates for the positions with 
their skill sets and overall experience fitting the 
objective role description approved by the Board 
at the outset of the recruitment process.
This policy applies equally to all appointments 
in the Company and so, two of the most recent 
appointments to the board of the Pets At Home 
Vets Group were female, Sally Hopson and 
Amanda Radford, in addition to the existing 
serving Managing Director, Jane Balmain. The 
Group also has four female colleagues on the 
Operating Board.
The Company used an external search 
consultancy, Korn Ferry, in the appointment of 
all Independent Non-Executive Directors during 
the period.

Board Committees 
The Board has established three committees 
of the Board: an Audit and Risk Committee, 
a Nomination and Corporate Governance 
Committee and a Remuneration Committee.  
In addition, the Board has also established the 
Pets Before Profit and CSR Committee which 
will comprise both Non-Executive Directors 
and colleagues and the Investment Committee 
which will comprise the Executive Directors and 
other members of the Executive Management 
and colleagues. If the need should arise, the 
Board may set up additional committees as 
appropriate.
Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee has delegated 
responsibility from the Board for: 
  Agreeing the scope of the annual audit of 
the consolidated accounts and the annual 
audit plan and monitoring the same;
  Monitoring, making judgements and 
recommendations on the financial reporting 
process and the integrity and clarity of the 
Group’s financial statements;
  Considering the appointment of the Group’s 
Auditors and their remuneration including 
reviewing and monitoring of independence 
and objectivity and agreeing and monitoring 
the extent of the non-audit work that may be 
undertaken;
  Reviewing and monitoring the effectiveness 
of the internal control, internal audit and risk 
management policies and systems in place; 
and
  Reporting to the Board on how it has 
discharged its responsibilities.
The Audit Committee gives due consideration 
to laws and regulations, the provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code and the 
requirements of the LRs. The UK Corporate 
Governance Code recommends that an audit 
committee should comprise at least three 
members who are independent non-executive 
directors and that at least one member should 
have recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Audit and Risk Committee is chaired by 
Amy Stirling, and its other members are Dennis 
Millard, Paul Coby and Paul Moody. As a former 
chief financial officer of Talk Talk Telecom Group 
Plc, the Directors consider that Amy Stirling 
has recent and relevant financial experience 
in accordance with the requirements of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. The Audit and 
Risk Committee meets not less than three 
times a year.
Only committee members have the right 
to attend and vote at its meetings but the 
Principal Shareholder has a right to appoint an 
observer to attend meetings of the Audit and 
Risk Committee for so long as it (and/or any of 
its associates, when taken together) holds 10% 
or more of the voting rights over the Company’s 
Shares.
The Audit and Risk Committee chair will be 
available at Annual General Meetings of 
the Company to respond to questions from 
Shareholders on the activities of the Audit and 
Risk Committee.
The Audit and Risk Committee has taken 
appropriate steps to ensure that the Company’s 
Auditors are independent of the Company 
and obtained written confirmation from the 
Company’s Auditors that they comply with 
guidelines on independence issued by the 
relevant accountancy and auditing bodies.
The Audit and Risk Committee has access to 
sufficient resources to carry out its duties, 
including the services of the Group Legal 
Director and Company Secretary and the 
Group’s internal audit function. Independent 
external legal and professional advice can also 
be taken by the Audit and Risk Committee if it 
believes it necessary to do so.

reference, which are available on request from 
the Company Secretary and are published on 
the Group’s website (investors.petsathome.
com), comply with the Code.

Board in determining its responsibilities in 
relation to Directors’ remuneration, including:
 making recommendations to the Board 
on the Company’s policy on Executive 
remuneration;
 setting the over-arching principles, 
parameters and governance framework 
of the Group’s remuneration policy and 
determining the individual remuneration and 
benefits package of each of the Company’s 
Executive Directors and Executive 
Management;
 ensuring compliance with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code in relation to 
remuneration.

Other Committees and Board Meetings
Executive Management and Operating Board
In addition to the new Board, the Group has 
both an Executive Management Board as 
detailed in the Corporate Governance Report 
on pages 58 to 59 and Operating Board (the 
“Operating Board”) for which respective roles 
are clearly defined. The Operating Board meets 
frequently to discuss the following:
 Current trading
 New Developments
 Operational issues
 Marketing
 People
Health and Safety
Health and safety is a key priority for the Board 
and senior management and is an item for 
review and discussion at each Board meeting. 
The Board has established a health and safety 
committee which meets at least on a quarterly 
basis and is chaired by the Customer, People 
and Development Director with the agenda 
led by the Head of Health and Safety. The 
Committee is attended by key individuals in the 
business that are responsible for certain areas 
of health and safety including the veterinary 
business, and Ride-Away and the committee 
is tasked with reviewing the Group’s overall 
health and safety performance. A health and 
safety policy is in place for the Group which is 
reviewed on a regular basis. 
Pets At Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 27th March 2014

Governance The distribution centres have their own 
dedicated health and safety manager and a 
separate health and safety sub-committee 
which also meets on a regular basis. The newly 
integrated veterinary business also has a 
designated health and safety manager. 
Further details of the work of the health and 
safety committee are contained on page 39 of 
our Corporate Social Responsibility Report.
Risk management and internal control
Details of the internal controls of the Company 
(including a description of the main features 
of its internal control and risk management 
arrangements and the manner in which 
the Board and its Committees assess the 
effectiveness of these controls) are set out in 
the report of the Audit Committee on page 78.
Share Dealing Code
The Company has adopted, with effect from 
Admission, a code of securities dealings in 
relation to the Shares which is based on, and 
is at least as rigorous as, the Model Code as 
published in the LRs. The code adopted will 
apply to the Directors and other relevant PDMR 
employees of the Company.
Board evaluation and effectiveness
As the Board has only been in existence 
for a short period of time, an evaluation of 
performance has not been undertaken. The first 
full evaluation is scheduled for 2015 and will 
be annual thereafter.
Relations with Shareholders
The Board believes it is important to explain 
business developments and financial results to 
the Company’s Shareholders and to understand 
any Shareholder concerns. We intend to 
communicate with Shareholders on a regular 
basis.
As part of the IPO process, the Company 
met regularly with analysts and institutional 
investors and such meetings will continue. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer have lead responsibility for investor 
relations. They are supported by a dedicated 
Head of Investor Relations who, amongst other 
matters, organises presentations for analysts 
and institutional investors and will also ensure 
that procedures are in place to keep the Board 
regularly informed of such investors’ views. 
The formal reporting of our full and half yearly 
results will be a combination of presentations, 
group calls and one-to-one meetings in a 
variety of locations where we have institutional 
Shareholders. All the Non-Executive Directors 
and, in particular, the Chairman and Senior 
Independent Director are available to meet 
with major Shareholders, if they wish to raise 
issues separately from the arrangements as 
described above. The Company also plans to 
communicate with Shareholders through the 
Annual General Meeting, at which the Chairman 
will give an account of the progress of the 
business over the last year and a review of 
current issues, and will provide the opportunity 
for Shareholders to ask questions. 
Pets At Home’s investor website is also 
regularly updated with news and information 
including this Annual Report which sets out 
our strategy and performance together with our 
plans for future growth (investors.petsathome.

Letter from the Audit Chair
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present the Company’s first 
Audit and Risk Committee (Committee) Report 
following its admission to the premium listing 
segment of the Official List maintained by the 
Financial Conduct Authority and to trading on 
the London Stock Exchange’s main market for 
listed securities (“Admission”) of the London 
Stock Exchange on 17th March 2014. Due to 
the relatively short time between Admission 
and the year end on 27th March 2014, no 
Committee meetings took place between these 
two dates. Following the year end, however, 
the Committee has met on two occasions prior 
to the approval of the financial statements. 
As a result, this report focuses on the 
matters considered by the Committee prior to 
Admission, the work undertaken to transition 
from the Group’s private company status to 
a Plc and the focus of the Committee going 
forward.
Leading up to Admission, the Company 
identified the need to strengthen the 
independence of the Committee to ensure that 
it complied with the recommendations of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code. As a result, 
the composition of the Committee changed 
on Admission and it is now entirely made up 
of independent Non-Executive Directors. The 
members of the Audit and Risk Committee are 
myself as Chair, Dennis Millard, Paul Coby and 
Paul Moody. The Board considers that I have 
recent and relevant financial experience. 
The Committee is a sub-committee of the 
Board and its terms of reference were approved 
at the time of the Admission and are fully 
aligned to the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
The primary function of the Committee is to 
assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities 
to protect the interest of the Shareholders 
with regard to the integrity of the financial 
reporting, audit, risk management and internal 
controls. We aim to provide Shareholders with 
timely communication on significant matters 
relating to the Company’s financial position 
and prospects and we are also responsible for 
monitoring fraud risk. 
The Committee will meet at least three times 
a year.
During the IPO, as part of completing the 
Group’s Financial Position, Prospects and 
Procedures Report (FPP), KPMG LLP and the 
Directors undertook a detailed assessment of 
the following key areas:
 Board governance including the Committee 
and the procedure for assessing the Group’s 
key risks;
 Management accounting process and the 
information provided to the Board;
 External financial reporting procedures 
and Audit arrangements and reporting 
standards;
 Internal control environment both at high 
and detailed levels;
 Complex transactions, potential exposure 
and risk; 
 Information Systems; and
 Budgeting and Forecasting procedures and 
controls.
The Directors recognise the need to maintain 
the financial reporting procedures, review 
them on an ongoing basis and adapt them 
to changing circumstances. Their continuous 
review will form part of the Committee’s agenda 
going forward together with its wider role and 
responsibilities which are set out in more detail 
on page 77 of the report.
I look forward to meeting with Shareholders at 
the AGM.

Chair of the Audit Committee

Governance Admission to the Premium Listing 
segment of the Official List and to Trading 
on the London Stock Exchange
Prior to the establishment of the current 
Group Committee, the Group had in place a 
Committee which was chaired by the Group 
Chairman, Tony DeNunzio and comprised two 
representatives from the Principal Shareholder 
together with the Chief Executive Officer and 
the Chief Financial Officer. The last meeting of 
the previous Committee took place on  
28th January 2014 and references to the 
Committee in this report include activities both 
before and after Listing.
Membership of the Audit and  
Risk Committee
The Committee is chaired by Amy Stirling, 
and its other members are Dennis Millard, 
Paul Coby and Paul Moody. Amy Stirling is a 
Chartered Accountant and until May 2013 
served as the Chief Financial Officer of the 
Talk Talk Telecom Group plc. Amy is also the 
chief financial officer of The Prince’s Trust. The 
Directors consider that Amy Stirling has recent 
and relevant financial experience in accordance 
with the requirements of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code.
The Chief Financial Officer, the Chief Executive 
and the Group’s Head of Internal Audit 
attend meetings by invitation along with 
representatives from the Group’s external 
Auditors, KPMG together with an observer 
appointed by the Principal Shareholder.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary  
to the Committee. 
The Committee meets separately with the Head 
of Internal Audit and the external Auditors to 
review their reports and discuss issues in 
detail. 
Role and Responsibilities
The Committee has received delegated 
authority from the Board as set out in its written 
terms of reference which were approved at the 
time of the IPO. The principal responsibilities of 
the Committee include:
 Agreeing the scope of the annual audit and 
the annual audit plan and monitoring the 
same;
 Monitoring, making judgements and 
recommendations on the financial reporting 
process and the integrity and clarity of the 
Group’s financial statements;
 Considering the appointment of the Group’s 
Auditors and their remuneration including 
reviewing and monitoring of independence 
and objectivity and agreeing and monitoring 
the extent of the non audit work that may be 
undertaken; 
 Reviewing and monitoring the adequacy and 
effectiveness of the internal control and risk 
management policies and systems currently 
in place; and
 Reporting to the Board on how it has 
discharged its responsibilities.
Audit and Risk Committee Calendar for 
year ended March 2014
The Committee will meet at least three times a 
year with any additional meetings being called 
as required. Two formal Committee meetings 
were held pre IPO, one on 19th July 2013 to 
present KPMG’s audit findings for the year 
ended March 2013 and the other on  
28th January 2014 to present the audit 
strategy for the year ended 27th March 2014. 
However, a number of meetings were held with 
KPMG LLP throughout the IPO process in their 
capacity as reporting accountants.
Main Activities of the Audit and Risk 
Committee during the year
A key systems project during the year was the 
implementation of some key elements of SAP’s 
enterprise resource planning system in May 
2013, covering key financials, master data, 
pricing and promotions, HR, business reporting 
and business intelligence. Ciber were chosen 
as the system integration partner and KPMG 
worked alongside Internal Audit during the three 
months prior to go live to provide assessment 
and challenge over key project areas. KPMG 
LLP focused on data migration procedures and 
Internal Audit focused on system testing and 
business readiness. The system went live with 
no issues.
During the year, the Committee reviewed certain 
relevant documentation in relation to the IPO, 
notably a detailed review and discussion on 
the detailed findings within the FPP and also 
the audit work carried out in relation to the 40 
week period ended 2nd January 2014.

Further work of the Committee in the year 
principally fell under the following main areas:
Internal Controls
 Reviewed and considered the reports of the 
Head of Internal Audit on audits completed 
and follow-up action plans to address areas 
of weakness. Further details of the areas 
covered are set out on page 80;
 Received reports from KPMG LLP on the 
Group’s internal control environment at the 
time of the IPO;
 Undertook an assessment of the internal 
control environment facilitated by discussion 
with relevant management including a review 
of procedures and processes in place at 
the Pets At Home Vets Group following 
acquisition of Vets4Pets in March 2013;
 Reviewed a report from the Head of Internal 
Audit on the Group’s risk assessment 
process and the way that significant 
business risks are managed and mitigated; 
and
 Reviewed the Company’s arrangements by 
which colleagues may raise concerns in 
confidence as part of a review of the Group’s 
anti-bribery and corruption policy.
External Auditors
 Considered and approved the external 
Auditors’ plans for the annual audit of the 
Company including the additional reporting 
requirements and accounting implications 
arising from the Listing; 
 Approved the fees of the external audit 
and reviewed the Company’s policy on the 
engagement of the external Auditors to 
supply non-audit services; 
 Reviewed the reports and findings of the 
external audit; and
 Reviewed the effectiveness and 
recommending the reappointment of the 
external Auditors.
Accounting, Tax and Financial reporting
 Reviewed the appropriateness of the annual 
and the financial statements for the 40 
week period ended 2nd January 2014 with a 
focus on, amongst other matters, the quality 
and acceptability of accounting policies and 
procedures, material areas where significant 
judgements have been applied or there 
has been a significant discussion with the 
Group’s external Auditors, and the clarity of 
disclosures and compliance with financial 
reporting standards; and
 Considered and approved the Group’s tax 
policy which covers the Group’s approach on 
the Group’s key tax principles, the Group’s 
attitude to tax and risk, our relationship 
with HMRC, the various individuals in the 
organisation who input into the various tax 
processes, our relationships with external 
tax advisers, a summary of our processes 
for assessing and providing for tax exposure 
where appropriate and making payments 
when due.
Main Activities of the Audit and Risk 
Committee Post Year-End
In June 2014, the Committee had two further 
meetings which covered the following:
 Reviewed whether the Annual Report and 
Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced 
and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to 
assess the Company’s strategy, business 
model and performance;
 Reviewed the reports and findings of the 
external Auditors;
 Reviewed the effectiveness and 
recommended the reappointment of the 
external Auditors; and
 Considered the risk assessment, mitigation 
actions and assurance activities produced 
by management.
Key Areas of Audit Focus 
Following discussion with the Executive 
Directors, key members of the management 
team and the external Auditors, the Committee 
have agreed with KPMG that the key audit focus 
areas are:
 Stock valuation; and
 Financial Statements – accounting for the 
IPO and enhanced plc disclosures.
The Corporate structure in place prior to the 
IPO on 17th March 2014 was complex in nature 
and structured to meet the needs of the Group 
and its shareholder base pre IPO. The Group 
engaged appropriate legal, accounting and tax 
advisers to develop a steps plan to facilitate 
a Group structure commensurate with its new 
status on the premium list of the London Stock 
Exchange. The Group engaged advisers who 
had been involved in the establishment of the 
structure at inception and who had maintained 
a close involvement with the Group and the 
structure’s evolution through to IPO. The steps 
developed included a detailed articulation of 
the accounting treatment necessary both pre 
and post the IPO and we have worked closely 
with our advisers to ensure the accounting 
entries necessary have been executed correctly. 
Subsequent to the IPO we have considered 
at length the appropriate presentation of our 
first IPO results as a PLC. The key area of 
technical consideration was the application of 
the principles of reverse acquisition accounting 
to the Group and the technical requirement 
to consolidate three companies from the 
old Group structure which were immediately 
liquidated following IPO. 
The Group has deployed additional technical 
accounting resource to ensure appropriate peer 
to peer internal review of our IPO accounting. 
This additional resource has ensured we have 
been able to adequately deal with increased 
reporting requirements and disclosures 
commensurate with delivering our first PLC 
accounts under IFRS having worked closely with 
our external Auditors to ensure we are compliant.

Governance Stock Valuation
The Group has a number of formal processes 
and controls to ensure that the value of stock 
presented in the annual report accurately 
reflects the stock on hand and that it is 
properly valued at the lower of cost or net 
realisable value. The business continually 
counts stock both in-store and in the 
distribution centres and the frequency of 
each department count is based on a risk 
assessment which is reviewed on an ongoing 
basis. The business has processes in place 
to manage the risk from out of date stock and 
the finance team and supply team meet weekly 
to discuss in detail the stock file and to agree 
actions to ensure slow moving lines are cleared 
and our overall stock investment is optimised 
such that our working capital targets are 
delivered. An inherent element of the process 
to introduce new ranges into the business is a 
clear focus on the clean and timely exit of any 
discontinued lines. Our provisioning process 
is undertaken on a product by product basis 
and reflects the current understanding of the 
finance and supply teams as regards the likely 
realisations for stock with significant forward 
cover of stock that has been designated 
discontinued. Our provision also reflects, based 
on historical count history, the likely stock loss 
between the last count of a specific department 
and the balance sheet date.
Risk Management and Internal Controls
The Board has overall responsibility for risk 
management and the system of internal control 
and for reviewing their effectiveness. 
Risk Management responsibilities are allocated as follows:
Executive Board Collectively responsible for managing risk
 Key risks are allocated an Executive Board member for oversight and ultimate ownership.
 The full Executive Management Board supported by key members of the Operating Board are responsible for closely 
managing the most significant risks.
 Receives regular risk updates and reports.
Operating Board Has line responsibility for managing risks within their areas
 Reviews risk registers periodically (three times a year).
 Takes action, as agreed and documented in the risk registers.
 Identifies new risks for inclusion in the registers.
Audit Committee Oversees the risk management process
 Receives and reviews detailed risk reports prepared on a department by department basis (twice a year).
 Chairman completes a detailed review of the risk reports.
Internal Audit Co-ordinates the Risk Management processes
 Holds meetings with all Risk Owners across the business three times a year.
 Updates the individual risk registers, including actions and progress made, assesses risk ratings and determines if 
these should change (up or down) and documents the controls in place that help mitigate each risk.
Health and Safety 
Committee
Assists the Board in managing the risk of health, safety and security
 Holds meetings quarterly with stakeholders from across the Group.
 Reviews the Group’s risk register, health and safety policy and compliance with applicable regulations.
 Recommends to the Board and Group appropriate policies and procedures.
 Updates the Board on accidents across the Group.

Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. The Board delegates to Executive 
Management the responsibility for designing, 
operating and monitoring these systems. The 
systems are based on a process of identifying, 
evaluating and managing key risks and include 
the risk management processes set out above.
The systems of internal control were in place 
throughout the period and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report. The systems of 
internal control are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives. They can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material errors, losses, fraud or breaches of 
law and regulations. The Group operates a 
number of internal controls across its business; 
the key controls the business relies upon are 
set out below:
  An annual Group-wide strategic review of  the 
business culminating in the preparation of 
a detailed three year strategic plan which 
is reviewed and approved by the Board. 
Immediately following this approval, the 
business undertakes its annual budget 
cycle, again culminating in a formal review 
and approval by the Board.
 Review of period end management accounts 
with comparison of actual performance 
against budget; consideration of the out-turn 
for the year; and Management accounts are 
reviewed at Board Meetings by the Board. 
The period end accounts are prepared by the 
management accounts team and reviewed 
by the Chief Financial Officer and the 
Finance Director.
 Approval by the Chief Financial Officer is 
required for all capital investments; an 
authority framework is in place which details 
the approvals required at specific levels 
of capital spend including those capital 
projects requiring full Board approval. The 
Board has delegated certain powers in 
respect of the acquisition and fit-out of 
new stores and new standalone veterinary 
practices to an investment committee 
chaired by the CEO; see page 74 for further 
details.
 There is an internal audit department in 
place which has its scope agreed with the 
Audit Committee and which reports formally 
twice a year on specific issues. All Internal 
Audit reports are presented to the Audit 
Committee for review and consideration of 
any material findings.
 A clearly articulated delegated authority 
framework in respect of all purchasing 
activity is in place across the Group. This is 
complemented by systemic controls which 
reflect the agreed authority framework.
 A clear segregation of duties between 
relevant functions and departments.
 A schedule of matters reserved for 
the Board is in place for approving 
significant transactions and strategic and 
organisational change.
Internal Audit 
The Internal Audit function was formally 
established in January 2013 and comprises 
one full-time colleague (Head of Internal Audit 
and Risk) whose activities have been assisted 
where necessary with appropriate external 
resource. The Head of Internal Audit and Risk 
has a direct reporting line to the Chairman of 
the Audit Committee but on a day-to-day basis 
reports to the CFO.
The Internal Audit department has an annual 
plan in place, covering the key areas to be 
reviewed in the financial year. The plan is 
prioritised according to the risk register and 
areas are covered in priority order. The plan has 
been reviewed and approved both by the Board 
and the Committee and this will be done on an 
annual basis going forward. 
2013/14 Plan
The Internal Audit Plan for 2013/14 included 
pet welfare, the launch of the new Pets At Home 
multichannel website, the SAP implementation, 
business continuity plans, the deployment of 
the new warehouse system (JDA), a recovery 
audit of accounts payable accounts for the Vets 
Group and Pets At Home and a quality audit for 
UK and Hong Kong Sourcing Office.
During FY14, three internal audit reports have 
been issued covering pet welfare, the launch of 
the Pets At Home multichannel website and the 
implementation of SAP .
Pets At Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 27th March 2014

Governance Recommendations from Internal Audit are 
prioritised based on risk. The three reports 
issued to date included a number of priority 
findings for management attention and these 
have been actioned.
The focus to date of internal audit has been 
operational matters, aligned to the risk 
assessment of the business by the Board. 
Internal audit resources will be increased in 
the forthcoming year to ensure the scope of 
internal audit is extended such that the internal 
audit programme in the areas of finance and 
systems are commensurate with best practice 
for a business of our size with our risk profile.
Looking Forward
Following Listing, the Board plans to undertake 
an external review of Internal Audit function 
once the Committee has had the opportunity 
to identify the scope we wish to adopt for the 
Group whilst ensuring the necessary resource 
is made available to deliver the agreed 
plan. The external review is expected to be 
completed by March 2015 representing the 
time the department has been in operation for 
two full financial years.
External Audit
The Group’s external Auditors are KPMG LLP 
and they have been the Group’s Auditors since 
the period ended 30th March 2000.
In each year an unqualified audit opinion has 
been given.
The Committee oversees the appointment 
and termination of the external Auditors, and 
ensures there is sufficient independence in 
place in regards to the audit and non-audit fees 
taken by KPMG LLP .
Representatives from KPMG LLP are invited to 
the Committee to report the findings of their  
annual audit.
The Board is aware of the regulatory proposals 
that would require a compulsory tender of the 
statutory audit. The last tender of the audit 
service was performed in 2000 when KPMG 
LLP were appointed and therefore under the 
FRC guidelines the tender process might be 
deferred until five years after the expiry of the 
current engagement partner’s tenure. However, 
the matter will be considered by the Committee 
in the forthcoming year.

Statement from the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to present our remuneration 
report for the financial year ended 27th March 
2014, which has been prepared in compliance 
with the new UK reporting regulations.
This report consists of two sections:
 Policy Report — This sets out the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy for all Directors of 
Pets At Home Group Plc and will be subject 
to a binding Shareholder vote at our 2014 
Annual General Meeting (AGM); and
 Annual Report on Remuneration — This 
sets out details of how our Directors were 
paid during FY14 and how the Policy will be 
applied in FY15. This will be subject to an 
advisory Shareholder vote at our 2014 AGM.
Context to the Committee Decisions 
The shares of Pets At Home Group Plc were 
admitted to the premium listing segment of the 
Official List maintained by the Financial Conduct 
Authority and to trading on the London Stock 
Exchange’s main market for listed securities 
(“Admission”) shortly before the FY14 year 
end. Prior to the IPO, we undertook a detailed 
review of our remuneration framework to ensure 
that post Admission, it was aligned with best 
practice whilst at the same time preserving the 
core values of our business.
Our policy recognises the importance of 
attracting and retaining high-quality talent. Our 
culture is underpinned by an engaged colleague 
base who are at the heart of our success. We 
know that engaged colleagues stay with us for 
longer and this supports our business model, 
creating higher customer advocacy and driving 
increased spend. Over the year:
 Colleague retention was 81%
 Colleague engagement was 93%
 Pets At Home won the Sunday Times ‘25 
Best big Companies To Work For’ award
The transition of Pets At Home Group Plc to a 
listed company has enabled us to broaden our 
colleague share ownership through:
 a one-off colleague share offer that enabled 
all colleagues to purchase shares directly in 
the IPO with over 2,700 colleagues deciding 
to participate in the investment opportunity; 
and
 the grant on Admission of awards under 
discretionary share plans with over 800 
participants.
We intend to ensure that widespread share 
ownership remains an integral part of our 
culture and will be adopting an all-colleague 
Sharesave plan later this year alongside the 
above discretional plans. 
FY 2015 Pay Structure 
As part of the pre IPO review, the CEO’s and 
CFO’s remuneration packages have been 
rebalanced to bring them more in line with 
typical listed practice. This resulted in an 
increase to their salary and bonus opportunity, 
positioning them in line, but not above, levels in 
the broader retail sector.
Post Admission, we also implemented two 
long-term incentive plans for senior executives, 
including the Executive Directors:
 Co-Investment Plan (CIP)
 Performance Share Plan (PSP)
Co-Investment Plan
The Remuneration Committee recognises the 
need to sustain the long-term success of Pets 
At Home by retaining key Executives beyond 
the IPO, many of whom now have significant 
shareholdings. As a result, we adopted a co-
investment plan (CIP) on Admission which is 
a one-off arrangement tailored to our post-IPO 
position. The CIP will create incentive and 
lock in, and also align interests with those of 
Shareholders. 
Pets At Home Group Plc
Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 27th March 2014
82
Governance The CIP required Executive Directors to make 
and retain a significant personal investment in 
return for a matching award subject to achieving 
stretching performance conditions. It is a one-
off arrangement and current Executive Directors 
will receive no further awards under the plan.
The CIP has been designed as a tool to both 
incentivise and retain the existing team, by the 
inclusion of a penalty through the forfeiture of 
invested shares in the event the Executives 
resign from the employment of the Group within 
two years of Listing.
Performance Share Plan
The Performance Share Plan will be our 
ongoing long-term incentive plan. Due to their 
participation in the CIP , the intention is for 
Executive Directors to receive their first award 
under the PSP in 2016.
FY14 Performance and  
Remuneration Outcomes 
Highlights of the Group’s financial and 
operational highlights include:
Financial Highlights
 Revenues grew 11.2% to £665.4m, 
reflecting store portfolio expansion and 
strength across food, accessories and 
services
 Like-for-like sales growth of 2.4%, driven 
by VIP Club success strength in Advanced 
Nutrition, omni-channel, and the growing 
maturity of Groom Rooms and vet practices
 Like-for-like growth in revenues generated 
within the Joint Venture veterinary practices 
of 14.0%, underpinning fee income growth
 Underlying EBITDA margin expansion of 
17bps to 16.6%, reflecting the leverage from 
our services business, which represents 
7.6% of Group revenues (FY13: 5.3%) 
Operational Highlights
 Now the largest vet services provider in UK 
with 277 practices, reflective of 47 in-store 
openings and 22 standalone openings 
during the year 
 32 new Pets At Home stores opened during 
the year, including the new, high-end, dog 
focused high street format, Barkers 
 Largest number of Groom Rooms ever 
opened in a single year; 42 new salons were 
opened, bringing the portfolio to 129 salons
Annual Bonus Payments in  
respect of FY14 Performance
On the basis of Pets At Home’s financial 
performance and also taking into account 
individual performance against objectives 
set by the pre IPO remuneration committee, 
the Remuneration Committee agreed bonus 
payments.
Shareholder engagement
We value all feedback from Shareholders and 
as a public company we intend to engage with 
our investors on a regular basis. We hope to 
receive your support for our Policy Report and 
our Annual Report on Remuneration at our AGM 
on 9th September 2014.

Remuneration policy
a) Policy Report
The following section on pages 84 to 97 sets out our Directors’ Remuneration Policy, in accordance with section 439A of the Companies Act 2006. 
This Policy will be put forward for Shareholder approval at our AGM on 9th September 2014 and will apply from that date. It is currently intended that 
the Policy will apply for three years.
Overall remuneration is structured and set at levels to enable the recruitment and retention of high calibre executives and encourage them to enhance 
the Company’s performance, in a responsible manner, in line with the business’s strategy and Shareholders’ interests.
A significant portion of the package is performance related. Remuneration has been set taking into account practice within the FTSE 250 and practice 
at other retail companies.

 Paid in cash and are pensionable.
 The Committee takes into consideration a number of  
factors when setting salaries, including (but not limited to):
 — Size and scope of the individual’s responsibilities;
 — The individual’s skills, experience and performance;
 — Typical salary levels for comparable roles within  
appropriate pay comparators including practice for  
retail companies and the broader FTSE 250; and
 — Pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group.
 In FY15, basic salaries will be reviewed at the June 
Remuneration Committee meeting and subsequent reviews 
will take place annually at the March Remuneration 
Committee meeting. Any change will usually be effective 
from the first period in the following financial year.
 Whilst there is no maximum salary level, any increases 
will normally be broadly in line with the wider colleague 
population within the relevant geographic area.
 Higher increases may be made under certain 
circumstances, at the Committee’s discretion. For example, 
this may include:
 — Increase in the scope and/or responsibility of the 
individual’s role; and
 — Development of the individual within the role.
 Annual base salaries for the Executive Directors are set out 
in Part 3(a) of this report.

Fixed elements — benefits
To provide 
colleagues with 
market competitive 
benefits
 The Company provides a range of benefits, which may 
include:
 — a company car (or cash equivalent)
 — life assurance
 — permanent health insurance
 — private medical insurance.
 These benefits are not pensionable.
 Other benefits may be considered by the Committee,  
if considered appropriate.
 The Company may also meet certain mobility costs, such 
as relocation support, expatriate allowances, temporary 
living and transportation expenses, in line with the 
prevailing mobility policy and practice for other senior 
Executives.
 Executive Directors are eligible to participate in any 
tax-approved all-colleague share plans operated by the 
Company on the same basis as other eligible colleagues. 
Whilst it does not currently operate such a plan, the 
Company intends to introduce a Sharesave scheme during 
the term of this Policy.
 The cost to the Company of providing other benefits may 
vary depending on, for example, market practice and the 
cost of insuring certain benefits.
 The Committee keeps the level of benefit provision under 
regular review.
 Details of current benefit provision for the Executive 
Directors are set out in Part 3(a) of this report.
Fixed elements — pensions
To provide 
colleagues with 
an allowance for 
retirement planning
 Pension contributions are made to either the Group  
Pension Plan, to personal pension schemes or cash 
allowances in lieu of contributions are paid.
 The contribution level for an individual Executive Director 
is capped at 9% of base salary per annum for employer 
contributions.

business strategy
 Delivery will normally be in cash and is not pensionable.
 Performance measures are set annually and payout levels 
are determined by the Committee after the year end, based 
on performance against those targets during the relevant 
financial year.
 Each year, the Committee determines the measures and 
weightings within the following parameters:
 — At least 75% of the annual bonus will be based on 
financial performance measures; and
 — No more than 25% of the annual bonus will be based on 
performance against non-financial measures, including 
for example, individual and strategic objectives.
 The Committee ensures that targets are appropriately 
stretching in the context of the business plan and that 
there is an appropriate balance between incentivising 
Executive Directors to meet financial targets for the year 
and to deliver specific non-financial goals. This balance 
allows the Committee to effectively reward performance 
against the key elements of our strategy.
 The Company may amend the performance measures or 
targets in exceptional circumstances, where it considers 
that they are no longer appropriate.
 There is no provision for recovery.
 The maximum bonus opportunity is 100% of base salary.
 20% is payable for threshold performance.

Governance Long-term incentives — overview
At the time of IPO, the Committee wished to put in place long-term incentive arrangements which would provide for the continued alignment of 
Executive Directors with our shareholders. As such, the Committee approved three long-term incentive plans: the Co-Investment Plan (CIP), the 
Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the Company Share Option Plan (CSOP).
 CIP — a one-off arrangement, tailored to our post-IPO position. It requires Executive Directors to make a significant personal investment in order 
to be eligible to receive a Company match providing that stretching performance conditions are reached. Awards were made on IPO and there is no 
intention to make any further awards to current Executive Directors under the Plan.
 PSP — intended to be our regular, ongoing long-term incentive plan in future years. Given that Executive Directors were made awards under the CIP 
in 2014, there is no intention for current Executive Directors to receive awards under the PSP until 2016.
 CSOP — for Executive Directors, this plan is used to allow the Company and participant to benefit from HMRC-approved option tax treatment in 
respect of the initial part of a PSP award (currently up to £30,000). As such, in line with the PSP above, it is not intended for current Executive 
Directors to receive awards under the CSOP until 2016.
In addition, the Committee intends to introduce a Sharesave plan during the term of this Policy, in which all colleagues will be eligible to participate 
(including Executive Directors).
Although we do not intend to make any further awards under the CIP to current Executive Directors following IPO, we have provided details of the Plan 
in the Policy Table below for clarity. No individual will be eligible to receive two awards under the CIP . The Committee may consider granting a new 
Executive Director a CIP award if it considers it to be appropriate to promote alignment across the Executive team.

To promote continued

Executive Directors and 
shareholders in the years

Current Executive 
Directors will not receive 
any further awards under 
the CIP
 Matching Awards vest after three, four and five years, 
subject to achievement of performance conditions.
 Additional shares (or cash) may be awarded in lieu of 
dividends on any Matching Awards which vest, which 
would have been paid during the vesting period.
 The performance measures under the CIP are:
 — 75% EPS growth — to reflect the financial 
performance of our business and a direct and 
focused measure of Company success.
 — 10% of the total Marching Award will vest for EPS 
growth of 10% per annum, rising to 75% of the total 
Matching Award will vest for EPS growth of 17.5%  
per annum.
 — 25% Relative TSR against the UK General Retail 
Index — a measure of the ultimate delivery of 
shareholder returns, promoting alignment between 
Executive Director remuneration and the shareholder 
experience.
 — 6.25% of the total Marching Award will vest for 
median TSR performance against the Index, and 
25% of the total Matching Award will vest for upper 
quartile TSR performance against the Index.
 Executive Directors invested 250% of base salary in the 
CIP at IPO (Invested Shares).
 Subject to performance, Invested Shares may be 
eligible for up to a 1:1 Company match on this amount 
(Matching Award).
1. The Committee may in the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital, demerger, delisting, or other event which may affect the value of awards, adjust or amend the terms of awards in 
accordance with the rules of the relevant share plan. In the case of the SAYE, any changes may be subject to HMRC approval if required.

 The Committee considers that the performance 
measures are fully aligned with our corporate strategy. 
The Committee has set the targets to be appropriately 
stretching, with regard to a number of internal and 
external reference points, and considers that delivery  
of these targets should create sustainable value for 
shareholders.
 The plan rules also stipulate that the Committee 
may amend the performance measures or targets in 
exceptional circumstances, where it considers that  
they are no longer appropriate. If this discretion was 
used, we would consult with our major shareholders 
and the rationale would be clearly explained in the 
remuneration report.
 Unvested and unexercised awards are subject to  
malus in case of misconduct or misstatement.
 Invested shares may also be forfeited in case of fraud, 
misconduct or negligence.
 Under the terms of the CIP , the treatment of leavers  
depends on the length of the period between grant  
and cessation with Invested Shares being forfeited in 
the event of Early Leavers. See page 94 for  
further details.

Long-term elements — Performance Share Plan (PSP)
1
To incentivise the delivery 
of our business plan on an 
annual basis.
To reward performance 
against key performance 
indicators which are 
critical to the delivery of 
our business strategy.
The intention is that 
current Executive Directors 
will not receive awards 
under the PSP until 2016
 Awards vest after three years, subject to achievement  
of performance conditions.
 Additional shares (or cash) may be awarded in lieu of 
dividends on any shares which vest, which would have 
been paid during the vesting period.
 Share awards are normally made in the form of 
conditional share awards, but may be awarded in  
other forms if appropriate (such as nil cost options).  
The plan rules specify that awards may also be  
satisfied in cash although this is unlikely to apply  
to Directors. 
 The ultimate goal of the Company’s strategy is to 
provide long-term sustainable returns to shareholders. 
The Committee strives to do this by aligning the 
performance measures under the PSP with the  
long-term strategy of the Company and considers  
that strong performance under the chosen measures  
should result in sustainable value creation:
 — Financial measure — to reflect the financial  
performance of our business and a direct and 
focused measure of Company success. The 
Committee sets targets to be appropriately 
stretching, with regard to a number of internal and 
external reference points.
 — Share price performance measure – a measure of 
the ultimate delivery of shareholder returns. This 
promotes alignment between Executive Director 
reward and the Shareholder experience. Targets 
are set with reference to wider market practice and 
positioned at a level which the Committee considers 
represents stretching performance.
 The Committee sets targets each year, achievement 
of which it considers would represent stretching 
performance in the context of the business plan.
 Normally the weighting would be split equally across 
these two measures, although the Committee may  
vary this as appropriate to reflect strategic priorities.
 The maximum award opportunity under the PSP is 
normally 150% of base salary (or 200% of salary in 
circumstances which the Committee considers to be 
exceptional).
1. The Committee may in the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital demerger, delisting, or other event which may affect the value of awards, adjust or amend the terms of awards in 
accordance with the rules of the relevant share plan. In the case of the SAYE, any changes may be subject to HMRC approval if required.

 For ‘threshold’ levels of performance, 25% of the 
maximum award vests, increasing to 100% of the  
award for maximum performance.
 The plan rules also stipulate that the Committee 
may amend the performance measures or targets in 
exceptional circumstances, where it considers that  
they are no longer appropriate. If this discretion was 
used, we would consult with our major shareholders 
and the rationale would be clearly explained in the 
remuneration report.
 Unvested and unexercised awards are subject to malus  
in case of misconduct or misstatement.
 The Committee may at its discretion structure awards 
as Approved Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) 
awards. CSOP awards enable the participant and 
Company to benefit from HMRC approved option tax 
treatment in respect of part of the award, without 
increasing the pre-tax value delivered to participants. 
CSOP awards may be structured either as an approved 
option for the part of the award up to the HMRC limit 
(currently £30,000) with an unapproved option for the 
balance and a ‘linked award’ to fund the exercise price 
of the approved option, or as an approved option and 
a PSP award, with the vesting of the PSP award scaled 
back to take account of any gain made on exercise of 
the approved option.
SAYE
1
An all-colleague plan, 
which encourages long-
term shareholding and 
to align the interests 
of UK colleagues with 
shareholders.
Executive Directors are 
eligible to participate
 SAYE is an HMRC-approved scheme where eligible 
colleagues are granted savings-related share options 
to subscribe for ordinary shares in the Company. It is 
intended that the plan will be implemented during 2014.
 Options are granted to be exercisable in conjunction 
with either a three-year or five-year savings contract  
with a monthly savings limit of £500.
 Options are normally granted at a discount of 20% to 
market price at the time of invitation. 
 There are no performance measures attached to  
awards under the SAYE.
  The market value of the shares under option at the date 
of maturity of the Sharesave savings contract, less the 
grant price of the option at the contract start date.
1. The Committee may in the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital demerger, delisting, or other event which may affect the value of awards, adjust or amend the terms of awards in 
accordance with the rules of the relevant share plan. In the case of the SAYE, any changes may be subject to HMRC approval if required.

Operation and performance

Maximum 
opportunity
Overall remuneration
To attract and retain high 
calibre individuals by 
offering market competitive 
fee arrangements
 Non-Executive Directors receive a basic fee in respect  
of their Board duties.
 Further fees are paid to Non-Executive Directors in 
respect of Deputy Chairman of the Board and/or 
chairmanship of Board committees.
 The Non-Executive Chairman receives an all-inclusive  
fee for the role.
 The remuneration of the Non-Executive Chairman is set 
by the Remuneration Committee, whilst the Board as 
a whole is responsible for determining Non-Executive 
Director fees. These fees are the sole element of Non-
Executive remuneration and they are not eligible for 
incentive awards, pensions or other benefits.
 Fees are typically reviewed annually.
 Expenses incurred in the performance of Non-Executive 
duties for the Company may be reimbursed or paid for 
directly by the Company, as appropriate, including any 
tax due on the benefits.
 Current fee levels can be found on page 102.
 Fees are set at a level which is considered appropriate 
to attract and retain the calibre of individual required by 
the Company.
 The Company’s articles of association provide that the 
total aggregate remuneration paid to the Non-Executive 
Chairman and the NEDs will be within the limits set by 
shareholders.
Legacy matters
The Committee will honour remuneration related commitments to current and former Executive Directors (including the exercise of any discretions 
available to the Committee in relation to such commitments) where the terms were agreed prior to the approval and implementation of the 
remuneration policy detailed in this report (provided that, in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in consideration for the individual 
becoming an Executive Director of the Company).
For these purposes, payments include the Committee satisfying awards of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the terms of 
the payment are agreed at the time the award is granted.
Remuneration arrangements throughout the Company
The remuneration policy for our Executive Directors is designed in line with the remuneration philosophy and principles that underpin remuneration for 
the wider Company.
All our reward arrangements are built around the common objectives and principles outlined below:
 Performance driven — The Company intentionally places significant focus on variable remuneration, ensuring that a meaningful proportion of 
remuneration is based on performance. Performance targets are typically aligned with those of the Executive Directors. As a result, individuals are 
incentivised towards consistent financial and non-financial business goals and objectives, in addition to appropriate individual goals.
 Colleagues as Shareholders — The Committee intends to put in place a Sharesave plan during the term of this Policy, to allow our wider colleague 
population to build up a Shareholding in the Company. In addition, under the terms of our IPO, colleagues were permitted to buy shares on Listing 
and over 2,700 colleagues took up this opportunity.

c) Recruitment policy
The following table sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the appointment of an 
Executive Director and the approach to be adopted by the Committee in respect of each component.
Element Policy and operation
Overall
 The Committee’s approach when considering the overall remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of a member 
of the Board from an external party is to take account of the Executive Director’s remuneration package in their 
prior role, the market positioning of the remuneration package, and to not pay more than necessary to facilitate the 
recruitment of the individual.
 Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the business, in addition to considering the matters detailed 
above for external candidates, the normal policy of the Company is that any legacy arrangements would be honoured 
in line with the original terms and conditions.
Fixed elements
(Base salary, benefits and 
other benefits)
 We recognize that salary levels drive other elements of the package and would therefore seek to pay a salary which 
is competitive, but no more than necessary to secure the individual.
 The Executive Director would be eligible to participate in our benefit and pension plans, including coverage under all 
Executive Director and colleague pension and benefit programmes in accordance with the terms and conditions of 
such plans, as may be amended by the Company from time to time.
 The Company may meet certain mobility costs, including relocation support, expatriate allowances, temporary living 
and transportation expenses in line with the prevailing mobility policy and practice for senior executives.
Short-term incentives
 The individual will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus plan, in accordance with the rules and terms of the 
plan in operation at the time.
	 The	maximum	le vel	of	oppor tunity	will	be	no	greater	than	that	set	out	in	the	P olicy	T able	abo ve	(i.e.	••%	of	base	
salary).
Long-term incentives
 The individual will be eligible to participate in the Performance Share Plan (and the associated Company Share 
Option Plan), in accordance with the rules and terms of the plan in operation at the time. The maximum level of 
opportunity will be no greater than that set out in the Policy Table above (i.e. 200% of base salary).
 Alternatively, whilst not currently envisaged at this time, the Committee may consider the individual eligible to 
participate in the Co-Investment Plan, which would operate under the same terms as for current participants. The 
maximum level of opportunity will be no greater than that set out in the Policy Table above (i.e. a maximum Matching 
Award of 250% of base salary), and would be pro-rated to reflect the length of the performance period which the 
individual was due to serve.

Governance Element Policy and operation
Buy-out awards
 The Committee will consider what buy-out awards (if any) are reasonably necessary to facilitate the recruitment of a 
new Executive Director in all circumstances. This includes an assessment of the awards which would be forfeited on 
leaving their current employer.
 The Committee will seek to structure any buy-out awards such that overall they are no more generous in terms of 
quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited.
 In determining the quantum and structure of these commitments, the Committee will seek to provide broadly 
equivalent value and replicate, as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of the awards 
forfeited.
 Buy-out awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing long-term incentive plans to the extent possible, 
although awards may also be granted outside of this plan if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
 In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding awards made in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out 
according to their original terms.
 If promotion is part way through the year, an additional top-up award may be made to bring the Executive Director’s 
opportunity to a level that is appropriate in the circumstances.
d) Service contracts and loss of office arrangements
The Committee’s policy on service contracts and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below. On principle, it is the Committee’s 
policy that there should be no element of reward for failure. The Committee’s approach when considering payments in the event of a loss of office 
is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason for the loss of office, Company and individual performance, contractual 
obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules.
The key employment terms and conditions of the current Executive Directors, as stipulated in their service contracts are set out below:
Area Policy
Notice period
 The service contracts for Nick Wood and Ian Kellett provide for a notice period from both the Company and the individual 
of 12 months for Nick Wood, and six months for Ian Kellett.
 New Executive Directors will be appointed on service contracts that have a notice period of not more than 12 months for 
both the Company and the individual.
 The Committee considers this policy provides an appropriate balance between the need to retain the services of key 
individuals for the benefit of the business and the need to limit the potential liabilities of the Company in the event of 
termination.
Contractual payments
 Executive Directors’ service contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination by 
way of payment in lieu of notice (PILON), at the Company’s discretion. Payment in lieu of notice would be made where 
circumstances dictate that the Executive Directors’ services are not required for their full notice period.
 Neither notice nor PILON will be given in the event of gross misconduct.
 Payment in lieu of notice will be limited to base salary and contractual benefits for the relevant notice period.
 There is no contractual entitlement to a payment under the annual bonus in respect of the notice period. 
 Service contracts allow for mitigation if the individual finds alternative employment.

Area Policy
Short-term incentives
 The Committee’s policy is not to award an annual incentive for any portion of the notice period not served.
 Where an Executive Director leaves office after the end of a performance year but before the payment is made, the 
Executive will remain eligible for an annual bonus for that performance year, subject to the normal assessment of 
performance achieved over the period.
 Where an Executive Director leaves office during a performance year, any bonus would be at the Committee’s absolute 
discretion and would take into account performance and the time served during the period.
 No bonus will be paid in the event of gross misconduct.
Long-term incentives
 The treatment of unvested long-term incentive awards is governed by the rules of the relevant incentive plan.
CIP
Treatment under the CIP is dependent on the period elapsed since the IPO.
a. Within the first 24 months following Admission
 Where an individual with a six month notice period voluntarily resigns less than 18 months following the date of 
admission, they will forfeit their Invested Shares and their Matching Awards.
b. Between 24 months and 36 months following Admission
 Where an individual with a six month notice period voluntarily resigns between 18 months and 30 months following the 
date of admission (and completes at least two years’ service by working his notice period or being put on garden leave, or 
would have done so but is given PILON), they will retain their Invested Shares and may retain a portion of their Matching 
Award subject to achievement of performance targets measured over the first two years of the performance period.
c. On or after 36 months following admission
 Where an individual with a six month notice period voluntarily resigns on or after 30 months following the date of 
admission (and completes at least three years’ service by working his notice period or being put on garden leave, or 
would have done so but is given PILON), they will retain their Invested Shares and, if a good leaver (defined as under the 
PSP), also their Matching Award, unless the Committee determines otherwise. 
Any participant who is dismissed for reasons of fraud or negligence will forfeit their Invested Shares and Matching  
Awards in full.
PSP
 Under the PSP , the default position is for unvested awards to lapse upon a loss of office event.
 Where an individual is determined to be a ‘good’ leaver (which include for reasons of death, illness, injury, disability, 
retirement or any other reason at the discretion of the Committee) the Committee may allow unvested awards to subsist 
until the relevant vesting date, subject to satisfaction of the performance conditions and pro-rated for time served.
 Alternatively, the Committee may, at its discretion, allow awards to vest at an earlier date, having regard to the 
achievement of performance conditions to that date and the period of time that has passed since the date of grant. The 
Committee may choose to apply no reduction in the amount vesting if it is considered appropriate given the particular 
circumstances.

Governance Area Policy
Change in control
 The Committee’s policy is that service contracts should not provide for additional compensation on severance as a result 
of a change in control.
 Under the PSP , the Committee will determine whether and to what extent awards shall vest, taking into account all relevant 
factors including Company performance, the period of time elapsed since the date of grant and the interests of our 
shareholders.
 Under the CIP , participants will be eligible to retain their full Invested Shares and all restrictions on them will be lifted. 
The Committee will determine whether and to what extent Matching Awards shall vest, taking into account Company 
performance, and the period of time elapsed since the date of grant.
External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold an external appointment with the prior consent of the Board. Any fees may be retained by the individual.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors, including the Chairman of the Board, have letters of appointment which set out their duties and responsibilities. They do 
not have service contracts.
The key terms of the appointments are set out in the table below:
Provision Policy
Period
 Initially appointed for a period of three years, subject to annual review and notice.
 In line with the UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors will seek annual re-appointment by Shareholders at the AGM.
Loss of office
 Three months’ notice by either the Company or the Non-Executive Director.
 Non-Executive Directors and the Chairman of the Board are not entitled to compensation on leaving the Board.
Fees
 As set out on page 102.
Expiry of current term See page 99 for details of the expiry of the current term of Non-Executive Directors’ letters of appointment.
Availability of documentation
Service contracts and letters of appointment for all Directors are available for inspection by any person at our registered office in Handforth, Cheshire. 
They will also be available for inspection during the 30 minutes prior to the start of our AGM to be held in Manchester on 9th September 2014.
e) Illustration of the remuneration policy
Our remuneration arrangements have been designed to ensure that a significant proportion of pay is dependent on the delivery of stretching 
short-term and long-term performance targets, aligned with the creation of sustainable Shareholder value. The Committee considers the level of

Pension £38,250 £28,800
Total Fixed Pay £474,750 £360,300
f) Consideration of conditions elsewhere in the Company
As per the Committee’s terms of reference, we also review the pay and conditions of colleagues at levels below the Executive Directors. This includes 
approving the design of, and determining targets for, any performance related pay schemes such as the bonus scheme operated by the Company and 
approving the total annual payments made under such schemes. The Committee is also consulted concerning any major changes in colleague benefit 
structures throughout the Group.
The remuneration package for all colleagues including the Executive Directors is reviewed on an annual basis and a consistent approach is applied at 
all levels.  As part of the annual salary and benefits review, the Company takes into account industry standards, future legislative framework (including 
the national minimum wage) and the financial and economic environment of the Group both internally and externally. The annual salary and benefits 
review is presented to the Committee with recommendations on remuneration throughout the colleague base, including a proposed salary increase to 
be applied to all colleagues’ wages, including Executive Directors. As such, the Committee has regard to this Group-wide annual review process when 
setting its remuneration policy for Executive Directors.
Whilst our colleagues are not directly consulted as part of the process of determining pay, the output from colleague surveys, including our internal 
‘We’re All Ears’ survey, is considered when carrying out the annual salary and benefits review. 
A significant number of our colleagues are also Shareholders and so are able to express their views in the same way as other Shareholders as a 
result of the IPO process and the colleague offer referred to on page 82.
g) Consideration of Shareholder views
Although we have only recently become a public listed company, the Committee recognises the importance of building a good relationship with our new 
Shareholders. This reflects our commitment to follow the highest standards of practice in relation to remuneration and governance at Pets At Home. 
In reviewing the remuneration arrangements which were put in place at IPO, the Committee evaluated current best practice in the listed environment. 
In particular, the Committee was keen to promote alignment, motivate our Executive team and retain key talent to drive our business strategy. Our aim 
was to adopt a remuneration framework which would drive achievement of our corporate goals, whilst providing Shareholders with comfort that it was 
appropriate, justified and did not encourage unacceptable risk management behaviour.
We will continue to monitor Shareholder views when evaluating and setting ongoing remuneration strategy, and we commit to consulting with 
Shareholders prior to any significant changes to our remuneration policy.
h) Minor amendments
The Committee may make minor amendments to the policy set out above (for regulatory, exchange control, tax or administrative purposes or to take 
account of a change in legislation) without obtaining Shareholder approval for that amendment.

Annual report on remuneration
a) Single total figure of remuneration for Executive Directors for the year ended 27th March 2014
The information presented from this section up until the relevant note on page 103 represents the audited section of this report.
The following table sets out the total remuneration for Executive Directors for the year ended 27th March 2014. The Company was incorporated on 
10th February 2014; however, payments were received by the Executive Directors in respect of the period from 17th March to 27th March 2014. Since 
the Company is a newly incorporated and listed company there are no prior year comparator figures.

Ian Kellett 8,556 348 770 7,207 n/a 16,880
Base salary — corresponds to the amount received during the financial year since IPO.
As explained in the Remuneration Committee Chairman’s statement above, prior to IPO, the salaries of our Executive Directors were reviewed against 
other companies comparable to Pets At Home. 
 Nick Wood’s base salary reflects his annual salary of £425,000 per annum paid by the Company since IPO to the year end.
 Ian Kellett’s base salary reflects his annual salary of £320,000 per annum paid by the Company since IPO to the year end.
Benefits — corresponds to the taxable value of benefits received during the financial year since IPO and principally includes company car (or cash 
equivalent), life assurance and permanent health insurance.
Pension — corresponds either to amount contributed to personal pension plans or the cash value of salary supplement received during the financial 
year since IPO. Executive Directors receive a Company pension contribution worth 9% of their salary or a cash allowance where the Annual Allowance 
has been reached. 
Annual bonus — corresponds to the annual bonus earned in respect of performance in the year ended 27th March 2014, prorated over the period 
since IPO.
The payments were determined by the Remuneration Committee under the bonus plan approved by the pre-IPO remuneration committee with awards 
being linked to both pre-set targets for the Group’s underlying EBITDA and achievement of non-financial personal objectives which were aligned to 
the key strategic priorities of the Group. The terms of the plan provided for a payment of up to 50% of salary for achievement of certain levels of 
financial targets and up to 25% of salary for achievement of the agreed personal objectives together with the discretion to make additional awards 
for exceptional performance. Shareholders will recognise that we have not disclosed specific financial performance targets for reasons of commercial 
sensitivity. The Remuneration Committee approved the bonus awards having taken account of:
 Achievement of underlying Group EBITDA of £110.7m.
 Individual contribution to the preparation and execution of the IPO.
 Performance against individually set targets. For the CEO these included the implementation of SAP , successful delivery of smaller store 
format and achievement of a number of core KPIs such as achievement of new store opening pipeline. For the CFO, these included successful 
integration of the finance function of the Vets4Pets business and achievement of targeted synergies, achievement of the working capital plan and 
implementation of the SAP function into the finance team.
Long-term incentives — no relevant long-term incentives vested in respect of the year under consideration.

Company on 10th February 2014 and both resigned on 11th February 2014. They were Directors for administration purposes in connection with the incorporation of the Company and so did not receive 
any remuneration for their services.
c) Scheme interests awarded during the financial year

d) Payments for loss of office
No payments for loss of office were made during the financial year.
e) Payments to past Directors
No payments were made to past Directors during the year.
f) Statement of Directors’ shareholding and share interests
The Committee believes that colleague share ownership is an important means to support long-term commitment to the Company and the alignment 
of colleague interests with those of Shareholders.
The interests of the Executive Directors are closely aligned with those of other Shareholders in this regard, through the operation of the Co-Investment 
Plan, which required participants to commit a significant amount of their IPO proceeds. This was a one-off award. From 2016 onwards, Executive 
Directors will participate in the PSP , which will further align their interests with those of Shareholders. Both of these remuneration elements constitute 
a significant proportion of the individual remuneration packages.
Executive Directors are subject to a shareholding requirement of 200% of base salary, which should be built up over a period of five years. This policy 
continues below the Board, with the next level of senior Executives also subject to a shareholding guideline. The Committee reviews share ownership 
levels annually.
Current shareholding levels for Directors are set out in the table below.

j) Dilution limits
In accordance with the ABI guidelines, the Company can satisfy awards under its colleague share plans with new issue shares up to maximum of 10% 
of its issued share capital in a rolling ten year period and within this 10% limit, the Company can only issue 5% of its issued share capital to satisfy 
awards under discretionary plans. 
k) External appointments
Executive Directors are entitled to accept one external appointment outside the Company with the consent of the Board. Any fees received may be 
retained by the Director.
As at the date of this report, neither of the Executive Directors held an external appointment for which they receive a fee.

Benefits
The Committee sets benefits in line with the policy set out on page 85. There are no changes proposed to the benefit framework in 2014/15.

Annual bonus
The maximum annual bonus opportunity for Executive Directors in respect of 2014/15 will be 100% of base salary.
The annual bonus framework will be in line with that presented in the policy table on page 86. At this stage, the Committee considers that the exact 
annual bonus targets remain commercially sensitive. However, in next year’s annual report, we commit to providing shareholders with as much context 
as possible on performance against those targets and rationale for the resulting annual bonus out-turns, within commercial constraints.
Performance Share Plan
There is currently no intention for Executive Directors to participate in the PSP until 2016, given that they received awards under the CIP on IPO.

Governance m) The Remuneration Committee
Shareholder context for the Committee’ s activities
During the year, the Committee received independent advice on Executive remuneration matters from Deloitte LLP (Deloitte). 
Deloitte is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in relation to Executive 
remuneration consulting in the UK. The Committee has reviewed the advice provided by Deloitte during the year and is comfortable that it has been 
objective and independent. Total fees received by Deloitte in relation to the remuneration advice provided to the Committee during 2013/14 amounted 
to £70,000 (excl. VAT), based on the required time commitment. 
In addition, other practices of Deloitte separate from the executive remuneration practice have provided general tax advice to the Group during  
the year.
During FY14, the Committee also received support from Travers Smith LLP on the terms of the discretionary and all-colleague share plans. 
The Committee met once during FY14 post Listing; the individuals listed in the table below, none of whom were Committee members, attended at 
least part of the meeting by invitation during the year.
Attendee Position
Tony DeNunzio Chairman of the Board
Brian Carroll Non-Executive Director
Sally Hopson Customer, People and Development Director

None of the individuals attended part of any meeting in which their own compensation was discussed.
Governance
The Board and the Committee consider that, throughout 2013/14 and up to the date of this report, the Company has complied with the provisions of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code relating to Directors’ remuneration.
Shareholder voting
The Company has yet to hold a Shareholder vote on its remuneration report.
Annual General Meeting
As set out in my statement on page 82, our policy report and annual report on remuneration will be subject to a binding and advisory vote respectively, 
at our AGM to be held on 9th September 2014.

Independent Auditor’ s Report 
to the Members of Pets At Home Group Plc only 
Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Pets At Home Group Plc for the year ended 27th March 2014 set out on pages 108 to 156. In our 
opinion: 
 the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 27th March 2014 and of 
the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the 
European Union (IFRSs as adopted by the EU); 
 the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and as applied in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and 
 the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit were  
as follows:
IPO accounting and disclosures
Refer to page 78 (Audit Committee Report), pages 116-118 (accounting policy) and pages 140-141 (financial disclosures)
 The risk: The public listing of the Group in March 2014 was preceded by changes to the Group’s legal structure. The restructuring involved a 
number of legal steps which included the issue of a mix of debt and equity and resulted in significant transaction costs some of which were 
recorded as a deduction from debt and equity. Due to the complex nature of these transactions and the judgement involved in allocating the 
costs this has been an area of focus for our audit this year. 
 Our response: Our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the validity and accurate reflection of each of the steps to create the 
new corporate structure. We inspected external legal advice obtained by the Group to assess if the Group’s capital structure has been correctly 
accounted for in line with Companies Act 2006 requirements. We used our own financial reporting specialists to assist us in challenging the 
accounting principles applied. We also challenged the appropriate classification of transaction costs as an expense or deduction from debt or 
equity and assessed whether the financial statement disclosures in relation to the IPO are sufficient and appropriate.
Carrying value of inventory (£46.1m)
Refer to page 79 (Audit Committee Report), page 122 (accounting policy) and page 136 (financial disclosures)
 The risk: Inventory is carried at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The Group is exposed to inventory recoverability risk as a result of new 
product launches, changes in customer preferences and consumer spending patterns with respect to the Group’s products. The Group carries a 
broad range of products, some with a limited shelf life, and may be unable to sell products in sufficient quantities during the relevant seasons. It 
may be difficult to accurately forecast demand when a new product is launched and the demand for products may also change between the time 
inventory is ordered from suppliers and the date of sale. As such there is a risk that the carrying value of inventory exceeds its net realisable 
value.
 Our response: Our audit procedures included, among others, assessing the principles and appropriateness of the Group’s inventory provisioning 
policies based on our understanding of the business and the accuracy of previous provisioning estimates. We obtained the inventory provision 
calculation and performed a recalculation of the amounts. We challenged whether inventory lines and sales prices had been appropriately 
included in the calculation through an analysis of data from both the inventory and sales system. We analysed specific attributes including 
historical sales trends, the ageing of individual inventory lines and sales prices. We also assessed the adequacy of the disclosures in respect of 
amounts recognised as provision against inventory during the period.
3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at £2.0m. This has been determined with reference to a benchmark of Group 
profit before taxation, which we consider to be one of the principal considerations for members of the Company in assessing the financial performance 
of the Group. Materiality represents 3.8% of PBT adjusted for items disclosed separately on the face of the income statement.
We agreed with the audit committee to report to it all corrected and uncorrected misstatements we identified through our audit with a value in excess 
of £0.1m, in addition to other audit misstatements below that threshold that we believe warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.

Financial Statements 23410.02     17 July 2014 3:23 PM     Proof 9
Audits were performed by the Group audit team at the key reporting entities in the UK. These Group procedures covered 96% of total group revenue; 
80% of Group profit before taxation; and 97% of total Group assets. 
The audits undertaken for Group reporting purposes at the key reporting components of the Group were all performed to materiality levels set 
individually for each component and ranged from £0.2m to £1.9m.
4 Our opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 is unmodified 
In our opinion: 
 the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements;  
5 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified other 
information in the annual report that contains a material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, a material 
misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 we have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider 
that the annual report and financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information necessary 
for Shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business model and strategy; or
 the Audit Committee Report does not appropriately address matters communicated by us to the audit committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion: 
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or 
 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our auditor; or

1. Significant accounting policies
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated 
financial statements.
Summary of impact of Group restructure and Initial Public Offering
On 17th March 2014, the Group listed its shares on the London Stock Exchange. In preparation for the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) the Group 
was restructured. The restructure has impacted a number of the current year and comparative primary financial statements and notes.
For the consolidated financial statements of the Group, prepared under IFRS, the principles of reverse acquisition accounting under IFRS 3 
”Business Combinations” have been applied. The steps to restructure the Group had the effect of Pets At Home Group Plc (“Plc”) being inserted 
above Pets At Home Lux S.a.r.l (“PAH Lux”) as the holders of PAH Lux share capital and Preferred Equity Certificates (“PECs”) exchanged their 
PAH Lux shares and a portion of their PECS, for shares in Plc.
By applying the principles of reverse acquisition accounting, the Group is presented as if Plc has always owned the PAH Lux Group. The 
comparative Income Statement and Balance Sheet are presented in line with the previously presented PAH Lux position. The comparative and 
current year consolidated reserves of the Group are adjusted to reflect the statutory share capital, share premium and merger reserve of Plc as 
if it had always existed, adjusted for movements in the underlying PAH Lux share capital and reserves until the share for share exchange. 
The steps taken to restructure the Group are explained in more detail in section 1.2. The impact on the primary consolidated financial 
statements is as follows:
 Equity reflects the capital structure of Plc.  As part of the restructuring of the Group, a number of shares in Plc were issued in exchange for 
various instruments or for cash. The premium arising on the issue of shares is allocated between the share premium and merger reserve.
 A consolidation reserve is created. This reflects the difference between the Plc reserves at the balance sheet date as reflected in the 
opening reserves at the start of the comparative period (29th March 2012) and the consolidated equity of PAH Lux at the same date.
 Prior to their cancellation as part of the IPO restructure, the PECs, issued by PAH Lux and shown as additional paid in capital in the 
consolidated financial statements, are shown as equity and the coupon charged on them is charged through reserves as a dividend. 
 As part of the restructure, the PECs were ultimately exchanged for a combination of cash and shares in Plc.
 Fees associated with the IPO are allocated to share premium, secured bank debt and the Consolidated Income Statement depending on 
the nature of the costs. Costs allocated against the secured bank debt will be amortised over the period of the financing. Fees charged to 
the Consolidated Income Statement have been presented as Exceptional Items.
 Due to the timing of the IPO not all fees had been paid at year end and hence there were significant balances in trade and other creditors 
for outstanding fees.  
 The Group refinanced its external bank debt, using proceeds from the IPO to reduce the net debt position of the Group. Unamortised fees 
associated with the previous financing have been written off in the period. This non-cash cost has been presented as an Exceptional Item 
in the Consolidated Income Statement.
1.1 Basis of preparation
The consolidated financial statements presented in this document have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The Company’s financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. The Company has taken 
advantage of the exemption provided under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to publish its individual income statement and related 
notes.
These are the first set of consolidated financial statements of Pets At Home Group Plc, which is the new ultimate holding company of the  
PAH Lux S (formerly KKR My Best Friend Lux S.a.r.l) Group following the reorganisation of the Group to facilitate the Initial Public Offering. 
The financial statements have been presented as a continuation of the PAH Lux S business. To do so, the principles of reverse acquisition 
accounting in IFRS 3 “Business Combinations” have been applied. The result of the application is to present the financial statements as if Pets 
At Home Group Plc has always owned the Group, comparatives have also been prepared on this basis accordingly.

1. Significant accounting policies continued
The Pets At Home Group has not previously prepared consolidated financial statements in accordance with EU endorsed IFRS. As such, these 
financial statements represent its first EU IFRS financial statements and IFRS 1 ‘First time adoption of International Financial Reporting 
Standards’ has been applied. However, as the main trading group, PAH Retail Ltd, adopted IFRSs in the prospectus, these consolidated financial 
statements reflect the amounts previously reported together with the additional assets, liabilities, income and expenses of entities that did not 
form part of that group. As Pets At Home Group has not previously presented consolidated financial statements, no reconciliations from previous 
GAAP have been presented. To aid users, the Group has set out a summary of the key differences between UK GAAP (the Group’s subsidiaries’ 
previous GAAP) and IFRS in note 1.4.
The financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, as modified by the revaluation of derivative financial instruments 
to fair value, and in accordance with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS as adopted by 
the European Union. New standards and interpretations issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) and the International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) becoming effective during the year have not had a material impact on the Group’s financial 
statements.
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. In determining the appropriate basis of preparation of the financial 
statements, the Directors are required to consider whether the Group can continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. The 
Directors are of the opinion that the Group and the Company have adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future, and feel it appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing this Annual Report and Financial Statements.
1.2 Group Reorganisation
Prior to the Initial Public Offering (“IPO”) the Group undertook a reorganisation in preparation for the transaction.
The effect of this reorganisation was to insert two new companies into the Group, a new ultimate parent company, Pets At Home Group Plc, and 
its wholly owned subsidiary Pets At Home No. 1 Limited, which is summarised below, acquired the entire issued share capital PAH Retail Ltd. 
Pets At Home Group Plc became the ultimate parent company of the Group by acquiring, directly and indirectly, interests in PAH Lux S.a.r.l in 
exchange for the issue of new shares. As part of this process, Preferred Equity Certificates issued by PAH Lux S.a.r.l were ultimately capitalised 
prior to that company’s transfer out of the Group and subsequent placing into liquidation.
Key steps in this process included:
 On 10th February 2014, a new company, Pets At Home Group Plc, was incorporated with one ordinary share of £1. On 14th February 2014, 
one redeemable preference share of £50,000 was issued. 
 On 11th February 2014, a new intermediate holding company, Pets At Home No. 1 Ltd, was incorporated as a direct wholly owned 
subsidiary of Pets At Home Group Plc.
 On 17th March 2014, Pets At Home Group Plc, directly and indirectly, acquired the entire share capital of PAH Lux S.a.r.l and £343m of 
Preferred Equity Certificates issued by PAH Lux S.a.r.l in exchange for the issue of 306 million new ordinary shares of £0.01 per share, 
creating a share premium of £634m and a merger reserve of £113m.

 On 17th March 2014, Pets At Home No. 1 Ltd acquired the entire issued share capital of PAH Lux S.a.r.l and certain Preferred Equity 
Certificates issued by PAH Lux S.a.r.l and held by Pets At Home Group Plc in exchange for 100 new ordinary shares.
 On 17th March 2014, Pets At Home No. 1 Ltd purchased the remaining £175.6m of Preferred Equity Certificates issued by PAH Lux S.a.r.l 
and outstanding interest in exchange for the issue of a subordinated loan note instrument.
 On 17th March 2014, PAH UK Midco Limited (formerly KKR My Best Friend UK Midco Ltd), a subsidiary of the Group, capitalised £9.7m of 
its issued loan notes, by issuing new ordinary shares. On the same date, Pets At Home Group Plc acquired these ordinary shares issued 
by PAH UK Midco Ltd by way of share for share exchange, issuing 4,000,000 ordinary £0.01 shares, creating a share premium of £2.44 
per share.
 On 17th March 2014, Pets At Home No. 1 Ltd acquired the entire issued share capital of PAH Retail Ltd, the consideration for which was 
left outstanding at an intercompany balance.
 On 17th March 2014, Pets At Home Group Plc issued 189,460,946 ordinary £0.01 share capital at an initial offer price of £2.45  
per share, generating proceeds of £464.2m. On the same date, Pets At Home Group Plc drew down £325m of senior debt facility.
 Subsequent to the IPO, and prior to the year end PAH Lux S.a.r.l, PAH International Limited and PAH UK Finco Limited were transferred out 
of the Group, PAH Lux S.a.r.l. and PAH UK Finco were placed into liquidation.
The Group used the proceeds of the IPO and new senior term debt to settle the Group’s previous senior debt. The Preferred Equity Certificates 
issued by PAH Lux S.a.r.l were ultimately exchanged for cash, further utilising proceeds from the transaction, and/or shares in Pets At Home 
Group Plc. This has been treated as a distribution from the consolidated reserves of the Group.
On 8 April 2013, PAH Luxco S.a.r.l redeemed £130,400,000 of Preferred Equity Certificates plus outstanding yield. 
1.3 Measurement convention
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except that the following assets and liabilities are stated at their 
fair value: derivative financial instruments, financial instruments classified as fair value through the profit or loss or as available-for-sale. Non-
current assets held for sale are stated at the lower of previous carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell.
1.4 UK GAAP to IFRS information
The main trading businesses within the Group present their statutory accounts under UK Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP). 
The key differences arising on transition to IFRS in the consolidated Group financial statements for financial information previously presented 
under UK GAAP are as follows:
 Recognition of lease incentives over the full lease term.
 Acquisition costs relating to business combinations effected on or after 26th March 2010, the Group’s IFRS transition date are expensed 
in accordance with IFRS 3 (Revised) “Business Combinations”.
 Goodwill is not amortised.
 Recognition of derivative financial instruments on the Statement of Financial Position through Other Comprehensive Income.
1.5 Going concern
The Company’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Strategic Report on pages 3 to 51. The financial position of the Company, its cash flows, liquidity position and borrowing facilities are described 
in the Chief Financial Officer’s review on pages 42 to 47. In addition, notes 20–21 to the financial statements include the Company’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging 
activities; and its exposures to credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Company has considerable financial resources and financing facilities and prepares detailed business plans that model headroom on 
financial covenants. 
The Directors believe the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully and therefore have a reasonable expectation that the 
Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going 
concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements.

1.6 Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, the Group takes into consideration potential voting rights that are 
currently exercisable. The acquisition date is the date on which control is transferred to the acquirer. The financial statements of subsidiaries are 
included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases. Losses applicable to 
the non-controlling interests in a subsidiary are allocated to the non-controlling interests even if doing so causes the non-controlling interests to 
have a deficit balance.
Other investments
The Group has a number of non-participatory shareholdings in veterinary practice companies. The veterinary practices were established under 
terms that do not give either party control and therefore are not consolidated in these financial statements. These are accounted for as 
available-for-sale investments.
1.7 Foreign currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective functional currencies of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at 
the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are retranslated to the 
functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the 
income statement, except for differences arising on the retranslation of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment in a 
foreign operation that is effective, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are recognised directly in other comprehensive income. Non-monetary 
assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the 
transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are retranslated to the functional 
currency at foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the 
Group’s presentational currency, sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of foreign 
operations are translated at an average rate for the period where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the 
transactions. Exchange differences arising from this translation of foreign operations are reported as an item of other comprehensive income 
and accumulated in the translation reserve or non-controlling interest, as the case may be. 
Functional currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling which is the Company’s functional currency, and have been rounded to the 
nearest thousand.
1.8 Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Following the adoption of IAS 32, financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following 
two conditions: 
(a) they include no contractual obligations upon the Company (or Group as the case may be) to deliver cash or other financial assets or to 
exchange financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company (or 
Group); and 
(b) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no 
obligation to deliver a variable number of the Company’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Company’s 
exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability. Where the instrument so classified takes 
the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital exclude amounts 
in relation to those shares.

1.9 Non-derivative financial instruments
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, 
loans and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are recognised initially at fair value. Subsequent to initial recognition they are measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method.
Investments in debt and equity securities
Other investments in debt and equity securities held by the Group are classified as being available-for-sale and are stated at fair value, with any 
resultant gain or loss being recognised directly in equity (in the fair value reserve), except for impairment losses and, in the case of monetary 
items such as debt securities, foreign exchange gains and losses. When these investments are derecognised, the cumulative gain or loss 
previously recognised directly in equity is recognised in profit or loss. Where these investments are interest-bearing, interest calculated using the 
effective interest method is recognised in profit or loss.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part 
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose only of the cash flow statement.
Interest-bearing borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-
bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the effective interest method, less any impairment losses.
1.10 Derivative financial instruments and hedging
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value. The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value is recognised immediately in profit 
or loss. However, where derivatives qualify for hedge accounting, recognition of any resultant gain or loss depends on the nature of the item 
being hedged (see below).
Cash flow hedges
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the variability in cash flows of a recognised asset or liability, or a highly 
probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised directly in the hedging 
reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge is recognised immediately in the income statement.
If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, the associated gains and 
losses that were recognised directly in equity are reclassified into profit or loss in the same period or periods during which the asset acquired or 
liability assumed affects profit or loss, i.e. when interest income or expense is recognised.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two policy statements, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from 
equity and recognised in the income statement in the same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss.
When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the 
hedged forecast transaction is still expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance 
with the above policy when the transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain 
or loss recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement immediately.
1.11 Intra-group financial instruments
Financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of companies within the Group, are considered to be insurance arrangements and 
accounted for as such. In this respect, the Group treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable 
that a payment will be required under the guarantee.

1.12 Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses.
Where parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items of property, plant 
and equipment.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant 
and equipment. Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold property — 50 years 
Motor vehicles — 3 years
Fixtures, fittings, tools and equipment — 3–7 years
Leasehold improvements — the term of the lease
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each balance sheet date. 
1.13 Business combinations
Subject to the relief in IFRS 1, all business combinations, with the exception of those accounted for as reverse acquisitions, are accounted for by 
applying the acquisition method. Business combinations are accounted for using the acquisition method as at the acquisition date, which is the 
date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
Acquisitions on or after 26th March 2010
For acquisitions on or after 26th March 2010, the Group measures goodwill at the acquisition date as:
 the fair value of the consideration transferred; plus 
 the recognised amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree; plus
 the fair value of the existing equity interest in the acquiree; less
 the net recognised amount (generally fair value) of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed. 
When the excess is negative, a bargain purchase gain is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
Costs related to the acquisition, other than those associated with the issue of debt or equity securities, are expensed as incurred.
Any contingent consideration payable is recognised at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as 
equity, it is not remeasured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes to the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
On a transaction-by-transaction basis, the Group elects to measure non-controlling interests, which have both present ownership interests 
and are entitled to a proportionate share of net assets of the acquiree in the event of liquidation, either at its fair value or at its proportionate 
interest in the recognised amount of the identifiable net assets of the acquiree at the acquisition date. All other non-controlling interests are 
measured at their fair value at the acquisition date. 
Acquisitions prior to 26th March 2010 (date of adoption of IFRSs)
IFRS 1 grants certain exemptions from the full requirements of Adopted IFRSs for first time adopters. In respect of acquisitions prior to  
26th March 2010, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost.
1.14 Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests
Acquisitions and disposals of non-controlling interests that do not result in a change of control are accounted for as transactions with owners in 
their capacity as owners and therefore no goodwill is recognised as a result of such transactions. The adjustments to non-controlling interests 
are based on a proportionate amount of the net assets of the subsidiary. Any difference between the price paid or received and the amount by 
which non-controlling interests are adjusted is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the parent.

1.15 Intangible assets and goodwill 
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is 
tested annually for impairment. 
Other intangible assets
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and less accumulated impairment 
losses.
Amortisation
Amortisation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of intangible assets unless such lives 
are indefinite. Intangible assets with an indefinite useful life and goodwill are systematically tested for impairment at each balance sheet date. 
Other intangible assets are amortised from the date they are available for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Computer Software 3–5 years
1.16 Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first in, first out principle and includes expenditure 
incurred in acquiring the inventories, production or conversion costs and other costs in bringing them to their existing location and condition, 
less rebates and discounts.
1.17 Impairment excluding inventories, and deferred tax assets
Financial assets (including receivables)
A financial asset not carried at fair value through profit or loss is assessed at each reporting date to determine whether there is objective 
evidence that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates that a loss event has occurred after the initial 
recognition of the asset, and that the loss event had a negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset that can be estimated 
reliably.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount 
and the present value of the estimated future cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective interest rate. Interest on the impaired 
asset continues to be recognised through the unwinding of the discount. When a subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to 
decrease, the decrease in impairment loss is reversed through profit or loss.
Non-financial assets
The carrying amounts of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each reporting date 
to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, then the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. For 
goodwill, and intangible assets that have indefinite useful lives or that are not yet available for use, the recoverable amount is estimated each 
period at the same time.
The recoverable amount of an asset or cash-generating unit is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs to sell. In assessing 
value in use, the estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset. For the purpose of impairment testing, assets that cannot be tested 
individually are grouped together into the smallest group of assets that generates cash inflows from continuing use that are largely independent 
of the cash inflows of other assets or groups of assets (the “cash-generating unit”). The goodwill acquired in a business combination, for the 
purpose of impairment testing, is allocated to cash-generating units (“CGUs”). Subject to an operating segment ceiling test, for the purposes of 
goodwill impairment testing, CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated are aggregated so that the level at which impairment is tested reflects 
the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal reporting purposes. Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated to 
groups of CGUs that are expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination.

Financial Statements 23410.02     17 July 2014 3:23 PM     Proof 9
1. Significant accounting policies continued
An impairment loss is recognised if the carrying amount of an asset or its CGU exceeds its estimated recoverable amount. Impairment losses 
are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any 
goodwill allocated to the units, and then to reduce the carrying amounts of the other assets in the unit (group of units) on a pro rata basis.
An impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are 
assessed at each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment 
loss had been recognised.
1.18 Employee benefits
Defined contribution plans
A defined contribution plan is a post-employment benefit plan under which the company pays fixed contributions into a separate entity and 
will have no legal or constructive obligation to pay further amounts. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans are 
recognised as an expense in the income statement in the periods during which services are rendered by employees. 
Short-term benefits
Short-term employee benefit obligations are measured on an undiscounted basis and are expensed as the related service is provided. A liability 
is recognised for the amount expected to be paid under short-term cash bonus or profit-sharing plans if the Group has a present legal or 
constructive obligation to pay this amount as a result of past service provided by the employee and the obligation can be estimated reliably.
Share based payments
A number of employees of the Company’s subsidiaries (including Directors) receive an element of remuneration in the form of share based 
payments, whereby employees render services in exchange for shares or rights over shares.
Share based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value of transactions involving the granting of shares is 
determined by the share price at the date of grant. The fair value of transactions involving the granting of share options is calculated by an 
external valuer based on a binomial model. In valuing share based payments, no account is taken of any performance conditions, other than 
conditions linked to the price of the shares of Pets At Home Group Plc (“market conditions”).
The cost of share based payments is recognised, together with a corresponding increase in equity, on a straight-line basis over the vesting 
period based on the Company’s estimate of how many of the awards will eventually vest. No expense is recognised for awards that do not 
ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or 
not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions are satisfied.
Where the terms of a share based payment award are modified, as a minimum, an expense is recognised as if the terms had not been modified. 
In addition, an expense is recognised for any increase in the value of the transaction as a result of the modification, as measured at the date of 
the modification.
Where a share based payment award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation and any expense not yet recognised 
for the award is recognised immediately. However, if a new award is substituted for the cancelled award, and designated as a replacement award 
on the date that it is granted, the cancelled and new awards are treated as if they were a modification to the original award, as described in the 
previous paragraph. The dilutive effect of outstanding options is reflected as additional share dilution in the computation of diluted earnings  
per share.
1.19 Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, that can 
be reliably measured and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation. Provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects risks specific to the liability.

1.20 Revenue
Revenue
Revenue represents the total amount receivable for goods and services, net of discounts and excluding value added tax, sold in the ordinary 
course of business, and arises from activities in the United Kingdom. 
Revenue is recognised when significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer, there is reasonable certainty over 
recovery of the consideration and the amount of revenue, associated costs and possible return of goods can be estimated reliably. Revenue is 
recognised when transactions are completed in store or online.
i) Sale of goods in store and online
Retail revenue is recorded net of value added tax, colleague discounts, coupons and vouchers. 
ii) Fee income
Fee income received from the joint venture veterinary practice companies is recognised in the period the services relate to and recorded net of 
value added tax. 
iii) VIP scheme
The sales value of the points earned under the VIP scheme are treated as deferred income; the sales are only recognised once the points have 
been redeemed by the charities. 
Cost of sales
Cost of sales includes costs of goods sold and other directly attributable costs and promotional income received from suppliers, including costs 
to deliver business services to joint venture veterinary practices and costs to deliver grooming services.
Exceptional items
Income or costs that are both material and non-recurring, whose significance is sufficient to warrant separate disclosure in the consolidated 
financial statements, are referred to as exceptional items. These are included and separately identified within their relevant income statement 
category.
1.21 Expenses
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease 
incentives received are recognised in the income statement over the term of the lease as an integral part of the total lease expense. 
Financing income and expenses
Financing expenses comprise interest payable, finance charges on shares classified as liabilities and finance leases recognised in profit or loss 
using the effective interest method, unwinding of the discount on provisions, and net foreign exchange losses that are recognised in the income 
statement (see foreign currency accounting policy). Borrowing costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production 
of an asset that takes a substantial time to be prepared for use, are capitalised as part of the cost of that asset. Financing income comprises 
interest receivable on funds invested, dividend income, and net foreign exchange gains.
Interest income and interest payable is recognised in profit or loss as it accrues, using the effective interest method. Dividend income is 
recognised in the income statement on the date the entity’s right to receive payments is established. Foreign currency gains and losses are 
reported on a net basis.
1.22 Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the period comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent that it 
relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable or receivable on the taxable income or loss for the period, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.

1.22 Taxation continued
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill; the initial 
recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination, and differences relating 
to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided 
is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised. 
1.23 Adopted IFRS not yet applied 
The following Adopted IFRSs have been issued but have not been applied by the Group in these consolidated financial statements:
IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements (2011)’ – On 12 May 2011, the IASB issued IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements which is a 
replacement of IAS 27 Consolidated and separate financial statements and SIC-12 Consolidation – Special purpose entities. This is part of a 
new suite of standards on consolidation and related matters, which will replace the existing accounting for subsidiaries and joint ventures (now 
joint arrangements), and will make limited amendments in relation to associates. Concurrent with the issuance of IFRS 10, the IASB also issued:
 IFRS 11 ‘Joint ventures (2011)’;
 IFRS 12 ‘Disclosures of involvement with other entities (2011)’;
 IAS 27 ‘Separate financial statements (revised 2011)’ has been amended for the issuance of IFRS 10 but retains the current guidance for 
separate financial statements; and
 IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures (revised 2011)’ has been amended for conforming changes based on the issuance of 
IFRS 10 and IFRS 11.
Each of the standards has an effective date for periods beginning on or after 1st January 2014, with earlier application permitted so long as 
each of the other standards in the ‘package of five’ is also early adopted.
The impact of these new standards on the Group is expected to lead to additional disclosure requirements in the Group’s financial statements 
for the period ended March 2015 in relation to the joint venture arrangements in place with veterinary practices.
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments – If endorsed, this standard will simplify the classification of financial assets for measurement purposes. It is not 
anticipated that this standard will have a significant impact on the Group’s financial statements. The effective date is to be determined.
There are certain other amendments and interpretations effective from 1st January 2014 which are not expected to have any significant impact 
on the Group.
1.24 Accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of consolidated financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and 
assumptions concerning the future that affect the application of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and 
expenses. These judgements are based on historical experience and management’s best knowledge at the time and the actual results may 
ultimately differ from these estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis and revisions to accounting 
estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. 
The estimates and assumptions that have significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying value of assets and liabilities are 
discussed below.
Carrying value of inventories
The managers review the market value of and demand for its inventories on a periodic basis to ensure inventory is recorded in the financial 
statements at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Any provision for impairment is recorded against the carrying value of inventories. The 
managers use their knowledge of market conditions to assess future demand for the Group’s products and achievable selling prices.

1. Significant accounting policies continued
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
Determining whether goodwill and other intangibles are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which 
goodwill and other intangible assets have been allocated. The value in use calculation requires estimation of future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash-generating unit and a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. Details of CGUs as well as further information 
about the assumptions made are disclosed in note 10.
Assumptions relating to tax
The Group recognises expected assets for tax based on an estimation of the likely taxes receivable, which requires significant judgement as to 
the ultimate tax determination of certain items. Where the actual asset arising from these issues differs from these estimates, such differences 
will have an impact on income tax and deferred tax assets in the period when such determination is made.
Provisions
Provisions have been made for dilapidations and for closed stores. Information about provisions and contingencies, which are considered to 
have a risk of material adjustment in the next financial period due to the assumptions and estimations used, are disclosed in note 19. The 
provisions are based on historical experience and management’s best knowledge at the time and are reviewed at each balance sheet date. The 
actual costs and timing of future cash flows are dependent on future events. Any difference between expectations and the actual future liability 
will be accounted for in the period when such determination is made.
2 Segmental reporting
The Directors consider there to be one operating and reportable segment, being that of the sale of pet products and services through retail 
outlets and the Group’s website. 
The Group’s Board receives monthly financial information at this level and uses this information to monitor the performance of the store 
portfolio, allocate resources and make operational decisions. The internal reporting received focuses on the Group as a whole and does not 
identify individual segments. To increase transparency, the Group has decided to include an additional voluntary disclosure analysing revenue 
within the reportable segments.
The performance of the operating segment is primarily based on a measure of EBITDA before exceptional items share based payment charges, 
and management charges. This can be reconciled to statutory operating profit as follows:

Acquisitions in the period ended 28th March 2013
Vets4Pets 
The entire share capital of Vets4Pets Limited, Vets4Pets I.P . Limited and Brand Developments Limited were acquired by Pets At Home Holdings 
Limited, a subsidiary undertaking, for a cash consideration of £47,400,000 on 27th March 2013. The transaction has been accounted for as 
a business combination. In the period of acquisition, the subsidiary contributed a net result on 29th March 2012, Group revenue would have 
been £606,695,000 and net profit would have been £23,393,000. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value 
adjustments that arose on the date of acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on 29th March 2012.

Consideration paid: 
Cash price paid 47,400
Total consideration 47,400
Goodwill on acquisition 42,176
Fair Value Adjustments
The fair value adjustments to fixed assets are in relation to the revaluation of freehold property acquired from its book value to the current 
market value (£339,000) and an adjustment to fixed assets held on the fixed asset register of the acquired company which are considered by 
management to be obsolete (£105,000). The adjustment to debtors was made to adjust the bad debt provision in line with the policies applied 
by other Group companies. Creditors have been adjusted to include a provision for onerous leases in line with other Group companies.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition due to the existence of expected synergies from combining operations. 
Acquisition related costs
The Group incurred acquisition related costs of £4,164,000 in the period ended on 28th March 2013 in relation to professional fees and 
transition costs arising upon acquisition, and £2,308,000 relating to costs associated with the integration of the Vets4Pets business into the 
Group in the period ended on 27th March 2014. All such costs have been expensed to the income statement in the relevant period.
Farm Away Ltd
On 12th December 2012 the entire share capital of Farm Away Limited (trading as Ride-away) was acquired by Pets At Home Limited, a 
subsidiary undertaking, for consideration of £6,534,000. Of this consideration, £2,000,000 was deferred and paid in £500,000 instalments 
during the subsequent financial period. The value of this deferred consideration was not contingent. This transaction has been accounted for as 
a business combination. In the four months to 28th March 2013 the subsidiary contributed a net result of £192,000 to the consolidated net 
result for the period. If the acquisition had occurred on 29th March 2012 Group revenue would have been £602,804,000 and net profit would 
have been £21,177,000. In determining these amounts, management has assumed that the fair value adjustments that arose on the date of 
acquisition would have been the same if the acquisition occurred on 29th March 2012.

Fair Value Adjustments
The fair value adjustments to fixed assets are in relation to the revaluation of freehold property acquired from its book value to the current 
market value. A fair value adjustment of £107,000 to stock was required to introduce a provision for slow-moving stock in line with Group 
policies.
Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition due to the existence of expected synergies from combining operations. 
Acquisition related costs
The Group incurred acquisition related cost of £417,000 relating to professional fees and transition costs arising upon acquisition. All such 
costs have been expensed to the income statement in the relevant period.
Companion Care (Services) Limited
During the period ended 28th March 2013 the Group acquired the non-controlling interest of 10% in the Companion Care (Services) Limited 
subsidiary for consideration of £1,390,000 settled in full by cash during the period. The book value of the assets acquired was considered to be 
equal to the fair values of the assets of £10,000. As there was no change in control as a result of this transaction, the difference between the 
fair value of the net assets acquired and the consideration of £1,380,000 has been recognised directly in retained earnings.
PAH UK Midco Limited (formerly KKR My Best Friend UK Midco Limited)
During the period ended 28th March 2013 the Group acquired the non-controlling interest in the PAH UK Midco Limited (formerly KKR My Best 
Friend UK Midco Limited) subsidiary for consideration of £7,685,000 settled in full by cash during that period. The book value of the assets 
acquired was considered to be equal to the fair values of the assets of £nil. As there was no change in control as a result of this transaction the 
difference between the fair value of the net assets acquired and consideration of £7,685,000 has been recognised directly in retained earnings. 
The income statement and balance sheet for PAH UK Midco Limited is consolidated in full in both the current and prior periods.

The UK corporation tax standard rate for the period was 23% (2013: 24%). The effective tax rate for the period of 26% on underlying profits of 
£52.2m pre non-recurring exceptional items differs from the UK corporation tax rate. The principal reason for this difference relates to the non-
deductibility of depreciation charged on capital expenditure. Included within the non-recurring exceptional items are non-deductible transaction 
costs in relation to the IPO process which result in a total effective tax rate for the period of 40%.

At 27th March 
2014
£000
At 28th March 
2013
£000
Pets At Home Group 952,032 952,032
The recoverable amount of the CGU group has been calculated with reference to its value in use. The key assumptions of this calculation are 
shown below:
Period ended 
27th March 
2014
Period ended 
28th March 
2013
Period on which management approved forecasts are based (years) 3 3
Growth rate applied beyond approved forecast period 3% 3%
Discount rate (pre-tax) 8% 9%
The goodwill is considered to have an indefinite useful life and the recoverable amount is determined based on ‘value-in-use’ calculations. These 
calculations use pre-tax cash flow projections based on a three year business plan approved by the Board. These projections are based on all 
available information and growth rates do not exceed growth rates achieved in prior periods. 
The discount rate was estimated based on past experience and industry average weighted average cost of capital. Management has assumed a 
growth rate projection beyond the three year period based on inflationary increases.
The total recoverable amount in respect of goodwill for the CGU group as assessed by the managers using the above assumptions is greater 
than the carrying amount and therefore no impairment charge has been booked in each period. The managers consider that it is not reasonably 
possible for the assumptions to change so significantly as to eliminate the excess.

Investments are available-for-sale financial assets which represent the fair value of non-equity share capital and loans provided to veterinary 
practice companies trading under the Companion Care and Vets4Pets brands, in which the Group’s share interest is non-participatory. These 
investments are classified as available-for-sale and accounted for as non-derivative financial assets at fair value.
The share capital of the veterinary practice companies is split into either ‘A’ ordinary shares and ‘B’ ordinary shares, or preference shares and 
ordinary shares. Under the terms of the agreements between the veterinary practices and Companion Care (Services) Limited, a subsidiary 
of the Group, the ‘B’ ordinary shares/ordinary shares which are held by Companion Care (Services) Limited are not entitled to any profits or 
dividends, or any surplus on winding up or disposal, although they are entitled to appoint Directors to the Board and carry the same shareholder 
voting rights as ‘A’ ordinary/preference shareholders. Any operational decisions require the agreement of the joint venture partner.
Under the terms of the agreements between the veterinary practices and Vets4Pets Limited, a subsidiary of the Group, the ‘B’ shares which are 
held by Vets4Pets Limited are not entitled to any profits or dividends and on winding up or other return of capital the holders of the ‘B’ shares 
are entitled (in priority to the holders of the ‘A’ shares) to receive £0.001 in respect of each ‘B’ share held but subject thereto, they are not 
entitled to receive any other return of capital which shall be applied for the holders of the ‘A’ shares; they are entitled to appoint ‘B’ Directors to 
the Board and carry the same shareholder voting rights as ‘A’ shareholders.

Included in deferred consideration on acquisition at 28th March 2013 is £2,000,000 due to the vendors of Farm Away Limited. The amount was 
settled in full in the period to 27th March 2014.
Included within the carrying value of senior and subordinated bank loans are issue costs of £5.1m (period to 28th March 2013: £19.0m). The 
Group has an undrawn revolving credit facility of £29.6m (period to 28th March 2013 £27.0m) which expires on 17th March 2019.
All bank borrowings are secured via fixed charges over the head office freehold property, the distribution centre leasehold property, and any plant 
and machinery owned by the Group, and also via a floating charge over the other assets of the Group. The senior bank loans bear interest at 
LIBOR plus a margin, currently varying between 2.00% and 2.25%, with the margin decreasing as the Group’s leverage (defined as total net debt 
to consolidated EBITDA) decreases. The senior bank loans are due for repayment at various dates up to 17th March 2020.
In July 2012 the business repaid the subordinated loan replacing it with a further tranche of the senior loan facility, which significantly reduced 
the interest charge of the Group. The business subsequently received approval from existing senior lenders to draw down a further £135m 
tranche of the senior loan facility. This refinancing was completed in March 2013, with the loan being drawn down on 8th April 2013. 
In March 2014 the business repaid the senior bank loans replacing them with a new senior finance facility, which has significantly reduced the 
interest charge of the Group. The new senior bank facility was drawn down on 17th March 2014. The new senior bank facility is held by the 
Company.

 The closed stores provision relates to the rent and rates payable on sublet or vacant stores. A provision is made where the rent receivable on 
the properties is less than the rent payable, or where management considers there to be a risk on the sublet. The timing of the utilisation of the 
above provisions is variable dependent upon the lease expiry dates of the properties concerned, which vary between 10 to 15 years. Market 
conditions have a significant impact and hence the assumptions on future cash flows are reviewed regularly and revisions to the provision made 
where necessary.
The Company did not hold any provisions at 27th March 2014.

Additional paid in capital
The additional paid in capital represents Preferred Equity Certificates (“PECs”) issued by PAH Lux S.a.r.l and is equal to the nominal value plus

Additional paid in capital continued
The PECs had a nominal value of £1.00 each. In accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’ the PECs were classified as 
equity instruments for the following reasons: (i) The terms of the PECs state that the PEC coupon shall be made, at PAH Lux S.a.r.l’s sole 
option, either in cash, in new PECs or in shares issued by PAH Lux S.a.r.l with a nominal value equal to the PEC coupon; and (ii) the terms 
provide a mandatory redemption clause which required PAH Lux S.a.r.l to redeem the outstanding PECs on the redemption date, this mandatory 
redemption was subject to the provision of a ‘conversion option’ clause, which provided an option for PAH Lux S.a.r.l to pay the PECs in shares of 
the company. 
The PECs accrue a coupon of 8% per annum payable provided that (i) PAH Lux S.a.r.l could make the payment without becoming insolvent or 
bankrupt, (ii) PAH Lux S.a.r.l would not have, or increase, a deficit balance in its retained earnings after making such payments and (iii) the 
payment could be made by PAH Lux S.a.r.l out of funds net of tax resulting from specific income.
In the period prior to the Initial Public Offering, the outstanding PEC certificates attracted accumulated return of £37.6m (2013: £46.0m), 
representing a return per certificate of £0.09 (2013: £0.10).
On 13th April 2013, £130.4m of PEC notes and associated coupon were ultimately exchanged for cash. As part of the Initial Public Offering 
transaction on 17th March 2014, £344.3m of PEC certificates and associated outstanding coupon were exchanged for 140,539,184 shares 
in the Company at a fair value of £2.45 per share. The remaining £175.6m of PEC certificates issued together with the associated outstanding 
coupon were redeemed for cash. 
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising since 21st November 2011, the date of incorporation of Pets At Home 
Asia Limited where the functional currency differs from that of the rest of the Group.

Financial risk management
The Pets At Home Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and 
cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk.
Risk management framework
Risk management is carried out by the Pets At Home Group treasury department under policies approved by the Board. The Board has overall 
responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. The Board provides written principles for overall 
risk management, as well as written policies covering specific areas, such as foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of 
derivative financial instruments and non-derivative financial instruments, and investment of excess liquidity. 
The main objectives of the Pets At Home Group treasury department are:
 To ensure shareholder and management expectations are managed on cash flow and earnings volatility resulting from financial market 
movements;
 To protect the expected cash flow and earnings from interest rate and foreign exchange fluctuations to within parameters acceptable to the 
Board and shareholders;
 To control banking costs and service levels.
Market risk
i) Foreign currency risk 
The Pets At Home Group sources a significant level of purchases in US dollars and monitors its foreign currency requirements through short, 
medium and long-term cash forecasting. The value of purchases in US dollars has increased significantly over the last three years and the risk 
management policy has changed in line with this increased risk. 
At 27th March 2014, the Pets At Home Group’s policy is to hedge between 75% and 90% of the forecasted foreign exchange transactions on a 
rolling 10 to 12 month basis, using foreign currency bank accounts and forward foreign exchange contracts. The transactions are deemed to be 
‘highly probable’ and are based on historical knowledge and forecasted purchase and sales projections. 
The Group’s exposure to foreign currency risk is as follows. This is based on the carrying amount for monetary financial instruments, except for 
derivatives which are based on notional amounts.
The Company does not have exposure to foreign currency risk.

Sensitivity analysis
A 5% weakening of the following currencies against the pound sterling at the period end date in both years would have increased/(decreased) 
profit or loss or equity by the amounts shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been 
applied to risk exposures existing at that date. 
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular other exchange rates and interest rates, remain constant.

A 5% strengthening of the above currencies against the pound sterling in any period would have had the equal but opposite effect on the above 
currencies to the amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
ii) Interest rate risk 
Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Pets At Home Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. As at 27th March 2014 the Group has a drawn down senior facility 
with a face value totalling £325.0m and an undrawn revolving credit facility of £29.6m, which expires on 17th March 2019. The Pets At Home 
Group’s borrowings as at 27th March 2014 incur interest at varying rates between 2.00% and 2.25% plus LIBOR, which exposes the Group to 
cash flow interest rate risk. The analysis of loan repayments is detailed in note 17.
The Pets At Home Group’s policy, with regard to interest rate risk, is to hedge the appropriate level of borrowings by entering into fixed rate 
agreements. The Pets At Home Group has entered into fixed rate interest rate swap agreements over a total of £291.8m of the senior facility 
borrowings at the balance sheet date at a fixed rate of 0.74%, and a further fixed rate interest rate swap was taken out over a total of £25.1m 
at the balance sheet date at a fixed rate of 0.655%. Both swaps expire on 30th March 2016. The hedges are structured to hedge at least 70% 
of the outstanding debt.

All loans bear a variable rate of interest based on LIBOR. Pets At Home Group policy is to hedge at least 70% of the loan to ensure a fixed 
rate. Therefore, designated above is the portion of the loan hedged by a fixed rate interest rate swap and the remaining unhedged portion is 
designated as variable rate.

Sensitivity analysis 
A change of 50 basis points in interest rates at the period end date would have increased/(decreased) equity and profit or loss by the amounts 
shown below. This calculation assumes that the change occurred at the balance sheet date and had been applied to risk exposures existing at 
that date.
This analysis assumes that all other variables, in particular foreign currency rates, remain constant and considers the effect of financial 
instruments with variable interest rates, financial instrument at fair value through profit or loss or available for sale with fixed interest rates and 
the fixed rate element of interest rate swaps. The analysis is performed on the same basis for comparative period.

Credit risk
Financial risk management 
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations, and arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and investment securities.
Credit risk also arises from cash and cash equivalents, derivative financial instruments and deposits with banks and financial institutions. The 
Group ensure that the banks used for the financing of the loan facilities and interest rate swap agreements hold an acceptable risk rating by 
independent parties. 
The Group has in place certain guarantees over the bank loans taken out by a number of veterinary practice companies in which it holds an 
investment. Further details of these guarantees are disclosed in note 26. The performance of the veterinary practice companies is reviewed on 
an ongoing basis.
Exposure to credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk being the carrying amount of financial assets is summarised in the table within the fair values 
section below.
Liquidity risk 
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. 
Management prepares and monitors rolling forecasts of the Group’s cash balances based on expected cash flows to ensure, as far as possible, 
that it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed conditions without risking damage to the 
Group’s reputation. Covenants are monitored on a regular basis to ensure there is no risk or breach which would lead to an ‘Event of Default’ 
and compliance certificates are issued as required to the syndicate agent.

Fair values of financial instruments
Investments in equity securities
The fair value of investments is considered to be their carrying value as the impact of discounting future cash flows has been assessed as not 
material and the investment is non-participatory.
Trade and other payables and receivables
The fair value of these items is considered to be their carrying value as the impact of discounting future cash flows has been assessed as not 
material.
Cash and cash equivalents
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is estimated as its carrying amount where the cash is repayable on demand. Where it is not 
repayable on demand (such as term deposits), then the fair value is estimated at the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the 
market rate of interest at the balance sheet date.

Long-term and short-term borrowings 
The fair value of bank loans and other loans approximates its carrying value as it has an interest rate based on LIBOR.
Short-term deposits
The fair value of short-term deposits is considered to be the carrying value as the balances are held in floating rate accounts where the interest 
rate is reset to market rates.
Derivative financial instruments
The fair value of interest rate swap contracts and forward exchange contracts is calculated by management based on external valuations 
received from the Group’s bankers and is based on forward exchange rates and anticipated future interest yield respectively.

Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital, which is deemed to be total equity plus total debt, are to safeguard the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, through the optimisation of the 
debt and equity balance, and to maintain a strong credit rating and headroom on financial covenants. The Group manages its capital structure 
and makes appropriate decisions in light of the current economic conditions and strategic objectives of the Group.
The Board’s policy is to maintain a strong capital base so as to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future 
development of the business. 
During the period the Group de-levered as part of the Initial Public Offering process, which brought the Group’s leverage into a position 
commensurate with the public market.
The funding requirements of the Group are met by the utilisation of external borrowings together with available cash, as detailed in note 21.
A key objective of the Group’s capital management is to maintain compliance with the covenants set out in the senior loan agreement and to 
maintain comfortable headroom over and above these requirements. 
Management has continued to measure and monitor covenant compliance throughout the period and the Group has complied with the 
requirements set.
22 Share based payments
At 27th March 2014, the Group has four share award plans, all of which are equity settled schemes.
1 The Co-Invest Plan (CIP)
On 25th February 2014 the Company adopted the Co-Invest Plan (CIP). Matching awards under the CIP (as described in section 1(b) below) 
were made on 17th March 2014 to Executive Directors and the Senior Executives by reference to corresponding investment pledges by those 
colleagues. 
These matching awards will vest over a period of three years subject to the satisfaction of performance conditions and once vested as to 
performance, will become exercisable in equal one-third tranches in years three, four and five subject to continued employment with the Group. 
These awards were granted at nil cost.
(a) Eligibility
Only the Executive Directors, the Senior Executives and certain other senior colleagues have been selected to participate in the CIP . 
(b) Type of Awards
Colleagues are invited to participate in the CIP by making an ‘investment’ or ‘pledge’ of their own Shares (the “Co-Invest Shares”), which can 
include existing, locked-in Shares or new Shares acquired with cash, in return for a nil cost-matching award over Shares (the “Matching Award”). 
Matching Awards will be granted by reference to a ratio not exceeding one matched Share for every Co-Invest Share ‘pledged’. Matching Awards 
under the CIP will not form part of a participant’s pensionable earnings and are not transferable other than on death.

(c) Individual Limits
The Executive Directors and the Senior Executives will pledge Co-Invest Shares with a market value equal to 2.5 times their annual salary. 
Other senior colleagues who elect to participate in the CIP will pledge Co-Invest Shares with a market value equal to a limit specified by the 
Remuneration Committee, but not exceeding 1 times their annual salary.
(d) Performance, Vesting and Performance Adjustment
The Matching Awards granted on 17th March 2014 vest subject to the satisfaction of the performance conditions outlined below. To the extent 
that any future awards are granted, different conditions may apply (in the absolute discretion of the Remuneration Committee).
The proposed performance conditions are as follows: 
 75% of the Matching Award will be subject to the CAGR in the Company’s earnings per share (“EPS”) over three financial years, namely 
FY15, FY16 and FY17 (together the “Performance Period”) (which, for the avoidance of doubt, ends on 31st March 2017). If the CAGR 
in the Company’s EPS is 10%, then 10% of the total Matching Award will vest. If the CAGR in the Company’s EPS is 17.5% or more, then 
75% of the total Matching Award will vest. Vesting will be on a straight-line basis between these two points. For the avoidance of doubt, 
if the CAGR in EPS is less than 10% over the Performance Period then the amount of the Matching Award which will vest under this EPS 
performance condition will be nil.
 25% of the total Matching Award will be subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (“TSR”) as compared to the UK General Retail 
Index over the Performance Period. Vesting of 6.25% of the total Matching Award will occur for median performance. Vesting of the 
maximum 25% of the total Matching Award will occur for upper quartile performance or above. Vesting will occur on a straight-line basis 
between these two points. If the Company’s TSR performance over the Performance Period is below median, then the amount of the 
Matching Award which will vest under this TSR performance condition will be nil.
 To the extent vested as to performance, Matching Awards will become exercisable in three equal amounts on the third, fourth and fifth 
anniversary of 17th March 2014, but subject to continued employment with the Group.
2 CSOP
On 25th February 2014 the Company adopted the CSOP . Part I of the CSOP will be tax approved under Schedule 4 to the Income Tax (Earnings 
and Pensions) Act 2003 and provides for the grant of tax approved options. Part II of the CSOP provides for the grant of unapproved options. 
The tax approved options under Part I of the CSOP were granted on 9th April 2014. These options will be exercisable between the third and 
tenth anniversary of the date of grant, subject to continued employment with the Group. These awards will be granted with an exercise price 
equal to the market value of the Shares at the grant date (as agreed with HMRC).
(a) Eligibility
All colleagues, including the Executive Directors and Senior Executives, are eligible to participate in the CSOP , at the discretion of the 
Remuneration Committee.
(b) Grant of Options
No options may be granted more than ten years after the adoption of the CSOP . Options under the CSOP will not form part of a colleague’s 
pensionable earnings.
(c) Vesting and Performance
Colleagues who receive options under the CSOP and under the PSP in connection with Admission will be subject to the same performance 
conditions described in Section 1 (d) above in respect of both grants. colleagues who only receive options under the CSOP in connection with 
Admission will not be subject to performance conditions.
(d) Exercise Price
The price at which an option holder may acquire Shares on the exercise of an option shall be determined by the Board but shall not be less than 
the greater of market value of a Share at the time of grant and its nominal value.

2 CSOP continued
(e) Individual Limits
No option may be granted to an eligible colleague under Part I of the CSOP which would result in the aggregate exercise prices of Shares 
comprised in all outstanding options granted to him/her under Part I, when aggregated with outstanding options held under any other tax 
approved executive share option scheme established by the Company, exceeding the tax approved limit (currently £30,000).
In addition, (both under Part I and II of the CSOP) the aggregate exercise price of Shares comprised in options granted to a colleague under the 
CSOP and the PSP in any financial year shall not exceed 150% of his/her annual salary for that year. 
For the purposes of these limits market value will be calculated by reference to the market value of the Shares on or prior to the relevant date of 
grant as determined by the Board (following consultation with the Remuneration Committee) and subject to HMRC approval if applicable.
(f) Part II
Part II of the CSOP provides for the grant of unapproved options. This enables Options to be granted under the same terms as Part I of the CSOP 
but without complying with the particular requirements of the legislation applicable to tax approved CSOP Schemes. The provisions of the CSOP 
that do not apply under Part II include the £30,000 limit and the need to seek HMRC approval for the scheme and subsequent amendments (as 
applicable).
3 PSP
On 25th February 2014 the Company adopted the PSP . Awards under the PSP were made on 17th March 2014 and will be exercisable between 
the third and tenth anniversary of this date, subject to continued employment with the Group and the satisfaction of performance conditions. 
These awards were granted at nil cost.
(a) Eligibility
Only the Executive Directors, the Senior Executives and certain other senior colleagues have been selected to participate in the PSP .
(b) Grant of Awards
Awards under the PSP will not form part of a colleague’s pensionable earnings. Awards are not transferable (other than on death) without the 
consent of the Remuneration Committee.
(c) Exercise Price
The price at which a colleague may acquire Shares on the exercise or vesting of an award under the PSP shall be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee on the date of grant and may, if the Remuneration Committee determines, be nil or nominal value only.
(d) Scheme Limits
The number of newly issued Shares over which (or in respect of which) awards may be granted under the PSP on any date shall be limited so 
that: (i) the total number of Shares issued and issuable in respect of options or awards granted in any ten year period under the PSP and any 
other discretionary share option scheme of the Company (including the CIP and the CSOP but other than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments) 
is restricted to 5% of the Company’s issued Shares calculated at the relevant time; and (ii) the total number of Shares issued and issuable 
pursuant to options or awards granted in any ten year period under the PSP and any other employee share scheme operated by the Company 
(including the CIP , CSOP , SAYE and SIP but other than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments) is restricted to 10% of the Company’s issued 
Shares calculated at the relevant time.
For the purposes of these limits no account will be taken of options or awards granted before, on or in connection with Admission and no 
account will be taken of options or awards which have lapsed, been surrendered or otherwise become incapable of exercise or vesting. Shares 
held in treasury will be treated as newly issued Shares for the purposes of these limits (as long as this is required by institutional investor 
guidelines), but (for the avoidance of doubt) Shares acquired in the market will not.

(e) Individual Limits
The aggregate market value of Shares comprised in awards granted to a colleague under the PSP and the CSOP in any financial year shall not 
exceed 150% of their annual salary for that year. 
For the purposes of awards granted on (or before) Admission, market value for these purposes will be calculated by reference to the Offer Price. 
For the purposes of awards granted following Admission, market value for these purposes will be calculated by reference to the market value of 
the Shares on the relevant date of grant as determined by the Board (following consultation with the Remuneration Committee) in its absolute 
discretion.
(f) Performance
For awards granted on, or in connection with, Admission, the performance conditions will be the same as for the CIP outlined in Section 1(d) 
above.
4 SAYE
On 25th February 2014 the Company adopted the SAYE (which is expected to be registered with and self-certified with HMRC by 6th July 
2014). The rules of the SAYE are approved under Schedule 3 to the Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003 and provide for the grant 
of tax approved options. It is proposed that invitations under the SAYE will be made as soon as practicable following the announcement of the 
Company’s results post-Admission. It is currently proposed that invitations will be made to eligible colleagues (including the Executive Directors 
and Senior Executives) for the grant of options under the SAYE by the end of the calendar year. All of these options will be exercisable in normal 
circumstances between the third and tenth anniversary of the date of grant. It is anticipated that these options will be granted with an exercise 
price to be agreed with HMRC which will be no less than 80% of the market value of the Shares on the date of issue of the invitations.
(a) Eligibility
All colleagues and full-time directors of the Group, who have been in continuous service for such period of time (not exceeding five years) as may 
be determined by the Board prior to the relevant date of grant of an option and who are liable to UK income tax, will be eligible to participate in 
the SAYE.
Participation may also be offered, at the discretion of the Board (taking account of the recommendations of the Remuneration Committee), 
to other directors or employees who otherwise do not satisfy all of the above criteria, although Non-Executive Directors are not eligible to 
participate in the SAYE.
(b) Issue of Invitations
Invitations to participate in the SAYE may be made during the period of 42 days from (and including) the date of Admission and thereafter 
in each 42 day period from (and including) (i) the date on which any amendment to the SAYE is approved or adopted by the Company’s 
shareholders (ii) the announcement of the Company’s final or interim results for any financial period, (iii) the occurrence of an event which the 
Remuneration Committee considers to be an exceptional event concerning the Group or (iv) changes to the legislation affecting tax approved 
SAYE option schemes coming into effect. If any of the above periods is a ‘close period’ as a result of the application of the Model Code for 
Securities Transactions by Directors of Listed Companies (or as a result of the Company’s equivalent internal share dealing rules) and the 
Company is prohibited from issuing invitations and/or granting options as a result then invitations may be made within 42 days of the end of the 
close period.
Invitations may be issued by the trustee of an employee benefit trust. No invitations may be issued or options granted more than ten years after 
the adoption of the SAYE.
(c) Exercise Price
The price at which an option holder may acquire Shares on the exercise of an option shall be determined by the Board but shall not be less than 
the greater of 80% of the market value of a Share at the time of grant and its nominal value.

22 Share based payments continued
4 SAYE continued
(d) Savings Contract
Options may be granted by the Board or the trustee of an employee benefit trust. Upon applying for an option, the colleague will be required 
to enter into an approved savings contract with a savings institution nominated by the Company which lasts for either three or five years. The 
maximum amount which an employee is permitted to contribute under SAYE contracts is £250 per month (increasing to £500 per month from  
6th April 2014). The Board may set lower savings limits than this for different colleagues by reference to objective criteria such as levels of 
salary or length of service. The minimum contribution is £5 per month (or such greater amount as the Board may specify, not to exceed £10). 
The total exercise price of the Shares over which the option is granted may not exceed the aggregate of the monthly contributions and bonus 
payable at the end of the colleague’s related SAYE contract.
(e) Scheme Limits
The number of newly issued Shares over which (or in respect of which) options may be granted under the SAYE on any date of grant shall be 
limited so that the total number of Shares issued or capable of being issued in any ten year period under all the Company’s employee share 
schemes (including the CIP , CSOP , PSP and SIP but other than to satisfy dividend equivalent payments) is restricted to 10% of the Company’s 
issued Shares calculated at the relevant time. Any options or rights to acquire shares granted before, on or in connection with Admission will be 
excluded from this limit, and no account will be taken of options or awards which have lapsed, been surrendered or otherwise become incapable 
of exercise or vesting.
(f) Exercisability
Options will normally be exercisable during a period of six months following the allocation of a bonus under the related SAYE contract and will 
normally lapse upon cessation of employment. Earlier exercise is, however, permitted if the colleague dies or leaves employment through injury, 
disability, redundancy or retirement or where a colleague leaves employment of the Group by reason of his employing company ceasing to be a 
member of the Group, or if the undertaking in which he is employed is sold outside the Group. Early exercise will also be permitted in the event 
of a takeover, reconstruction or voluntary winding-up of the Company.
Fair value of share awards
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility of a peer group of companies over a relevant period prior to award on 17th March 2014. 
The expected life is the average expected period to exercise, which has been taken as three years. The risk free rate of return is the yield on 
zero-coupon UK government bonds with a life equal to this expected life.
Options were valued using a Black–Scholes option-pricing model for the non-market based (EPS element) performance conditions and a Monte 
Carlo simulation for the market-based (TSR element) performance conditions.
Special provisions allow early exercise in the case of death, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement or because the Company which employs the 
option holder ceases to be part of the Group, or in the event of a change in control, reconstruction or winding-up of the Company.
The key assumptions used in the fair value of the awards were as follows:
At grant date CIP PSP
Share price £2.45 £2.45
Exercise price £0.00 £0.00
Expected volatility 30% 30%
Option life (years) 3 10
Expected dividend yield 2.00% 2.00%
Risk free interest rate 1.07% 1.07%
Weighted average fair value of options granted £2.06 £2.06
As both the CIP and PSP awards have a nil exercise price the risk free rate of return does not have any effect on the estimated fair value and 
therefore is excluded from the above table.

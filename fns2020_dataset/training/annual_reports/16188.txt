Following completion of the merger with 
TUI AG and as stated in the prospectus, 
we understand the Directors of the combined 
group intend to adopt a dividend policy in line 
with TUI Travel’s present progressive dividend 
policy under which dividends grow broadly in 
line with earnings. TUI Travel shareholders 
(including TUI AG) will receive a second interim 
dividend of 20.5 pence per TUI Travel share, 
to include 10.5 pence per TUI Travel share 
in lieu of a final dividend (2013: 9.75p) for 
the financial year 2013/14. At the time of 
our interim results, the Board proposed an 
increase of 8% to 4.05p (2013: 3.75p), leading 
to a full year dividend of 24.55p (2013: 13.5p). 
Provided the performance of the combined 
group develops in line with expectations, 
the combined group will target an increase in 
its dividend per share for the financial years 
2014/15 and 2015/16 of 10% in excess of the 
growth in the underlying earnings per share 
growth for the combined group.

Our sustainability performance has been 
recognised through many achievements this 
year, including joint first place in the FTSE 350 
with a ‘perfect 100’ score for climate change 
reporting and transparency (Carbon Disclosure 
Project). We have made significant progress in 
the final year of our Sustainable Holidays 
Plan – our three-year sustainability strategy 
which aligns with our corporate strategy and 
strategic drivers. Our airlines are Europe’s 
most carbon efficient. In FY14, TUI Travel 
airline's CO
2
 per revenue passenger kilometre 
was 69.9g – an improvement of 10.3% over 
the last six years. We also exceeded our 
goal to deliver 10 million greener and fairer 
holidays over three years, by taking over 
11.5 million customers to hotels with credible 
sustainability certifications.
Sustainability is a priority for our business 
and our industry – we have experienced 
a range of business benefits, including cost 
efficiencies, quality improvements and 
the enhanced engagement of customers, 
colleagues and suppliers. We aim to continue 
to lead the industry by making real changes 
at scale.

‘Making travel experiences special’, the hard 
work, commitment and dedication of our

The TUI Travel and TUI AG merger that 
was agreed by an overwhelming majority 
of shareholders on 28 October 2014 is 
a fantastic result for both businesses. 
The combined group will achieve further 
sustainable growth at a faster rate, 
delivering more value to both shareholders 
and customers. I am very excited about the 
opportunities we have for the future. 
The travel and tourism industry remains 
a growing one. International arrivals increased 
by 5% in 2013 to 1,087 million and are expected 
to increase by 3.3% a year to reach 1.8 billion 
by 2030*. We are therefore well positioned as 
market leader in the leisure sector to take full 
advantage of this growth industry.
Resu l ts
Our strong financial performance is driven 
by our strategy. We know what our customers 
want and we continue to deliver unique 
holiday experiences sold directly to them, 
increasingly online. Our success is testament 
to the continuing commitment to put the 
customer first in everything we do. This year 
we maintained record customer satisfaction

Source Markets. 
Our unique holidays now account for 71% of 
all Mainstream holidays, up three percentage

growth in this key strategic area reflects 
the demand our customers have for our 
unique holidays.

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Chief Executive’s statement
We have continued to deliver on our five 
strategic drivers across the Group. Unique 
holidays now account for an impressive  
71% of our Mainstream sales, the business 
benefits of which include higher average 
selling prices, higher rates of retention and 
earlier bookings. Continuing to build on our 
portfolio of unique products, the UK business 
opened 10 new Thomson Couples resorts, 
nine Thomson Scene, one additional Holiday 
Village and another flagship Sensatori hotel. 
We are targeting a 76% mix of unique content 
by 2017 and we are confident that we will 
achieve this. Online holiday sales stand at 
38% of Mainstream sales. This is up from 
21% in 2007 and we are targeting 50% online 
sales for Mainstream by 2017. 
The TUI Digital Assistant app continues to  
be a huge success; it has now been launched 
in five Source Markets and has been 
downloaded one million times. The app  
allows us to be present at every stage of  
the end-to-end customer journey. We have 
continued to enhance the app over the year, 
and are looking forward to implementing 
some key strategic developments to it over 
the coming months. A key development has 
been the introduction of the search and book 
functionality, allowing users to find and book 
their dream holiday using their mobile device. 
We have continued to take delivery of our 
Boeing 787 Dreamliners, with Arkefly and 
Jetairfly flying their first this year. The aircraft, 
which have received fantastic customer 
feedback, are delivering the targeted 20% 
of fuel savings which, along with substantial 
financial benefits, helps us to achieve our 
sustainability commitment to operate 
Europe’s most fuel efficient airlines. 
Also this year, we have built on the foundations 
of One Mainstream, which allows us to take 
full advantage of our scale and buying power 
and delivers more effective operations across 
the sector. One Aviation is a great example 
of the success of such collaboration, building 
one virtual airline operated from various 
locations, delivering significant reductions 
in overheads and sharing best practice.
We are well positioned to build on our 
record performance next year as part of a 
new combined group. Our Winter 2014/15 
programme is currently 63% sold, with 
the UK sales to date up 4% year-on-year. 
Our Summer 15 programme has seen an 
impressive start to trading in the UK, with 
current bookings up 9% compared to 2014. 
It is clear to me that our colleagues are the 
driving force behind our fantastic results. 
Our people are a key differentiator for 
TUI Travel, they set us apart from our 
competition and I would like to thank them 
for their continued commitment and passion.
Since the formation of TUI Travel in 2007  
we have been on a journey of value creation 
for shareholders. Total shareholder return 
has grown by 138% since that time, a strong 
performance against challenging market 
conditions. Future-proofing our business 
through the merger with TUI AG will enable 
our continued sustainable growth going 
forward. I am looking forward to completing 
the merger with TUI AG (expected on  
17 December 2014) and to beginning the next 
chapter of our journey as a new, stronger, 
combined group in the coming years.

The merger with TUI AG will strengthen and 
future-proof the combined group. It will also 
enhance the certainty of long-term unique 
holiday growth and reinforce our clear 
competitive advantage through further 
control over the end-to-end customer 
experience. This will mark the start of an 
exciting new phase of growth, delivering 
significant opportunities and value to 
customers, employees and shareholders.
Our Mainstream strategy is delivering 
sustainable, profitable growth through our 
focus on unique holidays, direct distribution 
and optimum leveraging of our scale, all 
contributing to the 13% growth in underlying 
operating profit on a constant currency 
basis of the Sector this year.
Accommodation & Destination had another 
good year. The Accommodation Wholesaler 
business was the stand out performer with 
underlying operating profit growth of 21%  
on a constant currency basis. Over the year, 
we sold 27.8 million roomnights across the 
Sector, up 10% on the year before.
Specialist & Activity has seen a more mixed 
performance: tougher trading in Adventure 
and Marine offset by strong results from the 
North American Specialist and Education 
businesses, and weak comparatives in Sport 
led to a performance broadly in line with  
last year.

Why we do it: Market overview
t h e 	 e c on omi c 	 e n v ir on m e n t
The global economic outlook remained steady in 2014 with GDP 
growth projections of 3.3% (2013: 3.3%)
1
. The outlook results from 
mixed geographical performances with the UK, Germany and Spain 
strengthening on 2013, offset by weak growth in the United States, 
as well as ongoing tensions in Russia and the Middle East. Despite 
these downsides, the positive trend is expected to continue into 2015, 
when global growth is expected to rise to 3.8%
1
. 
Within the Eurozone, growth is expected to register at 0.8% in 2014 
and 1.3% in 2015, following two years of decline
1
. Our two main source 
markets, UK and Germany, registered the biggest growth increase 
amongst advanced economies, growing 3.2% and 1.4% respectively
1
. 
Unemployment is slowly decreasing, down to 6.3% in the UK (from 
7.7%) and to 5% from 5.3% in Germany
2
.
t h e 	 l e isu r e 	 tra v e l 	 ma r k et
Arrivals increased again by 5% to 1,087 million in 2013 following the 
record breaking 2012 where international arrivals surpassed the one 
billion mark for the first time
3
. The regional trends remain broadly in 
line with those of last year. Europe, which is responsible for over 50% of 
global arrivals and our main focus both in terms of tour operator market 
and destination growth, and Asia, our focus for online accommodation 
growth, registered the largest increases on last year at 5.4% and 6.2% 
respectively
3
. The Middle East was the only region to suffer a decrease, 
albeit only by 0.2%, a vast improvement on the 5.4% decrease registered 
from 2011 to 2012
3
. Europe is the only region to see a year-on-year 
increase in growth rate with all other regions showing slightly slower 
growth than the previous year. A stronger euro also helped contribute 
to a healthy increase in tourist receipts in the region of $490bn
3
. 
We are operating in an increasingly dynamic environment; this year 
saw the proliferation of peer-to-peer business models, a challenging 
environment for airlines – both scheduled and Low Cost Carriers, and 
the continued growth of online travel agencies. Demand for leisure 
travel remains strong and, as our main markets recover from economic 
stagnation, we are well positioned to maintain our market-leading 
positions and grow further. 
The range and quality of our product is well positioned to serve the 
interests of different customer types. Our dedication to our unique 
holiday strategy in Mainstream, and to product variety and scope 
in online accommodation, coupled with a commitment to digital 
transformation across both models, ensures we continue to cater 
to the changing needs of our customer.
t he 	 s usta i n a bil i t y 	 ch a l le n g e
Travel and tourism is one of the world’s largest industries. The growth 
and employment it creates makes it of critical importance to the global 
economy – contributing 9% of global GDP and 6% of global exports
3
. 
It is responsible for 1 in 11 jobs globally
3
 and is the main source of foreign 
exchange in one-third of developing countries
4
. Travel and tourism also 
accounts for around 5% of global carbon dioxide emissions
4
, half of which 
is attributable to aviation. Recent UN research shows that only 34% 
of countries said that their tourism sector was guided by a ‘sustainable 
tourism’ policy
4
 Therefore the challenge for our industry is to maximise 
the positive social and economic impacts of tourism while minimising 
environmental impacts. 
Supporting local livelihoods and protecting the environment is not only 
the right thing to do, but brings a significant business benefit as well. 
In 2012, we developed our Sustainable Holidays Plan 2012 – 2014, 
which sets out four ambitious goals underpinned by 20 commitments 
in our priority areas – taking care in destinations, reducing carbon 
emissions and engaging our colleagues and customers in sustainability. 
See our Sustainable development section on page 24  
and  www.tuitravel.com for more information.
t h e 	 p oli ti ca l 	 clim at e	
As a global organisation, we feel the impact of government regulation 
in all of the markets in which we operate. Some of our activities, such 
as those undertaken by our airlines, are heavily regulated. Lawmakers 
continue to focus upon how they can balance consumer protection 
with the need to promote growth and protect jobs.
Our political and regulatory affairs team seek to engage with legislators 
at an early stage in relation to all of those areas of regulation which 
may have a material impact upon the way we do business. Our focus is 
always to work with governments to bring forward legislation that is fit 
for purpose, properly balances the interests of industry and consumers 
and treats all industry players fairly.
The last 12 months have seen continuing developments at the European 
level in respect of two major areas of legislative reform: Air Passenger 
Rights and the Package Travel Directive. We have engaged consistently 
with the Commission, the European Parliament and with member states 
as they have considered these reforms and will continue to do so over 
the coming 12 months. 
Aviation taxation also remains on the agenda as governments across the 
world look for ways to increase revenue. Our role is to remind them of 
the importance of the travel and tourism industry as a driver for growth.
In the UK, the debate on airport capacity continues, following publication 
of a report from the Airports Commission in December 2013. We will 
maintain a full role in that debate in order to ensure that the specific 
requirements of leisure airlines and passengers are fully understood.

TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Re Po RT & Accoun Ts 2014
Our principal Mainstream brands operate from the UK, 
Germany, France, Sweden, Belgium, the Netherlands, Austria, 
Poland, Switzerland & Canada. The global travel expenditure 
combined of these 10 markets amounts to £509bn. Our four 
largest source markets of the UK & Ireland, Germany, France  
& Sweden make up over 70% of this spend.*
In the Specialist & Activity Sector we have over 100 brands  
that deal with a variety of customer segments from luxury 
travel to school sports to languages to adventure. This makes  
it very difficult to quantify a defined market size or position, 
though the focus is on attaining leading positions in the 
individual markets and maximising growth opportunities.
The global hotel market, which includes all hotel bookings, 
amounts to €378bn. This is approximately halved to €181bn 
when considering the bookings made through intermediaries 
rather than direct.
Of this €181bn, approximately 20% of inventory booked 
through intermediaries, is sourced through a bedbank, 
amounting to a market size of €35bn for our Accommodation 
Wholesaler business.
The Accommodation only Online Travel Agent (OTA) segment 
amounts to about £36bn; of this, the addressable segment 
(markets in which we operate: UK, Asia Pacific and Brazil) 
amounts to approximately £8.2bn.
Our core markets are projected to grow at a 3% CAGR over the 
next three years. Despite the more challenging environment 
of recent years, we have seen consistent market growth and 
healthy projections for the mainstream holiday market.
The Accommodation only OTA market is projected to grow  
at a CAGR of 5.5% over the next five years while the 
Accommodation Wholesaler market is expected to grow  
at a CAGR of 7.7%.
We remain market leading in almost all source markets in which 
we operate.
In addition, we have market-leading positions in a number of 
specialist segments with a portfolio of unique products, 
unrivalled product knowledge and superb customer experience.
Our Accommodation Wholesaler business (Hotelbeds & 
Bedsonline) remains the clear leader in the Accommodation 
B2B space.
With our Accommodation OTA business we are positioned 
strongly in the UK (LateRooms.com) and are building our 
presence in the Asia Pacific and Latin American market  
through Asia Rooms and Malapronta respectively.
Customers’ research and booking preferences are constantly 
evolving from offline to online, and from desktop to mobile  
and tablet. Our focus is to ensure we have channels that serve 
all our customers’ needs, and that they offer a seamless and 
personalised service.
Unique holiday experiences continue to be popular and attract 
new customers and, with a diverse range of experiences on 
offer, TUI Travel remains well placed.
Online Accommodation only remains one of the fastest-growing 
segments in the leisure travel industry. The proliferation 
of internet use across the world opens up new markets 
and destinations which guarantees steady growth.

How we do it:  
Our key strategic drivers
The next few pages will provide further detail on what our 
strategic drivers mean to our Tour Operator and Online 
Accommodation businesses. This will focus on why they 
are important, how we adhere to them operationally, and 
how we know they are working. Whilst the focus of some of 
our strategic drivers will be considerably different, others 
demonstrate clear similarities, highlighting the underlying  
unity between the two models.

Differentiating 
through 
Dreamliners
This year, our Boeing 787 Dreamliner 
fleet has continued to grow, with both 
JetAirFly and ArkeFly receiving their 
first aircraft. The Dreamliner is a key 
differentiator for TUI Travel, further 
enabling us to provide an outstanding 
experience throughout the customer 
journey, not only in resort. They have 
received consistently high scores in 
customer satisfaction questionnaires.

• The increase in airline capacity, and continued success of 
Low-Cost Carriers, has created a large market of customers 
looking for a range of accommodation options all over 
the world.
• To capture this market, it is imperative that digital content 
is clear, relevant and well presented. 
• Getting this right will ensure customer loyalty and 
repeat customers.
What 	 ar e 	 w e 	 doin g 	 about 	 it ?
• Selling a wide variety of product, in terms of high quality, 
destination and budget. In FY14 we added a further seven 
destinations to our Accommodation Wholesaler portfolio 
and increased our hotel count to nearly 70,000. 
• In FY14 the Accommodation Wholesaler business diversified 
its offering to also sell transfers and activities. With nearly 
20,000 transfers and activities contracted for FY14, it is 
building a solid position in a profitable market place. 
• Over the past year Accommodation Wholesaler TTV has 
grown significantly in the key regions of Asia and Africa 
which has contributed to an impressive divisional TTV 
growth rate of 15% year-on-year.
• FY14 saw a 37% increase in hotel inventory on Malapronta, 
driven by domestic content.

Wh y 	 is 	 it 	 impor tant ?
• By pursuing a unique content strategy we are able to cater 
to the needs of clearly defined customer segments, thereby 
appealing to a wide range of our addressable market.
• The investment in designing and delivering our different 
hotel concepts attracts satisfied and repeat customers; 
validated by higher satisfaction and retention scores 
across source markets.
• The inclusion of value added services and features, 
such as private transfers and swim-up rooms, commands 
a higher margin.
• Our unique content books earlier than commodity  
products enabling us to manage our capacity and yield 
more effectively.
• By offering content which is exclusive to us, we can 
distance ourselves from the competition and limit 
comparisons on meta search engines, e.g. Kayak or Trivago
What 	 ar e 	 w e 	 do in g 	 about 	 it ?
• In Mainstream we are continuously reviewing our existing 
concept portfolio, adapting where appropriate for different 
source markets and opening new destinations.
• In FY14 we opened Sensatori Jamaica, the sixth property  
in the collection with a further three in Ibiza, Turkey  
and Cyprus on sale for Summer 15. Sensatori has seen 
year-on-year pax growth of 40% since it was launched  
in FY09. 
• Unique content has grown from 68% in FY13 to 71%  
in FY14.
• Our Specialist & Activity brand Citalia launched ‘Citalia 
Secrets’, offering pre-departure knowledgeable advice and 
hidden secrets on customer chosen destinations in Italy. Sensatori Resort Aphrodite Hills, Cyprus

Wh y 	 is 	 it 	 impor tant ?
• Unlike our tour operator business, we do not have input 
into the physical content but instead create value with  
our digital content, branding and distribution.
• In our Accommodation Wholesaler business, we have a  
long established reputation to maintain so that we can 
grow both with existing customers and in new geographies. 
Our customers expect an easy-to-use interface, breadth  
of content and reliable service; delivery of this is a critical 
success factor.
• Our Accommodation OTA brands operate in a far more 
crowded market place where having a trusted and 
recognisable brand is vital in driving online traffic. 
Therefore working on our brand to increase awareness  
is the most efficient way to attract new customers.
What 	 ar e 	 w e 	 doin g 	 about 	 it ?
• FY14 saw particular focus on the growth of our agency 
distribution arm Bedsonline. Efforts in Europe and the 
Americas in particular saw agent numbers increase by 
nearly 30%.
• Our Accommodation Wholesaler business partnered with 
easyJet holidays in mid-2014, becoming the operator’s 
accommodation provider. This partnership allows 
distribution of our content to a far wider customer base.
• In our Accommodation OTA business we remain focused on 
building on our strong brand positioning of LateRooms.com 
in the UK and expanding in the emerging markets 
through AsiaRooms.com and MalaPronta.com. This year 
LateRooms.com brand messaging reached over one million 
users across all social media platforms including Google+, 
Instagram, Facebook, Tumblr, Pinterest and Twitter.

Wh y 	 is 	 it 	 impor tant ?
• The benefits from a direct distribution strategy are 
two-fold: it enables us to form a direct relationship with the 
customer, and thereby understand more about what they 
are looking for, and also drives down our distribution costs.
• Customers increasingly expect a standardised service 
and offering across different devices and therefore 
we need to ensure we are ahead of the curve with our 
digital developments.
• In a densely populated industry, the robustness of our 
brand names and the financial security and quality they 
promise are very important. 
• Recognisable brands are particularly important in 
an online world, helping to direct organic traffic and 
improving conversion.
What 	 ar e 	 w e 	 do in g 	 about 	 it ?
• In our capacity as an end-to-end operator we consider 
‘online’ as the whole journey from inspiration, to booking, 
to the holiday itself, as well as returning and sharing 
experiences through social media. 
• We recognise the changing role of the travel agency which 
remains an important part of the booking process for  
many of our customers. Our new concept stores, which 
incorporate digital elements and inspiration, have seen 
increased traffic and improved customer interaction  
and this year our Thomson stores beat cross industry 
competition to win the Digital Store of the Year award.
• These efforts have seen our direct share of bookings 
increase from 66% in FY13 to 68% in FY14.
• Thomson Sport, the sports-fan focused arm of Specialist  
& Activity, recently signed a partnership with Manchester 
City to be the club’s official supplier of supporter travel, 
and another brand, Gullivers, signed a similar six-year deal 
with the Welsh Rugby Union.

TUI Digital Assistant now Live in Five 
This year has seen the international roll-out of the TUI Digital Assistant (TDA). 
Capitalising on the scale of our business, the app, which was first developed for 
the UK as ‘My Thomson’, has been translated for five of our key source markets. 
With a total of over one million downloads to date – 120,000 in the month  
of July 2014 alone – the Digital Assistant is a ‘one stop shop’ for everything 
customers need. Available for Android and iOS devices, it includes everything 
from inspiration, research, booking, flight information and luggage allowance 
details, to maps to help customers plan the best route to the airports. 
The TDA has a number of exciting new innovations planned in 2015.  19

Wh y 	 is 	 it 	 impor tant ?
• The complexity of our product (multiple components) 
and distribution pattern (e.g. a six-month lag between 
purchase and consumption) requires us to have robust 
and inter-linking systems to ensure a seamless customer 
service and reliable management information.
• Innovation in technology means we can develop new ways 
to inspire our customers and make their booking process  
as user-friendly as possible.
• Enables us to offer our customers the best possible value 
by having an efficient technology infrastructure and 
therefore driving maximum savings and efficiencies.
What 	 ar e 	 w e 	 do in g 	 about 	 it ?
• This year Thomson launched a system called Connect, 
linking the digital, retail and call centre businesses. Connect 
allows customer information to be shared across booking 
platforms, meaning online or call-centre bookings can be 
followed up in shops. The system will make customer data 
available from the point of booking onwards, allowing 
frontline staff to offer a more personalised service.
• In FY14 we launched Holiday Open Day, an online tool 
which allows the customer to virtually explore and  
select different options which our concepts offer and 
consequently suggest the most suitable product for  
their next holiday.
• We rolled out the TDA in other markets (from Sweden to 
Austria) whilst simultaneously updating its functionality. 
The app had been downloaded one million times with more 
updates in the pipeline.
• Our Specialist business also launched a range of successful 
apps, most notably: Crystal Ski Explorer complemented  
by live Facebook, live chat and mobile optimised sites to 
support their multi-channel distribution strategy.

Wh y 	 is 	 it 	 impor tant ?
• Similarly to our tour operator business, the main areas 
where technology can benefit our business are through 
enhanced user experience at the front end and the 
rationalisation of systems and platforms at the back end.
• As our OTAs interact directly with the customer, user 
experience is of utmost importance as customers have 
come to expect an intuitive and fast interface that delivers 
relevant results.
• Having efficient technology platforms allows us to 
drive cost savings and therefore provides further value 
to our customers.
What 	 ar e 	 w e 	 doin g 	 about 	 it ?
• Accommodation Wholesaler’s in-house platform is one  
of the most robust and flexible in the industry, allowing  
for quick connectivity with hotel suppliers as well as our 
customer base of travel agencies, tour operators and OTAs.
• FY14 saw the launch of the dedicated XML link for the 
transfer and activity bank which we expect to gain further 
traction next year.
• In our Accommodation OTA business, we are continuing to 
invest in a new platform to support our growth strategy: 
the Brazilian OTA Malapronta started offering payments  
by instalments in FY14 – an option which is very popular in 
that market, accounting for over 42% of online purchases.
• Following the success last year of the LateRooms app, apps 
were launched for AsiaRooms and Malapronta in early FY14 
and have generated over 600k downloads to date across 
the three brands.

Scale Leads to Success 
In December 2013, TUI Travel announced its ‘One Mainstream’ strategy. 
The purpose of One Mainstream is to generate further growth, innovation 
and  cost efficiencies for the Group. Leveraging our scale, we have been able 
to develop new functional groups, such as Mainstream Product & Purchasing, 
and Distribution & Online. One Mainstream has also involved building business 
clusters from existing source markets, for example, TUI Benelux – formed of 
TUI Belgium, Netherlands and Luxembourg, where operational efficiencies have 
been implemented through joint aviation operations to Mombasa and Zanzibar 
for Summer 14 and Florida for Winter 14. 
Our five charter airlines are also changing – One Aviation, another part of 
One Mainstream, is building a virtual airline. This means that we will act ‘as one’ 
wherever it makes sense to do so, maintaining local differences where the benefit 
of that differentiation is greater than that of harmonisation – one team does 
not mean one location. 21

• We are the largest integrated leisure travel company in the

our leading positions.
• Enables us to drive economies of scale, further synergies

What 	 ar e 	 w e 	 do in g 	 about 	 it ?
• We further deployed the Dreamliner aircraft across our 
Mainstream business, giving our customers a superior  
flight experience and allowing us to offer new long-haul 
destinations and more capacity to existing ones. Our 
Benelux airlines Arkefly and Jetairfly were the latest to 
offer flights on the Dreamliner in August.
• The Mainstream functions are working closer together  
with central structures in place for distribution, aviation, 
product and purchasing and digital. This allows the 
different markets to collaborate on initiatives and learn 
best practice from each other.
• Our Specialist & Activity brand, TCS Expeditions, the  
world leader in private jet travel, added a new first-class 
dedicated Boeing 757 custom-configured cabin with  
52 flat-bed seats to its fleet. The plane was designed  
in collaboration with Four Seasons Hotels & Resorts  
as part of the ongoing strategic partnership.
• For the second consecutive year in FY14 we delivered on 
our growth roadmap of 7-10% EBITA growth (at constant 
currency) as set out at the beginning of the year.

• Online driven businesses need to compete with global

• In a price-driven, lower-margin business, it is imperative  
for us to achieve high volumes which can be leveraged  
to gain competitive advantage.
What 	 ar e 	 w e 	 doin g 	 about 	 it ?
• Hotelbeds and Bedsonline are clear market leaders in the 
B2B space with operations in over 100 countries. We are 
continuing to follow our strategy of consolidating our 
market-leading position by expanding in destination and 
source markets. 
• Within the Accommodation OTA division we cover three 
attractive markets:
> LateRooms.com has maintained its position as  
number two against fierce competition in the UK 
accommodation-only OTA market. Our focus is on 
profitable growth through product quality and  
multi-channel optimisation.
> AsiaRooms.com is now an established and growing  
brand in the Asia-Pacific region, focused on seven key 
APAC countries and intra-Asia corridors.
> MalaPronta.com continues to establish itself in  
South America, a fast-growing and lucrative market.
• Accommodation OTA can benefit from access 
to the merchant stock available through 
Accommodation Wholesaler.
• Accommodation Wholesaler saw a further 26% growth  
in the number of XML links between their inventory  
and tour operators/travel agencies’ booking systems.

build networks, understand the breadth of the organisation 
and learn about key industry trends.
• Our International Graduate Leadership Programme and

How we do it: Sustainable development
S t R A te G i c 	 R e P O R t
We want our holidays to benefit local people and to protect 
the environment. It is important to us not just because it is 
the right thing to do, but because our products – memorable 
and unique holidays – rely on beautiful and welcoming 
tourist destinations. Managing our impact means we can 
maintain the quality, viability and desirability of our holidays 
for years to come. Our vision is to make travel experiences 
special whilst minimising environmental impact, respecting 
culture and people and bringing economic benefits 
to communities. 
Our commitment to Responsible Leadership (see our values on page 
25) extends beyond our Group. In FY14 we were pleased that our 
performance was recognised as follows:
• For the seventh consecutive year TUI Travel was featured in the 
Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) and was ranked joint 
first in the FTSE 350 for our approach to carbon disclosure and 
governance. TUI Travel was the only company in the travel and 
leisure sector to feature in the 2014 CDLI.  www.cdproject.net
• TUI Travel was recognised by Carbon Clear for its approach to 
carbon reporting, ranking the Company 4th in the FTSE 100 in  
its annual survey.  www.carbon-clear.com/uk 
• We continue to be listed on the FTSE4Good Index in recognition  
of meeting strict social, environmental and governance standards. 
• We were a finalist in the business category of the World Travel  
& Tourism Council’s 2014 Tourism for Tomorrow awards. 
For further details on awards and our latest Sustainable Holidays 
Report, see  www.tuitravelplc.com/sustainability.
Go v e r na n c e
Commitment at the most senior level is vital for us to achieve our 
goal of leading the leisure travel sector in sustainable development. 
Johan Lundgren, Deputy Chief Executive, is responsible for reporting on 
sustainable development to the TUI Travel Board and Jacky Simmonds, 
Group HR Director, is responsible for reporting on sustainable 
development to the Group Management Board. Jane Ashton is the 
Director of Group Sustainable Development. The Group Management 
Board acts as the Steering Committee, setting the strategic direction 
and long-term objectives for sustainable development across TUI Travel.
The Group Sustainable Development Department’s role is to drive 
change towards a more sustainable business and continue to lead 
the industry. The Department works closely with other Group 
departments and a network of sustainable development coordinators 
in each key source market/Sector who have a remit to develop and 
implement sustainable development strategy, supported by a network 
of champions. 
We work with Forum for the Future, a global sustainable development 
NGO which selects a handful of companies as ‘Pioneer’ partners, 
defined as leading organisations at the cutting edge of sustainability. 
TUI Travel has been selected as one of these partners.
R isk 	 ma na g e m e n t
Policy and mitigation for Group-wide risks relating to sustainability  
are facilitated by the Group Risk Management and Sustainable 
Development Departments, with responsibility for managing such  
risks also shared by the businesses themselves. Increasing legislative 
and societal demands on a company like ours requires that we act 
responsibly and identify and manage our risks effectively. 
Key areas of risk identified are:
• Legislative and societal demands in relation to size and management 
of TUI Travel’s carbon footprint.
• Ensuring that the actions of our colleagues uphold TUI Travel’s 
sustainable development policy.
• Ensuring that the actions of our suppliers uphold TUI Travel’s 
environmental and social supplier standards.
• Putting measures in place to enable us to gain a better 
understanding of the socio-economic impacts of tourism.
• Ensuring we are aware of potential damage to, and the quality of, 
destinations due to ecosystem degradation and climate change.
• Being aware of customer expectation in respect of sustainability.
For further information about sustainability risks and how we manage 
them see our latest Sustainable Holidays Report. We have also identified 
sustainability risks within the Principal risks section, see page 42

Our three-year Sustainable Holidays Plan was launched in 2012 and marks our journey towards 
a more sustainable future. It shows significant integration of environmental and social principles 
in the way we do business – including performance measures, processes and the customer 
proposition. It sets out four ambitious goals underpinned by 20 commitments in our priority 
areas – taking care in destinations; reducing carbon emissions; and engaging with colleagues and 
customers in sustainability. Our Sustainable Holidays Plan aligns with our corporate strategy. 
For further details on our  
Sustainable Holidays Plan including  
our 20 commitments, see  
 www.tuitravelplc.com/sustainability
Our Sustainable Holidays Report 2014  
is due out in Spring 2015.

We will measure this by the number of 
customers we take to hotels with credible 
sustainability certifications from 2012 
to 2014, e.g. sustainability certifications 
by working with the Global Sustainable 
Tourism Council (such as Travelife) and 
international environmental management 
standards such as ISO 14001 and EMAS. 
We are proud of the positive role our industry plays around 
the world. The travel and tourism sector accounts for 9% 
of the world’s GDP and 6% of its exports (UNWTO, 2014). 
It is responsible for one in 11 jobs globally (UNWTO, 2014) 
and is the main source of foreign exchange in one-third of 
developing countries (UNEP , 2014). 
However, we know that travel and tourism can also have unintended 
negative consequences and are committed to understanding and 
enhancing the socio-economic impacts of our holidays. There are 
also significant environmental challenges: for example, water will be 
a key challenge for our industry in the coming decades, particularly 
in island states. Our challenge is to maximise the positive social and 
economic impacts of tourism in all our destinations and to minimise 
environmental impacts.
We are committed to influencing more hotels to achieve credible 
sustainability certifications which provides us with assurance that 
our suppliers are making continual sustainability improvements. This 
not only improves our sustainability performance but also benefits 
our suppliers.
Our most sustainably-managed hotels deliver higher quality and 
customer satisfaction. Analysis of over 1.4 million customer satisfaction 
questionnaires within TUI UK & Ireland in 2012 and 2013 showed that 
hotels with Travelife sustainability awards scored higher on overall 
satisfaction. From this, we can conclude that our customers experience 
a link between sustainability and quality. 
Good sustainability management – and good environmental management 
in particular – can have a significant effect on a hotel’s operating costs. 
For example, depending on the region, energy costs can account for 
between 5% and 15% of a hotel’s operating costs (blueContec, 2012). 
So encouraging hotel suppliers to use energy more efficiently, and also 
to use renewable energy wherever feasible, helps them save on one 
of their biggest costs as well as helping destinations prepare for a low 
carbon future. 
In many destinations, TUI Travel accounts for a significant percentage 
of tourist arrivals. That means we contribute, directly or indirectly, 
to many of the jobs, tourism-related businesses and tax revenues in 
destination countries.
We are conscious of the pressures that tourism can place on local 
populations and resources and therefore work collaboratively with 
communities, governments and a range of other partners to support 
sustainable management of destinations. Examples include: The Global 
Sustainable Tourism Council, The Dutch Association of Travel Agents  
& Tour Operators, Deutscher ReiseVerband, GIZ, Association of British 
Travel Agents and The Travel Foundation.

• Our majority shareholder, TUI AG, signed up to the UN Global 
Compact in September 2014, committing the Group to 10 universally 
accepted principles in the areas of human rights, labour, environment 
and anti-corruption.
• Our employee Code of Conduct commits us to respecting and 
observing human rights.
• Our Supplier Code of Conduct sets out the minimum standards we 
expect from suppliers and their employees, contractors, agents and 
subsidiaries when working on our behalf. The code covers human 
rights and labour laws, support for local communities, environmental 
impacts as well as bribery and corruption. 
• Our internal policies, practices and guidelines also cover anti-
discrimination, grievance and whistleblowing procedures (see 
page 71), health & safety (see page 51), sustainability, anti-bribery & 
corruption, fraud (see page 71), conflicts of interest, data protection 
and security, various sanctions and third party due diligence.
• TUI Travel joined Transparency International UK’s Business Integrity 
Forum in 2014.
• We have been named a Top Member of the Code of Conduct for the 
Protection of Children from Sexual Exploitation in Travel & Tourism 
in 2014 and our businesses support child protection projects 
and campaigns.
• The majority of our businesses have incorporated environmental and 
social minimum standards into contracts for accommodation suppliers.
• Our goal is to deliver 10 million ‘greener and fairer’ holidays and to 
encourage our hotel suppliers to implement credible sustainability 
certifications. Travelife is the system of choice for the majority of 
our businesses and we helped them to develop new, stricter criteria, 
including human rights (incorporating the principles of the Ethical 
Trading Base Code), which were launched in 2014.
We continue to work with stakeholders to understand and respond  
to human rights issues better.

• Sportsworld achieved ISO 20121 for sustainable event management.
• TUI Nederland won the ‘Overall winner’ award and the ‘Best for child 
protection’ award at the 2013 World Responsible Tourism Awards.
We are involved in hundreds of projects that support communities 
and reduce environmental impacts. Where we can, we focus on those 
destinations where we send the most customers and where we believe 
we can make the greatest difference. In FY14 this included Brazil, 
Cape Verde, Jamaica, Spain, Thailand, Tunisia and Turkey.

We are trialling a big picture approach to measuring and understanding 
the impact of tourism. In partnership with the Travel Foundation, and 
using a methodology developed by PwC, we aim to value the various 
economic, fiscal, social and environmental impacts of tourism in Cyprus.
PwC’s ‘Total Impact Measurement & Management’ (TIMM) framework 
will be applied to our Mainstream Sector tourism operations, focusing 
on a selection of hotels in Cyprus. This is the first time the methodology 
has been applied to tourism. Cyprus was chosen for this project as it is 
a Mainstream destination and an important destination for TUI Travel. 
The pilot is expected to provide new insights into the impacts, both 
positive and negative, of Mainstream tourism on a holiday destination 
and to highlight the practical implications of undertaking holistic impact 
measurement more widely in the industry and/or in other destinations.
All the impacts will be measured and valued, so that they can be 
considered alongside the more traditional financial measures used 
for strategic business decisions. The impact of transport to/from the 
hotels, hotel operations, the entire tourism supply chain within Cyprus 
and customer and employee spending impacts will all be within scope, 
covering aspects of tourism such as: working conditions, social/
community benefits, local economic benefits and tax contributions.  
We expect to publish our learnings from the pilot in early 2015.

Human rights are basic rights that allow individuals the freedom to lead 
a dignified life, free from fear or want, and free to express independent 
beliefs. TUI Travel is committed to the protection of human rights in 
compliance with applicable laws, conventions and regulations throughout 
our worldwide operations. 
We acknowledge the UN Guiding Principles on Business and Human 
Rights and have many policies and initiatives in place to identify, prevent, 
mitigate and account for how we are addressing key human rights issues 
and challenges.

We are committed to reducing carbon emissions which is 
a key challenge for TUI Travel and the rest of the industry. 
We want to prepare for a low-carbon future by reducing 
our environmental impact and encouraging our suppliers 
and customers to do the same. Travel and tourism accounts 
for around 5% of global carbon emissions (UNEP , 2014) – 
half of which is attributable to aviation. 
Carbon management is a critical part of our business practices, 
protecting the environment and saving us money now and into the 
future. Across TUI Travel, improved management of energy, natural 
resources and fuel across our operations has saved a total of £28 million 
in 2012 and 2013*.
We take this challenge seriously – the carbon efficiency of our airlines is 
one of TUI Travel’s key performance indicators as a business. Our carbon 
management strategy covers not only aviation but also hotels, major 
premises, retail shops, water transport and ground transport emissions.
Our customers trust us to make their holiday experiences special. 
Predictable weather, personal comfort and beautiful destinations 
are part of the product we sell – and all of these are threatened by 
climate change. 
We expect that national governments and international organisations 
will take decisive action on climate change, including putting in place 
fair and effective regulation around carbon. We have identified climate 
change-related regulation as a material issue for the Company (see 
page 50), and monitor upcoming regulation that could have a financial 
or reputational impact on the Group. 
In 2014, TUI Travel airlines’ total carbon emissions were 5,014,068 
tonnes, a reduction of 1.7% compared to 2013. Emissions from aviation 
make up over 88% of our Company’s carbon footprint.
We operate Europe’s most fuel-efficient airlines, investing in cutting-
edge aviation technology and playing an active role in advocating 
smarter carbon legislation.

Responsible Leadership is one of our core values and 
commits us to making a positive impact on society, 
celebrating local differences and contributing to a 
better world. Our colleagues need to be enthusiastic 
and knowledgeable about TUI Travel’s sustainability 
commitments and the role they play in delivering them.
Today’s employees are not only motivated by money and status but 
also by the knowledge that their employer’s values align with their own. 
The evidence shows that employees who are engaged in sustainability 
– who are encouraged to share their experiences with others – are 
happier and more productive at work. Values matter even more to the 
leaders of the future; 80% of 13-25 year olds want to work for a company 
that cares about its impact on society (Forbes, 2014).
We want our colleagues across the world to understand, and bring to 
life, the TUI Travel values and know that they can take action in their 
day-to-day lives. Responsible Leadership is increasingly embedded  
into how we measure behaviour and performance across the Group. 
We communicate regularly about the issues, successes and challenges of 
sustainable tourism to our colleagues. Across the Group, sustainability 
information can be found in recruitment materials, intranets, newsletters, 
inductions, blogs by senior managers, short films and e-learning modules.

• Sustainability awareness – raising initiatives were implemented 
across the Group, such as TUI Nordic’s sustainability training video  
for holiday advisers and Specialist Holidays Group’s sustainability 
week with a different theme for each day.
• Our colleagues united to protect holiday destinations by taking part  
in the Travel Foundation’s Big Holiday Beach Clean for ’Make Holidays 
Greener’ month in July. Over 700 people took part, cleaning 30 plus 
beaches and collecting 400 bags of rubbish (over 35,000 pieces).
• We have set up networks of sustainability champions, made up of 
people who know how to inspire change in their business area. For 
example, TUI Nordic has a network of ISO-coordinators who helped 
to implement ISO 14001, TUI Deutschland has Environmental 
Ambassadors who meet regularly, TUI Nederland has sustainability 
champions in each product department and TUI UK & Ireland has 
champion networks in place in retail, head office and overseas.
• Training programmes were rolled out across retail such as a 
sustainability module within TUI UK & Ireland’s new online induction. 
• Community volunteering programmes are one of the ways we engage 
our people in sustainability, enabling them to see projects in action 
and develop their own skills. Many of our businesses allow colleagues 
one day per year to volunteer for a charity in their local area. For 
example, 80 colleagues from Bedsonline Asia and Hotelbeds in South 
East Asia travelled to San Remigio, in the Philippines, to help rebuild  
a school devastated by Typhoon Haiyan. 
• TUI Travel was shortlisted for a 2014 HR Excellence Award for 
embedding the Sustainable Holidays Plan throughout our Company.

TUI Travel’s vision is to make travel experiences special. 
Customers are at the heart of everything we do, and 
that means we must involve them in order to become 
a more sustainable business and help drive a more 
sustainable industry.
Our customers are critical to delivering some of our most important 
sustainability goals. We need to make sure that clear links are made 
between sustainability and the holiday experiences they value, and 
encourage them to take action in a way which is engaging and memorable. 
We have found a positive correlation between more sustainable holidays 
and customer satisfaction.
According to the research we undertook in 2012, which covered  
3,000 people in several of TUI Travel’s key source markets, modern 
mainstream consumers are more engaged with sustainability compared 
to traditional mainstream consumers: 
• One in two would be willing to book a more sustainable holiday  
if available
• One in two want their holiday company to be clear about what  
they do to make their holidays more sustainable
• They are more interested in social and community issues than 
traditional mainstream consumers
• The sustainability aspects that interest them most in the destination 
are: fair working conditions; learning about the country and the 
people; and changing their behaviour to help the environment.
Sustainability is not a primary driver of consumer preference for 
mainstream holidays – customers are more interested in price, quality, 
food, service and unique destinations. The good news is that these are 
exactly the aspects of our holidays that sustainability helps to support. 
Minimising waste in energy and resources helps us deliver value for 
money. Hotels that treat their people and the local environment with 
consideration are developing a quality product with friendly staff. And 
beautiful, unique destinations rely on the tourism industry committing 
to protect them.

• We are encouraging holidaymakers to engage in sustainable tourism 
through our kids’ club activities, school education initiatives, 
customer donation schemes and sustainable tourism campaigns. 
• Since 2011, over one million UK school children have participated  
in the Eco-traveller programme which teaches them how to make  
a difference on holiday. 
• Over £1.4 million raised through the World Care Fund customer 
donation scheme. The funds are channelled into projects that  
help address the environmental impact of tourism, and support 
communities around the world.
• Fritidsresor, our brand in Sweden, was ranked the most sustainable 
travel company in Sweden in the 2014 Sustainable Brand Index and 
by the Differ survey.
• Across the Group our businesses are working to reduce brochures 
and to use digital platforms throughout the customer journey.  
The TUI Digital Assistant app has now been rolled out in Austria, 
Germany, the Nordics, Switzerland and the UK and has been 
downloaded over one million times.
• Our Mainstream businesses in Germany and Austria have partnered 
with myclimate to offset the carbon emissions from all customer 
rental cars from April 2013. To date, over 26,000 tonnes of CO

 has 
been offset via projects in Turkey and China.

How we do it: Our people
S t R A te G i c 	 R e P O R t
e n ga gi n g 	 a n d 	 i n v o l v i n g 	 o u r 	 c o l l e a gu es
Although TUI Travel is made up of a diverse and unique range of 
brands and businesses, they share many similarities due to a shared 
vision and common values. 
Nurturing these values is key to our strategy. Following the first TUI 
Travel Group-wide global opinion survey that took place in September 
2012, we identified three key areas to strengthen the engagement of 
our colleagues:
• Pride: Colleagues told us that they were looking for a better 
opportunity to identify with TUI Travel as a great place to work 
• Trust: We aim to build trust right across our organisation by giving 
people more opportunities to get involved and delivering more 
targeted and transparent communications
• Opportunity: Our colleagues asked us for better accessibility to 
opportunities that would enable them to grow and develop within 
TUI Travel. Colleagues wanted to develop a career within the 
Company rather than viewing their role as just another ‘job’
Over the past year we have continued to address these key areas 
through a number of Group-wide initiatives, detailed below.
P ride 	 – 	 the 	 intr oduc ti on 	 of 	 an 	 emplo y er 	 brand
People told us that TUI Travel was such a great place to work, they felt 
we should use the strength of our scale and size when trying to attract 
and retain people within the organisation. We also wanted to find a 
way to express what binds us today in a common and shared colleague 
experience no matter where you work in TUI Travel. To capture this, 
we have introduced an employer brand that describes, in a clear way, 
the experience you will have working for the Group. It is centred 
around the three key pillars described on the following page.

• Winning Together: we are passionate about our work; we inspire  
and respect each other 
• Freedom to Shine: our global businesses are fast moving, dynamic 
and rich in development opportunities 
• Pushing Boundaries: we never stop looking ahead, seeking new  
ways to delight our customers and grow our business. We embrace 
technology, innovate and adapt at speed, staying true to our values.
Since being developed, these pillars have been used in a number of 
recruitment campaigns across the Group, and have provided a global 
identity for employees across the world for the first time.

We’ve given over 300 of our colleagues the opportunity to get directly 
involved in the work to transform our business.
Many more colleagues are indirectly involved through focus groups, 
surveys and interviews, giving a broad representation of people a 
chance to have their say in making our business more innovative, 
future-proof and effective. 
With this ongoing dialogue at all levels, we are building trust and 
bringing the Company closer together. Beyond this, we understand 
trust as the experience of our colleagues in their daily work with their 
leaders and co-workers. We have put a great deal of emphasis on the 
ongoing, clear communication of our strategy and achievements as a 
Company, and will continue to invest in the development of our leaders 
at all levels. 
Oppor tunit y 	 – 	 global 	 j obs 	 and 	 learnin g 	 oppor tunities
In July 2014, we launched an internal careers portal to increase internal 
visibility of job vacancies across parts of TUI Travel for the first time. 
The portal is currently being developed further to give colleagues 
access to an even wider range of opportunities across the globe.
We have also launched a Global Learning Management System which 
will give colleagues worldwide access to state of the art learning once  
it is fully implemented. 
The portal encourages colleagues to take responsibility for their own 
development and is multi-lingual, accessible via the internet (enabling 
learning anytime, anywhere, via laptop, iPad or smartphone), and 
assists collaboration by supporting the transfer of best practice across 
the Group. The Learning Management system has been developed to 
facilitate a variety of different learning needs: personal and leadership 
development, compliance/mandatory training and functional skills  
and knowledge. As well as being embedded in the Finance Academy 
with over 2,000 people actively using it, the Academy has now been 
embedded across our UK Retail and destination teams. 
In January TUI Germany implemented Magellan, a software 
programme allowing employees to be trained on a variety of topics 
including automated contract generation, employer’s reference creation 
and feedback sessions. More capability will be progressively added to the 
software to cater for all areas of the business.
We are very interested in finding out how these initiatives have worked 
to shift perceptions across the Group and will capture this during the 
Your Voice opinion survey in 2015.

Our Digital Transformation journey began in 2013, and has become  
a key feature of our strategy to become a truly consistent, effortless 
and engaging team.
As part of One Mainstream’s digital transformation, our vision is to 
create a single environment that is available to our global colleague 
base – anytime, anywhere, any way. This includes providing instant 
access to customer data, communications, colleague data, social 
interaction and working practices and improving collaboration and 
efficiency in how we work and increasing the awareness in expertise 
and knowledge sharing. In doing so, we will empower our colleagues  
to become brand ambassadors and encourage them to fully engage 
with our customers and their colleagues.
In our Mainstream and Specialist & Activity Sectors, we have been 
piloting schemes allowing our reps in resorts to support customers 
through iPads. This ensures colleagues can engage with customers 
over social media prior to and during their holidays, and thereby 
further improving customer service levels. We have had great feedback 
following these pilots and are looking into rolling it out across more  
of the business. 
Real time communication and collaboration amongst colleagues has 
been facilitated this year by installing an instant messaging tool  
(Lync) for teams based in the UK & Ireland and France. This is both  
an efficient and informative tool and allows people to make contact 
quickly, easily and simply.
i n v esti n g 	 i n 	 o u r 	 l e a d e rs
At TUI Travel, we know that we need talent and strong leadership, 
facilitated by development opportunities, in order to deliver our strategy 
and cement the business’s future. Some of the key programmes to 
support these opportunities are as follows: 
For high-potential senior leaders, there is our G l ob al 	 h ig h 	 P e r for m an c e	
Le a d e r sh ip programme which focuses on their development whilst 
equipping indviduals to support our commercial business growth 
and strategy. Sponsored by the Deputy Chief Executive and MD of 
One Mainstream, Johan Lundgren, the programme aims to enhance 
strategic thinking and leadership skills, creating the foundation for 
more active collaboration across the Group. 
The programme is run by the prestigious IMD business school in 
Switzerland, where participants solve real strategic business priorities 
in a learning environment which results in tangible improvement plans. 
We also have a development portfolio for colleagues in the earlier 
stages of their career who have been identified as high potential and/
or successors to commercial senior leadership roles in the future.
P e r spe c tiv es , sponsored by Joan Vilà, MD Accommodation & 
Destinations Sector, takes ‘Rising Stars’ on a journey to widen their 
understanding of the Group strategy and our expectations of future 
leaders. The programme helps drive the mobility of talent across the 
Group, supporting our culture of global leadership.
h o r iz o ns , sponsored by David Burling, MD UK&I Mainstream, focuses 
on high-potential senior leaders who have been identified as successors 
to more senior roles. The programme takes participants through 
a business-led initiative to identify ways we can meet our business 
challenges whilst also developing their personal leadership styles at 
all levels.
To support all managerial development, we have introduced two new 
leadership programmes: 
Leadership 	e ssentials 	– focuses predominantly on self and people 
leadership, how we expect leaders to behave in TUI Travel. It is designed 
for those who have just commenced their leadership journey to embed 
the behaviours which encourage and bring out the best in people. 
Lea d e rsh ip 	 e v o l u ti o n – an advanced programme focusing on people 
and business leadership. This is for more experienced managers, 
enabling them to explore the evolution of themselves as a leader  
and the organisation in the face of a rapidly-changing environment.
In addition to these Group-wide development initiatives, we also offer 
bespoke internal and external mentoring and coaching.
Through the People Performance management process in Germany,  
70 leaders had the opportunity to attend a development centre to 
build on their leadership potential, where they receive feedback  
from external consultants on their progress. By creating a learning 
environment where people can demonstrate high performance, we are 
able to identify potential, and in turn give them more responsibility.
In Germany we offer selected colleagues an opportunity to take on 
project-based work with a global perspective over a two-year period. 
Employees can take on the role of a People or Operational Leader, 
where they cover topics such as working in an international organisation, 
digital transformation, dealing with ambiguity, building resilience and 
change management. Part of the selection process to determine if people 
are ready to attend the two-year programme is successful completion 
of a one-day Development Centre, aligned to the requirements of the 
international Group development programmes (Perspectives and 
Horizons). All participants in this talent pool have the opportunity 
to apply for these international Group development programmes.

Learning conferences have also been established as an instrument for 
the development of talent and management. This initiative was started 
by TUI Germany and is now a Group-wide measure in Mainstream 
Germany, where colleagues share experiences and understanding. 
The event covers strategic topics that underpin our business success 
and the satisfaction of our employees. 
There has also been a series of seminars run for our leaders. An example 
of one of these seminars, ‘Conflict management in change’, was devised 
to ensure we are prepared for upcoming change processes as well as 
dealing with resistance to change. Around 100 leaders have participated 
so far.

The International Graduate Leadership Programme continues to 
attract, develop and retain high-quality graduates who are earmarked 
to become our future senior Commercial Leaders.
To reflect the increasing globalisation of our business, we focus on 
attracting graduates with an international mindset and a professional 
approach seen as suitable for our fast-paced, ever-changing 
environment. There are two small intakes annually, another eight 
graduates joined our team in September 2014 from France, India, 
Spain, Croatia, Germany, Romania, the Netherlands and Belgium. 
There is a mentoring programme in place on the Scheme which provides 
support throughout the 18-month duration, and senior leaders commit 
to meeting and helping graduates with specific assignments. Speaking 
a minimum of two languages including English, our graduates are 
provided with significant international commercial business exposure 
across the Group with the aim for them to become emerging leaders 
within four years.
Since 2010, 41 graduates have joined the business. They complete four 
business placements, a five-week overseas placement, attend four 
one-week training blocks and participate in a Group project to look  
at a business challenge. Over 80% of these graduates are still in the 
business. We have been recognised in Germany by the online career 
platform for students, graduates and young professionals, ’Absolventa’ 
– who have commended us for having a career-enhancing and fair 
International Graduate leadership programme. Also, in TheJobCrowd 
top Companies for Graduates to work for, we have been placed 19th, 
12 places higher than our 2013 ranking, with some excellent feedback 
being given by our graduates.
In TUI Germany we deliver an intern programme which forms part  
of ‘Adelante’, an initiative started by the Chamber of Industry and 
Commerce in Hanover to take action against the unemployment of 
young people in Spain. In April 2014 two young Spaniards began their 
three-month internship and from September they will commence a 
year-long internship.
In August and September 2014, 172 young people began their first 
professional job through TUI Germany’s retail, airline and TBS divisions. 
Over the next three years they will have on-the-job training with the 
aim of becoming merchants in tourism (travel agents), merchants in 
dialogue marketing, office clerks and aircraft mechanics. In addition 
to their practical training, TUI Germany will also provide academic 
vocational schooling, aiming to give young people the best possible 
start in their careers.
In June 2014, we launched a series of workshops for colleagues across 
TUI Germany, TUIfly, TUI Business Service, TUI 4U, TUI Service, 
TUI Aqtiv, TUI AG, Robinson Club and TLT Service. These workshops 
have been designed in an interactive and innovative way to discuss 
exciting, current and forward-looking strategic issues. The people in 
attendance found it extremely useful to debate current issues as 
well as network across multiple companies and learn more about the 
culture at TUI Travel. The events took place in different locations and 
were sponsored by senior leaders. They will continue throughout the 
next financial year. 
In the UK & Ireland we have a leading employer apprenticeship 
programme. We continue to partner with the Skills Funding Agency 
and City & Guilds to deliver vocational training through our in-house 
accredited programmes department. We deliver over 400 qualifications 
every year including apprenticeships, NVQs and Institute of Leadership 
& Management Certificate and Diploma programmes. The programmes 
recognise and support all aspects of our business and provide 
qualifications ranging from Customer Service to Chefs and Sales to 
Airline Operations. The UK&I team has supported the delivery of these 
programmes in the Specialist & Activity Sector of the JCA business 
and Specialist Holiday Group (SHG) finance. The expertise of the team 
has supported both of these areas to attract, retain and develop 
talented candidates.
To support succession planning programmes, we have launched the 
Institute of Leadership Management Qualifications Level 2 and 3 and 
currently have 82 colleagues on the programme. These programmes 
are designed to support and develop talented Sales Advisers and 
Assistant Managers, who undertake assignments and are offered 
opportunities for secondment, which in turn aids the Group with 
succession planning.
We also have a placement scheme, with eight students joining the 
2013/14 programme and another seven starting in 2014/15. The 
placement students work in different areas of the business including 
Product, Early Trading, Late Trading, Cruise Trading, E-commerce  
and Purchasing. There is also a School Leaver Scheme, which takes 
students that have finished their ‘A-Levels’ and, rather than going to 
University, join TUI Travel. This is a two-year programme where they 
work in the same areas as the placement students and eventually will 
aim to take on the same formal roles. This programme is in its third 
year now and is working well. We are working with City & Guilds to 
develop a specific qualification that can be awarded to those who 
complete the programme. 36 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

How we do it: Our people
continued
In our Specialist & Activity Sector great progress has been made to 
develop a formal graduate sales programme. This has been designed 
to improve the sales capability within this sector, building on the agility 
of the Specialist & Activity sales model, which can move talent across 
portfolios as required, whilst ensuring future managers are given 
development opportunities early on. 
The Navigator programme is one which is specially designed for 
colleagues who have been identified as young talent within Specialist 
& Activity, and forms part of the Sector’s succession planning. It has 
now been rolled out to European-based colleagues within the Specialist 
& Activity Sector, with plans to deliver this to colleagues based in the 
US, in the future.
Gl ob a l 	 m ob i li t y 	 a n d 	 c olla b orati on
In December 2013 we announced the transformation of our Mainstream 
Sector into One Mainstream. This was a turning point for opportunities 
in collaborative working practices, encouraging a global best practice 
model as well as global mobility, and driving a big picture mindset.
An example of this collaboration can be seen in our Digital Transformation 
model, where we have created centres of excellence (hubs) in which 
digital solutions are developed once and deployed to all Source 
Markets. The success of the TUI Digital Assistant app pays testament 
to what can be developed within these multi-locational, collaborative 
hubs, and it has now been rolled out into five Source Markets.
Two initiatives have been developed with the specific aim of building 
the global mobility of our colleagues across the Group, and furthering 
their career development. 
The first is a new global resourcing function, focusing on senior 
leadership and internal talent pools. This helps to drive international 
moves and internal promotion across the business, which forms part  
of our HR strategy, whilst the second is the development of ‘talent 
panels’, to monitor talented indviduals so the business has an easy  
way to input into talent discussions. 
A 	 t e a m 	 o f 	 i n d i v i d ua ls 	 – 	 str e n g th 	 i n 	 d i v e rs i ty
We have a global workforce with a wide range of different cultures  
and backgrounds, which gives depth and breadth of experience and 
understanding – a team of diverse individuals, all of whom contribute 
to our market leadership. 
Illustrating this diverse workforce, 57 of our 210 senior leaders  
based across 24 countries are female. Across our total workforce, 
approximately 61% of all employees and 30% of managers are female.
We are clear that we do not tolerate discrimination under any 
circumstances and our ethos is that opportunities should be equally 
available to everyone. We have principles and guidelines in place to 
ensure this is maintained at every level throughout our Company.
‘Spotlight’ is a new programme which allows us to identify and  
target specific groups who are under-represented in the Group.

When it comes to making travel experiences special, we recognise that 
it is the dedication of our colleagues that makes the difference and we 
strive to make sure they feel valued.
Recognising the importance of good retirement planning, we continue 
to offer pension arrangements across the Group reflective of local 
legislative requirements, as well as the economic position of our 
business and local market practice. 
In the UK there continue to be significant changes to pension legislation 
following the implementation of pension auto-enrolment in 2013. 
We are working closely with our partners to ensure that we can adapt 
to facilitate these changes as they take effect.
The health and wellbeing of our colleagues is paramount and we have 
built upon the work started by TUI UK & Ireland and TUI Germany by 
providing wellbeing programmes and initiatives for our employees.

 TUI Travel has just embarked on a fantastic new opportunity to shape the development of the UK 
tourism industry. Along with 21 other leaders in the industry such as easyJet, Expedia and VisitBritain, 
it has joined a partnership with the Government. Together they will become the new Tourism Industry 
Council, using their expertise to develop skills and share best practices whilst enabling the tourism 
industry to innovate and grow. This is the first time that such a partnership has been set up and 
further cements our role as a business leader within the UK. Peter Long commented:
‘ The importance of outbound tourism in the UK can be overlooked at times but it is a significant 
part of the industry. We alone take over five million Britons on holiday every year directly 
employing some 20,000 people in the UK. I’m therefore delighted to be part of the Council and I 
look forward to playing my part in the development of our industry now and in the years to come.’
 The partnership follows a recent government drive to increase the availability of apprenticeships 
within the country. It is also, significantly, the first time that there has been a cross-government 
council including both the Tourism Minister and the Minister for Skills and Enterprise.

Our unique holidays form the backbone of our Mainstream businesses 
and are exclusive to us. Unique holidays provide value added services and 
features which command a margin premium over commodity products. 
This in turn leads to higher customer loyalty and an increase in repeat 
bookings. Unique holidays also book earlier enabling us to manage our 
capacity and yield more effectively and it is very difficult for our 
competitors to replicate these concepts.

Our direct distribution channels are central to the Group’s strategy. By 
increasing the direct distribution of our holidays we lower distribution 
costs, reduce the reliance on third party distributors and can build on our 
customer relationships. As an online-driven business, we have a focus on 
the online customer experience. During the year, we continued to see the 
benefits of the investments we have been making in our online platforms. 
We are moving to one core online platform across Mainstream.

TT27 | AR 2014 | XX/08/2014 | Design
In the year, we increased the unique holidays mix by three percentage points across the 
Mainstream Sector as a whole to 71% with improvements in all key source markets.
Customer satisfaction for the UK, Nordic region and Germany combined remained at the 
record levels achieved in 2013, with continued strong performances by our unique brands.
To measure our progress, we have two distribution KPIs: (i) direct distribution mix;  
and (ii) online distribution mix.
Direct distribution mix increased to 68% driven by all major source markets. 
The improvement in direct distribution was driven by the online channel which has 
increased by three percentage points in 2013 to 38%. Within this, the UK improved 
by four percentage points to 51%, the Nordic region improved by three percentage 
points to 70% and Germany improved by three percentage points to 11%.
The overall Mainstream overhead remained below 5% in 2014. The One Mainstream 
programme is continuing to deliver significant benefits and operational efficiencies across 
our source markets.
During 2014, the Specialist & Activity Sector saw a mixed performance from its various 
businesses, delivering a broadly flat result on a constant currency basis. We saw an 
improved result from our North American Education and North American Specialist 
businesses. Sport benefited from weak year-on-year comparatives as well as the Ashes 
and 2014 FIFA World Cup tournament. However, these results were offset by soft trading 
in the Adventure and Marine businesses.

One of our key strategic objectives is to continue to improve the Group’s 
profitability and free cash flow and therefore deliver superior returns 
on investment. This improvement will allow us to invest further in the 
future of our business which will benefit our customers, colleagues 
and shareholders.
We are experiencing greater stakeholder interest in sustainability  
and believe that creating more sustainable holidays will help protect  
our product into the future and also support product differentiation,  
brand loyalty, customer satisfaction and competitive advantage.

BUSINESS AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
 
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
 
SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
TT27 | AR 2014 | XX/08/2014 | Design
ROIC performance was strong, but slightly lower than 2013 due to the impact of foreign 
exchange translation and an expected increase in the underlying effective tax rate, driven 
by a change in the geographic mix of profit.
We generated a cash conversion rate of 85% in 2014, significantly in excess of our target 
of 70% of profit before tax. 
We delivered £12m of operational efficiency savings through the business improvement 
programme in the last 12 months. The programme is now largely complete.
Our airlines’ per passenger carbon emissions reduced year on year, from 70.7g CO
2
/RPK in 
2013 to 69.9g CO
2
/RPK in 2014, a 10.3% reduction against our 2008 baseline year. This was 
achieved through investment in new fuel-efficient aircraft, operational efficiencies, fuel 
conservation activities and capacity amends.
We had another strong performance in Accommodation Wholesaler in 2014, with 21% 
growth in underlying operating profit at constant currency rates. TTV grew by 15% from 
£1.655bn to £1.899bn in 2014, with 16% growth in roomnights. Top-line growth was driven 
primarily by continued expansion in Asia and Latin America.
Traffic and roomnights decreased by 6% and 11% respectively in the year, driven by  
a planned reduction in unprofitable marketing spend in AsiaRooms and pressure on 
conversion rates as customers increasingly switch to mobile devices. We expect this  
trend to reverse as we continue to improve our mobile capability.

What are the risks? Principal risks
R isk 	 Go v e r na n c e
• Successful management of existing and emerging risk is critical 
to the long-term success of our business and a key area of 
management focus.
• We continue to strengthen our risk governance framework which 
enables us to identify and understand more fully the threats and 
opportunities in the market place, to match these against the 
strengths and weaknesses of our Group and to respond accordingly. 
Our risk management process, and the risk software supporting it, 
helps to drive clarity, consistency, transparency and accountability 
at every level of the organisation. It enables us to understand and 
manage our risk exposures (both individually and in aggregate) across 
the Group so that, at any given time, we are incurring the right level 
and the right type of risk to pursue effectively our strategic goals.
• We recognise that good risk governance exists when an organisation 
is intuitively sensitive to changes in its risk landscape and its risk 
profile and is quick to flex either its strategic objective and/or its risk 
strategy, as necessary to drive long-term value. We also recognise 
that this capability requires active commitment at the top, a strong 
independent risk function, clear, consistent risk methodology 
and language, good information flows and a culture of open and 
honest communication.
• Our risk governance framework, which is aligned to and embedded 
within our business planning cycle, is set out below and summarises 
the various risk-related roles, responsibilities and relationships 
operating throughout the Group.
S tra t e gi c 	 R isk 	 Go v e r na n c e
Risk s 	 of 	 the 	 Strateg y: 	 (Dir ec ti on )
The Board determines the strategic direction of the business and agrees 
the nature and extent of the risk it is willing to take to achieve its 
strategic objectives. 
However, effective risk management is dependent on the capability 
and commitment of our people. The n o minati o n 	 c o m mi t t e e ensures 
that an appropriate balance of skills, knowledge and experience exists 
in the Boardroom to understand and manage the risk environment at  
a strategic level, providing a culture whereby risks and assumptions  
are challenged and debated rigorously. 
To ensure that the strategic direction chosen by the business represents 
the best of the strategic options open to it, the Board is supported by 
the Gr oup 	 Strateg y 	 func ti on. This function exists to facilitate and 
inform the Board’s assessment of the risk landscape and development 
of potential strategies by which it can drive long-term shareholder 
value. On an annual basis the Group Strategy function develops an 
in-depth fact base, in a consistent format which outlines the market 
attractiveness, competitive position and financial performance by 
Sector and source market. These are presented to the Board by the 
Executive Directors and time set aside in April, July and September to 
allow full consideration and debate as to the level and type of risk that 
the Board finds appropriate in the pursuit of enhanced shareholder 
value. Through this process, the strategic options and the trade-offs 
between risk and reward are debated upfront and through ongoing 
review and refinement are pulled progressively into the close weave of 
strategic intent that best fits the business, its culture, capabilities and 
resource. The strategy, once fully defined, considered and approved 
by the Board, is then incorporated into the Group’s five-year roadmap 
and helps to communicate the risk appetite and expectations of the 
organisation both internally and externally.
Risk s 	 to 	 the 	 Strateg y: 	 ( e x ecuti on )
Having determined the appropriate level of risk for the business, in 
relation to the potential for reward, the Board ensures that risks to 
the delivery of the strategic objectives are identified, assessed and 
managed effectively. 
While the Nomination Committee ensures an optimum balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience required within the executive management 
team to deliver the strategy, the R e m u n e rati o n 	 c o m mi t t e e ensures 
the right reward system to drive an appropriate culture of high 
performance with commensurate control. Business performance relating 
to the achievement of strategic, operational and financial objectives is 
reviewed and monitored closely at B usin ess 	 R e v i e w 	 Me etin gs chaired 
by the Chief Executive.
The A u di t 	 c o m mi tt e e , on behalf of the Board, seeks assurance that the 
risk management and internal control system is operating effectively 
throughout the organisation and that risks to the delivery of the 
strategy and long-term viability of the business are being managed 
effectively such that the risk profile is well within the risk capacity of 
the organisation and appropriately aligned with the risk appetite set 
by the Board. The Audit Committee receives this assurance from three 
lines of defence: 
Management: The Audit Committee receives presentations from 
management on a routine basis to understand the key risks facing 
their businesses and how these are being addressed.
Group Functions: The Audit Committee receives updates from the 
Gr oup 	 Risk 	 Mana gement 	c ommit tee (GRMC) and Gr o u p 	 R isk	
fu nc ti o n on activities relating to risk management as well as updates 
from the Gr oup 	 func ti ons 	 (includin g 	 their 	 r elevant 	c ompliance	
fu nc ti o ns ) on activities relating to the establishment of control 
standards and adherence to them. 
Internal Audit: The Audit Committee receives assurance from Internal 
Audit over the processes, Principal risks and business transformation 
initiatives most critical to the Group’s continued success.
O p e ra ti o na l 	 R isk 	 Go v e r na n c e
Whilst ultimate responsibility for risk management rests with the Board, 
effective day-to-day management of risk sits within the business. 
Management is responsible for setting the right tone at the top and 
establishing a culture where employees are expected to be risk aware, 
control minded and to ‘do the right thing’.
The GRMC is a Committee of the Group Management Board (GMB).  
It is chaired by the Chief Executive and comprises the full membership 
of the GMB supported by key members of the risk and control 
community. The GRMC has two key responsibilities: 
• to ensure that an effective risk management process is operating 
throughout the organisation; and
• to be involved actively in identifying, assessing and managing those 
risks most significant to the long-term value of the organisation. 
To discharge the first of these responsibilities the GRMC selects key 
business areas and Group functions for scrutiny and invites the MDs 
and their Risk Champions (individuals chosen by the MDs to champion 
the process in their respective business areas) to discuss how risk is 
managed (risk process) and the risks identified ‘bottom up’ as a result 
(risk content). It also receives regular presentations from the Director 
of Group Audit Services on the ongoing level of engagement and 
effectiveness of each Sector/Source Market in relation to the risk 
management process, specific areas of strength and weakness by 
individual business area and an analysis of the ‘bottom up’ risks 
reported, along with any developing themes. t OP ic S	P Re Se nte D	An D	De BA te D

Risk Governance Framework
The majority of GRMC time however is reserved for the identification, 
assessment and management of Principal risks to the Group strategy. 
Individual members of the GRMC are accountable for specific Principal 
risks and for the quality of Risk & Control Summaries which set out the 
key controls on which reliance is placed and the further actions that 
are required, as necessary, to achieve targeted risk level. These risks, 
controls and targets are reviewed and approved at the GRMC and then 
communicated ‘top down’ to the wider business to ensure that risks 
are managed within these levels through the organisation. The GRMC 
also recognises the natural cycle of risk exposure, the interaction of 
individual risks and the extent to which individual risks may be offset 
through natural hedging or amplified through specific risk combinations.
F e e d b ack 	 t o 	 th e 	 B o a r d
The Director of Group Audit Services provides an update to the Audit 
Committee and the Board on how risk is being managed across the 
organisation (risk process) and the Executive Directors provide an 
update to the Board twice a year on the key risks under consideration 
(risk content). This feedback is reviewed and debated by the Board to 
ensure management has understood the risks and that mitigation fits 
within its overall risk appetite. Where there is misalignment between 
the risk profile and the risk appetite (i.e. management are taking too 
much or too little risk relative to the strategic objectives) the Board 
seeks to ensure that appropriate corrective action is being taken. 
During the year the Board reviewed the completeness of the Principal 
risks, debated risk appetite and management’s alignment with it and 
raised issues relating to the transparency and consistency of ‘bottom 
up’ risks reported. 
A d d i ti o na l 	 c o m m i tt e es 	 o f 	 th e 	 G M B
The following committees form part of the overall risk 
governance framework:
The Capability Committee supports the risk governance process by 
assessing the Group’s current capability and competence against its 
future needs in the achievement of its strategic objectives. 
The Investment Committee ensures that risk and reward is closely 
scrutinised prior to any acquisitions, capital expenditure and 
major investments. 
The Projects Committee oversees cross-Group projects and ensures 
that interdependencies and risks (both upside and downside) are 
understood fully and guidance provided, as appropriate.
R isk 	 Ma na g e m e n t 	 P r o c ess
The Group Risk function supports the risk management process by 
providing guidance, support and challenge to management whilst acting 
as the central point for co-ordinating, monitoring and reporting on risk 
across the Group.
The Group Risk function applies a consistent risk methodology across 
all key areas of the business. This is underpinned by risk and control 
software which reinforces clarity of language, visibility of risks, controls 
and actions and accountability of ownership. Although the process 
of risk identification, assessment and response is continuous it is 
consolidated, reported and reviewed by senior management on a 
quarterly basis. 
This is considered by the GRMC alongside the Group’s Principal risks. 
New risks are added to the Group Risk Profile if deemed to be of 
a significant nature so that the ongoing status and the progression 
of key action plans can be managed in line with the Group’s targets 
and expectations. U n D e R S t A n D 	 MAR K e t

& s ca Le c o Ntext Geo-political events continue to highlight the inherent risks within 
travel and tourism, whilst the ongoing banking sector recovery and 
the introduction of Basel III have the potential to impact long-term

In addition a significant proportion of operating expenses are in 
relation to aircraft fuel which is also subject to fluctuation.
risk We do not manage adequately the volatility of exchange rates and 
fuel prices or other rising input costs; we face an increase in tax 
authorities taking a more strident tax approach in order to fund 
local fiscal deficits; and difficulties in securing additional facilities,  
if needed, and at a reasonable cost.
Po te Ntia L im Pa ct We suffer increased costs which reduce demand resulting in lower

Health & Safety
Incident rates across the business are collated and reviewed to ensure 
any trends are identified and actions are taken to resolve issues.
Compliance with the appropriate national and/or state law remains a 
priority amongst all businesses regardless of location. Much of the H&S 
law within Europe stems from the same source, although it has been 
interpreted slightly differently by national governments, and therefore 
there is much commonality in the procedures being included in safety 
management systems.
c ust o me r 	 sa fet y
Each Sector continues to have responsibility for ensuring the H&S of 
their customers. This is achieved by having sound H&S practices and 
robust safety management systems embedded within each business. 
The Mainstream Sector continues to move forward with the ‘One 
Mainstream’ concept and, through the One Mainstream H&S Working 
Group, has established the foundations for closer co-operation, greater 
consistency, common policies, systems and processes across all 
Mainstream source markets. The H&S Working Group meets regularly 
and is made up of colleagues from every source market with H&S 
responsibilities together with the Head of GHSCD. 
Each Mainstream source market continues to maintain its own dedicated 
H&S team of people, each of whom has specific H&S duties. 
Some developments which took place in Mainstream H&S during 2014 
are detailed below:
• the creation of a UK & Ireland Mainstream Overseas H&S 
Management Board to provide a greater degree of governance  
and oversight of UK&I specific H&S management;
• the expansion of the TUI France H&S team which has allowed a full 
review of all the Club Marmara properties and the development of 
TUI France’s Safety Management System; and
• the application of H&S resource within TUI Germany specifically 
dedicated to the identification and eradication of swimming pool 
entrapment issues.
The Specialist & Activity Sector continues to operate a dedicated H&S 
function based in the UK and overseas, working with all SAS divisions to 
establish and maintain Safety Management Systems under the guidance 
of GHSCD. Each SAS business is ‘Risk Profiled’ which facilitates the 
provision of H&S responses tailored to divisional and business unit risks. 
Suppliers of accommodation, transport and excursions/activities are 
assessed using both physical inspections and self-assessments generated 
from the ‘Sure2Care’ in-house, web-based due-diligence system which 
now hosts in excess of 37,000 completed H&S assessments.
Within the Accommodation & Destination Sector (A&D) the responsibility 
for H&S is at the divisional level. 
Hotelbeds continues to deploy Sure2Care – managed from the central 
Palma-based headquarters with each region responsible for delivery 
against specific Sure2Care targets. The Hotelbeds’ Steering Committee 
meets regularly to agree responses to any H&S related issues which 
are identified.
Within A&D, Intercruises continues to deploy and develop its safety 
management system and is increasingly utilising Sure2Care for supplier 
assessments as part of its contract with Mainstream for the provision 
of activity/excursion and transport services.
The Strategic report was approved by a duly authorised Committee of 
the Board of Directors on 3 December 2014 and signed on its behalf by:

Chief Executive

The health and safety (H&S) of customers and employees remains  
a key focus for the Group. 
The Group businesses liaise and cooperate with each other to ensure 
that best practice is followed and their decisions are underpinned by the 
TUI Travel PLC H&S Policy Statement, signed by the Chief Executive, 
Peter Long. Primary responsibility for the management of H&S remains 
with the individual businesses within the Group but assistance is available 
from the Group H&S Compliance Department. Further assurance that 
sound H&S management systems are being implemented is provided 
by Group Audit Services.
The Group airlines continue to work together to comply with and improve 
their safety management systems. In each Group airline there are clearly 
identified and accountable senior managers who are responsible 
for safety in the key areas of flight operations, training and ground 
operations/engineering. There is also a risk-based safety management 
system (which engages the whole airline at all levels in safety 
management). The operations of the airlines are regulated by the 
European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) and by the applicable 
national aviation body (e.g. in the United Kingdom, the Civil Aviation 
Authority). The National Aviation Authorities regularly inspect and 
audit each airline’s safety management system.
2013/2014 saw the first full year’s operation of the Group H&S 
Compliance Department (GHSCD) and good progress has been 
made with regard to:
• monitoring H&S management systems across the Group;
• collating relevant data and establishing mechanisms for regular 
reporting against established Key Performance Indicators (KPIs)  
and Key Risk Indicators (KRIs);
• documenting and communicating to all businesses minimum 
Group H&S management system requirements and associated 
H&S standards; 
• providing training in H&S incident reporting and risk assessments; 
• providing guidance, advice and support to operating businesses; and
• investigating fatalities, serious incidents and near misses.
Group-wide incident thresholds have been established and all 
non-natural-cause fatalities and all Yellow, Orange and Red incidents 
are automatically investigated. Trigger points have been set for each 
incident level colour band which, if reached, will result in a full review 
of H&S management processes.
e mp lo y e e 	 sa fet y
Our employees face hazards that are both common and unique to their 
particular business on a world-wide basis. Effective identification and 
control is achieved through a robust risk assessment procedure. Risk 
assessment is a key element of the safety management systems being 
developed by our businesses. 
GHSCD is now working in collaboration with dedicated employee H&S 
resource within a number of geographical locations – including Spain, 
France, Germany, the Nordics and North America. Elements of mature 
safety management systems are shared, where appropriate, amongst 
those businesses when developing their own systems. In this way 
practical procedures are put in place to assist and benefit the business, 
promoting a positive safety culture whilst allowing a consistent 
Group-wide approach.
The Group H&S induction programme ‘Safety in Your Workplace’, which 
provides a baseline of H&S knowledge for all employees, is currently 
being revised and updated. The induction programme continues to be 
a key element of the Group’s commitment to good H&S practice. 52 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Group revenue decreased by 3% from the prior year to £14,619m 
(2013: £15,051m). This result was driven by adverse foreign currency 
translation impact. The main drivers of the year-on-year improvement

The improvement in underlying operating profit was driven by strong 
performances in the UK, Germany and Netherlands, as well as a halving 
of French tour operator losses. These positive results were partly offset 
by weakness in the Nordics trading in the first half of the year, and by 
the performances of Russia and Ukraine.

Acquisitions were made in the year for a total investment value of 
£31m. The main acquisition made during the year, on 20 December 
2013, was a further 41% of the voting equity shares of Le Passage to 
India Tours and Travels Private Limited (‘LPTI’), a tour operator and 
destination management company incorporated in India. The Group 
previously owned 50% of LPTI and accounted for this as a joint 
venture. The total consideration for this step acquisition was £20m, 
including £10m of non-cash consideration for the Group’s share of 
LPTI that it previously owned.
n et 	 fi na n ci a l 	 e x p e nses
Net financial expenses have increased by £9m to £137m. The increase 
was primarily due to a number of one-off items totalling £19m, 
the largest of which were the acceleration of the amortisation of 
the old revolving credit facility and the impact of revaluation of a 
put option for an investment in a tour operator in Germany. These 
one-off charges were partially offset by a £10m reduction in interest 
due to the conversion of the £350m convertible bond at the end of 
the financial year.

• £10m in France from the ongoing restructure of both the tour 
operator and the airline.
• Restructuring charge of £4m in the Accommodation & Destinations 
Sector and £4m in Marine. 
• £67m pension credit primarily relating to two pension transactions 
which completed in the UK.

Given the ongoing challenging trading environment for tour operators 
located in the Russian and Ukrainian source markets, an impairment  
of £28m was booked against loans to our joint venture entity. This 
non-underlying item is included within ‘Impairment of financial assets’. 
Further information is included within Note 8.
t axati on
The underlying effective rate of taxation for the year ended 
30 September 2014 is calculated based on the underlying profit before 
tax (excluding separately disclosed items, acquisition related expenses 
and impairment charges) and equates to 31% (2013: 27%). The increase 
in the underlying effective tax rate is due to the effect of the geographical 
mix of profits. 
The actual tax rate of 46% differs from the underlying effective tax rate 
primarily due to the write off of certain deferred tax assets totalling 
£26m where there is no longer sufficient certainty of the timing any 
benefits that might arise in the future.
During the year, the Group paid £3m of UK cash corporation tax  
and a further £122m of cash corporate taxes in other jurisdictions.

Underlying basic earnings per share was 29.1p (2013 restated: 30.1p). 
Higher underlying operating profits at constant currency rates were 
offset by the impact of foreign exchange translation, an increased 
interest charge and the higher underlying effective tax rate. Statutory 
basic earnings per share increased to 16.4p (2013 restated: 4.6p), 
reflecting lower separately disclosed items in the year.
D i v ide n ds
On 13 May 2014 the Board recommended an interim dividend of  
4.05p per share (2013: 3.75p), which was paid on 3 October 2014.
On 15 September 2014, as part of the Rule 2.7 announcement, the 
Directors announced that the Company will, immediately prior to 
completion of the merger with TUI AG, declare and pay a second 
interim dividend of 20.5p per share, which includes a 10.5p dividend 
per share in lieu of a final dividend for the financial year ended 
30 September 2014. This second interim dividend will be payable to 
those shareholders on the register of members of the Company at  
the Scheme Record Time and will be paid prior to completion of the 
merger conditional on the Court Order having been granted at the 
Scheme Court Hearing.

Further information is included in Note 27. The £350m convertible 
bond saw 99.6% conversion into TUI Travel shares on maturity in 
October 2014. The number of shares issued as a result of the conversion

Our growth levers 
Creating shareholder value
We are very pleased with our performance this year against our clearly 
defined strategic growth levers. These drive improved profitability 
and free cash flow and, therefore, strong returns on investment. 
This improvement will allow us to invest further in the future of our 
business which will benefit our customers, colleagues and shareholders.
1 . 	 D e l i v e r i n g 	 Ma i nstr e a m 	 gr o w th
Our Mainstream business reported a record performance over the year, 
with underlying operating profits growing by 13% to £581m on a 
constant currency basis. 
We continue to leverage fully the strength of expertise across the Sector 
and the scale of the Group through our ‘One Mainstream’ initiative. 
This continues to evolve, delivering greater benefits as one business 
across the strategic drivers of unique holidays, direct distribution and 
operational efficiency.
1 . 1 	 Unique 	 holida ys 	 only 	 a va ilable 	 fr om 	t Ui	t ra v el
Unique holidays
Our unique holidays form the backbone of our Mainstream businesses 
and are exclusive to us. Unique holidays provide value added services 
and features which command a margin premium over commodity 
products. This in turn leads to higher customer loyalty and an increase 
in repeat bookings. Unique holidays also book earlier enabling us to 
manage our capacity and yield more effectively. Due to our experience 
in designing and operating new concepts it is increasingly difficult for 
our competitors to replicate these holidays.
New openings during the year included Sensatori Jamaica, new Couples 
product in Croatia (Kalamota Island) and a new Holiday Village resort 
in Ibiza. We also opened six new Blue Star and five new Blue Couples 
concepts for the Nordic market. 2014 also marked the first season of 
our pan-Mainstream SuneoClub concept, which saw openings in Kos 
and Djerba among others. 
Moving forward into next year, we will see three new Sensatori resorts 
in Turkey, Cyprus (Aphrodite Hills) and Ibiza and six new Splash resorts 
in Spain, Greece and North Africa. New Sensimar/Couples resorts are 
also planned for Croatia, Tunisia, Portugal, Ibiza and Bodrum. 
Sales of higher margin unique holidays during the year increased by 
three percentage points to 71% of Mainstream holidays. We have 
maintained our record customer satisfaction score of 79% for our 
three largest Mainstream markets. Demand for unique holiday 
experiences continues to see strong growth and our customers are 
delighted with the holiday experiences we have designed for them.  
We believe there is a direct correlation between unique holidays and 
strong customer service questionnaire scores that leads to increased 
customer retention.
One mobility platform
Our unique holiday offering gives us control over the end-to-end 
customer experience and an opportunity to interact with our customers 
throughout their journey. We have a clear digital strategy to enhance 
and deepen the relationship with our customers. Our award-winning 
TUI Digital Assistant (TDA) app has now had over one million 
downloads across Mainstream. The digital assistant is a key driver of 
customer engagement at every stage of the customer journey. 
We recently expanded the functionality of the TDA by adding ‘search 
and book’ on the iPad for both the Thomson and First Choice apps  
in the UK. This will be followed by the Android and iPhone launch in  
Q1 2015. ‘Search and book’ will be expanded to the Nordics by the end 
of Q1 2015. Traffic from mobile devices (including tablets) continues  
to grow dramatically, standing at 36% of overall visits in 2014, up from 
25% in the prior year. In the UK, the conversion rate on smartphones 
has increased by just under 50%. 
The use of a common app platform has enabled us to widen the roll 
out across a number of Mainstream markets. As well as the UK and 
Germany, the app is now live in the Nordics, Austria and Switzerland. 
We will continue to leverage our one common mobility platform in 
2015 by launching the app across the rest of our Mainstream markets. 
The ongoing pipeline of features includes online check-in via the app 
(expected by early 2015), flight extras, travel documents and hotel 
check-in.
Flight experience
The flight experience is a key part of our unique holiday offering.  
We continue to reshape the composition of our airline fleet to drive 
customer satisfaction and simplify the fleet to one short-haul and one 
long-haul aircraft type. Having a modern, cost-efficient and reliable 
fleet is strategically important to the Group, as well as operating the 
most carbon efficient airlines in Europe.
Our Boeing 787-8 Dreamliner fleet has proved to offer a much better 
experience to our customers. The feedback we receive from those who 
fly on these aircraft is exceptional. As at November 2014, we operate 
eight 787 Dreamliner planes, with a further five to be delivered by the 
end of FY15. We remain the only integrated tour operator to operate 
these aircraft and carried one million long-haul customers during 2014.
The expanded 787 fleet has been a key driver of demand for long-haul 
travel, enabling us to travel non-stop to destinations such as Western 
Mexico, Mauritius and Thailand. The range of long-haul destinations 
offered will be expanded during the coming year, with direct flights  
to Costa Rica in November 2015 as well as other destinations being 
considered such as St Lucia, Antigua, Vietnam and Malaysia. The 
long-haul opportunity complements our existing end-to-end customer 
proposition which is difficult for LCCs and scheduled carriers to replicate. 
Our ‘One Airline’ cost saving initiative will see one structure across  
all of our Mainstream markets. This will enable one IT platform, and  
a joint perspective on crew planning/aircraft deployment across our  
six airlines. The leadership structure for this ‘one virtual airline’ is in 
place with all aviation operations now under one Airline Operations 
Director. Cost savings will be driven by leveraging our scale across  
joint purchasing and a common supply chain. Being able to offer our 
customers the most advanced, comfortable aircraft, whether they are 
travelling with us to short or long-haul destinations, while reducing  
our environmental impact, will only strengthen our position. 
1 . 2 	 Distributed 	 dir ec tly 	 to 	 the 	 customer 	 – 	 gr o w th 	 fr om 	 online
Direct distribution
Our direct distribution channels are central to the Group’s strategy. By 
increasing the direct distribution of our holidays we lower distribution 
costs, reduce the reliance on third party distributors and can build on 
our customer relationships. Our direct distribution mix improved by 
two percentage points over the year to 68% of Mainstream sales, with 
improvements in all three largest source markets. The improvement in 
direct distribution was driven by the online channel which also increased 
by three percentage points in 2014 to 38% of Mainstream sales. During 
the year, we generated £4.1bn of revenue online within our Mainstream 
business, reflecting 6% growth in online package bookings.
One online platform
We continue to drive the online customer experience through 
investments made in our online platforms. This helped to deliver 
a tangible increase in conversion as customers booking their holidays 
experienced an enhanced user interface including focused search 
functionality. We expect that our other key source markets will join the 
UK and Nordics on the same online platform during 2015. Our websites 
are tablet and mobile optimised as our customers increasingly use their 
tablets and mobile devices to dream, plan, search and book with us. 56 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Next generation retail stores
We are currently operating 23 next generation stores in the UK, following 
the first store that launched in Bluewater late last year. These stores 
combine personal advice and service with a rich digital experience that 
enables customers to build their perfect holiday. Features include a giant 
video wall to show off new video content, an interactive map and table 
to help research holidays, the ‘Advice Bar’ with staff on hand to answer 
questions and free in-store Wi-Fi. Additional next generation stores will 
continue to open in the UK at high footfall sites. We have also carried 
this concept into other key source markets and now operate two next 
generation stores in both Germany and the Netherlands. 
1 .3 	 Le v era gin g 	 our 	 scale
As Europe’s largest tour operator we leverage our scale across all source 
markets to consolidate our market-leading position and grow the number 
of customers travelling with us. Our One Mainstream structure is in 
place and yielding tangible benefits. The move from multiple online 
and back-end platforms to one core platform will be a key driver of 
efficiencies going forward.
We have market leading positions and brands across our portfolio. 
The breadth of our brands offers our customers a wealth of holiday 
experiences. This leading market position and scale means that our 
competition cannot easily replicate what we do. There are significant 
barriers to entry in both our positioning and deep-rooted relationships 
with hotel suppliers. Our scale also enables us to deliver synergy 
benefits through joint contracting and purchasing of accommodation 
and destination contracting.
We maintain a target of overheads as a percentage of sales of less  
than 5%, which was maintained in 2014.
2. 	 O r ga n i c 	 Sp e ci a l ist 	 & 	 A cti v i ty 	 gr o w th
The Specialist & Activity Sector offers a wide range of unique activity 
and experience based holidays to 1.3m customers from around the 
world. We have market-leading positions in a number of specialist 
segments with a portfolio of experiential and tailor-made holidays, 
unrivalled product knowledge and superb customer experiences.
During 2014, the Specialist & Activity Sector saw a mixed performance 
from its various businesses, delivering broadly flat operating profit  
on a constant currency basis. We saw a strong result from our North 
American Education and North American Specialist businesses. Sport 
benefited from weak year-on-year comparatives as well as the Ashes 
and 2014 FIFA World Cup tournament. However, these results were 
offset by soft trading within the Marine and Adventure businesses.

Our Accommodation Wholesaler business is a market leader operating 
in the B2B segment with a global distribution presence. We have a clear 
strategy of consolidating our market-leading position even further by 
focusing on high growth markets, such as Asia, Africa and Latin America. 
The global hotel market, which includes all hotel bookings, amounts 
to €378bn with the Accommodation Wholesaler market accounting 
for €35bn of this spend. We also continue to explore avenues for new 
product growth – for example, ROI Back (Global Obi), which was 
acquired during 2014, provides online solutions and marketing to hotels. 
In addition, we announced a three year deal in March 2014 with easyJet 
Holidays to act as their accommodation and transfer & activity provider. 
Accommodation Wholesaler continues to grow its global leadership 
position, delivering TTV growth of 15% to £1,899m during the year 
with a strong performance from Asia and Latin America. Roomnights 
grew by 16% to 22.5 million during 2014, with hotel inventory also 
increasing by 8% to over 67,000 hotels. Accommodation Wholesaler 
delivered a 21% growth in underlying operating profit during the year, 
on a constant currency basis.

In Accommodation OTA (online travel agent) our focus is to build on our 
strong brand positioning of LateRooms.com in the UK and expand in the 
emerging markets through AsiaRooms.com across Asia and in Brazil 
with MalaPronta, Brazil’s fourth largest accommodation-only OTA.
Accommodation OTA TTV declined by 9% to £382m during the year. 
The decline in TTV was primarily driven by a reduction in unprofitable 
marketing spend within our AsiaRooms brand. On the mobile side, 
we launched new iOS and Android apps across all brands (LateRooms, 
AsiaRooms and Malapronta). We look to capitalise on mobile growth 
through a single content management platform in the year ahead.

One of our key strategic objectives is to continue to improve the Group’s 
profitability and free cash flow, delivering superior returns on investment. 
This improvement will allow us to invest further in the future of our 
business which will benefit our customers, colleagues and shareholders.
During the year, we generated a strong free cash flow, with an 
improvement year-on-year of £50m to £477m on a constant currency 
basis. We delivered a strong ROIC performance of 14.6% (2013: 14.8%), 
down slightly on prior year due to foreign exchange translation and 
an increase in the underlying effective tax rate, as a result of delivering 
increased profits in higher taxed jurisdictions such as Germany. 
We generated a cash conversion rate of 85% in 2014 (2013: 93%). 
This was above our cash conversion target of at least 70%.
Our Group-wide business improvement programme delivered £12m 
of cost savings during the year, in line with our expectations. These 
cost savings were primarily driven by back office restructuring and IT 
platform replacement across a number of markets. This leaves £7m 
of the business improvement programme left, which is expected to 
close fully in 2015 with these cost savings coming through the UK and 
Specialist & Activity Sector.

We see sustainability as an integral part of our differentiation strategy 
and we have experienced a range of business benefits, including cost 
efficiencies, quality improvements and the enhanced engagement of 
customers, colleagues and suppliers. We have made significant 
progress in the final year of our Sustainable Holidays Plan – our three 
year sustainability strategy which aligns with our corporate strategy 
and strategic drivers.
Our airlines are the most carbon efficient in Europe. In 2014, TUI Travel 
airline’s CO
2 per revenue passenger kilometre was 69.9g – an 
improvement of 10.3% over the last six years. This was achieved through 
investment in new, more fuel-efficient aircraft, operational efficiencies, 
fuel conservation activities and capacity amends.
We exceeded our goal to deliver 10 million greener and fairer holidays 
over three years, by taking over 11.5 million customers to hotels with 
credible sustainability certifications (5.5 million in 2014). We featured 
over 5,900 hotels with sustainability certifications in 2014.
Our sustainability performance has been recognised through many 
achievements in 2014:
• For the seventh consecutive year, TUI Travel was featured in CDP’s 
Climate Disclosure Leadership Index (CDLI) and was ranked joint 
first place in the FTSE 350 for our approach to climate change 
reporting and disclosure. TUI Travel was the only Travel & Leisure 
company to feature in the 2014 CDLI.
• We continue to be listed in the FTSE4Good Index in recognition  
of meeting strict social, environmental and governance standards.
• TUIfly was ranked the most climate-efficient airline in the world  
with over one million passengers in the 2014 atmosfair Airline Index.
• Thomson Airways won the Best Aviation Programme for Carbon 
Reduction at the 2014 World Responsible Tourism Awards.

The UK business delivered a £20m improvement in underlying operating 
profit to £271m during the year. This translates to an operating margin 
of 6.9%, a 40 basis point improvement over the prior year. This record 
result was driven by focus on higher margin unique holidays increasingly 
distributed online and greater operational efficiency.
We continued to see strong demand for unique holidays, accounting 
for 84% of departures, up by one percentage point on the prior year. 
New openings during the year included Sensatori Jamaica, new Couples 
product in Croatia (Kalamota Island) and Morocco (Madina Gardens) 
as well as a new Holiday Village resort in Ibiza. The result benefited from 
a two percentage point increase in direct distribution to 91% compared 
with the prior year. Online bookings accounted for 51% of all bookings, 
up four percentage points year-on-year.
The UK business delivered £4m of efficiency savings towards the 
business improvement programme in the period.

Nordics achieved an underlying operating profit of £47m (2013: £79m). 
The decline in operating result was driven primarily by a weak 
performance in H1 reflecting weaker pricing due to a significant 
reduction in the Egypt programme, political unrest in Thailand and 
a more competitive environment overall, particularly in the Canaries 
which is a key destination and source of Winter profitability. The Nordic 
business delivered an underlying operating margin of 4.2% (2013: 6.5%) 
or 4.5% on a constant currency basis.
Our performance during the second half of the year stabilised, delivering 
a broadly flat H2 operating profit year-on-year on a constant currency 
basis. We united the four countries under a ‘One Nordic’ structure 
which will be built upon as we focus on differentiated product and 
driving further operational efficiencies. A change in management in 
early Summer saw Eivor Andersson join the Group to take charge of 
TUI Nordic.
Unique holidays accounted for 94% of departures, one percentage 
point ahead of the prior year. Direct distribution increased by one 
percentage point to 90%. New openings during the year included one 
new Blue Village in Kos, six new Blue Star and five new Blue Couples 
concepts in Antalya, Bodrum, Palma, Sicily, Cyprus. Online distribution 
continues to grow, standing at 70% of bookings, up three percentage 
points over the prior year.

Germany reported a £11m increase in underlying operating profit on  
a constant currency basis to £124m. Including currency translation, 
Germany reported flat operating profit of £113m (2013: £113m). 
Operating margin for the German business increased by 20 basis 
points to 2.9% in 2014, and to 3% on a constant currency basis.
Last year we launched our popular TUI Reisewelten labels (Beach, 
Classic, Lifestyle, Nature, Premium and Scene) which, along with 
continued focus on our highly differentiated holiday concepts, has 
increased the mix of unique holidays to 52%, up three percentage 
points. We continue to implement our strategy to improve direct 
distribution with a focus on online via our TUI.com website. Direct 
distribution stands at 37%, an increase of one percentage point over 
the prior year. Online continues to grow and stood at 11% of bookings 
in 2014, up by three percentage points from the prior year.

France reported a reduced underlying operating loss of £36m (2013: 
loss of £60m). This reflected the continued delivery of efficiency 
savings and alignment of tour operator capacity in line with demand.
Our overall direct distribution mix of 56% (2013: 56%) remained flat 
with the increase in online bookings offset by the planned closure of 
part of our retail estate. The French tour operator delivered £4m of 
efficiency savings towards the business improvement programme in 
the period. 
The Airline result declined by £6m from the prior year with an operating 
loss of £7m. The year-on-year decline was driven by weak local demand, 
not helped by an outbreak of the Chikungunya virus in the Caribbean 
and Ebola concerns in Africa. The French airline delivered £1m of 
efficiency savings towards the business improvement programme during 
the period.

grew by 10% to £2.3bn and roomnights increased by 16%. 
Accommodation Wholesaler continues to grow its global leadership 
position, delivering TTV growth of 15% to £1,899m during the year

grew by 16% to 22.5 million during 2014, with hotel inventory also

We are delighted to have delivered another year of out-performance 
against the growth roadmap we set out in December 2012. This 
demonstrates the strength and resilience of our business model in what 
has been a competitive trading environment for many tour operators 
and airlines. Our UK business is going from strength to strength, 
delivering a 6.9% underlying operating profit margin this year, as we 
continue to build on our strong market-leading position. In Germany 
further progress has been made in realising operational efficiencies, 
growing unique content and driving online sales. Also particularly 
pleasing has been our performance in the Netherlands and reducing 
our losses by half in the French tour operator. In addition to the 
strong performance by Mainstream, our Accommodation Wholesaler 
business delivered a second year of growth in earnings in excess of its 
growth roadmap.
We are pleased with the progress in Winter 2014/15 trading and 
the strong start to Summer 2015 trading in the UK continues. 
The combination of our market leadership position, scale, focus on 
unique holidays distributed increasingly online and our relationship with 
the customer throughout their whole holiday experience continues to 
provide a strong basis for sustainable, profitable growth. The merger 
with TUI AG will strengthen and future-proof our combined Group. 
It will also enhance the certainty of long-term unique holiday growth 
and reinforce our clear competitive advantage through further control 
over the end-to-end customer experience. This will mark the start of 
an exciting new phase of growth, delivering significant opportunities 
and value to customers, employees and shareholders.

Tax 
t h e 	 Gr o u p ’ s 	 a p p r o ach 	 t o 	 tax	
The Group’s approach to tax matters is to comply with all relevant tax 
laws and regulations, wherever we operate in the world, whilst managing 
our overall tax burden. 
W e 	 look 	 to 	 pa y 	 the 	 ri ght 	 and 	 fa ir 	 amount 	 of 	 t ax es 	 in 	 a ccordance	
with 	 the 	 let ter 	 and 	 spirit 	 of 	 the 	 la ws 	 in 	 the 	 countries 	 in 	 which 	 w e	
do 	 business .
We consider the ‘right’ amount of tax as being in accordance with the 
letter of the law and the ‘fair’ amount of tax as being in accordance 
with the government policy intention for which the law was introduced.
t h e 	 Gr o u p ’ s 	 tax 	 o b j e cti v es
In view of the Group’s approach to tax, the following high-level tax 
objectives have been developed:
• Commercial and sustainable tax planning to support the Group’s 
business operations
• Optimisation of the Group’s tax risk and control environment
• Accurate and timely tax compliance on a full-disclosure basis
• Optimisation and stability of the income statement effective tax 
rate and cash tax payments
• Excellent working relationships with tax authorities
These are considered in more detail in the following sections.
t ax 	 g o v e r na n c e
The Group’s tax strategy is determined by the Board of Directors as  
a sub-set of the Group’s overall business strategy and is approved 
annually by the Audit Committee. Operational responsibility for the 
execution of the Group’s tax strategy rests with the Chief Financial 
Officer and the Director of Tax, who report the Group’s tax position  
to the Audit Committee on a regular basis.
The Group Risk Management Committee considers tax risks that may 
arise as a result of our business operations, on a quarterly basis, through 
the Group’s risk management framework. The consideration of such tax 
risks includes actions to mitigate the risks or to prevent their occurrence 
or reoccurrence.
c on t e xt
The effective tax rate on the Group’s underlying profit before tax for 
2014 was 31%, up from 27% in 2013. The Group paid cash income 
taxes of £125m in 2014, an increase of £15m from 2013. These increases 
are due to the Group’s increasing year on year underlying profitability 
and, in particular, increasing underlying profitability in countries that 
have statutory rates of corporation tax or corporate income tax in 
excess of the UK rate of 22%. We consider the cash taxes that we 
pay to governments are an important source of revenue for them in 
providing a stable infrastructure and environment in which we operate 
our businesses.
The Group’s businesses operate in 180 countries. This geographical 
diversity leads to considerable complexity in our tax affairs and tax 
authorities around the world are subjecting the tax affairs of large 
companies to ever-greater scrutiny. We look to manage our tax affairs in 
a manner to support our business operations with the aim of ensuring 
that the tax consequences of our business operations match the 
economic and commercial consequences of those business operations. 
For example, we look to ensure that the same profits are not taxed twice 
by different countries and that transactions between subsidiary and 
associate companies are conducted on arm’s-length terms and prices. 
Where a tax rule, regulation or incentive exists that may convey a tax 
advantage to our operations, such as using losses incurred in prior years 
or tax depreciation from investing in our business, we will use that rule, 
regulation or incentive to support our businesses. In many countries, 
such rules operate automatically by law, for example, using UK losses 
incurred in prior years to offset current year UK taxable profits.
The Group uses the services of external, expert tax advisers to provide 
input into the Group’s tax affairs, such as the management of compliance 
in some overseas jurisdictions and the impact of changes in tax legislation 
on the Group.
The macro tax environment will be subject to considerable change as 
a result of the recent international co-operation between governments 
to address cross-border and international tax matters. The OECD’s 
Base Erosion & Profit Shifting (BEPS) study is the prime example of 
this international co-operation. 
The BEPS study is due to publish its final recommendations over the 
next 12 months and these recommendations are likely to be adopted by 
many, if not all, governments. As with all legislative change, the Group 
continues to monitor the possible impact on its business operations.

TUI Travel operates across 31 key source markets. These source 
markets are ‘home’ to our tour operators and airlines. It is from these 
source markets that our 30 million customers wish to travel. Our 
inbound services companies and associates operate in key leisure 
travel destinations. 
As a leisure travel group, we take people on holiday to some countries 
that have low or zero tax rates. This means that we may have subsidiary 
companies in such locations, for example, we have a legal entity in the 
British Virgin Islands which operates a yacht base for our Moorings 
business and is one of the island’s largest employers. We also have 
legal entities in other Caribbean islands for the same purpose and for 
operating hotels that our customers visit.  63 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

P a y m e n t 	 o f 	 tax es
In the year ended 30 September 2014, the Group paid corporate income 
taxes of £125m, an increase of £15m or 14% over 2013. 
The amounts shown in the table below represent the corporate income 
tax, or corporation tax or cash tax payments made by the Company and 
its subsidiaries during the year ended 30 September 2014. Different 
countries have different rules as to how companies should make 
payments of cash taxes, with some requiring payments on account to 
be made during the current year or the immediately following year or a 
combination of these methods, whilst others may use the immediately 
preceding year as the basis for cash tax payments. Cash tax payments 
may be lower than the tax charge for the year due to the utilisation of 
brought forward tax losses against current year profits.
With regard to UK cash taxes, £3m is the corporation tax paid in the 
year ended 30 September 2014. This is lower than may be expected 
due to the utilisation of losses brought forward from earlier years and 
tax depreciation (capital allowances) resulting from investment in our 
UK business. We expect the amount of UK corporation tax to increase 
in future years as these brought forward losses reduce.
R e la ti o nsh i ps 	 w i th 	 tax 	 a u th o r i ti es
We look to develop and maintain good working relationships with tax 
authorities in the countries in which we operate. We communicate with 
them in an open, honest and positive manner. Where it is possible to do 
so, we seek to discuss our major commercial transactions and their tax 
consequences and treatment with tax authorities in advance of their 
execution or seek an advance ruling of the tax consequences and 
treatment of such transactions in order to provide us with certainty 
of the tax treatment. We are committed to transparent and prompt 
full disclosure in all tax matters. We pay our tax liabilities when they 
become due.
We recognise that there will be areas of differing legal interpretations 
between the Group and tax authorities. Where this occurs, we will engage 
with tax authorities to try to resolve the matters in a co-operative and 
expedited manner. Where a conclusion cannot be reached in such a 
manner, the tax authority or the Group may choose to litigate the issue 
through the relevant legal system.
The Group reviews new tax law and regulations introduced by 
governments around the world from time to time. Where we believe 
that new laws would have a disproportionate or detrimental impact on 
the Group’s businesses or require amendment to achieve the intention 
of the new law, we will lobby the relevant government, either in our 
own name or as part of a trade association, to explain the potential 
issues and to suggest alternatives.  64 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

The Board’s primary responsibility is to promote the long-term success 
of the Company by creating and delivering sustainable shareholder 
value. The Board seeks to achieve this through setting out its strategy, 
monitoring its strategic objectives and providing oversight and 
direction to the management team. The Board considers the impact of 
its decisions on wider stakeholders including employees, suppliers and 
the environment.
The Board meets regularly, including visits to operational locations, 
and is responsible for the overall leadership, strategy and control of 
the Group. A full schedule of matters reserved for the Board’s decision, 
along with the terms of reference of the Board’s key committees 
and the individual roles of Board members, can be found online  
at www.tuitravelplc.com and will be available for inspection at the 
Annual General Meeting (AGM). The schedule of matters includes: 
• determining the strategy of the Group; 
• amendments to the structure and capital of the Group; 
• approval of financial reporting; 
• oversight of the Group’s internal controls;
• approval of capital and revenue expenditure of a significant size; 
• acquisitions, disposals and share dealings; 
• Board membership and appointments; 
• approval of remuneration of Directors and certain senior management;
• corporate governance matters; and 
• approval of Group policies and risk management strategies. 
The Board has overall responsibility for ensuring the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control and risk management framework and 
this has been developed in accordance with the Code. This system of 
control is designed to manage and mitigate rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives. In pursuing these objectives, 
internal controls – which include financial, operational and compliance 
controls – and risk management can only provide reasonable, and not 
absolute, assurance against material loss.
The role of management is to implement Board policies on risk and 
control and the Board has delegated the day-to-day management of 
the Company to the Chief Executive and, through him, to the other 
Executive Directors and members of the Group Management Board 
(GMB). For information on the GMB see ‘Our People’ on pages 32 
and 33.
c ha i rma n ’ s 	 Go v erna n ce 	 S ta tem ent
The Board of TUI Travel PLC believes that effective corporate 
governance is integral to the successful delivery of our business goals 
and is therefore a key contributor to the long-term success of the 
Company. We remain committed to maintain standards by ensuring 
that a robust framework of systems and controls is in place and 
refreshed on a continual basis. We have made good progress across 
the governance agenda – some of which is highlighted in the following 
pages. We know that processes and procedures need to be reviewed 
and improved on an ongoing basis and our aim is that they become 
embedded in the daily lives of management throughout the Group.
The Board’s role is to set the strategy for the Group and, to this end, 
we work closely with the executive team to give support and advice. 
We also provide challenge, where appropriate, in order to drive 
continued and sustained improvement. 
For this year, the Board had agreed to put in place new initiatives  
in respect of succession planning – as well as our annual talent 
management review, we planned a more detailed approach to 
succession planning for the Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
However, in view of the proposal for the Company to merge with our 
majority shareholder TUI AG, these initiatives were put on hold and 
will now be reviewed upon completion of the merger.
As Chairman, I am fortunate to be able to call on a broad range of  
skills and perspectives in the board room from colleagues with a deep 
understanding of the challenges which face us now and in the future.

Board (‘Vorstand’) of TUI AG), Friedrich Joussen and Horst Baier 
(also members of the Vorstand) and Sebastian Ebel (member of the 
Management Board of TUI AG).
There were two meetings of the Non-Executive Directors, without 
management present, held in December 2013 and September 2014. 
These focused primarily on the effectiveness of the Board.
The key elements of the Company’s internal control and risk 
management framework in place across the Group are as follows: 
• The Board sets corporate strategy and business objectives. 
The GMB and Sector management integrate these objectives into 
their operational and financial business plans. 
• The GMB meets regularly, together with other senior executives, to 
consider Group operational and financial performance and business 
development. The Chief Executive reports to the Board on behalf 
of the GMB on significant changes in the business and the external 
environment. The Chief Financial Officer provides the Board 
with financial information which includes key performance and 
risk indicators.
• The Group operates a risk management process which is integrated 
within the short and long-term business planning processes (see 
page 42).
• The Treasury position of the Group, including cash, foreign exchange 
and fuel hedging exposure, is managed centrally in accordance with 
policies appropriate for each Sector and is the responsibility of the 
Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer.
• Financial forecasts, providing predicted results with sensitivity analysis, 
are prepared routinely throughout the year for review by the GMB 
and the Board. These forecasts also include details of the Group’s 
ongoing compliance with its regulatory and banking requirements. 
• The Group has established investment appraisal and authorisation 
procedures and its capital expenditure is reviewed against budgets 
which have been approved by the Board.
• The Group routinely assesses the capability of its people to deliver 
the business objectives set and responds accordingly. This is 
supported by the three lines of defence (see page 42).
Processes are in place to ensure appropriate action is taken where 
necessary to remedy any deficiencies identified through the Group’s 
internal control and risk management processes (see page 42).
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of internal controls during the year and confirms that:
• there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the Group;
• this has been in place for the year under review and up to the date 
of approval of the Annual Report and Accounts;
• the process is regularly reviewed by the Board and accords with 
the Code; and
• in addition, the Board also reviewed the effectiveness of the risk 
management process.
The division of responsibilities between the Chairman and Chief 
Executive is clearly established, has been agreed by the Board and is 
reviewed annually. The Board approves any necessary amendments  
to reflect changes in legislation, policy and practices.
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary and can take independent professional advice, if necessary, 
at the Company’s expense. During the year advice was sought by the 
Independent Non-Executive Directors as a group from Lazard and 
Herbert Smith Freehills in relation to merger discussions. Advice was 
also received from Bank of America Merrill Lynch and Barclays. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for ensuring Board procedures 
are followed, including the formal minuting of any unresolved concerns 
that any Director may have in connection with the operation of the 
Company. During the year there were no such unresolved issues.
A secure iPad-based paperless meeting system, which was introduced in 
2012, continues to be rolled out across the Group and helps our drive to 
reduce the impact of our operations on the environment. As well as the 
Board and its Committees, this has now been adopted in numerous 
businesses across the Group. 69 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
TT27 | AR 2014 | XX/08/2014 | Design
Val Gooding, Janis Kong, Coline McConville and Minnow Powell are 
considered to be effective Directors due to their breadth of experience 
and ability to provide appropriate challenge in Board debate. As part 
of the initial recruitment process, external consultants were used to 
conduct a search for suitable candidates and the Nomination Committee 
considered and concluded that each of them met the independence 
provisions of the Code. They have no relationships, transactions or 
arrangements that are required to be disclosed pursuant to LR13.8.17(1).
Erhard Schipporeit and Albert Schunk are considered to be effective 
Directors due to their particular industry experience. At the time of 
their appointments, the Nomination Committee concluded that they met 
the necessary independence criteria. Albert Schunk is an adviser to RIU, 
the Spanish international hotel group, with which the Company, and 
a number of its subsidiaries, have material contractual arrangements. 
RIU Group is also a shareholder of TUI AG, a controlling shareholder of 
the Company. Erhard Schipporeit has no relationships, transactions or 
arrangements that are required to be disclosed pursuant to LR13.8.17(1). 
Sir Michael Hodgkinson was the independent Chairman of First Choice 
Holidays PLC and was therefore considered to be independent on 
his appointment as the Senior Independent Director of the Company 
following the merger with the Tourism Division of TUI AG in 2007. 
He is considered to be effective due to his considerable experience 
in executive and non-executive positions. He has no relationships, 
transactions or arrangements that are required to be disclosed 
pursuant to LR13.8.17(1).
The Board recommends to shareholders the re-appointment of all 
Directors retiring at the meeting on the basis that they are all effective 
Directors of the Company and demonstrate the appropriate level of 
commitment in their respective roles. 
For the purposes of the Listing Rules, TUI AG is a controlling shareholder 
of the Company (that is, a person or group of people acting together 
which exercises or controls more than 30% of the voting rights in the 
Company). Because the Company has a controlling shareholder, the 
Listing Rules require the re-election of the Independent Directors 
to be approved at the AGM by a majority of the votes cast by both: 
(i) the shareholders of the Company as a whole; and (ii) the independent 
shareholders of the Company (that is, all of the shareholders of the 
Company entitled to vote on the election of the Independent Directors 
excluding any controlling shareholder).
At the AGM, the Company will therefore propose the resolutions in 
relation to the re-election of the Independent Directors as ordinary 
resolutions on which all shareholders are entitled to vote, but the 
Company will separately count the number of votes cast by independent 
shareholders in favour of such resolutions (as a proportion of the total 
votes of independent shareholders cast) to determine whether the 
threshold referred to in (ii) above has been satisfied. The Company will 
announce whether each threshold has been satisfied in respect of each 
resolution for the re-election of an Independent Director. 
Under the Listing Rules, if a resolution to re-elect an Independent 
Director is not approved at the AGM by both a majority of the votes cast 
by the shareholders as a whole and by the Company’s independent 
shareholders (but one of these two thresholds is satisfied), the Company 
is entitled to propose a further resolution for the re-election of that 
Independent Director for the approval of the shareholders as a whole 
by ordinary resolution. If the Company proposes such a resolution, 
the meeting at which the resolution is voted upon must be held at least 
90 days after (but within 120 days of) the AGM. 
Accordingly, if any resolution to re-elect an Independent Director is not 
approved by a majority vote of the Company’s independent shareholders 
at the AGM, the relevant Independent Director(s) will be treated as 
having been re-elected only for the period from the date of the AGM 
until the earlier of: (i) the close of any general meeting of the Company,

Our Board consists of 13 Directors – 12 of whom served throughout 
the year. At 30 September 2014, in addition to the Chairman, Friedrich 
Joussen, there were three Executive Directors and nine Non-Executive 
Directors – seven of whom are considered to be independent. Val 
Gooding was appointed as an Independent Non-Executive Director with 
effect from 7 February 2014 and Vladimir Yakushev was also appointed 
as a Non-Executive Director on 7 February 2014. He resigned on 
24 March 2014 without attending any Board meetings. Volker Böttcher 
and Tony Campbell resigned and retired respectively on 16 December 
2013 and Harold Sher retired on 18 September 2014.
i n de p e n de n ce 	 of 	 n o n- e x e cuti v e 	 Dir e c t o r s
The Chairman, Friedrich Joussen, did not comply with the independence 
criteria of the Code at the time of his appointment. This is because 
Mr Joussen is the Chief Executive of TUI AG – a 53.72% shareholder 
of the Company as at 30 September 2014. Horst Baier and Sebastian 
Ebel are also not considered to be independent as they are both 
members of TUI AG’s Executive Board. 
Details of the Chairman’s other significant commitments are given 
in his biography on page 64. He has no other external roles and the 
Board is confident that he has sufficient time to perform his duties 
as Chairman of the Company.
The Non-Executive Directors considered to be independent are 
Sir Michael Hodgkinson, Val Gooding, Janis Kong, Coline McConville, 
Minnow Powell, Dr Erhard Schipporeit and Dr Albert Schunk. Each 
year all the Directors complete a Conflicts of Interests and Material 
Interests in Contracts/Arrangements declaration which captures those 
matters which could affect their independence and such disclosures, 
if any, are included in this report.
The Board recognises that the Code requires that at least half the Board, 
excluding the Chairman, should be Independent Non-Executive Directors 
and was compliant with provision B1.2 of the Code throughout the year 
ended 30 September 2014. The Board is committed to ensure that its 
membership is refreshed on a regular basis. 
Ski l ls 	 a n d 	 e x p e r i e n ce
Biographical details for each of the Directors are set out on page 64 
and can also be found online at www.tuitravelplc.com.
The Directors have collective responsibility for the Company’s 
direction. In particular, Non-Executive Directors are responsible for:
• scrutinising and challenging performance across the 
Group’s business;
• bringing wide-ranging skills and experience, including 
independent judgement on issues such as strategy, 
performance and risk management;
• assessing risk and the integrity of the financial information 
and controls; and
• challenging constructively the Chief Executive and 
Executive Directors.
In accordance with the Code, all Directors will be subject to annual 
re-election by shareholders. To enable shareholders to make an 
informed decision, the 2015 Notice of the AGM includes biographical 
details and a statement as to why the Company believes the Directors 
should be re-elected. The Chairman intends to confirm at the AGM 
that the performance of each individual continues to be effective 
and demonstrates commitment to the role. The effectiveness of the 
Directors is considered as part of the annual Board evaluation process 
and any issues arising are addressed appropriately by the Chairman. 
The reasons why the Company considers that each Independent 
Non-Executive will be an effective Director are given below. 70 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

P e r for man ce 	 e val ua ti on
Each year the performance of the Board and its Committees (Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination) is evaluated. The evaluation for the 
years ended 30 September 2013 and 2014 were both undertaken by 
an online survey and comprised a series of questions in relation to the 
running of, and business conducted at, Board meetings. The questions 
also covered the performance of individual Directors (including the 
Chairman of each Committee). Each Director was asked to place a score 
against the questions and the Directors were able to make additional 
comments where appropriate. 
Summary reports were produced following analysis of the responses 
by broad category and by reference to a traffic-light system showing 
the number of red, amber and green scores. As disclosed in last year’s 
annual report, the Board and its Committees considered the reports of 
their effectiveness at their meetings in September 2013. Following on 
from those initial discussions, the Chairman had conversations with 
individual Directors to highlight any points for further consideration. 
Following these conversations, various positive changes were agreed: 
(1) the style/format of presentations was revised to provide greater 
clarity and focus; (2) a review of individual skillsets of the Directors 
was undertaken to identify any potential gaps; (3) a more structured 
approach to reviewing the strategic plan; and (4) a more formalised 
and transparent approach to succession planning – particularly in 
respect of the appointment of Independent Non-Executive Directors. 
In addition, to give greater visibility of individual senior managers to the 
Board, and to provide a forum for general discussion, it was decided 
that Managing Directors would be invited to attend Board dinners 
and give an informal presentation on their businesses. During 2014, 
informal presentations were given by the Managing Directors of four 
significant business areas.
One of the outcomes of the 2013 evaluation process led to a review  
of the number and appropriateness of questions in the survey. As a 
result of this, a full review of the questions was undertaken prior to  
the launch of the survey in April 2014. As the 2013 review had been a 
much more in-depth exercise than in previous years, fewer issues were 
raised and these were presented, and considered, at the June 2014 
meeting of the Board. Two outcomes were (1) to carry out more 
post-project/acquisition appraisals; and (2) to put in place a more 
rigorous approach to succession planning for Non-Executive Directors.
In accordance with the Code, the intention had been to facilitate 
next year’s evaluation by way of personal interviews with an 
independent external adviser but this has been put on hold until 
the merger completes.
In March 2014, the Non-Executive Directors met to appraise the 
Chairman, Friedrich Joussen, who had just completed one year in 
his role as Chairman. It was unanimously agreed that meetings 
were chaired in an open and objective manner which allowed Board 
members the opportunity to express their views. 
convened for a date at least 90 days after (but within 120 days of) the 
AGM, to propose a further resolution to re-elect him/her; (ii) the date 
which is 120 days after the AGM; and (iii) the date of any announcement 
by the Board that it does not intend to hold a second vote. In the event 
that the Independent Director’s re-election is approved by a majority 
vote of all shareholders at a second meeting, the Independent Director 
will then be re-elected until the next AGM. 
If any resolution to re-elect an Independent Director is not approved by 
the shareholders of the Company as a whole at the AGM but is approved 
by the independent shareholders, the relevant Independent Director(s) 
may be re-appointed by the Board as a Director from the date of the 
AGM until the earlier of: (i) the close of any general meeting of the 
Company, convened for a date at least 90 days after (but within 120 
days of) the AGM, to propose a further resolution to re-elect him/her; 
(ii) the date which is 120 days after the AGM; and (iii) the date of 
any announcement by the Board that it does not intend to hold a 
second vote. 
The terms of the Directors’ service contracts are disclosed in the 
Remuneration Report commencing on page 79. Directors’ interests 
in the shares of the Company are disclosed on page 93.
Directors’ service contracts and the letters of appointment of the 
Non-Executive Directors are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office and will be available at the AGM which is scheduled  
to take place on Thursday 5 February 2015. 
The Chairman, in conjunction with the Company Secretary, ensures that 
a full, formal and tailored induction to the Company is made available 
for all new Directors on appointment and this is updated on a regular 
basis. The Company Secretary is on hand to answer any questions 
which may arise. During the year, Val Gooding and Vladimir Yakushev 
were both given Induction & Training Manuals and Val also received 
a full and tailored induction programme. She met with members of the 
senior management team (including the Chief Executive, Deputy Chief 
Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Company Secretary and senior 
managers from IT, HR, Corporate Communications, Treasury, Aviation 
and Internal Audit). Meetings were also arranged for her with various 
Company advisers (i.e. brokers, auditors and lawyers). 
Dir ec tors’ 	 confl ic t s 	 of 	 inter est s	
Under the Companies Act 2006, the Directors have a statutory duty  
to avoid a situation where they have, or could have, a direct or indirect 
interest that conflicts, or possibly may conflict, with the interests of 
the Company. Directors of public companies may authorise conflicts 
and potential conflicts where appropriate, if the Articles of Association 
contain a provision to this effect. 
The Board is aware of the other commitments of its Directors and is 
satisfied that these do not conflict with their duties as Directors of  
the Company. The process for monitoring conflicts is as follows:
• changes to the commitments of all Directors are reported to 
the Board;
• the Directors are required to complete a conflicts questionnaire 
on appointment and annually thereafter;
• any conflicts identified are presented to the Board for consideration 
and, as appropriate, authorised in accordance with the Companies 
Act and the Articles of Association; and
• Directors are responsible for notifying the Company Secretary if 
they become aware of any actual or potential conflict situations 
or a change in circumstances relating to an existing authorisation.
The Board believes that the procedures established to deal with 
conflicts of interest are operating effectively. 71 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

In respect of general meetings of the Company: 
• the Company prepares separate resolutions on each 
substantially separate issue and does not combine resolutions 
together inappropriately;
• the election or re-election by shareholders of an Independent 
Director will require approval both by a majority of the votes cast  
by the shareholders as a whole and by the Company’s independent 
shareholders (but, if one of these two thresholds but not both is 
satisfied, the Company is entitled to propose a further resolution  
(to be voted upon at least 90 days but within 120 days after the date 
of the AGM) for the re-election of that Independent Director, for  
the approval of the shareholders as a whole by ordinary resolution);
• proxy appointment forms provide shareholders with the option to 
vote for, against or to withhold their vote. The proxy form makes it 
clear that a ‘vote withheld’ is not a vote in law and will not 
be counted;
• all postal proxy votes are returned to Equiniti (the Company’s 
Registrar) which is responsible for ensuring votes are properly 
received and counted;
• proxy counts are displayed at the close of the AGM and the final poll 
results are posted on the Company’s website www.tuitravelplc.com 
following closure of the meeting; and
• the Annual Report and Accounts is laid before shareholders 
at the AGM.
The Directors consider that the Annual Report and Accounts taken

the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.
R ela ti o ns 	 with 	 sha r eh o ld ers	
The Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer and members of the Investor 
Relations team hold regular meetings with major shareholders to review 
the Group’s performance and prospects. The views of shareholders 
are communicated to all members of the Board following such 
meetings. During the course of these meetings the issue of governance 
is discussed. Presentations to major shareholders are made at least 
twice yearly, after the announcement of the interim and preliminary 
results, details of which, together with the Group’s financial reports 
and other announcements, can be accessed via the Group’s website 
www.tuitravelplc.com/investors-media.
The Code recommends that the Senior Independent Director meets 
with a range of major shareholders to gain an understanding of their 
views. Sir Michael Hodgkinson (Senior Independent Director) and 
Coline McConville (Chairman of the Remuneration Committee) held 
meetings with several major shareholders during October 2013. They 
also met with shareholders in October last year to explain the changes 
in the Committee membership and to discuss remuneration policy 
generally (see page 88 for further details). Sir Michael Hodgkinson also 
met with a number of major shareholders to discuss the implications  
of the proposed merger with TUI AG.
As a result of the extensive investor feedback provided by the 
Chief Executive, the Chief Financial Officer, and those Non-Executive 
Directors who did meet with shareholders, the remaining Non-Executive 
Directors did not consider it necessary to meet with other major 
shareholders during the year. They believe that they are kept aware of 
all issues, which are fed back to them at Board meetings, and therefore 
additional meetings were not required. However, they have confirmed 
they would be happy to make themselves available if any shareholder 
requested such a meeting.
Regular updates are produced by the Company’s brokers and circulated 
to the Board to keep them informed of market and industry views. The 
updates also include analyst views of TUI Travel’s position in the market.
There is an opportunity for shareholders to question the Chairman and 
other Directors (including the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and 
Nomination Committees) at the AGM. The AGM also provides a forum 
for the Non-Executive Directors to discuss the views of shareholders 
with them directly.

The Audit Committee comprised five Independent Non-Executive 
Directors at 30 September 2014 – Minnow Powell, Val Gooding, Sir 
Michael Hodgkinson, Janis Kong and Coline McConville. Four were 
members throughout the year and Val Gooding was appointed on  
1 July 2014. At least one had recent and relevant financial experience 
in compliance with the Code provision C3.1. 
The Chairman, Chief Executive, Chief Financial Officer, Director of 
Group Audit Services and the external auditor are invited to, and 
routinely attend, all meetings and other Non-Executive Directors  
may also attend.
Me etin gs
The Audit Committee met eight times during the year. The Chairman 
of the Audit Committee reports to the Board on how the Committee 
discharges its responsibilities.
As Chairman of the Audit Committee it is my responsibility to ensure 
that the Committee is rigorous and effective in its role of monitoring 
and reviewing:
• the integrity of the financial statements of the Company (including 
formal announcements relating to the Company’s financial 
performance and the significant financial reporting judgements 
contained therein);
• the effectiveness of internal controls and the risk management 
framework (including presentations from Group, Sector, regional 
and functional management);
• the effectiveness of Internal Audit (including agreeing in advance  
the work of Group Audit Services and reviewing the results of the 
work undertaken); 
• the arrangements by which employees may raise concerns regarding 
potential impropriety in confidence and ensuring these concerns  
are investigated appropriately; and
• the integrity of the Group’s relationship with the external auditors 
and the effectiveness of the audit process, including reviewing the 
policy for the engagement of the external auditors to supply 
non-audit services, considering their appointment, re-appointment 
and removal and approving the remuneration and terms of 
engagement of the external auditors.
The Audit Committee agenda is designed, in concert with the Board’s, 
to ensure that all significant areas of risk are considered during the 
course of the year. During the year we have continued to focus on 
improving key financial controls, processes and procedures across the 
organisation and I am pleased with the good progress that has been 
achieved in fulfilling our responsibilities in this regard. However, there 
are still improvements to be implemented and embedded across the 
Group which will remain a key point of focus for the Committee. 
I am satisfied that the Audit Committee was presented with papers of 
good quality during the year, provided in a timely fashion to allow due 
consideration of the subjects under review. I am also satisfied that 
meetings were scheduled to allow sufficient time to enable full and 
informed debate. We reviewed and amended our Terms of Reference 
with reference to the Code and guidance from the Institute of 
Chartered Secretaries & Administrators (ICSA). We decided that 
oversight of the Annual Report & Accounts and whether it is fair, 
balanced and understandable should be a matter for the Board as a 
whole. The updated terms of reference were approved by the Board 
and are available on www.tuitravelplc.com/investors-media. 
During the year we invited a number of members of management  
to present to the Committee on key areas of risk and control in order 
to encourage transparency and accountability, together with open 
discussion and debate. Management invited to present to the 
Committee included: 
• the Managing Directors and Finance Directors of our major 
businesses; 
• the Project Managers and Project Sponsors of our major projects 
(including additional updates where the projects were significant 
and complex);
• Group Accounting (including new accounting developments and 
controls over prepayments); 
• Group Treasury (including Group Treasury policy and counterparty 
risks);
• Group Tax (including the Group’s overall taxation strategy and the 
key factors for the Group’s overall tax position and forecasts for the 
future tax charge and cash taxes); and
• Group Insurance (including related risks and mitigation).
I met, individually and in private, with management in order to 
understand more fully the context and challenges of their business 
operations and thereby ensure the Committee’s time was used most 
effectively. 
The activities of the Committee members have enabled us to gain a 
good understanding of the culture of the organisation, the risks and 
challenges faced and the adequacy and timeliness of the action being 
taken to address them. 
No major matters were raised in the annual evaluation of the 
Committee’s performance.

Liab i l i ties
The business model is such that it is the level of provisions and accruals 
and any judgements thereon which can have a significant impact on 
the income statement. Detailed analysis of the key judgements was 
received by management to support the recognition of such balances 
on the year-end balance sheet, and it is an area which our Group 
auditors focus on in their work and discuss with us. We are satisfied 
that the balances reported are materially accurate. 
In addition, we examined the specific risks relating to the main legal 
cases facing the Group and the adequacy of provisions made against 
them. Management presented papers detailing the background to each 
case, the latest developments, their assessment of the respective risks, 
the mitigating action taken and amounts provided. We agreed with the 
judgements reached by management in each of the cases presented.
h o t el 	 pr epa ym e nt s
Twice a year, the Audit Committee reviews the level of prepayments 
made to hoteliers and assesses their recoverability with reference to 
the expected volumes of future trading with, and the credit-worthiness 
of, those hoteliers.
Separately 	 Disclosed 	i tems 	 (SDi s )
SDIs are those significant items which, in management’s judgement, 
are highlighted by virtue of their size or incidence to enable a full 
understanding of the Group’s financial performance. We reviewed the 
items proposed by management to be reported as SDIs each quarter 
to validate that it was appropriate for such items to be reported this 
way, and agreed with their judgement. Items included the pension 
credit arising in the UK&I as a consequence of offering to members 
and pensioners of the defined benefit pension schemes the option to 
swap future higher pension increases for a higher initial pension with 
lower annual increases; and restructuring costs in TUIfly as heavy 
maintenance work is being outsourced to other Group companies  
and to third parties. 
The risks relating to the VAT position of Hotelbeds Product SLU and 
the decision to regularise the position were taken by the Board as a 
whole. 
The performance and future prospects of our joint venture operating 
in the Russian and Ukrainian source markets were also considered by 
the Board as a whole. As a result of this review, £28m of loans made  
to the joint venture were provided for and disclosed separately.
t ax
We reviewed the judgement of management in assessing whether 
deferred tax assets will be utilised in future periods and agreed with 
the balances reported on the year-end balance sheet. In respect of 
German Trade Tax we once again reviewed the judgement made by 
management who also requested an update from external advisors on 
the opinion provided last year. The update continued to support the 
Group position that, with the risk more than minimal but less than 
50%, the disclosure as a contingency remains appropriate at this time. 
P r ofit 	 estimate
The Independent Directors reviewed the schedule and activities 
proposed by management and PwC to ensure effective reporting in 
August and October of the estimated year end result in accordance 
with Rule 28 of the City Code. The Independent Directors reviewed,  
on each occasion, both the process itself and the key judgements. We 
note that the actual results are consistent with the estimates made.
During the year activities of the Committee included the following:
t h e 	 in t e gr i ty 	 o f 	 fi n a n c i a l 	 r e p or tin g 	
We reviewed the integrity of the financial statements of the Company 
and all quarterly announcements relating to the Company’s financial 
performance. 
In last year’s Annual Report we reported on judgements relating to 
Aircraft transactions and Denied Boarding Compensation along with 
our annual review of Going Concern, Impairment, Provision for Claims, 
SDIs and Tax. The key areas reviewed in the current year are set out 
below. In each case we reviewed, discussed and challenged detailed 
papers received from management and took account of the views of 
the external auditors.
Denied 	 Boardin g 	c ompensati on 	 (DBc )
As a result of a ruling by the European Court of Justice in October 
2012, there is a present obligation to past events in respect of delay 
compensation being due to passengers where they have been subject 
to a flight cancellation or a delay of more than three hours (subject to 
certain restrictions). Accordingly, a provision is required. 
Again this year we reviewed the methodology for provisioning in 
relation to DBC exposure, the input factors, the key assumptions being 
applied and the classification for financial reporting. We were satisfied 
that the resultant provision had been calculated on a reasonable basis 
in light of current claims experience, i.e. rolling claim rates and pay-out 
ratios in each of the source markets, whilst noting that these factors 
may change with future experiences. 
Goin g 	 concern
We assessed our available facilities, including those to be made available 
by TUI AG when the merger completes, facility headroom, our banking 
covenants and the sensitivity analyses on these items.
We challenged management’s forecasts including sensitivities to 
downturns in budgeted trading. Reduced customer deposits were 
factored explicitly into the model and an assessment of the degree  
of flexibility in the payables ledger at the cash low point in December 
2014 was also taken into account.
We were satisfied that the going concern basis of preparation 
continues to be appropriate in the context of the Group’s funding 
and liquidity position.
Annual 	 g oodwill 	 impa irment 	 r e view
During the year we also considered the judgements made in relation  
to the valuation methodology adopted by management and the model 
inputs used. We reviewed the recommendation made by external 
advisers, who were engaged to calculate the weighted average cost  
of capital using more robust long-term data to reduce the impact of 
short-term stock market volatility. We examined movements against 
the previous year in the risk premium and long-term growth rate for 
each cash generating unit, reviewed the detailed WACC calculations 
along with the explanations provided and noted that the impairment 
model was consistent with the long-term planning approved by the 
Board in September 2014. We were satisfied with the quality of the 
work presented.
The annual impairment review has not resulted in an impairment 
charge this year. 
We also reviewed and approved the sensitivities applied by 
management which were consistent with 2013 and the ‘reasonably 
possible’ change to model inputs including the related disclosure,  
as required by IAS 36.

 – We received feedback during the year on the progress being 
achieved in relation to preventative and detective controls 
implemented during the year and activity planned for the coming 
year relating to Anti-Bribery & Corruption, Competition, Data 
Protection, Due Diligence and Anti-Money Laundering, Sanctions 
and Human Rights legislation.
• Group IT Compliance. Created in March 2012 to provide a compliance 
framework across the Group’s IT function by producing and/or 
publicising appropriate standards and monitoring compliance to those 
standards using a mixture of self-assessment and a programme of 
review visits.
 – We noted the progress being achieved in relation to the 
development of the IT control environment and the strengthening 
of the team. We reviewed the Group’s compliance with PCI DSS 
and the ongoing work and necessary work on improving the 
effectiveness of Business Continuity Planning (BCP) and Disaster 
Recovery (DR). We will continue to monitor progress during this 
coming year. 
While there is still further work to do, we noted that the three Group 
Compliance functions and the three functions that make up Group 
Audit Services (Risk, Internal Audit and Fraud) work well together to 
ensure the free flow of relevant information between them and have 
developed a co-ordinated and consistent approach across the Group 
through the Group Compliance Steering Committee.
We reviewed the talent pool of senior financial management during 
the year, noting the continued roll-out of competency testing in 
conjunction with Korn Ferry, a third party consultant, for key finance 
management and the role of the Finance Academy to educate and 
train our employees.
t hird 	 line 	 of 	 defence
i nt e rna l 	 A u d it
We noted further improvements in the development and effectiveness 
of the Internal Audit function during the year against the transformation 
plan set out by the Director of Group Audit Services in 2012. The 
function continues to innovate and we have noted the close and 
constructive working relationship that has developed between Internal 
Audit and the business, as evidenced in annual and post audit projects 
feedback surveys (which are reported in full to the Audit Committee) 
and in comments made by management directly to the Committee. 
We believe this reflects well both on the function and on management.
The Committee holds a private session with the Director of Group Audit 
Services without management present once a year. I also meet with the 
Director of Group Audit Services informally before each Committee 
meeting, without management present, in order to provide the 
opportunity for open and timely dialogue. Typically we discuss the 
quality and content of papers due for discussion with the Committee, 
emerging business risks, the quality of management engagement with 
Internal Audit and key internal audit findings and the associated response.
t h e 	 e f f e cti v e n e ss 	 o f 	i n t e r n a l 	 A u di t
Again this year we requested a review on the effectiveness of Internal 
Audit. The approach was consistent with the previous two years, 
covering the effectiveness of the function (positioning, processes, 
systems and people). Effectiveness was assessed both from an internal 
perspective (through an independent review of the function 
benchmarked against best practice) and from an external perspective 
(the perception of 12 senior financial personnel/senior management 
and seven Board members). We were pleased to note that the function 
continues to perform strongly.

r i s k 	 m a n a g e m e n t 	 f ra m ew or k
We recognise that a robust and effective system of internal control 
is critical to achieving reliable and consistent business performance. 
On behalf of the Board, we review the effectiveness of the risk 
management and control systems in relation to the key financial, 
operational and compliance controls. We noted continued focus and 
improvement in this area during the year. 
We also reviewed the key controls (preventative and detective) in  
place to identify and mitigate the risk of material misstatement due to 
non-compliance with laws and regulations per the Financial Reporting 
Council’s report (Audit Quality Thematic Review dated January 2014) 
and reviewed the risks to the business arising from fraud and the 
associated controls management have in place to minimise those risks.
We have seen continued improvement in the transparency and active 
ownership of risk and control management throughout the organisation, 
driven and supported by a strong tone at the top. We have noted the 
growing strength of the three lines of defence. Whilst we are pleased 
with the progress achieved, there remains much still to do and work in 
these areas will be ongoing in 2015. 
First 	 line 	 of 	 defence
Ma na ge me n t	
We continue to spend time with management below Board level in order 
to understand their concerns and the risks, controls and challenges in 
their respective business or functional areas. 
Local 	 compliance 	 func ti ons
We noted the continued investment in local compliance functions within 
our key businesses during the year, which will serve to strengthen 
the control environment closer to the front-end of businesses across 
the organisation.
Second 	 line 	 of 	 defence
Risk 	 Mana gement
We have noted the appetite of the Group Risk Management function 
to drive continuous improvement in the risk management competence 
and capability of the Group and the positive results that have been 
achieved in ensuring transparency, alignment and accountability through 
the organisation. We have received regular updates on the work of the 
Group Risk Management Committee and noted the quality of the risk 
discussions that have taken place during the year. 
While significant improvements have been made in the year, this will 
continue to be a strong area of focus during the coming year. 
Gr ou p 	 c o m p lia n ce 	
We noted the continued development and strengthening of the 
Group Compliance functions during this year. The Committee receives 
presentations from the three Group Compliance functions up to 
four times a year.
• Group Financial Compliance. Created in 2011 to provide assurance 
that individual company balance sheets across the Group are fairly 
stated and minimum financial controls are adhered to through a 
programme of site visit reviews to ensure that companies in the 
Group comply with existing financial reporting requirements. 
 – We received feedback on the individual visits, the ongoing 
programme of education, communication and independent 
validation of the financial minimum controls as well as feedback 
on quarterly self-assessment returns.
• Group Legal & Regulatory Compliance. Created in January 2012 
to identify, assess and respond to legal and regulatory risk across 
the Group. 76 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

R e-appointment 	 of 	 ex ternal 	 auditors
Based on the results of our annual review, and our experience during 
the year, we have recommended to the Board the re-appointment of 
the external auditors (who have been our auditors for four years). In the 
event that the merger with TUI AG does not complete, we will continue 
to review the performance of PwC formally on an annual basis and, 
although not required by the UK Code to undertake a formal tender 
process until 2020, will continue, during this remaining six-year period, to 
keep this under close review in the best interests of our shareholders.
n o n-a u di t 	 se r v i ces
The Audit Committee has developed the Company’s policy on the 
engagement of the auditors to supply non-audit services and has 
sought to ensure that the provision of such services does not impair 
the independence and objectivity of the Company’s external auditors. 
We have achieved this by considering the Auditing Practices Board 
Ethical Standard Number 5 (revised). This relates to non-audit services 
provided to audited entities and sets out six principal threats to 
objectivity and independence, for example, the auditors cannot act as 
management nor audit their own work. We have reviewed, monitored 
and approved, where appropriate, the nature and extent of non-audit 
services provided by the Company’s external auditor and are satisfied 
that their independence and objectivity has not been compromised. 
We have also reviewed the fees (both individually and in aggregate 
relative to the audit fee) and management’s compliance with the 
approval thresholds set out in the Company’s non-audit services policy.
We acknowledge that, in some circumstances, the external auditors’ 
understanding of the business can be beneficial in improving the 
efficiency and effectiveness of advisory work and, therefore, it has 
been considered appropriate that the external auditors be engaged.
A summary of the policy is given below:
• non-audit fees are capped in any one year to no more than the audit 
fee itself; 
• routine tax compliance and advisory services may be provided up to 
a pre-approved maximum of £1m in any one financial year, subject 
to the overall cap noted above;
• any engagement where the value is expected to exceed £100,000, 
but be less than £250,000, should be pre-approved by the Chairman 
of the Audit Committee; and
• engagements at or above £250,000, must be pre-approved by the 
Audit Committee.
In total £1.9m was spent on non-audit fees during the year (being 28% 
of audit and audit related fees). Fees in respect of the merger with  
TUI AG are being borne by that company. Further details of non-audit 
services are set out in Note 7. Significant expenditure that was 
authorised in the year, i.e. £250,000 or over, is outlined below:

We received updates during the year on the arrangements by which the 
business encourages feedback from management and employees on 
instances of potential impropriety. This included presentations from 
Group Legal on the development of the whistle-blowing hotlines across 
the Group (including number of calls, issues and benchmarking against 
other named companies), from Group Finance on the development 
of HOT principles (Honesty, Openness and Transparency) and the 
communication thereof via the Finance Academy.

Again this year we requested a review of the effectiveness of external 
audit although, this year, we adopted a new survey. This survey was 
completed by 13 senior financial personnel and senior management 
closely involved in the year-end reporting process and four members of 
the Audit Committee and a shorter survey was completed by operating 
business FDs and Group department heads. The surveys covered three 
key areas – the robustness of the audit process, the quality of delivery 
and the quality of people and service. Questions related to professional 
scepticism, integrity and competence, understanding of the business 
risks, issues and their impact, the clarity and appropriateness of the 
audit strategy, the efficiency and effectiveness of audit delivery, 
constructive relationships and control recommendations, good 
judgement and clear and timely communication. Overall, the survey 
results were positive about PwC’s performance. We noted that all of 
the key actions identified from the previous year’s review had been 
addressed. Some further areas for improvement were identified during 
this year’s review and we will assess progress against these in 2015. 
In addition, we also noted the results of the Audit Quality Review Team 
(part of the Financial Reporting Council) assessment of the effectiveness 
of PwC relative to its peers as well as PwC’s own transparency report. 
Details of fees payable to the auditors and its associates are given in 
Note 7. Further information in respect of non-audit services is given 
on the right.
Audit 	 plan 	 and 	 appr oa ch
During the year we reviewed PwC’s benchmarking of our organisation’s 
audit risks relative to the FTSE 100 and the audit strategy developed 
as a result. We noted the risk-based audit approach, key areas of audit 
focus, materiality and the audit plan produced as a result. The annual 
plan takes account of size, complexity and the control environment of 
individual businesses as well as the overall coverage split by revenue, 
absolute EBITA and absolute net assets. We welcomed PwC’s 
assessment that the risk of material misstatement in the Group accounts 
has reduced over the last two years but we noted and agreed with their 
continued emphasis on substantive as opposed to controls testing.
The Committee holds a private session with the Lead Partner without 
management present once a year immediately prior to the publication 
of the year-end accounts. In addition I meet with the Lead Partner on 
a regular basis throughout the year to provide the opportunity for open 
communication and the free flow of any concerns relating both to the 
openness, transparency and general engagement of management with 
the audit process as well as to understand PwC’s assessment of key 
judgements as they arise.

Vladimir Yakushev was appointed to the Board as a Non-Executive 
Director on 7 February 2014. Vladimir was the managing partner of 
S-Group Capital Management (S-Group) – the Company’s joint venture 
partner in Russia – and it was felt that his background, knowledge and 
skills in the Russian market would enhance the geographical diversity of 
the Board. He was not considered to be independent on appointment. 
Following his resignation from S-Group, he resigned from the Board on 
24 March 2014 having not attended any meetings.
As mentioned above, Harold Sher retired from the Board on 
18 September 2014, having also joined at the time of the merger in 
2007. The Board will miss his wise counsel and valued contribution 
over the last seven years and wish him a long and happy retirement. 
c o m positi o n 	 of 	 th e 	c o m m it tee
As at 30 September 2014, the Committee comprised three Independent 
Non-Executive Directors and one Shareholder Director (the latter 
being appointed in accordance with the Relationship Agreement). 
The Chairman is Sir Michael Hodgkinson (Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director) and the other members are Minnow Powell 
(Independent), Val Gooding (Independent) and Friedrich Joussen 
(Shareholder). Harold Sher (Independent) was also a member of 
the Committee until his retirement on 18 September 2014.
K e y 	 o b j ec tiv es
• To identify, evaluate and recommend candidates for appointment 
as directors;
• To ensure that the Board has the right balance of skills, mix of 
knowledge and experience; and
• To review and contribute to the talent management strategy for 
the Board, its Committees and senior managers in order to attract 
a highly-qualified and diverse workforce.
The Committee’s main focus is to strengthen, balance and understand 
the range of skills, experience and diversity of the Board, its Committees 
and key roles below Board level.
During the year the composition of the Board and its Committees 
has been refreshed. Val Gooding was appointed as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director with effect from 7 February 2014. She was 
also appointed to both the Audit and Remuneration Committees on 
1 July 2014 and the Nomination Committee on 18 September 2014. 
We are pleased that female representation on the Board is now at 23% 
(2013: 13%). It had been the Board’s intention to refresh its membership 
further by the end of 2014 but, because of the merger with TUI AG, this 
has been put on hold for the time being. In addition, the recruitment 
process for replacing Harold Sher, following his retirement as a Director 
on 18 September 2014, has also been postponed.
Appo i ntm ent s 	 a n d 	 r esi gna ti o ns 	 d u ri n g 	 th e 	 y ea r
On 16 December 2013 there were two resignations from the Board – 
Volker Böttcher (Executive Director) and Tony Campbell (Independent 
Non-Executive Director). Volker joined the Board of TUI Travel following 
the merger between First Choice Holidays PLC and the Tourism Division 
of TUI AG in 2007. He was the Managing Director of the Group’s German 
Specialist Division and, prior to that, held a number of senior roles 
including Managing Director, Central Europe. Volker resigned from the 
Company to pursue a career in the field of academia. Tony Campbell 
also joined the Board following the merger in 2007. His wealth of 
knowledge and experience in retailing/online distribution was greatly 
valued and his input in the Board’s deliberations will be missed. 
In relation to the appointment of Val Gooding, an extensive search of 
suitable candidates was carried out by an independent external agency 
– The Miles Partnership – which has no other connection with the 
Company. Prior to commencing the interview process the balance of 
skills, experience, independence, diversity, the working of the Board as 
a unit and its collective knowledge had been taken into consideration 
when preparing a description of the role and capabilities required. 
Consideration was also given to whether candidates would have 
sufficient time available to devote to their duties. The Committee 
concluded that Val was an excellent candidate and would contribute 
significantly to the Board’s deliberations because of her wide breadth 
of experience in executive and non-executive positions over many years. 
It was also concluded that Val was independent in both character and 
judgement and therefore met the independence criteria laid out in the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. Following a review 
of her other commitments, it was felt that she would have sufficient 
time to devote to her duties.

Our diversity objectives were agreed in 2012 and these were considered 
again at the September 2014 meeting and confirmed as detailed below:
• To achieve at least 25% female representation among the Board’s 
membership by 2015;
• To ensure that at least half of the initial applicant pool for Board 
appointments consists of women;
• To engage executive search firms who have signed up to the 
voluntary Code of Conduct on gender diversity and best practice;
• To report annually against these objectives and other initiatives 
taking place within the Company which promote gender, 
international, ethnic and other forms of diversity; and
• To report annually on the outcome of the Board evaluation, the 
composition and structure of the Board as well as any issues and 
challenges the Board is facing when considering the diverse 
make-up of the Company.
As at 30 September 2014, the percentage of female representation 
among the Board’s membership was 23% accounting for three of 
13 Directors (2013: 13%). When making new appointments, the Board 
is committed to seeking directors with the right skillsets and gender 
balance in line with the 25% aspiration.

During the year two new appointments were made to the Board – 
Val Gooding and Vladimir Yakushev (although the latter subsequently 
resigned on 24 March 2014 and did not attend any Board meetings).
Four meetings of the Nomination Committee took place – in October 
and December 2013 and in March and September 2014. The following 
matters were considered:
Oc tober 	 20 1 3 :	
The Committee spent a considerable amount of time reviewing the 
individual skillsets of Board members to enable us to ascertain where 
there could be gaps – either now or in the future. Following this debate, 
the Directors’ biographies were updated – see page ●64 for full details. 
A more robust process was also agreed particularly in respect of the 
recruitment of Independent Non-Executive Directors.
December 	 20 1 3 :	
The appointments of Val Gooding and Vladimir Yakushev as additional 
Non-Executive Directors were approved.
Mar ch 	 20 1 4:	
Additional three-year terms for Minnow Powell and Coline McConville 
were approved. 
Specific guiding principles for the recruitment process relating to 
Independent Non-Executive Directors and Executive Directors were 
considered and approved. For Independent Non-Executive Directors 
this included:
• the use of executive search consultants who have signed up to the 
voluntary Code of Conduct on gender diversity and best practice; 
• matters to take into account when preparing a role profile; and 
• consideration of succession planning for Independent Non-Executive 
Directors as part of the annual talent/succession planning review. 
For Executive Directors, the Committee agreed to improve the 
Non-Executive Directors’ visibility of senior executive succession 
planning and leadership development.
September 	 20 1 4:	
Talent management and succession planning for key senior management 
roles was reviewed. The focus was on a structured approach to 
performance and the development of talented individuals. It had 
been the intention to consider the refreshment of the Independent 
Non-Executive Directors at this meeting but, in view of the merger, 
this was postponed as detailed above.

I am pleased to introduce the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the 
year ended 30 September 2014.
Dir e c t o rs ’ 	 R e m u n e rati o n 	 P o li c y
Last year, we made a number of changes to our Executive Director 
remuneration framework. These were set out in our Remuneration 
Policy Report, which was subject to a binding vote at our 2014 AGM. 
As a Committee, we were pleased with the level of support the Policy 
Report received and would like to thank our shareholders for this.
We are not proposing to make any changes for the year ending 
30 September 2015 and therefore the Policy approved last year will 
remain in force. For convenience, we have reproduced the Policy on 
pages 81 to 88.
I would like to highlight that the Policy relates to TUI Travel PLC and 
therefore we will remain subject to its provisions whilst we remain an 
independent Company. Once the merger with TUI AG completes, the 
Policy will cease to apply from the date of the merger onwards.
The aims of our policy are:
• to provide a package that is simple and transparent to shareholders;
• to link a substantial proportion of the total remuneration 
package to the achievement of demanding long-term financial 
performance targets;
• to provide an appropriate balance between fixed remuneration 
and variable performance-related reward;
• to align the Executive Directors’ interests with those of 
shareholders over the long term by building a significant 
shareholding in our business;
• to set the total remuneration package at a level that reflects 
the competitive markets in which the Group operates;
• to enable recruitment, retention and stability; and
• to reinforce a high-performance culture throughout the Group.
We believe that these principles are fundamental in ensuring that our 
remuneration framework is fit for purpose and provides an appropriate 
alignment between pay and performance.

t Ui	 A G 	 merger
Since the summer of 2014, the Committee has been busy considering 
the impact of the merger on senior management remuneration at TUI 
Travel. As part of these discussions, Sir Mike Hodgkinson, our Senior 
Independent Director, has met with a number of major shareholders 
to discuss their expectations regarding the merger, including from a 
remuneration perspective. We have listened to shareholders’ views 
and have fed these into our discussions, both internally and during our 
conversations with representatives of TUI AG.
Items of discussion for the Committee in relation to the merger included:
• the treatment of outstanding employee share awards;
• input to the TUI AG Supervisory Board regarding corporate 
governance expectations and remuneration arrangements for the 
Executive Directors under the combined Group; and
• communication with impacted TUI Travel individuals regarding the 
merger negotiations and any remuneration implications.
As a Committee, we are firmly of the view that no share awards should 
automatically vest as a result of the merger. As such, Performance Share 
Plan (PSP) and Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme (DABS) awards granted 
in 2012 and 2013 will remain outstanding and will continue in line with 
their original vesting timeframes and with performance conditions 
attached. Following completion, some performance conditions may 
need to be amended to ensure that the targets remain appropriate in 
the combined Group.
The 2011 DABS and PSP awards will vest in December 2014 in 
accordance with their original schedule.
Under the merger, the combined Group will be a German-domiciled 
company. During our discussions with TUI AG representatives we 
have provided input on UK institutional investor, advisory body and 
shareholder expectations regarding corporate governance best practice. 
As an example, the Committee notes the revised UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which was released by the Financial Reporting 
Council in September 2014 and applies to reporting years beginning 
on or after 1 October 2014. Following the year-end, we have been 
considering the implications of the changes, particularly in relation to 
clawback provisions. We recognise the importance of companies being 
able to recover amounts which have been paid out where it becomes 
clear that they should not have been, and we have discussed potential 
approaches for TUI Travel, which would augment our current malus 
provisions. TUI AG is currently considering the framework for senior 
management remuneration, and this will include discussions around 
the potential inclusion of clawback provisions.

Remuneration Committee
continued
The Remuneration Report for the financial year ended 30 September 
2014 has been prepared on behalf of the Board by the Remuneration 
Committee (the Committee). The report has been compiled taking into 
account the Listing Rules of the Financial Conduct Authority, the relevant 
sections of the Companies Act 2006 and the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 
(as amended). The Committee adopts the principles of good governance 
as set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code. 
This report will be subject to one vote at the AGM on 10 February 2015 
– an advisory vote in relation to the statement by the Remuneration 
Committee Chairman and the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Gr oup 	 Mana gement 	 Board 	 r e view
Following the review of Executive Director remuneration in 2013, 
we have extended the framework across the full Group Management 
Board (GMB). In aligning remuneration arrangements across our senior 
team, we have adopted a consistent approach to remuneration at the 
top of our business. This policy focuses the senior management team 
on key measures of business performance, ensuring that all individuals 
are focused on the same corporate goals.
v olk er 	 Böt tcher
During the year we considered the arrangements for Volker Böttcher, 
who stood down from the TUI Travel PLC Board as an Executive Director 
on 16 December 2013. He remains employed within the TUI Travel PLC 
group of companies until 31 December 2014. 
P ay 	 o utco m es 	 i n 	 th e 	 y ea r 	 end ed 	 3 0 	 Septem ber 	 2 0 1 4
The Company has continued to perform strongly, led by the executive 
team, and the remuneration received for the year ended 30 September 
2014 recognises this strong performance.
We have delivered another year of out-performance against our 
growth roadmap achieving:
• an underlying operating profit growth of 11% on a constant 
currency basis;
• record customer satisfaction level of 79% maintained across our 
key markets; 
• free cash flow increase of 12% on a constant currency basis; and
• an available net cash position (cash and cash equivalents less loans, 
overdrafts and finance leases, excluding restricted cash) of £371m.
As a result annual bonus payouts for Executive Directors reflect 
strong performance against financial targets and their individual 
personal objectives. 
2011 DABS and PSP awards are due to vest in full in December 2014. 
For context, over the performance period of these awards, we have 
delivered strong EPS growth and our market capitalisation has risen 
from under £2bn to well over £4bn. This has resulted in excellent value 
creation for shareholders and we believe the reward for Executive 
Directors fairly reflects these achievements.
Lo o ki n g 	 a h ea d 	 to 	 th e 	 y ea r 	 end i n g 	 3 0 	 Septem ber 	 2 0 1 5
As highlighted above, we will continue to operate under our approved 
Remuneration Policy until the merger completes.
In line with the Executive Directors’ Remuneration Policy salaries were 
reviewed on 1 October 2014. No revisions were made. Benefits, pension 
provisions and opportunities under the annual bonus are unchanged.
At this stage, it is not currently planned to make any further TUI Travel 
PSP awards to Executive Directors, although this position may change 
if the merger is cancelled or substantially delayed.
On behalf of the Committee I thank you for your support and trust 
that you find the Remuneration Report informative.

Directors’ Remuneration Policy
This section sets out the Policy which was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 6 February 2014. The Policy applies to any remuneration and 
loss of office payments made on or after 1 October 2014.
e x e cutiv e 	 D i r ec to rs’ 	 F utu r e 	 P o l i c y 	t a bl e
e l em en t B a s e 	 s al ar y
Purpose and link to strategy Set at levels to attract and retain Executive Directors of the high calibre required to develop and deliver the strategy.
To reflect the individual’s skills, experience and role within the Group.
Operation When determining salaries, the Committee typically takes into account:
• business and individual performance;
• salary levels at companies of a similar size, industry, global scope and complexity to TUI Travel PLC; and 
• the pay and conditions of employees elsewhere in the Group. 
Paid monthly in cash.
Salaries are generally reviewed annually in October, although an out-of-cycle review may be conducted  
if the Committee determines appropriate. A review will not necessarily lead to an increase in salary.
Maximum opportunity Salary increases will typically be in line with the general level of increase awarded to other employees in the Group.
In exceptional circumstances, at the Committee’s discretion, higher increases may be made. These could include:
• increase in the scope and/or responsibility of the individual’s role;
• development of the individual within the role; and/or 
• where a larger increase is considered necessary for the retention of an Executive Director.
Performance measures Individual and business performance are considerations in deciding salary levels.
e l em en t R e t i rem en t 	 b en e fi t s 	
Purpose and link to strategy To attract and retain Executive Directors of the right calibre.
To provide a market-competitive retirement benefit.
To reassure Executive Directors about their provision in retirement.
Operation Executive Directors can choose to participate in the relevant local defined contribution pension or receive a cash 
allowance or a combination thereof. 
William Waggott has deferred pension entitlements under the final salary section of the TUI Pension Scheme (UK). 
He ceased to be an active member on 3 September 2007. 
When appointing new Executive Directors, the Committee may apply alternative pension provisions. In such 
circumstances the Committee will consider a range of factors including cost, market practice and pension policy 
elsewhere in the Group.
Maximum opportunity The maximum Company contribution to an Executive Director’s pension (or equivalent cash allowance) may not  
exceed 50% of base salary.
Performance measures Not performance related.
e l em en t O t h e r 	 b e n e fi t s
Purpose and link to strategy To ensure broad competitiveness with market practice.
To support personal health and well-being.
Operation Benefits provision is set at an appropriate market level, taking into account the individual’s home jurisdiction, the 
jurisdiction in which the individual is based, market practice at similar companies and the level of benefits provided 
elsewhere in the Group.
The benefits to which Executive Directors are entitled include (but are not limited to) private medical insurance 
(for the individual and his family), life assurance, permanent health insurance, car provision/allowance, holiday travel 
concessions (up to an annual limit of £2,500) and interest-free loans.
Global relocation support (for up to five years) and any associated costs or benefits (including but not limited to 
housing benefits, personal tax advice and school fees) may also be provided if business needs require it. The Company 
may also provide tax equalisation arrangements.
The Committee may remove benefits that Executive Directors receive or introduce other benefits if considered 
appropriate to do so.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate, on the same basis as other employees, in the Company’s tax-advantaged 
Share Incentive Plan or any other all-employee share plan operated in the future.
Maximum opportunity The maximum level of benefits provided to an individual Executive Director may not exceed £70,000 per annum. 
In exceptional circumstances, at the Committee’s discretion, an exception to the above limit might be approved, 
e.g. where global relocation of an Executive Director is considered necessary to deliver business objectives.
Participation by Executive Directors in the Share Incentive Plan, and any other all-employee share plan operated 
in the future, is limited to the maximum award levels permitted by the relevant legislation.

Purpose and link to strategy To encourage and reward the attainment of challenging financial and strategic performance targets during an 
annual period.
The performance measures closely align to the strategy of the business and shareholder value creation.
The deferred element drives and rewards delivery of sustained long-term performance, aligns Executive Director 
and shareholder interests and supports retention.
Operation Performance is normally assessed over one financial year.
25% of any bonus paid must normally be deferred into shares under DABS for three years. Participants may either 
voluntarily choose to defer up to an additional 25% or the Committee may, in certain circumstances, determine that  
an additional 25% of the bonus should be deferred on a compulsory basis. 
As outlined in the Notes to this Table the last awards of matching shares under DABS were made in December 2013. 
The awards related to performance in the year ended 30 September 2013. These, and other previous DABS awards 
currently outstanding, will vest in subsequent years. The vesting of matching awards is subject to continued 
employment, achievement of performance conditions and compliance with the policy on payment for loss of office.
Dividend equivalent payments may be made equal to the amount of dividends that would have been payable during 
the period between the grant and vesting of an award.
Share awards are normally made in the form of nil-cost options but may be awarded in other forms if appropriate 
(such as conditional share awards). Nil-cost options may normally be exercised until the 10th anniversary of the date 
of grant. Awards may also be satisfied in cash and may be granted to a Director’s personal service company at the 
discretion of the Committee.
For bonuses awarded in respect of the year commencing 1 October 2014, and subsequently, malus provisions apply. 
These allow the Committee to cancel or reduce vesting of unvested awards in certain circumstances, including:
• a misstatement of results that resulted in a bonus or award being paid at too high a level;
• a material failure of risk management or health and safety;
• serious reputational damage to the Company; and/or
• personal misconduct.
The Committee may adjust and amend the terms of the awards in accordance with the plan rules.
Maximum opportunity The maximum bonus opportunity (as a percentage of salary) is up to 175% for the CEO and up to 140% for the 
other Executive Directors. 
The last award of DABS matching shares was made in December 2013. The award related to performance in  
the year ended 30 September 2013. The maximum multiple was a ratio of four matching shares to one deferred share. 
Performance measures A nnu a l 	 b o nu s
The annual bonus is based on a mix of financial and individual business objectives, with the majority of the weighting 
being given to financial metrics. 
• Financial performance-related measures (typically 75% to 85% of total) are chosen carefully to ensure a strong link 
between reward and underlying Company financial performance. As an example, these measures may typically 
include profit, cash flow or other measures as appropriate.
• Individual performance (15% to 25% of total) is measured through an assessment of comprehensive business 
deliverables, financial targets, personal performance and the achievement of specific individual objectives. 
The exact measures, weightings and targets are determined by the Committee each year taking into account the 
Group’s key strategic priorities and the approved budget for the year. 
A sliding scale between 0% and 100% of the maximum award applies for achievement between threshold and 
maximum performance under the bonus plan.  83 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Purpose and link to strategy To incentivise long-term value creation through the setting of stretching targets that ensure a strong link between 
reward, underlying Group financial performance and shareholder returns.
To support recruitment and retention.
Operation Awards are discretionary and normally vest subject to performance over a three-year performance period.
The vesting of awards is subject to continued employment or compliance with the policy on payment for loss of office.
Dividend equivalent payments may be made equal to the amount of dividends that would have been payable during 
the period between the grant and vesting of an award.
Share awards are normally made in the form of nil-cost options but may be awarded in other forms if appropriate (such 
as conditional share awards). Nil-cost options may normally be exercised until the 10th anniversary of the date of grant. 
Awards may also be satisfied in cash and may be granted to a Director’s personal service company at the discretion of 
the Committee.
For awards made in respect of the year commencing 1 October 2014, malus provisions apply. These allow the Committee 
to cancel or reduce vesting of unvested awards in certain circumstances including:
• a misstatement of results that led to the award being granted at too high a level;
• a material failure of risk management or health and safety;
• serious reputational damage to the Company; and/or
• personal misconduct.
The Committee may adjust and amend the terms of the awards in accordance with the plan rules.
Maximum opportunity The maximum award opportunity under the PSP is 400% of salary in any financial year. 
It is currently envisaged that awards will be made of up to an operational limit of 300% of salary, although a larger 
award may be made in exceptional circumstances. The Committee also retains power to increase the operational limit 
to up to the maximum plan limit without shareholder approval if it considers it appropriate to do so, in which case the 
Committee will aim to engage with shareholders.
Performance measures Awards vest based on performance against EPS (as defined in the plan rules), relative TSR and ROIC measures over  
a three-year period.
Normally, these will be broadly weighted as below, although the Committee may vary the precise weightings, as well 
as setting the specific targets for each measure as appropriate to reflect business and strategic priorities.
• EPS – 50%
• Relative TSR – 25%
• ROIC – 25%
To ensure that the PSP awards vest only when shareholder value is being created, awards will be subject to the 
achievement of an initial financial performance hurdle. This will normally be based on a return on capital measure. 
Failure to achieve this hurdle will usually result in none of the award vesting.
Should the hurdle be achieved, vesting for threshold performance will be up to, but no more than, 15% of the 
maximum award opportunity.
If events happen that cause the Committee to determine that the performance conditions are no longer a fair measure 
of the Company’s performance, the Committee can amend the conditions as it determines to be appropriate, with due 
regard to the best interests of shareholders.

Legacy matters
The Committee reserves the right to make remuneration payments 
and payments for loss of office (including the exercise of any discretions 
available to the Committee in connection with such payments) that fall 
outside the Policy where the terms of the payment were agreed before 
the Policy came into effect or at a time when the relevant individual was 
not a Director of the Company and the payment was not in consideration 
for the individual becoming a Director of the Company. 
For these purposes, payments include the Committee satisfying awards 
of variable remuneration and, in relation to an award over shares, the 
terms of the payment agreed at the time the award was granted. The 
share awards under the PSP and DABS held by the Executive Directors 
which were granted, or which are anticipated to be, prior to the Policy 
coming into effect are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Matching shares
The last award of DABS matching shares was made in December 2013. 
The award related to performance in the year ended 30 September 
2013. The maximum multiple was a ratio of four matching shares to 
one deferred share. These and other previous DABS awards that are 
currently outstanding will vest in subsequent years.
Matching awards are subject to performance measured over a three-
year period. The framework used for assessing performance is the same 
as that for PSP awards. If events happen that cause the Committee to 
determine that any target is no longer a fair measure of the Company’s 
performance, the Committee can amend the target if considered 
appropriate, with due regard to the best interests of shareholders.
Selection of performance measures – annual bonus
The Committee will choose annual bonus performance measures and 
targets which will provide an appropriate balance between incentivising 
Executive Directors to achieve financial targets for the year and driving 
the delivery of specific business deliverables, strategic objectives and 
personal goals.
Selection of performance measures – PSP
The Company aims to create sustainable long-term shareholder value. 
To encourage and reward this, the Company aims to align performance 
measures under the PSP with the strategy of the business and set 
stretching targets, achievement of which it considers should result in 
long-term value creation. In particular:
• financial performance measures – a direct measure of business health, 
reflecting the strength of our underlying financial performance. We 
take into account a number of internal and external reference points 
to ensure that targets are appropriately stretching; and
• share price performance measures – the most focused indicator of 
our ultimate delivery of shareholder returns and intended to promote 
alignment between investors and Executive Directors. Targets are 
set taking into account a number of factors, including reference to 
typical market practice. They are set at a level which the Committee 
considers represents stretching performance. 84 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Deferred bonus awards not subject to performance measures
No further performance measures apply to deferred share awards 
granted under the DABS as these represent the deferral of annual 
bonus amounts that have already been earned.

The Board aims to recruit high-calibre Non-Executive Directors, with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience. The remuneration 
policy for Non-Executive Directors (with the exception of the Chairman) is set by the Board having taken account of the fees paid in other companies 
of a similar size and complexity and the limits set by the Articles of Association. The policy for the Chairman is determined by the Committee (of 
which the Chairman is not a member). When recruiting Non-Executive Directors, the remuneration arrangements offered will generally be in line 
with those set out in the Non-Executive Directors’ Future Policy Table.
A p p ro ac h 	 t o 	 s e t t ing 	 fe e s B a s i s 	 o f 	 fe e s O t he r 	 i t e m s
Fees are set at an appropriate level to attract 
and retain high-calibre Non-Executive Directors. 
Fees are reviewed at appropriate intervals 
taking into account the time commitment 
expected and practice in peer companies  
of a similar size, sector and complexity.
Each Non-Executive Director is paid a basic 
fee for undertaking Non-Executive Director 
and Board duties. A higher fee is typically 
paid to the Chairman of the Board and the 
Deputy Chairman. 
Additional fees may also be paid for taking 
on Committee responsibilities and other 
Board duties. 
The maximum aggregate fees for all Non-
Executive Directors allowed by the Company’s 
Articles of Association is £1.5m. 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees are not subject  
to claw-back or withholding arrangements.
The Non-Executive Directors do not participate 
in the annual bonus or long-term incentive plans 
and do not receive any pension benefits. 
The Group provides each Non-Executive 
Director with relevant liability insurance  
for the duration of their appointment. 
Non-Executive Directors receive holiday 
concessions. The maximum annual value is 
£2,500. There are currently no other benefits 
provided to Non-Executive Directors. However, 
the Board may introduce additional benefits 
if it is considered appropriate to do so.

We have a strong track record of succession planning and growing and 
promoting talent internally. 
P r in cip les
When hiring a new Executive Director, or promoting to the Board from 
within the Group, the Committee will offer a package that is sufficient 
to retain and motivate and, if relevant, attract the right talent whilst 
at all times aiming to pay no more than is necessary. In determining 
an appropriate remuneration package, the Committee will take into 
consideration all relevant factors, including, but not limited to, the impact 
on other existing remuneration arrangements, the candidate’s location 
and experience, external market influences and internal pay relativities.
Typically, the new appointment will be in line with, or be transitioned 
onto, the policy as set out in the Executive Directors’ Future Policy 
Table. Following any Executive Director recruitment the Committee 
will include the rationale for the arrangements offered in the next 
Remuneration Report.
c o m po n e nt s 	 a n d 	 a ppr oa ch
The package offered to a new Executive Director will typically include 
those elements listed within the Executive Directors’ Future Policy Table. 
In certain circumstances, the Committee may use other elements if it 
considers it appropriate to do so with due regard to the best interests 
of the shareholders. In particular, in considering its approach, the 
Committee will take into account factors which include, but are not 
limited to, typical market practice, existing arrangements for other 
Executive Directors, internal relativities and market positioning.
R e m u n era ti o n 	 a rra n g em ent s 	 a cr oss 	 th e 	 Gr o u p
Our reward philosophy is consistent across the Group, namely that 
reward should support our business strategy and be sufficient to attract 
and retain high-performing individuals. Only success is rewarded. Within 
this framework, there are differences for a range of reasons, including 
global location and the local talent market. 
• Salaries and benefits – a range of factors are considered including 
business and individual performance, the pay of other employees 
and external market data. 
• Annual bonus – consistent with the policy for Executive Directors, 
annual bonuses across the Group are typically linked to local 
business performance with a focus on underlying profit growth  
and performance against key strategic business objectives. Key 
management team members may also receive some of their annual 
bonus in shares which have to be deferred for three years, in line 
with the policy for Executive Directors.
• PSP – a small number of senior executives who provide significant 
strategic input may be invited to participate in the PSP in any year.
• All Employee Share Plans – a tax-advantaged Share Incentive Plan is 
open to all UK eligible employees (including Executive Directors) on 
the same terms, giving them the opportunity to become 
shareholders in the Company. Participation in a global plan may  
be offered in the future.

Where expatriate appointments are made, the Committee may consider 
providing additional benefits where considered appropriate and in the 
Company’s best interests to do so.
In exceptional circumstances the Committee may, at its discretion, 
offer a service contract that contains a longer initial notice period, 
tapering down to 12 months over a set period of time, if it is deemed 
to be in the best interests of our shareholders.
B uy - o ut s
The Committee may make awards on hiring an external candidate 
to ‘buy-out’ forfeited remuneration arrangements. In doing so, the 
Committee will typically take account of relevant factors including any 
performance conditions attached to these awards, the form in which 
they were awarded (e.g. cash or shares) and the time over which they 
would have vested. Generally it is the Committee’s intention that 
the buy-out of awards will be made on a comparable basis to those 
forfeited and will be share-based.
In determining whether it is appropriate to offer a buy-out, the 
Committee will ensure that any awards are made in the best interests 
of both the Company and its shareholders and will give due regard 
to all relevant factors.
Maximum 	 le v el 	 of 	 variable 	 pa y
The maximum level of variable pay which may be awarded to new 
Executive Directors is limited to 575% of salary. This excludes any 
buy-out awards. 
For an internal appointment, any variable pay element awarded in 
respect of the previous role may either continue on its original terms 
or be adjusted to reflect the new appointment.
It is appropriate for the Committee to have discretion to make additional 
one-off cash or share-based awards to Executive Directors in order for 
the Committee to be able to respond in exceptional and unexpected 
circumstances. The Company will make full disclosure of any such awards 
made, including the rationale, in the Company’s Directors’ Remuneration 
Report for the relevant financial year.

R e m u n e rati o n 	 P o li c y
Our remuneration arrangements have been designed so that a 
substantial proportion of pay is dependent on the achievement 
of stretching short and long-term performance targets.
As part of this process, the Committee reviews, on at least an annual 
basis, the impact of different performance scenarios on the potential 
reward opportunity and pay-outs to be received by the Executive 
Directors. The charts show hypothetical values of the remuneration 
package for Executive Directors in post on 30 September 2014 under 
three assumed performance scenarios:
• Minimum performance (i.e. fixed elements of pay only, with no 
bonus pay-out or vesting of long-term incentives).
• Performance in line with expectations (assuming 50% pay-out 
under the annual bonus and threshold performance under the PSP, 
i.e. 10% vesting under the EPS element and 15% vesting under the 
TSR and ROIC elements).

Notes:
1. These illustrations of the application of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy show the 
potential reward opportunity for the Executive Directors from 1 October 2014 onwards 
(assuming PSP awards are made at the operational limit of 300% of salary).
2. Minimum performance. Fixed remuneration is comprised salary, standard benefits 
provision (company car or car allowance, medical insurance and holiday travel concessions 
based on maximum values for the year ended 30 September 2013) and employer pension 
contribution/allowance.
3.  Performance in line with expectations is comprised fixed remuneration, annual bonus at 50% 
of maximum performance levels and long-term incentives at threshold performance levels.
4.  Maximum performance is comprised fixed remuneration, annual bonus at maximum 
performance levels and long-term incentives at maximum performance levels.
5. All scenarios assume no share price appreciation during the vesting period. Therefore, 
depending on share price performance, the actual outcomes could be higher or lower.
6. All-employee share plans have been excluded, as have any legacy awards which 
Executive Directors may hold. 86 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Remuneration Committee
continued
D i r ec to rs’ 	 Ser vi ce 	 Agr eem ent s	
In line with best corporate practice for listed companies, the Committee’s 
policy is for Executive Directors to have rolling contracts with a 12-month 
notice period (although in some recruitment circumstances a longer 
notice period may be offered, tapering down to 12 months over a set 
period of time). 
The following table sets out a description of any obligations on the 
Company, contained in the UK Executive Directors’ service contracts, 
which could give rise to, or impact, remuneration payments or payments 
for loss of office.

Contractual entitlement to be considered for 
participation in the PSP and DABS, subject to the 
Company’s policy in relation to such schemes and 
to the approval of the Committee. 
R e t ire me n t 	 d at e There is no default retirement age. Requests  
for retirement are considered on a case-by-case 
basis. It is anticipated that at least 12 months’ 
notice will be provided, albeit that the contractual 
requirement on the part of an Executive Director 
to give notice is only six months.
t e r min at io n	 	
p ay m e n t s
The Director will be paid his salary and any other 
contractual benefits in respect of the relevant 
notice period. If the Director is placed on notice 
he may be eligible to be paid an annual bonus 
equivalent to 50% of the maximum amount that 
could have been awarded had he worked his notice.
The service contract for any new Executive Directors will not include 
any provision that is more generous than those listed above.
The obligations on the Company, which could give rise to, or impact, 
remuneration payments or payments for loss of office, contained in 
Volker Böttcher’s service contract are set out below. Dr Böttcher’s 
service contract is governed by German law.

end of the month in which he reaches the age of 63. 
t e r min at io n 	 	
p ay me n t s
If Dr Böttcher is placed on notice he may be eligible 
to be paid an annual bonus equivalent to at least 
50% of the maximum amount that could have been 
awarded had he worked his notice. The normal 
award required under German case law is the 
average of the previous three-years’ bonus awards.
The Company may also apply a non-compete 
clause. In such circumstances under the German 
Commercial Code Dr Böttcher would be entitled 
to 50% of the annual remuneration he last received 
in his role (including variable remuneration) as 
compensation. This would be paid in 12 monthly 
instalments and would be subject to mitigation. 
Compliance with the German Commercial Code  
is a legal obligation.
In a termination situation the Committee would 
strive to balance the interests of the Company 
with German legislative requirements.
Executive Directors are able to accept non-executive appointments 
outside the Company (as long as this does not lead to a conflict of 
interest) with the consent of the Board as such appointments can 
enhance their experience and add value to the Company. Any fees 
received (excluding positions where the Executive Director is appointed 
as the Company’s representative) are retained by the Executive Director.  87 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Executive Directors are entitled to 12 months’ base pay and contractual 
benefits if served notice by the Company. The Company is entitled 
to six months’ notice of termination by UK Executive Directors and 
12 months by Dr Böttcher. 
In the normal course of events, the Executive Director will work his 
notice period.
In the event of termination for cause (e.g. gross misconduct) neither 
notice nor payment in lieu of notice (PILON) will be given and the 
Executive Director will cease to perform his services immediately.
In the event of termination for other reasons than cause (e.g. resignation) 
and the individual being requested to cease working before the end 
of his notice period, PILON may be payable. If a portion of the notice 
period is served, the payment will be reduced on a pro-rata basis. 
Payments may be made on a phased basis and may be subject to 
mitigation. Alternatively, rather than making a PILON, the Company 
may instead place an Executive Director on garden leave for the 
duration of some or all of their notice period.
In redundancy situations the Committee will comply with prevailing 
relevant legislation. In addition, and consistent with market practice, 
the Company may pay a contribution towards the Executive Director’s 
legal fees for entering into a statutory agreement and may pay a 
contribution towards fees for outplacement services as part of a 
negotiated settlement. 
There is no provision for additional compensation on termination 
following a change of control nor liquidated damages of any kind. 
Payment may also be made in respect of accrued benefits, including 
untaken holiday entitlement.
Executive bonus and share-based schemes will be managed as follows:
The following table sets out a description of any obligations on the 
Company, contained in the letters of appointment of the Non-Executive 
Directors, which could give rise to, or impact on, remuneration payments 
or payments for loss of office:

All Executive Director service contracts and Non-Executive Director 
letters of appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office during normal hours of business, and will also be 
available at the Company’s AGM until the close of the meeting.
P o l i c y 	 o n 	 paym ent 	 f o r 	 l oss 	 of 	 of fice 	
We are committed to ensuring a consistent approach so that we do not 
pay more than is necessary. In the event of an early termination of a 
contract, the policy is to seek to minimise any liability. When managing 
such situations, the Committee takes a range of factors into account 
including contractual obligations, shareholder interests, organisational 
stability and the need to ensure an effective handover.
G oo d 	 l e ave r s O t he r 	 le ave r s
A nn u al 	 p e r for m an c e 	 b on u s The Committee considers it appropriate for 
the Company to have discretion regarding the 
payment of a full or partial bonus in termination 
scenarios. 
When determining whether an Executive 
Director is a good leaver, the Committee  
will consider contractual terms, personal 
performance, the generally accepted definition 
of a good leaver and other factors outlined 
below.
Unless the Committee exercises its discretion 
to treat the Executive Director as a good leaver, 
no bonus will be payable.
P SP 	 an d 	 m at c hing 	 aw ard s 	 un de r 	 t h e	
e x i s t i ng 	 D A B S
Participants will be a good leaver on ceasing 
employment due to injury, disability, ill-health, 
death, redundancy or the sale of the Company 
or business in which the participant is employed.
Awards held by good leavers will normally vest 
after three years pro-rated for time and subject 
to the relevant performance measures.
The Committee has discretion to accelerate vesting 
to the date employment ends. 
The Committee also has discretion to waive the 
time pro-rating requirement. 
Unvested awards will lapse in full where the 
termination is on grounds of gross misconduct.
In other circumstances unvested awards will 
lapse in full unless the Committee applies 
discretion to treat the Executive Director  
as a good leaver.
De f e r re d 	 A n n u al 	 B onu s 	 S c h e me 	 (D A B S )	 Unvested deferred share awards (which 
represent deferrals of earned bonus) vest in  
full on ceasing employment other than on 
grounds of gross misconduct either at the date 
of termination or on the normal vesting date,  
at the discretion of the Committee.
Unvested deferred share awards will lapse in full 
where the termination is on grounds of gross 
misconduct. 88 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Remuneration Committee
continued
In considering the exercise of discretion as set out above, the Committee 
will take into account all relevant circumstances. In doing so, factors that 
the Committee may take into account shall include, but not be limited to, 
considering the best interests of the Company, whether the Executive 
Director has presided over an orderly handover, the contribution of the 
Executive Director to the success of the Company during their tenure, 
the need to ensure continuity, the need to compromise any claims 
that the Executive Director may have, whether the Executive Director 
received a PILON payment and whether, had the Executive Director 
served out their notice, a greater proportion of the outstanding award 
may have vested. 
On a corporate event affecting the Company, the rules of the PSP and 
DABS, as approved at the AGM on 6 February 2014 apply. A corporate 
event will include:
• a takeover of the Company; 
• a company or a person, already having control, making a general 
offer to acquire shares in the Company; 
• a voluntary winding-up; and 
• under the rules of the new plans if the Board so determines, 
a de-merger or other similar event materially affecting the value 
of shares. 
In summary, awards under the PSP and matching awards under the 
DABS will vest subject to the performance conditions and, unless the 
Board determines otherwise, time pro-rating. Deferred awards under 
the DABS, which represent previously earned bonuses, will vest in full. 
On a variation of share capital, a de-merger, a sale of a substantial part 
of the Group’s business or similar event, the Committee may make such 
adjustment to awards as it considers appropriate.
In respect of the Share Incentive Plan, the same leaver conditions will 
be applied as those applied to all employees.
In the event of death in service, the arrangements for the Executive 
Directors provide lump sums for the purchase of dependants’ pensions 
of the greater of eight times salary or the value of the pension fund, 
in addition to which a lump sum of four times salary is payable. 
The Company may enter into new contractual arrangements with an 
Executive Director in connection with the termination of employment, 
including (but not limited to) settlement of claims, confidentiality, 
restrictive covenants and/or consultancy arrangements, where  
the Committee determines it necessary or appropriate to do so. 
Appropriate disclosure of any such arrangement will be made.
c o nsi d era ti o n 	 of 	 co nd iti o ns 	 else wh er e 	 i n 	 th e 	c o m pa n y
The Committee has oversight of the main compensation structures 
throughout the Group and actively considers the relationship between 
general changes to employees’ remuneration and Executive Director 
reward. When considering potential changes to Executive Director 
remuneration the Committee is provided with comparative employee 
information, (e.g. average salary reviews across the Group).
The Committee does not consider it appropriate to consult directly with 
employees when formulating Executive Director reward policy. However, 
it does take into account information provided by the Group HR Director 
and feedback from our global employee satisfaction survey, which 
includes questions about remuneration.
c o nsi d e rati o n 	 o f 	 sha r e h o l d e r 	 v i ews
The Committee is strongly committed to an open and transparent 
dialogue with shareholders on remuneration matters. We believe that 
it is important to meet regularly with our key shareholders to understand 
their views on our remuneration arrangements and discuss our approach 
going forward. 
The Committee will continue to engage with shareholders going forward 
and will aim to consult on any material changes to the application of the 
approved Policy or proposed changes to the Policy. 
The Committee may make minor changes to the Policy that do not 
have a material advantage to Executive Directors without seeking 
shareholder approval.
Additional Information
The following points are included for ease of reference. 
A statement regarding the Directors’ Remuneration Policy was 
published on the Company’s website on 22 January 2014. The page 
numbers refer to the Annual Report and Accounts for the year 
ended 30 September 2013.
Service contracts
As set out on page 86, under the terms of their existing service 
contracts, the three UK-based Executive Directors may be eligible to 
receive an annual bonus equivalent to 50% of the maximum amount 
that could have been awarded had they worked their notice period.  
As has previously been communicated to shareholders, this is a legacy 
issue contained within current contracts and will not be incorporated in 
service contracts for new appointments. In a payment in lieu of notice 
situation, contractual termination arrangements for new appointments 
will be restricted to salary and contractual benefits during the relevant 
notice period.
Recruitment policy
On page 85, we stated that the Committee’s intention is for the 
maximum level of variable pay to be limited to 575% of salary, 
representing the current maximum opportunity under the annual bonus 
and PSP. In addition, it was considered appropriate for the Committee 
to have discretion to make further one-off cash, or share-based awards, 
to Executive Directors on recruitment to enable the Committee to 
respond in exceptional and unexpected circumstances. The Committee 
considered that this was in the best interests of the Company and our 
shareholders, allowing it to retain flexibility to act appropriately in a 
commercial recruitment situation.
Following discussions with shareholder representatives, in order to 
provide additional comfort in how our recruitment policy will operate, 
the Committee has agreed that the total maximum level of variable 
remuneration which may be offered in a recruitment event will be 
limited in all cases to 725% of base salary (excluding buy-out awards).
We reiterate that, other than in truly exceptional and unexpected 
circumstances, we would continue to expect variable pay on 
recruitment not to exceed 575% of salary (excluding buy-outs). 89 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Notes
1. Benefits for the year ended 30 September 2014 include (where used) holiday travel concessions.
2. Annual bonus figures include cash and the proportion that is deferred for at least three years. The deferred element is not subject to performance conditions.
3. In accordance with the relevant legislation the anticipated value of the DABS and PSP shares that vested on 10 December 2013 was estimated in the Annual Report for the year ended  
30 September 2013 using a share price of 365.00p, this being the three-month average for the year ended 30 September 2013. The actual share price at the date of vesting was 378.30p. 
4. The anticipated value of the DABS and PSP shares that will vest for the three-year period ended 30 September 2014 has been calculated using a share price of 372.54p, this being the 
three-month average up to 30 September 2014.
5. Awards vest after the approval of the financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2014 and such awards relate to a performance period ending on the same date as those 
financial statements. Therefore, the figures in the 2014 DABS and 2014 PSP columns relate to awards that will vest in December 2014.
6. Dr Böttcher stood down from the Board as an Executive Director on 16 December 2013. Each element that comprises his single total figure of remuneration is pro-rated and covers the 
period 1 October to 16 December 2013. Dr Böttcher’s salary was revised on 1 October 2013 to €400,000 (previously €545,000). In line with the Directors’ Remuneration Policy published 
last year, and as required by German case law, his bonus payment for the year ended 30 September 2014 is equivalent to the average of his previous three-years’ bonus awards i.e. 
€578,441. In accordance with the rules of the PSP and DABS, Dr Böttcher will be a good leaver with respect to his awards. 
7. Dr Böttcher is paid in EUR. Payments in the table above have been converted at 1.1896 to 1 GBP, being the average exchange rate for the period 1 October 2013 to 31 December 2013.
Alignment of pay with performance
The remuneration policy at TUI Travel places substantial emphasis on 
variable pay. The Committee considers that this is aligned with the 
best interests of shareholders and ensures that Executive Directors 
will only receive significant remuneration for exceptional performance.
Over the last three years, the Company has continued to perform 
strongly, led by the executive team. For example, we have delivered 
excellent EPS growth over this period, and this has driven strong 
share price performance. This has resulted in our market capitalisation 
increasing from under £2bn to well over £4bn over these three years. 
We consider that the remuneration received for the year ended 
30 September 2014 recognises the management team’s continued 
excellent performance. For example, for Peter Long:
• 90% of his total remuneration was delivered in variable pay; and
• Of this variable amount, over half was directly due to the significant 
increase in our share price over the last three years.
This demonstrates the strong alignment of our Directors’ packages 
with the shareholder experience.

Benefits (excluding pension)
Benefits incorporate tax assessable benefits arising from the 
individual’s employment.
• Peter Long. Car/car allowance, private healthcare cover and holiday 
travel concessions.
• Johan Lundgren. Car/car allowance, private healthcare cover, holiday 
travel concessions and school fees (£42,760). 
• William Waggott. Car/car allowance, private healthcare cover and

Retirement benefits
Total pension contributions or allowances accrued to the year ended 
30 September 2014 were £856,000. Payments totalling £1,037,000 
have been made as at the date of this report. These payments include 
contributions for the year ended 30 September 2013 which were accrued 
but not paid at the date of the 2013 Annual Report and Accounts.
William Waggott has deferred pension entitlements under the Final 
Salary section of the TUI Pension Scheme (UK). He ceased to be an 
active member on 3 September 2007 and therefore did not accrue 
further benefits during the year. The accrued benefits including 
deferred revaluation to 30 September 2014 are a pension of £63,879 per 
annum, payable from age 62. The transfer value as at 30 September 
2014 calculated on the current basis is £1,594,633. The transfer value 
as at 30 September 2013 calculated on the basis in force at that time 
was £1,402,198. The only change in accrued benefits over the financial 
year is another year of deferred revaluation (fixed at 5% per annum). 
The accrued benefits at the start of the year were £60,837 per annum 
so there has been an increase in pension of £3,042 over the year. No 
contributions were made in the year ended 30 September 2014.
Entitlement under the Executive Directors’ pension arrangements 
is not enhanced in an early retirement situation.
Annual bonus
The annual bonus is driven by the achievement of Group, business 
and individual targets which are weighted for each Executive Director. 
For the year ended 30 September 2014 the achievement of financial 
targets represented up to 80% of the bonus awarded with the balance 
being determined by the achievement of individual objectives. 
The financial element is weighted to the achievement of profit and cash 
targets. These are set by the Committee annually with reference to the 
Company’s five-year strategic plan, analyst profit forecasts and cash 
flow performance. The targets are designed to be stretching, drive 
improved results and align delivery with shareholders’ expectations. 
The individual business objectives were determined with consideration 
to the strategic goals set for each Executive Director by the Board. 
Performance against these objectives was reviewed by the Committee 
against quantifiable individual performance metrics. Further information 
regarding these targets can be found under each graph.
As reported earlier the Company has had a successful year and this 
is reflected in the level of bonus awards. 
We have delivered underlying profit of £654m and free cash flow of 
£477m (both at constant currency rates). These represent growth of 
11% and 12%, respectively from last year delivering maximum financial 
performance. We remain confident of delivering on our five-year 
annualised target of 7-10% underlying operating profit growth at 
constant currency rates.
The specific financial targets under the annual bonus are considered by 
the Committee to be commercially sensitive, although the Committee 
keeps this position under review and aims to provide shareholders with 
as much context as possible as to how the performance outcomes are 
aligned with the remuneration received by Directors.

Under the DABS, up to 50% of each Executive Director’s annual 
performance bonus will be deferred. Due to the practical implications 
of the merger, it is currently expected that DABS awards to be made 
in December 2014 will be made as cash-settled awards over notional 
shares on materially the same terms as the scheme rules. In line with 
the policy communicated to shareholders last year, no matching DABS 
awards will be made in respect of the year ended 30 September 2014. 91 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Long-term incentives
The vesting of the matching shares element of DABS and PSP awards 
is subject to achievement of the following performance conditions over 
the three-year performance period and continued employment.
The Committee assesses the Earnings Per Share (EPS) and the 
Return on Invested Capital (ROIC) tests based on audited information. 
Independent calculations of Total Shareholder Return (TSR) 
performance for outstanding awards are performed by Deloitte.
Following our strong performance over the last three years the 
performance conditions attached to the Deferred Annual Bonus 
Scheme (DABS) and Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards made 
on 7 December 2011 were achieved in full and these awards will vest 
on 8 December 2014. 
Performance measures 
M e a s u re t arget Re s u l t Weig ht ing
A performance hurdle of ROIC requiring ROIC to be on average at least equal to WACC. This condition was achieved.
Growth in the Company’s EPS  
(as defined in the plan rules) in relation 
to the growth in UK RPI. 
Average annual EPS growth in excess of 
RPI growth of:
• less than 4% results in nil achievement
• between a threshold level of 4% to 13% 
results in achievement between 10% 
and 100% on a straight-line basis
• greater than 13% results in 
100% achievement
EPS growth in excess of RPI for the 
three-year performance period was 88.10%.
This performance measure was therefore 
achieved at 100%.
50%
The Company’s TSR performance relative 
to an index of 23 international travel and 
leisure companies which are considered the 
most relevant peers in terms of size, global 
scope, business type and exposure to 
external factors. 
Average relative TSR per annum: 
• below index results in nil achievement
• between index and index +8% per 
annum results in achievement between 
15% and 100% on a straight-line basis
• at or above index +8% per annum 
results in 100% achievement
The Company’s achieved relative TSR 
performance was 174.68% over the three-
year performance period, with the peer 
group average achieving 91.99%.
This represents out-performance above the 
required hurdle of 117.96% by 48.08%. This 
performance measure was therefore 
achieved at 100%.
25%
ROIC performance in relation to 
ROIC targets.
Average ROIC performance in excess 
of ROIC targets:
• less than 14.1% results in nil achievement
• between a threshold of 14.1% to 15.6% 
results in achievement between 15% 
and 100% on a straight-line basis
• greater than 15.6% results in 
100% achievement
ROIC performance in excess of ROIC 
targets for the three-year performance 
period was 19.37%.
This performance measure was therefore 
achieved at 100%.

2. Harold Sher retired from the Board with effect from 18 September 2014.
3. Vladimir Yakushev was appointed to the Board on 7 February 2014. He resigned  
on 24 March 2014.
Non-Executive Directors are appointed with three months’ notice 
by either party. Minnow Powell, Coline McConville, Janis Kong and 
Val Gooding were appointed for a three-year term which expires 4 April 
2017, 21 September 2017, 29 May 2015 and 7 February 2017 respectively 
but includes the three months’ notice on either side provision. At the end 
of each term their re-appointment is considered by the Nomination 
Committee. In respect of Coline McConville and Minnow Powell, their 
re-appointments were considered, and unanimously recommended, 
to the Board at a meeting of the Nomination Committee held on 
26 March 2014.
A review of Non-Executive Director fees was carried out during the 
year, taking into account the scope of the roles at TUI Travel and the 
time commitment expected. The review highlighted that the fees for 
the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees were lower 
than their market comparators. The decision was taken to increase the 
fees for those Chairmen by £10,000 each with effect from 1 April 2014. 
The table below sets out the Non-Executive Director fees framework 
as at 30 September 2014:

Aside from the arrangements for Volker Böttcher outlined below, there 
have been no payments made to Directors for loss of office.

Volker Böttcher stood down from the TUI Travel PLC Board as an 
Executive Director on 16 December 2013. He remains employed within 
the TUI Travel PLC group of companies until 31 December 2014. During 
his notice period, Dr Böttcher continues to be paid in line with the 
terms of his service agreement, entitled to receive his normal benefits 
and to participate in his existing pension arrangements. 
Dr Böttcher’s salary was revised on 1 October 2013 to €400,000 
(previously €545,000). A bonus will be paid in respect of the financial 
year ended 30 September 2014. As required under German law, and in 
line with the approved Directors’ Remuneration Policy published last 
year, this payment will be equivalent to the average of his previous 
three-years’ bonus awards.
As at 30 September 2014 Dr Böttcher had the following awards 
outstanding under the PSP and DABS.

In line with the rules of the PSP and DABS, Dr Böttcher will be a good 
leaver with respect to his awards. Deferred share awards under the 
DABS, which represent the deferral of bonuses previously earned, will 
vest in full at the normal vesting date. Matching share awards under the 
DABS and share awards under the PSP will vest on the normal vesting 
date, subject to the achievement of the applicable performance criteria. 
Matching share awards that are not vested by 31 December 2014 will be 
pro-rated for service accrued within the three-year performance period 
from the date of award to 31 December 2014. Consequently 107,416 
Matching share awards will lapse. The last PSP award to Dr Böttcher 
was made in December 2011. Therefore there will be no unlapsed PSP 
awards on 31 December 2014.
No further payments for loss of office have been made.

assuming dividends are re-invested, with the TSR performance of 
an index of international travel and leisure companies. This index is 
considered by the Committee to be the most appropriate comparison 
reference for these purposes. From October 2011 this index has also 
been used for performance measurement under the Company’s 
long-term incentive schemes. As a member of the FTSE 100, the 
performance of this index is included.

Notes
1. For the financial year ended 30 September 2010, the performance targets for the annual 
bonus were met in full. However, the Committee decided that, in the context of an 
appropriate claw-back of prior year bonus due to the profit restatement and substantial 
one-off costs during the year, the cash portion of the bonus would not be payable.
2. In accordance with the relevant legislation the anticipated value of the DABS and PSP 
shares that vested on 10 December 2013 was estimated for the purposes of the Annual 
Report for the year ended 30 September 2013 using a share price of 365.00p, this being 
the three-month average for the year ended 30 September 2013. The actual share price 
was 378.30p. The FY2012/13 data above is the actual value rather than the estimate 
included in last year’s Annual Report and Accounts.

The following table shows the percentage change in remuneration 
between the years ended 30 September 2013 and 30 September 2014 
for the CEO and employees within our chosen comparator group. Last 
year the comparator group was the UK Group Leadership team as this 
was considered to be the most meaningful comparator group given 
that their remuneration is managed on a central, rather than local, 
basis. However, following shareholder feedback the comparator group 
has been broadened.

the CEO compared to all permanent employees based in the UK.

The Committee has set stretching targets focused on both profit 
and cash performance for the business. Although the target detail is 
considered commercially sensitive, the measures and weightings for 
the year commencing 1 October 2014 are:
Group Profit/Cash Individual Business Objectives
Peter Long 80% 20%
Johan Lundgren 80% 20%
William Waggott 80% 20%
It is anticipated that the bonus targets will be reviewed when the merger 
completes to ensure that they remain appropriate in the combined 
Group, and may be modified if appropriate to ensure that they remain 
relevant in the new business.
Shar e 	 P lans
In light of the merger it is not planned to make any PSP awards in 
December 2014. It is understood that TUI AG will include the Executive 
Directors in their LTIP arrangements after the merger has completed.
The Share Incentive Plan is on hold.

The Committee advises the Board on overall remuneration policy. 
It also determines, on behalf of the Board, and with the benefit of 
advice from external consultants and members of the HR Department, 
the remuneration of the Executive Directors and other members of 
the Group Management Board.
The Committee formulates and applies the Policy with consideration 
to the prevailing economic climate in the major economies in which 
the Group operates. It observes the spirit of the Group’s core values 
which cultivate responsible leadership in the external and internal 
social environment. Consequently the Committee closely considers 
the Company’s performance in building both shareholder value and 
a secure future for all stakeholders.
The activities of the Committee are governed by its Terms of Reference 
which were last revised on 6 February 2014 and can be found on the 
Company’s website.
The Committee currently comprises four Non-Executive Directors 
each of whom the Company deems to be independent.
• Coline McConville – Chairman
• Sir Michael Hodgkinson
• Val Gooding
• Janis Kong
The Chairman, Sir Michael Hodgkinson and Janis Kong were in place 
throughout the year. Val Gooding was appointed to the Committee 
on 1 July 2014.
No member of the Committee has any personal financial interest, 
other than as a shareholder, in the matters to be decided by the 
Committee. The members of the Committee have no conflicts of 
interest arising from cross-directorships and have no day-to-day 
involvement in the running of the Company. 
The Committee met eight times during the year. Details of attendance 
can be found in the Corporate Governance Report (see page 68). 
During the year, the Committee carried out the following activities:
• Consultation with shareholders and external bodies regarding the 
Executive Directors’ and GMB remuneration policy.
• Assessment of the achievement of Executive Directors’ and GMB 
members’ performance against their annual bonus objectives. 
• Assessment of performance for the vesting of the 2010 
Performance Share Plan and Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme 
awards.
• Approval of PSP and DABS awards for performance in the year 
ended 30 September 2013.
• Approval of the Directors’ Remuneration Report for the year ended 
30 September 2013. 
• Consideration of market trends in executive remuneration and 
potential impact.
• Review of how the Committee oversees the remuneration for the 
50 most senior leaders below the GMB. TT27 | AR 2014 | 13/11/2014 | Proof 1

• Review of GMB salaries.
• Review and discussion about corporate governance developments 
and their potential impact. 
• Assessment of the executive shareholding guidelines.
• Evaluation of the effectiveness of support provided by Deloitte 
in their role as independent advisers to the Committee.
• Consideration of the impact on executive remuneration of the 
merger with TUI AG.
• Agreement of the Annual Bonus, PSP and DABS performance 
targets for the year ended 30 September 2014.
During the year the Committee considered the results of a Remuneration 
Committee Effectiveness Survey. No significant concerns were raised.
Ad v is e r s
While it is the Committee’s responsibility to exercise independent 
judgement, the Committee does request advice from management 
and external professional advisers, as appropriate, to ensure that its 
decisions are fully informed. Advice or services were provided to the 
Committee during the year by: 
• Deloitte LLP (Deloitte);
• Joyce Walter – Company Secretary; 
• Peter Long – Chief Executive;
• Jacky Simmonds – Group HR Director; and
• Tim Taylor – Group Reward Director.
The Group HR Director has direct access to the Chairman of the 
Committee and, together with the Group Reward Director, advised the 
Committee on reward matters relating to the Executive Directors and 
members of the GMB and broader Group HR strategy and policy. 
The Chief Executive attends meetings of the Committee by invitation to 
make recommendations relating to the performance and remuneration 
of his direct reports and the Company Secretary acts as Secretary 
to the Committee. Executives are not in attendance when their own 
remuneration is considered. 
The Committee is authorised by the Board to seek any information it 
requires from any employee of the Group. The Committee is authorised 
to require the attendance of any Director at any of its meetings.
During the year, the Committee received independent advice on 
executive remuneration matters from Deloitte. Deloitte received 
£179,500 in fees for these services. The fees were higher than usual 
because of the additional work arising from the proposed merger with 
TUI AG. Deloitte is a founder member of the Remuneration Consultants 
Group and, as such, voluntarily operates under the code of conduct in 
relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. 
The Committee appointed Deloitte to the role of independent advisers 
to the Committee in 2008, following an interview process. The Committee 
is comfortable that the Deloitte engagement partner and team, which 
provide remuneration advice to the Committee, do not have connections 
with TUI Travel PLC that may impair their independence or objectivity. 
In addition, during the year ended 30 September 2014, Deloitte also 
provided various tax services to the Company.
Herbert Smith Freehills LLP was appointed to provide advice on law 
and regulation in relation to share scheme matters (which is provided 
to the Company and is available to the Committee). Legal fees relate 
to advice provided to the Company and not the Committee, and are 
charged on a time-cost basis. Herbert Smith Freehills LLP also provides 
general legal advice to the Company.

A special resolution will also be proposed to renew the Directors’ 
authority to repurchase the Company’s ordinary shares in the market. 
The authority will be limited to a maximum of 121,755,258 ordinary 
shares and sets the minimum and maximum prices which will be paid. 
This authority will expire at the end of the AGM held in 2016 or, if

Throughout the financial year and at the date of approval of these 
financial statements, the Company has purchased and maintained 
Directors’ and Officers’ liability insurance in respect of itself and its 
Directors whether in their capacity as Directors of the Company or 
associated companies. The Directors also have the benefit of indemnity 
provisions in the Company’s Articles of Association. These provisions 
are qualifying third-party indemnity provisions as defined in section 
234 of the Companies Act 2006.
Si gn ifica nt 	 a gr eem ent s 	 – 	 cha n g e 	 of 	 co ntr o l
The Companies Act 2006 requires us to disclose any significant 
agreements that take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control 
of the Company.
R elati onship 	 Agr eement 	 with 	t Ui	 A G 	
The Relationship Agreement between TUI AG and TUI Travel, dated 
29 June 2007, includes the principle that TUI Travel will operate 
independently of TUI AG and records the understanding between 
TUI AG and TUI Travel regarding the relationship between them and 
the governance of TUI Travel. 
The Relationship Agreement includes the following requirements:
• that transactions and relationships between the Company and TUI 
AG (and/or its associates) must be conducted at arm’s length and  
on normal commercial terms;
• that TUI AG (and/or its associates) must abstain from taking action 
that would have the effect of preventing the Company from 
complying with its obligations under the Listing Rules;
• that no controlling shareholder (or its associates) may propose or 
procure the proposal of a shareholder resolution which is intended, 
or appears to be intended, to circumvent the proper application of 
the Listing Rules; and
• that, so long as TUI AG controls 40% or more of the Company, the 
CEO’s appointment is subject to consent from TUI AG unless TUI AG 
relinquishes its right to appoint a Chairman, in which case TUI AG has 
the right in its sole discretion to appoint any person to be the CEO.
The Company has complied with these independence provisions set 
out above during the year and, so far as the Company is aware, TUI AG 
and its associates have complied with these independence provisions 
during the year.
The Relationship Agreement will remain in force until either the shares 
in TUI Travel are no longer traded on the London Stock Exchange, or 
TUI AG has less than 10% of the rights to vote at general meetings. 
In addition, in the event that another party acquires control of TUI AG 
during the term of the Relationship Agreement, TUI AG will lose certain 
rights under the Relationship Agreement including its rights in respect 
of the composition of the Board.

The Company was authorised by shareholders, at the AGM held in 
February 2014, to purchase in the market up to 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital, as permitted under the Company’s Articles. No 
shares (2013: no shares) have been bought back under this authority 
during the year ended 30 September 2014. This standard authority is 
renewable annually and the Directors will seek to renew this authority 
at the AGM to be held on 5 February 2015. The Directors were granted 
authority in 2014 to allot relevant securities up to a maximum nominal 
amount of £74,534,044.60. That authority will apply until the conclusion 
of the 2015 AGM. 
At the AGM in February 2015, shareholders will be asked to grant an 
authority to allot shares in the capital of the Company up to a maximum 
nominal amount of £81,170,172.40 representing the ABI guideline limit 
of approximately 66% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. 
Of this amount, 405,850,862 shares (representing approximately 33% 
of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital) can only be allotted 
pursuant to a rights issue. The power will last until the conclusion of 
the AGM in 2016 or, if earlier, on 5 May 2016. The Directors have no 
present intention of exercising this authority but they consider it 
appropriate to maintain the flexibility that this authority provides.

Agreements between a number of surety companies and the Company 
relating to bonding facilities of £116 million currently provided to the 
Company contain terms which give the sureties the right to cancel all 
commitments to the Company and to declare all outstanding bonds 
immediately due and payable if a change of control occurs. For the 
purpose of this agreement a change of control occurs if:
• any person or group of persons acting in concert gains control of the 
Company; or
• TUI AG and any persons acting in concert with it acquires or acquire 
75% or more of the voting shares in the Company.

In May 2011, the Company entered into a limited liability partnership 
arrangement and a Scottish limited partnership arrangement with 
three of its UK defined benefit pension schemes to address the 
ongoing funding and management of the pension schemes. Under 
the partnership arrangements, the Company committed to making 
payments of up to £275 million in 2026 if, and to the extent that, the 
pension schemes remain in deficit at that time. The partnership 
agreements contain terms which give the pension schemes the right to 
wind up the partnerships and require an injection of up to £275 million 
by the Company if there is a restructuring or reorganisation of the 
assets of the Company which results in a reduction of the Company’s 
consolidated net assets to less than £1,100 million following the 
occurrence of a change of control. For the purposes of the partnership 
agreements a change of control occurs if:
• following a takeover offer for the Company a person or group of 
persons acting in concert acquire more than 30% of the voting rights 
in the Company; or
• TUI AG and any persons acting in concert with it acquires or acquire 
75% or more of the voting rights in the Company and/or the 
Company’s listing is cancelled.
R estri c ted 	 sha r es	
In relation to the £400m fixed rate 4.9% convertible bond, an 
independent special purpose company (Antium Finance Ltd) subscribed 
for 50%. TUI AG entered into a forward purchase agreement with 
Antium Finance Ltd for those £200m of convertible bonds (representing 
86,967,049 shares), in order to prevent dilution of its majority 
shareholding. TUI AG is entitled to receive the interest coupon on these 
bonds and to purchase them. By way of security, TUI AG transferred 
to Antium Finance Ltd 86,967,049 shares, currently representing 7.14% 
of the Company’s share capital on an undiluted basis. Those shares are 
restricted from being transferred and TUI AG remains entitled to the 
dividend yields, to exercise the voting rights attached to them and to 
repurchase them.
According to a new contractual arrangement dated 10 October 2013, 
Antium Finance Ltd has assigned its rights to Deutsche Bank AG and 
the entitlement of TUI AG to purchase the bonds and to repurchase 
the 86,967,049 shares in the Company is extended to July 2016 at the 
latest. TUI AG remains entitled to receive the interest coupon on the 
bonds as well as the share dividends referred to above. 
The Relationship Agreement contains restrictions on the acquisition by 
TUI AG of additional shares in TUI Travel which result in the increase of 
its shareholding to more than 55% of the voting rights on a fully-diluted 
basis (save where TUI AG makes a general offer to acquire all TUI Travel 
shares in issue). As detailed below, £400m of 4.9% Convertible Bonds 
were issued in April 2010. Half of these bonds are held on TUI AG’s 
behalf and, if converted at the conversion price set on the launch date, 
would give rise to 52,309,463 new shares. On a fully-diluted basis 
(if bonds held by all bondholders were converted), TUI AG would have 
had a holding of 50.03% as at 30 September 2014. As a percentage of 
shares in issue, TUI AG’s holding as at 30 September 2014 was 53.72% 
(2013: 54.48%). 
As a ‘controlling shareholder’ of the Company for the purposes of the 
Listing Rules, TUI AG will be entitled to vote on the ordinary resolutions 
at the AGM for the re-election of the Company’s Independent Directors. 
However, each such resolution at the AGM will also require approval 
by a majority of the votes cast by the Company’s independent 
shareholders (i.e. the Company’s shareholders excluding TUI AG and 
any other controlling shareholder).
TUI AG has anti-dilution rights in respect of further issues of shares in 
TUI Travel other than on a pre-emptive basis. TUI Travel has also agreed 
that certain matters will require the prior approval of 80% of the 
Directors present at the meeting of the Board at which such matter is 
considered, including material changes to the business of any Group 
company, acquisitions and disposals of a value which exceeds £10m, 
the entry into, variation or redemption prior to their due date of any 
borrowing facilities and the approval of the annual budget.
Bank 	 cr edit 	 fa cilities
Some bank facility agreements incorporate terms which give the 
lending banks the right to cancel all commitments to the Company  
and to declare all outstanding credits and accrued interest immediately 
due and payable if a change of control occurs. For the purpose of this 
agreement a change of control occurs if:
• any person or group of persons acting in concert gains control of  
the Company; or
• TUI AG and any persons acting in concert with it acquires or acquire 
75% or more of the voting shares in the Company.
Specifically, the facilities affected are:
• a total of £1,225m bank revolving credit facilities which mature  
in June 2018; 
• £175m of bonding and letter of credit facilities which mature in  
June 2018; and
• £150m bank syndicated facility which matures in April 2016 and 
which is only available in the event of a requirement to redeem the 
Group’s convertible bonds.
£ 40 0 	 milli on 	 4. 90% 	 con v er tible 	 bonds
In April 2010, the Company issued £400 million of 4.90% convertible 
bonds with a conversion price set at 382.34 pence per share. The 
settlement took place on 27 April 2010. The convertible bonds contain 
terms which give the bondholders the right to redeem the bonds at 
their principal amount, together with accrued and unpaid interest up to 
the date of redemption, if a change of control occurs. For the purpose 
of the convertible bonds a change of control occurs if:
• following a takeover offer to acquire all, or a majority of, the shares 
in the Company being declared unconditional in all respects or 
becoming effective, the offeror and/or its associates have or will 
have more than 50% of the voting rights in the Company; or

Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed on page 64 
confirm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit of the 
Group; and
• the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development  
and performance of the business and the position of the Group, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that it faces.
The Directors also confirm that:
• so far as they are aware, there is no relevant audit information  
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• they have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as 
Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware 
of that information.
The Directors’ responsibilities statement was approved by a duly 
authorised Committee of the Board of Directors on 3 December 2014 
and signed on its behalf by William Waggott, Chief Financial Officer.
William 	 W a g g ot t
Chief Financial Officer
3 December 2014
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have prepared the 
Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, and 
the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the 
Directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these financial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and apply them consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
• state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject 
to any material departures disclosed and explained in the Group 
and Parent Company financial statements respectively; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position  
of the Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the 
financial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the 
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions. 
The Directors consider that the Annual Report & Accounts, taken as a 
whole, is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.

• The Group engagement team visited the following locations – UK, Germany, France, 
Nordics, Belgium, Netherlands, Russia, Canada and Spain.
• Our audit scope addressed 87% of Group revenues and 83% of absolute Group 
underlying operating profit (i.e. the sum of the numerical values without regard  
to whether they were profits or losses for the relevant reporting units). 
• Effectiveness of internal control.
• Impairment assessment – Goodwill and other intangible assets, and Russia.

• Separately disclosed items.
• Deferred taxation.
• Risk of fraud in revenue recognition.

We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (‘ISAs (UK & Ireland)’).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In particular,  
we looked at where the Directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates that involved making 
assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits, we also addressed the risk of management 
override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by the Directors that may represent a risk of material 
misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are identified as 
‘Areas of focus’ in the table below together with an explanation of how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas. This is not a complete 
list of all risks identified by our audit. 
Our observations on the areas below were based on the evidence obtained to support our opinion on the financial statements as a whole.

Refer to page 75 (‘The effectiveness of Internal Control and the risk 
management framework’ within the Audit Committee Report).
The overall control environment in the Group has improved over the last 
few years, with a change in approach from the Group management team 
and a greater focus on ensuring that controls in place are more robust 
and financial reporting more accurate. 
The financial controls, processes and procedures across the Group are  
at varying stages of maturity and there are a large number of different 
financial systems in operation. Management is continuing to implement 
the COSO framework across the Finance functions within the Group, 
with the aim of ensuring controls within the larger businesses are fully 
documented, owned by individuals within those businesses and evidence 
of the operation of the control is retained. The smaller businesses within 
the Group are required to operate a centrally defined list of minimum 
controls, providing additional assurance over the control environment.
We focused on this area because financial information at locations 
where the control environment is less mature is inherently more at risk 
of misstatement. These locations tend to be, but are not exclusively, 
the smaller businesses operated by the Group.
We assessed the overall control environment of the Group including 
meeting with senior management and the Group’s legal, compliance and 
internal audit functions. 
We evaluated the progress of the Group’s project that is designed to 
strengthen the tone at the top (including assessing the quality of internal 
audit and strengthening of risk management process and procedures) and 
to formalise certain controls, policies and processes to improve the 
robustness of the control environment throughout the businesses operated 
by the Group.
The Group is complex and we noted that although this project is becoming 
embedded within the larger businesses where the output is more 
formalised, within the smaller businesses the controls are less formal.
As a result, our audit approach incorporated:
• a greater focus on those reporting units and functions with weaker controls;
• a greater emphasis on substantive testing of transactions, balances and 
key reconciliations; and
• a greater emphasis on testing of manual journals.
After discussion with the Audit Committee we also included a greater 
number of smaller businesses in scope for an audit of their complete 
financial information. 
No material misstatements were noted from these additional areas of 
focus and emphasis.

Refer to page 74 (‘Annual goodwill impairment review’ and ‘SDI’ within 
the Audit Committee Report), page 121 (Significant Accounting Policies) 
and page 144 (notes).
Goodwill and other intangible assets
The Goodwill and intangible asset balances of £4.3bn are supported by 
an annual impairment review. 
No impairment charge has been recorded by management against these 
balances in the current financial year. The risk that we focused on in the 
audit is that the goodwill and intangibles balance may be overstated and 
that an impairment charge may be required. 
Of the £4.3bn, £3.2bn relates to businesses that have grown significantly 
since acquisition and for which there is substantial headroom. The risk 
that we focused on in the audit is that the remaining balance of £1.1bn 
may be overstated. 
Certain assumptions made by management in the impairment review are 
key judgements. In particular:
• The goodwill and intangibles balances in the Specialist & Activity 
businesses amount to £715m. Certain of these businesses have been 
trading below budget and will require turnaround actions to achieve 
the anticipated growth rate in the next five years in the business plans. 
If these growth rates are not achieved the goodwill and intangible asset 
values could be impaired; 
• The French mainstream business, with £162m of goodwill and intangibles, 
has been loss making and is highly dependent on the North African 
destinations, where there is continuing political unrest, and the success 
of the cost reduction plan. The judgement over the extent of revenue to 
be generated from North Africa is a key area of focus; 
• There has been investment in the Online Accommodation businesses for 
the last three years, with £253m of goodwill and intangibles. Management 
is forecasting high revenue and profit growth rates in the next five years 
resulting from the investment in Brazil and in Asia. If these growth rates 
are not achieved, it could lead to impairment of the related goodwill and 
intangible assets; and
• The assessment of the overall long term growth rates and discount rates 
used by management, because small changes in either of these can result 
in a significant change in the value in use.
Russia
In addition, the Group has a joint venture in Russia and Ukraine. Following 
the civil war in Ukraine and the impact of the devaluation of the rouble, 
the businesses in Russia and Ukraine made losses in the year and there 
is uncertainty over the future trading environment and cash flows from 
these businesses. Management has now assessed that the long-term 
non-trading balances with the Russian joint venture have been impaired 
and also provided for the committed funding which was paid to the joint 
venture in October and November 2014. In total, impairment charges of 
£28m have been made during the year.
We evaluated and challenged the Group’s future cash flow forecasts and 
the process by which they were drawn up, and tested the underlying 
value in use calculations. We compared the Group’s forecast to the latest 
Board approved three year plans and found them to be consistent.
In certain Specialist & Activity businesses, the key assumptions we focused 
on were the speed at which sales growth would be achieved, and whether 
cost savings could return some businesses to their former profitability. 
Factors we considered included new market opportunities and the cost 
savings from ongoing restructuring. Overall, we found the growth plans 
were achievable but that there was sufficient uncertainty to require 
management to disclose the sensitivities of key assumptions and these 
are included in note 10.
For the France mainstream business, we focused on the assumptions about 
the impact of the political unrest on sales in North Africa, management’s 
ability to retain sales growth by offering alternative destinations and the 
impact of the downsizing restructuring of recent years. Based on the booking 
pattern of TUI France’s customers this year and analysis of the size of the 
French market for overseas travel we concurred with management’s position.
For the Online Accommodation business we focused on understanding and 
challenging management plans for future growth. We noted that these plans 
are driven by cost savings from shared IT platforms and back office functions 
for the key businesses in this cash generating unit (CGU) and considered 
these were achievable and within management’s control. We applied 
sensitivities to the assumptions on speed and extent of market penetration, 
particularly in AsiaRooms and MalaPronta, this analysis showed that 
although different assumptions could have been made, those chosen by 
the Directors sat within an acceptable range.
We also challenged:
• the Directors’ key assumptions for long-term growth rates in the Group’s 
forecasts by comparing them to economic and industry forecasts; and
• the discount rate by assessing the cost of capital for the Company and 
comparable organisations. 
We performed sensitivity analysis around the long-term growth rates 
and discount rate to ascertain the extent of change in those assumptions 
that would be required for the goodwill and other intangible assets 
in individual CGUs to be impaired. We determined that a movement 
arising of this extent in those key assumptions was unlikely and that the 
disclosures made regarding the assumptions and the sensitivities drew 
attention to the more significant areas of judgement.
We reviewed the likely future cash flows from the Russia joint venture 
and focused on the speed at which the Russian market will return to 
trading levels similar to that achieved in 2013. The level of trading will 
determine the ability of the business to generate sufficient cash to repay 
the trading and non-trading balances. We agreed with management’s 
conclusion to impair the loans and the October and November 2014 
committed funding. We read investment committee and Board minutes 
and discussed with management and as a result were satisfied there is 
no unprovided committed funding to the Russia joint venture. 106 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Refer to page 74 (‘Provisions for claims and accruals’ and 
‘Hotel prepayments’ within the Audit Committee Report), page 123 
(Significant Accounting Policies) and pages 154 & 158 (notes).
The relative size of the balances in the consolidated balance sheet compared 
to the size of the underlying operating profit of the Group makes the 
income statement very sensitive to changes in the consolidated balance 
sheet. Certain lines within the balance sheet, such as airline and hotel 
cost accruals (within accruals and deferred income of £1.5bn), provisions 
(£644m) and prepayments (£632m), require more judgement on the part 
of management and are therefore an area of greater focus for the audit.
In June 2014 TUI AG and TUI Travel PLC announced their intention to 
complete an all share nil premium merger. 
The timing of the publication of certain documents related to the merger 
resulted in the need for management to make judgements on closing 
balance sheet positions earlier than usual during the year end process 
and to make an estimate of the year’s underlying operating profit in early 
October 2014. Shareholders made decisions based on this estimate 
which placed additional pressure on management not to change the 
estimate of underlying operating profit and the judgements made. 
We assessed and tested the judgements made by both Group and local 
management teams relating to key balance sheet positions. 
In particular, we challenged, for example by assessing against past history 
or agreeing to supporting evidence:
• the estimated costs associated with maintaining aircraft under existing 
lease agreements; 
• the anticipated claim and payment rates used within the calculation 
of denied boarding compensation liability;
• the closing provisions associated with ongoing legal matters;
• the appropriateness of the carrying value of hotel prepayments; 
• the appropriateness of the internal and external costs capitalised 
for development projects;
• the estimate of accruals for airlines and hotels costs; and
• the assumptions used within the calculation of pension liabilities.
In each case we considered the judgements made by management to  
be reasonable in light of the evidence provided.

Refer to page 74 (‘SDI’ within the Audit Committee Report), page 116 
(Significant Accounting Policies) and page 129 (notes).
Credits of £73m and debits of £72m have been included in SDI in the 
year ended 30 September 2014.
As separately disclosed items and other categories are excluded from 
underlying operating profit the nature and consistency of classification 
of these items is important in understanding the result for the year and 
is a matter of judgement.
We assessed the appropriateness of the policy for SDIs and whether the 
significant items that were included within the SDIs were appropriately 
classified. We also considered whether there were other significant items 
which should have been included as SDIs by obtaining a list of significant 
one-off transactions and assessing these against the policy for SDIs.
We found that the classification judgements and disclosures made by 
management were in line with the policy.
t a x at io n
Refer to page 74 (‘Tax’ within the Audit Committee Report), Note 1 to 
the financial statements for the Directors’ disclosures of the related 
accounting policies, judgements and estimates and notes 8 & 14.
There is significant complexity in the calculation of direct and indirect tax 
balances that arises from the complexity of the Group’s legal structure 
(including multiple legal entities in non-fiscal consolidations), the multiple 
tax jurisdictions and changing tax environment in which the Group operates 
and the differing underlying systems used by the Group to generate 
accounting entries. In addition we focused on specific tax issues with respect 
to German trade tax (as set out in note 8 (iv)) and the VAT position of 
Hotelbeds Product SLU.
The Group also has deferred tax assets of £165m and liabilities of £67m 
in the balance sheet at 30 September 2014. During the year the Group 
has performed a review of all deferred tax assets and liabilities to ensure 
they have been calculated correctly and that they are substantiated by 
supporting documentation. There is judgement in the assessment of 
whether deferred tax assets will be utilised in future periods, particularly 
given the cyclicality of the business and the difficulty in estimating when 
and where taxable profits will arise around the Group.
We assessed and formed our own views on the key judgements with 
respect to open tax positions and found that the judgements made by 
management were consistent with our views. We tested the calculations 
and payments in relation to the VAT position of Hotelbeds Product SLU 
and found no material misstatements.
We read the external advice the Group has received with respect to the 
assessment that no provision is required for German trade tax and 
concurred with management’s conclusion and the resulting disclosures.
We understood the underlying transactions basis for significant deferred 
tax assets and liabilities and we found evidence to support the rationale  
on which the deferred tax assets and liabilities have been recognised.
We tested the calculations performed in respect of the locations within 
Group audit scope with particular emphasis on the UK where each legal 
entity files a separate tax return and Germany which includes two levels 
of tax – federal and state. We found no material misstatements from 
our testing.
Where the recoverability of deferred tax assets is dependent on future 
profits, such as in France, we checked that the forecasts used were 
consistent with the Board approved three year plan that we subjected 
to scrutiny as part of the goodwill impairment review.

See note 1 to the financial statements for the Directors’ disclosures of the 
related accounting policies, judgements and estimates for further information.
We focused on recognition of revenue because there can be a significant 
difference between the timing of receipt of cash from customers and the 
subsequent recognition of revenue on the holiday departure date. Due to 
manual intervention and the high volume of transactions, the high number 
of different reservation systems and the interfaces of these with the 
accounting records there is the potential for deliberate manipulation 
or error.
We assessed the consistency of the application of the revenue recognition 
policy by reconsidering the accounting policy for the different sources of 
the Group’s revenue. We tested the design and operating effectiveness 
of the controls (including IT controls) over revenue systems across the 
Group to determine the extent of additional substantive testing required 
and also tested key reservation system reconciliations at 30 September 
2014. We found no material misstatements from our testing.
We checked that revenue had been recognised at the correct time by testing 
a sample of transactions and comparing the departure dates against 
which the revenue had been recognised. No exceptions were noted from 
our testing.
Our work also included testing a sample of manual journals which did not 
identify any items that could not be substantiated. TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014 107

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
h o w 	 w e 	 t a ilor ed 	 the 	 audit 	 scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough 
work to be able to give an opinion on the financial statements as a 
whole, taking into account: the geographic and management structure 
of the Group; the accounting processes and controls; and the industry 
in which the Group operates. 
The Group is structured along three segment lines being Mainstream, 
Accommodation & Destinations and Specialist & Activity. The Group’s 
financial statements are a consolidation of its world-wide reporting 
units, comprising its operating businesses within these segments and 
centralised functions. 
In establishing the overall Group audit strategy and plan, we determined 
the type of work that needed to be performed at the reporting units 
by the Group engagement team and by component auditors from 
other PwC network firms and from two other firms working under 
our instruction in respect of Canada and Russia. Where the work 
was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of 
involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those reporting 
units so as to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit 
evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the Group 
financial statements as a whole. 
For each reporting unit we determined whether we required an audit of 
their complete financial information or whether higher level procedures 
would be sufficient. Those where a complete audit was required included 
the two largest reporting units (Mainstream UK & Ireland and 
Mainstream Germany), because they each make up more than 15% 
of the Group’s revenue or underlying profits. We included a further 18 
reporting units due to the risk characteristics of those units, either due 
to the control environment or the nature of the business as an airline, 
another 16 reporting units so that the major source markets were 
covered across all sectors, six additional reporting units as a consequence 
of both the maturing control environment and our consultations with 
the Audit Committee and performed specified procedures on a further 
eight reporting units to cover specific balances. 
In addition, we performed higher level procedures with respect to the 
remaining reporting units. The Group consolidation, financial statement 
disclosures and a number of complex items were audited by the group 
engagement team at the head office. These include derivative financial 
instruments, hedge accounting, pensions and share based payments. 
The Group engagement team also visited 15 businesses in nine countries 
(UK, Germany, France, Nordics, Belgium, Netherlands, Russia, Canada 
and Spain) to direct the planning, review the work undertaken and 
assess the findings.
Taken together, our audit work performed at individual component 
locations and at the head office addressed 87% of Group revenues and 
83% of absolute Group operating profit ( i.e. the sum of the numerical 
values without regard to whether they were profits or losses for the 
relevant reporting units). This gave us the evidence we needed for our 
opinion on the Group financial statements as a whole.
Mat e r ia li t y
The scope of our audit is influenced by our application of materiality. 
We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, together 
with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of 
our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures 
and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on 
the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for 
the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £27.5 million (2013: £27.5 million)
How we determined it 4.5% of underlying operating profit  
(2013: 5%)
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
We note that underlying operating profit is 
the key measure used both internally by 
management and, we believe, externally by 
shareholders in evaluating the performance 
of the Group. This measure excludes SDIs, 
acquisition related expenses, impairments, 
tax on joint ventures and associates, 
interest and tax. We applied specific 
materiality levels for each of these items 
because of their particular sensitivity. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them 
misstatements identified during our audit above £1.4m (2013: £1.4m) 
as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, 
warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Goin g 	 concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the Directors’ 
statement, set out on page 101, in relation to going concern. We have 
nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted within the Directors’ Report on page 101, the Directors have 
concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements 
using the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis 
presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in 
operation, and that the Directors intend it to do so, for at least one 
year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our 
audit we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern 
basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, 
these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern. 108 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

What 	 an 	 a udit 	 of 	 financial 	 st atement s 	 in v olv es
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: 
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the 
Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; 
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We focus our work primarily in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in 
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

been 1.5p and 1.3p higher respectively.
( A ) 	 Statement 	 of 	 compliance
The consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
30 September 2014 have been prepared and approved by the Directors 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards and 
IFRIC interpretations as adopted by the European Union (Adopted 
IFRS) and the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting 
under IFRS. The consolidated financial statements were approved on 
3 December 2014. 
(B ) 	 Basis 	 of 	 pr eparati on
The consolidated financial statements are prepared on the historical cost 
basis other than derivative financial instruments, financial instruments 
held for trading and financial instruments classified as available for sale, 
which are stated at fair value. Non-current assets held for sale are stated 
at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in the Group’s 
presentation currency of Sterling, rounded to the nearest million. Each 
entity in the Group determines its own functional currency and items 
included in the consolidated financial statements of each entity are 
measured using the currency of the primary economic environment in 
which the entity operates.
( i ) 	 Paren t 	c omp any
TUI Travel PLC (the Company) is a company incorporated and domiciled 
in England and Wales and listed on the London Stock Exchange.  
The Registered Office of the Company is TUI Travel House, Crawley 
Business Quarter, Fleming Way, Crawley, West Sussex, RH10 9QL.  
The Company has elected to prepare its Parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
( ii ) 	 Underl y ing 	 me a s ure s 	 o f 	 p ro fi t s 	 and 	 lo s s e s
The Group believes that underlying operating profit, underlying profit 
before tax and underlying earnings per share provide additional 
guidance to statutory measures to help understand the underlying 
performance of the business during the financial year. The term 
underlying is not defined under IFRS. It is a measure that is used by 
management to assess the underlying performance of the business 
internally and is not intended to be a substitute measure for adopted 
IFRS GAAP measures. The Group defines these underlying measures 
as follows:
Underlying operating profit is operating profit from continuing 
operations stated before separately disclosed items, acquisition 
related expenses, impairment of goodwill and financial assets and 
interest and taxation on the Group’s share of the results of joint 
ventures and associates. 
Underlying profit before tax is profit from continuing operations before 
taxation, acquisition related expenses, impairment of goodwill and 
financial assets, interest and taxation of joint ventures and associates 
and separately disclosed items included within the operating result.
1 . 	 A c c o u n ti n g 	 p o l i ci es
The accounting policies adopted in the preparation of these consolidated 
financial statements are consistent with those followed in the preparation 
of the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
30 September 2013, except for the adoption of the following new and 
amended International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) that are 
applicable to the Group for the year ended 30 September 2014: 
•  IAS 19 (revised) ‘Employee benefits’
•  IFRS 13 ‘Fair value measurement’
•  Amendments to IFRS 7 Disclosures – Offsetting financial assets  
and financial liabilities 
•  IASB’s Annual improvements project (2011)
The Group has also adopted the following amendments to current 
IFRSs early:
• Amendment to IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’ in respect of fair 
value disclosures 
•  Amendment to IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments: Recognition and 
measurement’ in respect of novation of derivatives and continuation 
of hedge accounting
The amendment to IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’ on deferred tax is not currently 
applicable to the Group as it has no investment properties measured at 
fair value.
With the exception of the impact following the revision to IAS 19, which 
is disclosed below, these new and amended standards have had no 
significant impact on the consolidated results or financial position and 
therefore no restatement of the prior year’s equity or profit has been 
presented. Additional disclosures in respect of the amendments to 
IFRS 7 are provided within these consolidated financial statements 
where applicable.
i A S 	 1 9 	 ( r e vised) 	 ‘e mplo y ee 	 benefit s’
The revision to IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’ makes significant changes to 
the recognition and measurement of defined benefit pension expense 
and termination benefits and enhances the disclosures for all employee 
benefits. The most significant impact for the Group is that interest 
expense is now calculated by applying the discount rate to the net 
defined benefit liability. This replaces the interest cost on the defined 
benefit obligation and the expected return on plan assets.
The revised standard has retrospective application and consequently the 
relevant charges or income in the consolidated income statement and 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income for the financial 
year ended 30 September 2013 have been restated. The impact on 
opening retained earnings or net assets has not been dealt with as a 
prior year adjustment on the grounds of materiality. 
The impact on the results for the year ending 30 September 2013 was 
as follows:

Notes to the consolidated financial statements
continued
covenant limits at the date of the balance sheet. Forecasts reviewed by 
the Board, including forecasts adjusted for significantly worse economic 
conditions, show continued compliance with these covenants. For both 
covenants, earnings are calculated on an underlying basis as described 
in Note 1(B)(ii). On the basis of its forecasts, both base case and 
adjusted as described above, and available facilities, the Board has 
concluded that the going concern basis of preparation continues to 
be appropriate. 
This is the case both in the scenario that the merger with TUI AG does 
not proceed, which is considered unlikely, and the scenario once the 
merger is completed, as TUI AG has agreed to provide facilities to enable, 
based on current expectations, TUI Travel PLC and its subsidiaries to 
continue operations for the foreseeable future.
( c ) 	 Basis 	 of 	 consolidati on
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and 
its subsidiaries (together referred to as the Group) and equity accounts 
for the Group’s interest in joint ventures and associates. The Parent 
Company financial statements present information about the Company 
as a separate entity and not about the Group. Accounting policies of 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates are amended where necessary 
to be consistent with those adopted by the Group. Where audited 
financial statements are not coterminous with those of the Group, the 
financial information is derived from the last audited accounts available 
and unaudited management accounts for the period up to the Group’s 
balance sheet date.
( i ) 	 S ub s idi arie s
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when 
the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial 
and operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its 
activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently 
exercisable or convertible are taken into account. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
information from the date that control commences until the date that 
control ceases.
( ii ) 	 Join t 	 ven t ure s 	 and 	 a s s oc i at e s
Joint ventures are jointly controlled entities whose activities the Group 
has the power to control jointly, established by contractual agreement. 
Associates are those entities in which the Group has the ability to 
exercise significant influence, but not control, over the financial and 
operating policies. The consolidated financial statements include the 
Group’s share of the total recognised income and expense and changes 
in equity of joint ventures and associates on an equity accounted basis, 
from the date that joint control or significant influence respectively 
commences until the date that it ceases. Associates and joint ventures 
are recorded at cost, adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the 
Group’s share of net assets of the entity including goodwill net of 
accumulated impairment loss. When the Group’s share of losses 
exceeds the carrying amount of the joint venture or associate, the 
carrying amount is reduced to £nil and recognition of further losses 
is discontinued except to the extent that the Group has incurred legal 
or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the joint 
venture or associate.
( iii ) 	 n on - c on t r ollin g 	 in t e r e s t s
In the consolidated balance sheet, the share of net assets attributable 
to non-controlling interests is disclosed as a separate component 
of equity after share capital and reserves. The consolidated income 
statement discloses the amount of the result for the year attributable 
to non-controlling interests and which is excluded from earnings per 
share calculations.
1 . 	 A c c o u n ti n g 	 p o l i ci es 	continued
Underlying earnings used in the calculation of underlying earnings per 
share is profit after tax from continuing operations excluding acquisition 
related expenses, impairment of goodwill and financial assets and 
separately disclosed items included within the operating result. 
For the purpose of this calculation, an underlying tax charge is used 
which excludes the tax effects of separately disclosed items, acquisition 
related expenses, goodwill and financial asset impairment charges and 
separately disclosed tax items.
It should be noted that the definitions of underlying items being used 
in these consolidated financial statements are those used by the Group 
and may not be comparable with the term ‘underlying’ as defined by 
other companies both within the same sector or elsewhere.

Separately disclosed items are those significant items which in 
management’s judgement are highlighted by virtue of their size or 
incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial 
performance. Such items are included within the income statement 
caption to which they relate (Note 4). 
( iv ) 	 Bu s ine s s 	 and 	 fi n anc i al 	 review
The Group’s business activities, together with factors likely to affect 
its future development, performance and position, are set out in the 
Business and financial review section. In addition, Notes 26 and 34 set 
out the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing its 
capital, financial risks, financial instruments and hedging activities as 
well as its exposures to credit and liquidity risk. 
( v ) 	 F unding 	 and 	 liquidit y
The Board remains satisfied with the Group’s funding and 
liquidity position. At 30 September 2014, the main sources of 
debt funding included: 
• a total of £1,225m bank revolving credit facilities which mature 
in June 2018; 
• £175m of bonding and letter of credit facilities which mature 
in June 2018;
• £400m convertible bond due April 2017;
• £150m bank syndicated facility which matures in April 2016 and 
which is only available in the event of a requirement to redeem 
the Group’s convertible bond; and
• £382m of drawn finance lease obligations with repayments 
up to June 2024.
The ratio of earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation, amortisation 
and operating lease rentals (EBITDAR) to fixed charges (being the 
aggregate amount of interest and any other finance charges in respect 
of borrowings and including all payments under operating leases) and 
the ratio of net debt to earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation 
and amortisation (EBITDA), which the Board believes to be the most 
useful measures of cash generation and gearing, as well as being the 
main basis for the Group’s credit facility covenants, are well within the  TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014 117

The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and 
fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated from 
functional currency to Sterling at the foreign exchange rates ruling at the 
balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of overseas operations 
are translated from functional currency at rates approximating to the 
foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on the translation are recognised in other 
comprehensive income through the translation reserve.
Foreign exchange gains and losses arising from monetary items 
receivable from or payable to a foreign operation, the settlement 
of which is neither planned nor likely in the foreseeable future, are 
considered to form part of a net investment in a foreign operation 
and are recognised directly in equity in the translation reserve. 
( iii ) 	n e t 	 inve s t men t 	 in 	 foreig n 	 op er at ion s
Foreign currency differences arising on the retranslation of a financial 
liability designated as a hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation 
are recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income 
to the extent that the hedge is effective and are presented within equity 
in the translation reserve. To the extent that the hedge is ineffective, 
such differences are recognised in profit or loss. When the hedged part 
of a net investment is disposed, the relevant amount in the translation 
reserve is transferred to profit or loss as part of the profit or loss 
on disposal.
(e ) 	 Financial 	 instrument s
( i ) 	 F in anc i al 	 a s s e t s
Financial assets are either classified as loans and receivables, available 
for sale financial assets, or financial assets at fair value through profit 
or loss. Financial assets include cash and cash equivalents, trade 
receivables, loans, trade and other investments (including financial 
deposits within the Group’s control), derivative financial instruments and 
other receivables, but exclude financial deposits outside the Group’s 
control, prepayments and taxes. The Group determines the classification 
of its financial assets at initial recognition. Financial assets are recognised 
initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price plus, in the 
case of financial assets not at fair value through profit or loss, directly 
attributable transaction costs. The subsequent measurement of 
financial assets depends on their classification, as follows:
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or 
determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Such 
assets are carried at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
if the time value of money is significant. Gains and losses are recognised 
in income when the loans and receivables are derecognised or impaired, 
as well as through the amortisation process. This category of financial 
assets includes trade and other receivables.
Available for sale financial assets
Available for sale financial assets are those non-derivative financial 
assets that are not classified as loans and receivables or financial assets 
at fair value through profit or loss. After initial recognition, available 
for sale financial assets are measured at fair value, with gains or losses 
recognised within other comprehensive income until the investment 
is derecognised or until the investment is determined to be impaired, 
at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously reported in other 
comprehensive income is included in the consolidated income statement. 
Note 1(W)(ii) describes the basis on which fair value is determined.
Where the Group has a written put option in respect of a non-controlling 
interest and has an unavoidable obligation to purchase the shareholding, 
the obligation is recorded as a financial liability at fair value, rather than 
being reported as a separate component of equity. Changes to the fair 
value of the financial liability are recorded at each period end in the 
income statement within financial income or financial expenses.
On purchase or sale of a non-controlling interest held in a Group 
subsidiary, the Group recognises increases or decreases in the value of 
its interest directly in equity providing there is no overall change in 
control. As such, these transactions do not result in goodwill or gains and 
losses being recognised in the consolidated income statement. When 
control is lost, any remaining interest in equity is remeasured to fair value 
and a gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
( i v ) 	 t r an s a c t ion s 	 e limin at e d 	 on 	 c on s oli d at ion
Intra-group balances and any unrealised gains or income and expenses 
arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated in preparing 
the consolidated financial statements. Unrealised gains arising from 
transactions with associates and jointly controlled entities are eliminated 
to the extent of the Group’s interest in the entity. Unrealised losses are 
eliminated in the same way as unrealised gains but only to the extent 
that there is no evidence of impairment.
( v ) 	 Ac qui s i t ion 	 in 	 s t age s
Where the Group gains control of a subsidiary undertaking through 
a step acquisition, the existing interest owned is remeasured at fair value 
with the difference between fair value and book value being recognised 
in the income statement. The accounting impact of changes in share 
ownership which do not affect control is accounted for directly in equity.
( vi ) 	 Ac qui s i t ion 	 rel at e d 	 expen s e s
Acquisition related expenses comprise amortisation of business 
combination intangibles, other acquisition and merger related expenses 
and remuneration for post-combination services. Directly attributable 
acquisition costs are expensed in the consolidated income statement 
as incurred. 
( v ii ) 	 c on t inge n t 	 c on s i d e r at ion
Contingent consideration is accounted for at fair value on the acquisition 
date with subsequent changes in the fair value being recognised in the 
income statement. Contingent consideration dependent upon continuing 
service of an employee is charged to the income statement over the 
related service period within acquisition related expenses (Note 13) 
and is included within operating profit. Contingent consideration is 
discounted to present value where the time value of money is material.

Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded at the rate

transaction for each entity. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the 
functional currency spot rate ruling at the reporting date. Foreign 
exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the 
income statement (except for differences arising on the retranslation 
of a financial liability designated as a hedge of the net investment 
in a foreign operation, or qualifying cash flow hedges, which are 
recognised directly in equity). Non-monetary assets and liabilities 
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are 
translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates 
ruling at the dates the fair values were determined. 118 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Convertible bonds
Convertible bonds are separated into three components: liability, 
issuer call option and equity at inception. Each component is 
recognised separately.
The initial fair value of the liability component of the convertible 
bond is determined using the market interest rate for an equivalent 
non-convertible bond and is subsequently recorded at an amortised 
cost basis using the effective interest method until extinguished on 
conversion or maturity of the bonds. The issuer call option is fair 
valued using a valuation model and is measured at each balance sheet 
date with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. 
The remainder of the proceeds are recognised in shareholders’ equity 
in a separate convertible bond reserve.
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and equity components 
of a convertible bond based on the allocation of proceeds to the liability 
and equity components when the instruments are first recognised.
Derivatives
Derivatives are accounted for in accordance with the policy in 
Note 1(E)(iii).
Derecognition
The Group derecognises a financial liability when the contractual 
obligations to pay the contractual cash flows on the financial liability 
are discharged, cancelled or expire. 
For convertible bonds, derecognition occurs on the date on which an 
irrevocable conversion notice to convert the bond to ordinary shares 
is received from the bond holder. The carrying value of the bond at 
the date of derecognition is extinguished and replaced by the nominal 
value of the ordinary share capital being issued with the balance being 
recognised in the share premium account, notwithstanding that the 
relevant ordinary shares may not have been legally issued on the date 
of derecognition. No gains or losses are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement on conversion.
( iii ) 	 Deri v at i ve 	 fi n anc i al 	 in s t r umen t s
The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge its exposure 
to foreign exchange, interest rate and fuel price risks arising from 
operational, financing and investment activities. In accordance with its 
treasury policy, the Group does not hold or issue derivative financial 
instruments for trading purposes. However, derivatives that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments.
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value 
on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. The method of recognising the resulting gain 
or loss depends on whether the derivative is designated as a hedging 
instrument and if so the nature of the item being hedged. 
The gain or loss on remeasurement to fair value on derivatives not 
designated as hedging instruments is recognised immediately in the 
income statement against the opposite line of income or expense. 
The accounting policy for derivatives that qualify for hedge accounting 
is included in Note 1(F).

Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets at fair value through profit or loss are measured at 
fair value after initial recognition. The gain or loss is included in the 
consolidated income statement. Note 1(W) describes the basis on 
which fair value is determined.
Derivatives
Derivatives are accounted for in accordance with the policy in 
Note 1(E)(iii).
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits 
which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and which are 
subject to insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original 
maturity of three months or less. Where the Group operates centrally 
pooled accounts and has the intention and ability to pool account 
balances, the net cash or overdraft position is disclosed. Where the 
intention or ability to pool balances together is absent, the cash and 
overdraft are disclosed on a gross basis in the consolidated balance 
sheet and the overdraft is excluded from cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose of the consolidated statement of cash flows.
Where cash and cash equivalent balances are not available for use by 
the Group, for example to meet regulatory requirements, this fact is 
disclosed and the balances are excluded from available net debt.
Derecognition
The Group derecognises a financial asset when the contractual 
rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or it transfers the 
rights to receive the contractual cash flows on the financial asset 
in a transaction in which substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership of the financial asset are transferred. Any interest 
in transferred financial assets that is created or retained by the 
Group is recognised as a separate asset or liability.
( ii ) 	 F in anc i al 	 li abili t ie s
Financial liabilities are either classified as financial liabilities measured at 
amortised cost, or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. 
Financial liabilities include trade and other payables (excluding tax 
and social security and deferred income), accruals, finance debt and 
derivative financial instruments. The Group determines the classification 
of its financial liabilities at initial recognition. Financial liabilities are 
recognised initially at fair value, normally being the transaction price plus, 
in the case of financial liabilities not at fair value through profit or loss, 
directly attributable transaction costs. The subsequent measurement 
of financial liabilities depends on their classification, as follows:
Financial liabilities measured at amortised cost
All financial liabilities are initially recognised at fair value. For interest-
bearing loans and borrowings this is the fair value of the proceeds 
received net of issue costs associated with the borrowing. After initial 
recognition, financial liabilities other than those at fair value through 
profit or loss are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the 
effective interest method. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into 
account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement. 
Gains and losses arising on the repurchase, settlement or cancellation 
of liabilities are recognised respectively in interest, other revenues and 
finance costs. This category of financial liabilities includes trade and 
other payables. TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014 119

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
When a hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge 
accounting, expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity 
revokes designation of the hedge relationship, hedge accounting is 
discontinued prospectively. If the hedged forecast transaction is still 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in 
equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the 
transaction occurs. If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to 
take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity 
is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately.

Revenue represents the aggregate amount earned from inclusive tours, 
scheduled and charter flying, provision of incoming agency destination 
services, travel agency and intermediary commission received and other 
services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business. 
Revenue excludes intra-group transactions and is stated after the 
deduction of trade discounts and sales taxes. Revenue is reported gross 
of fixed charges which are a liability of the tour operator or airline. 
These include Air Passenger Duty and other per passenger charges 
and levies, including the ATOL Protection Contribution in the UK.
( i ) 	 Revenue 	 recog ni t ion
Revenue is recognised in the consolidated income statement when 
the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred 
to the buyer. Travel agency and intermediary commissions and other 
revenues received from the sale of third party product are recognised 
when they are earned, typically on receipt of final payment. Revenue 
in respect of our own holidays and services is recognised on the date 
of departure. Revenue from individual travel modules directly booked 
by the customer with airlines, hotels and incoming agencies is recognised 
when the customer departs or uses the respective service. Revenue 
from the sale of travel insurance is recognised at the point of sale.
No revenue is recognised if there are significant uncertainties regarding 
recovery of the consideration due or associated costs.

Where the Group acts as principal, revenue is stated at the contractual 
value of services provided.
Where the Group acts as an agent between the service provider and the 
end customer, revenue is presented on a net basis as the difference 
between the sales price to the customer and the cost of the services 
purchased and not the total transaction sales value. Businesses are 
identified as intermediaries dependent on a number of criteria, 
principally including the control exercised over the provision of service, 
inventory risk and customer credit risk.

Operating lease rental income is recognised in operating income

( iv ) 	 S h are 	 c api t al
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of ordinary shares and share awards are 
recognised as a deduction from equity, net of any tax effects.
In respect of ordinary shares being issued following the receipt of an 
irrevocable conversion notice from holders of the convertible bonds, 
these are considered to be fully paid on the date of the extinguishment 
of the liability and included within the share capital notwithstanding that 
they may not have been legally issued on the date of derecognition.
(F ) 	h edge 	 a ccountin g
The Group designates certain derivatives as cash flow hedges of highly 
probable forecast transactions. 
On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the 
relationship between the hedging instrument(s) and hedged item(s), 
including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking 
the hedge transaction, together with the methods that will be used 
to assess the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group 
makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship 
as well as on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments 
are expected to be ’highly effective’ in hedging cash flows during the 
period for which the hedge is designated and whether the actual 
results of each hedge are within a range of 80-125%. The transaction 
being hedged should be highly probable to occur and should present 
an exposure to variations in cash flows that could ultimately affect 
reported net income. 
Where a derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedge of the 
variability in cash flows arising from a recognised asset or liability, or 
a highly probable forecast transaction, the effective part of any fair 
value gain or loss on the derivative financial instrument is recognised 
directly in the hedging reserve. Any ineffective portion of the hedge 
is recognised immediately within the consolidated income statement.
When the forecast transaction subsequently results in the recognition 
of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the associated 
cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and is 
included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the non-financial 
asset or liability. If a hedge of a forecast transaction subsequently 
results in the recognition of a financial asset or a financial liability, 
the associated gains and losses that were recognised directly in equity 
are reclassified into the consolidated income statement in the same 
period or periods during which the asset acquired or liability assumed 
affects profit or loss.
For cash flow hedges, other than those covered by the preceding two 
paragraphs, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from 
equity and recognised in the consolidated income statement in the 
same period or periods during which the hedged forecast transaction 
affects the consolidated income statement.
Prospective hedge testing is performed at the inception of the hedge 
relationship and subsequently at each balance sheet date, through 
comparison of the critical terms of the hedged forecast transaction 
and the hedging instrument using regression analysis. Retrospective 
hedge testing is performed at each reporting date principally using 
a dollar offset analysis, comparing the cumulative changes in the fair 
values of the forecast hedged transaction and the hedging instrument. 120 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

The Group’s share award programmes allow certain Group employees 
to acquire shares of the Company. These shares are awarded by the 
Company. For equity-settled transactions, the fair value of services 
is measured by the fair value of the shares at the time awarded and 
is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase 
in equity. The fair value is spread over the period during which the 
employees become entitled to the awards.
For cash-settled transactions, the resulting liability for the Group is 
charged to expenses at its fair value as at the date of the performance 
of the service by the beneficiary. Until payment of this liability, the 
fair value of the liability is remeasured at every reporting date and 
all changes are included in the consolidated income statement.
For both types of share-based payment transactions, the fair value 
of the awards is measured using option valuation models, taking into 
account the terms and conditions upon which the awards were made, 
including market performance conditions and the impact of non-vesting 
conditions. The amount recognised as an expense is adjusted to reflect 
the actual number of share awards that vest except where forfeiture 
is due only to market based performance conditions not meeting the 
threshold for vesting.

Financial income comprises interest income on cash and cash 
equivalents invested. Interest income is recognised as it accrues in 
profit or loss, using the effective interest method. Foreign currency 
gains and losses are reported on a net basis.
Financial expenses comprise interest expense on borrowings, unwinding 
of the discount on provisions and changes in the fair value of financial 
assets or liabilities at fair value through profit or loss. All borrowing costs 
are recognised in profit or loss using the effective interest method. 
Foreign currency gains and losses are reported on a net basis.

Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension plans 
are recognised as an expense in the consolidated income statement

( ii ) 	 De fi ne d 	 bene fi t 	 pl an s
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension plans 
is calculated separately for each plan by estimating the amount of 
future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service 
in current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine 
its present value and the fair value of any plan assets is deducted in 
calculating the overall net liability. The liability discount rate is the yield 
at the balance sheet date on AA credit-rated bonds denominated in 
the currency of, and having the same maturity dates approximating to, 
the terms of the Group’s obligations. The calculation is performed by 
a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
Where the calculation results in a benefit to the Group, the asset 
recognised is limited to the present value of any future refunds from 
the plan or reductions in future contributions to the plan which are 
under the control of the Group.
When the benefits of a plan are amended, the portion of the  
increase/decrease in benefit relating to past services by employees 
is recognised as an expense/income in the consolidated income 
statement immediately.
Remeasurements of the net defined pension liability, including actuarial 
gains and losses, are recognised immediately in other comprehensive 
income. Either monthly or annual contributions are made to funded 
schemes. The current service cost is included in the consolidated income 
statement as a personnel expense.
The interest charge on the net retirement benefit obligation is calculated 
by applying the applicable discount rate to the net retirement benefit 
obligations at the beginning of the financial year, taking account of any 
changes in the net retirement benefit obligation during the year as a 
result of contributions and benefit payments.  TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014 121

All business combinations are accounted for by applying the purchase 
method. Goodwill represents amounts arising on acquisition of 
subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates. Goodwill represents the 
difference between the fair value of consideration paid or payable and 
the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities acquired. Identifiable intangibles, such as brands and 
customer relationships, are those which can be sold separately or 
which arise from contractual or legal rights regardless of whether 
those rights are separable, and the fair value can be reliably measured. 
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is allocated to those cash generating units (CGUs) expected 
to benefit from the business combination and is not amortised but 
tested annually for impairment. Impairment testing is based on assets 
grouped at the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal 
management purposes. In respect of joint ventures and associates, the 
carrying amount of goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the 
investment in the joint venture or associate.
Fair value adjustments are made in respect of acquisitions. If, at 
the balance sheet date, the amounts of fair values of the acquiree’s 
identifiable assets and liabilities can only be established provisionally, 
then these values are used. Any adjustments to these values are taken 
as adjustments to goodwill and are recorded within 12 months of the 
acquisition. Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised in 
the income statement upon acquisition.

Computer software consists of all software that is not an integral part 
of the related computer hardware and is stated at cost less accumulated 
amortisation and impairment losses. 
Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes 
are recognised as an expense as incurred. Development costs that 
are directly attributable to the design and testing of identifiable and 
unique software products controlled by the Group are recognised 
as intangible assets when the following criteria are met:
• it is technically feasible to complete the software product so that 
it will be available for use;
• management intends to complete the software product and use 
or sell it;
• there is an ability to use or sell the software product;
• it can be demonstrated how the software product will generate 
probable future economic benefits;
• adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the 
development and to use or sell the software product are available; and
• the expenditure attributable to the software product during its 
development can be reliably measured.
Directly attributable costs that are capitalised as part of the software 
product include the software development employee costs and an 
appropriate portion of relevant overheads. Other development 
expenditures that do not meet these criteria are recognised as an 
expense as incurred. Development costs previously recognised as 
an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period. 
Licences and order books assets acquired in a business combination 
are recognised at fair value at the acquisition date, as detailed in 
Note 1 W(i). Licences have a finite useful life and are carried at cost 
less accumulated amortisation.

Deferred tax is provided or recognised using the balance sheet liability 
method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and 
the amounts used for taxation purposes. The following temporary 
differences are not provided for: the initial recognition of goodwill 
not deductible for tax purposes; the initial recognition of assets or 
liabilities in a transaction that is not a business combination; and 
differences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that 
they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future. The amount  
of deferred tax asset recognised is based on the expected manner 
of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and 
liabilities, using the tax rate at which the asset or liability is expected to 
reverse in future periods, based on tax laws enacted or substantively 
enacted at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally 
enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax 
liabilities and when the deferred tax assets and liabilities relate to 
income taxes levied by the same tax authority on either the taxable 
entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle 
the balances on a net basis. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to 
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available 
against which the asset can be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced 
to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax benefit 
will be realised.  
(L ) 	 Dividends
Dividend distribution to the Company’s shareholders is recognised as  
a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the 
dividends are appropriately authorised and approved for payment and 
are no longer at the discretion of the Company. Interim dividends are 
recognised when paid. Unpaid dividends that do not meet these 
criteria are disclosed in the notes to the financial statements.

number of ordinary shares outstanding for the effects of all dilutive 
potential ordinary shares. EPS measures for continuing operations 
have been presented in accordance with IAS 33. The Group also presents

The cost of major overhauls of owned airframes and engines is 
capitalised and depreciated over the period until the next scheduled 
major overhaul. 
The depreciation methods, useful economic lives and residual values 
are reassessed annually. Revisions to useful economic lives and residual 
values are accounted for prospectively from the date of change.
Freehold land, assets under construction and advance payments 
(including capitalised borrowing costs for future aircraft) are not 
depreciated. Upon delivery of the aircraft, advance payments for 
aircraft that are subsequently owned are re-categorised to aircraft 
assets and depreciation is commenced. Advance payments for aircraft 
that are sold and leased back on delivery under an operating lease 
are accounted for as a disposal. Where the aircraft is leased back on 
a finance lease, as well as the disposal of the advance payment, an 
addition to aircraft is recorded at an amount equal to the lower of 
fair value of the aircraft and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments at the inception of the lease.

In respect of borrowing costs relating to qualifying assets, the Group

When a sale and leaseback results in a finance leaseback, any gain 
on the sale is deferred and recognised as income over the lease term. 
Any loss on the sale is immediately recognised in the profit and loss 
account if there is evidence that the asset’s carrying value exceeds 
the fair value. 
If the leaseback is classified as an operating lease, any gain is recognised 
immediately if the sale and leaseback terms are demonstrably at fair 
value. Otherwise, the sale and leaseback is accounted for as follows:
• If the sale price is below fair value, the gain or loss is recognised 
immediately, other than to the extent that a loss is compensated for 
by future rentals at a below-market price, then the loss is deferred 
and amortised over the period that the asset is expected to be used.
• If the sale price is above fair value, any gain is deferred 
and amortised over the useful life of the asset.
• If the fair value of the asset is less than the carrying amount 
of the asset at the date of the transaction, then that difference 
is recognised immediately as a loss on the sale.

A financial asset is assessed at each reporting date to determine 
whether there is any objective evidence that it is impaired or whenever 
events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount 
may not be recoverable. A financial asset is considered to be impaired 
if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a 
negative effect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset is calculated as the 
difference between its carrying amount and its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss in respect of an available for sale financial asset 
is calculated by reference to its fair value. The recoverable amount 
of the Group’s receivables which are carried at amortised cost is 
calculated as the present value of estimated future cash flows, 
discounted at the original effective interest rate (i.e. the effective 
interest rate computed at initial recognition of these financial assets). 
Receivables with a short duration are not discounted.

Inventories are measured at the lower of cost or net realisable value. 
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price less the estimated 
costs incurred until the sale and the estimated variable costs required 
to sell. All inventories are written down individually where the net 
realisable value of inventories is lower than their carrying amounts. 
The measurement method applied to similar inventory items is the 
weighted average cost formula. Spare parts and servicing equipment 
are classified as property, plant and equipment rather than inventory 
when they meet the definition of property, plant and equipment, which 
includes the expectation that they will be used for more than one 
financial year.
(S) 	 P r o visi ons
A provision is recognised in the consolidated balance sheet when the 
Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event; 
it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation; and the outflow of economic benefits can be 
reliably estimated. If the effect is material, provisions are determined 
by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that 
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the liability.
( i ) 	 M ain t en anc e 	 p rov i s ion 	 for 	 le a s e d 	 airc r af t
To reflect the legal obligations placed upon the Group under the terms 
of certain operating leases, provision is made for the maintenance, 
overhaul and repair costs of operating leased airframes, engines 
and certain other components. The provision is based on the present 
value of the anticipated external costs of the next maintenance 
event calculated by reference to costs experienced and published 
manufacturers’ data. The charge to the consolidated income statement 
is calculated by reference to the number of hours and cycles flown and 
by reference to the length of the full overhaul cycle. Costs incurred are 
charged against the provision. Neither the timing nor the value of the 
expenditure can be precisely determined but they can be averaged 
over time and over a fleet. The unwinding of discounted values is 
charged to the consolidated income statement as a financial expense.
( ii ) 	 Re s t r uc t uring 	 p rov i s ion
A provision for restructuring is recognised when the Group has approved 
a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either 
has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating costs 
are not provided for.
( iii ) 	 O nerou s 	 con t r ac t s
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected 
benefits to be derived by the Group from the contract are lower than 
the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract.  
The provision is measured at the present value of the lower of the 
expected cost of terminating the contract and the expected net cost  
of continuing with the contract. Before a provision is established, the 
Group recognises any impairment loss on the assets associated with 
that contract. 
Significant financial assets are tested for impairment on an individual 
basis. The remaining financial assets are assessed collectively in groups 
that share similar credit risk characteristics.
All impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairments 
of loans to joint ventures and associates, including losses recognised 
when the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made 
payments on behalf of a joint venture or associate, are recognised 
within the share of the result of joint ventures and associates and 
included within operating profit. Any cumulative loss in respect of 
an available for sale financial asset previously recognised in equity is 
recycled to profit or loss. An impairment loss is reversed if the reversal 
can be related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment 
loss can be recognised.
For financial assets measured at amortised cost and available for sale 
financial assets that are debt securities, the reversal is recognised in 
profit or loss. For available for sale financial assets that are equity 
securities, the reversal is recognised in other comprehensive income.
( ii ) 	n on - fi n anc i al 	 a s s e t s
The carrying amount of the Group’s non-financial assets, other than 
inventory and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet 
date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. 
If such an indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
For goodwill, the recoverable amount is estimated at each balance 
sheet date.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of 
an asset or its CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable 
amount of an asset or CGU is the greater of its value in use and fair 
value less costs to sell. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset. 
A CGU is the smallest identifiable group of assets that generates cash 
inflows that are largely independent of the cash inflows from other 
assets or groups of assets. The largest unit to which goodwill is 
allocated is an operating segment level as defined in IFRS 8 before 
applying aggregation criteria. Note 3 contains further details of the 
Group’s operating segments.
Impairment losses are recognised in profit or loss. Impairment losses 
recognised in respect of CGUs are allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to reduce the 
carrying amount of other assets in the unit on a pro-rata basis. An 
impairment loss in respect of goodwill is not reversed. In respect of other 
assets, impairment losses recognised in prior periods are assessed at 
each reporting date for any indications that the loss has decreased or 
no longer exists. An impairment loss is reversed if there has been a 
change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have 
been determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment 
loss had been recognised. 124 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Brands are calculated by reference to the royalty rate that could be 
supported by the individual business unit profit margin, weighted for 
the strength of the brand acquired. Appropriate tax and discount rates 
are also applied to the valuation. Customer relationships are valued 
using the excess earnings methodology, which calculates the present 
value of the earnings the asset generates, net of a reasonable return 
on other assets also contributing to that stream of earnings. Inputs to 
the excess earnings methodology include applicable forecast sales to 
which the customer relationship contribute, the deduction of returns 
on all other assets and appropriate discount and tax rates.
( ii ) 	i nve s t men t s 	 in 	 e qui t y 	 and 	 de b t 	 s ec uri t ie s
The fair value of financial assets at fair value through profit or loss and 
available for sale financial assets is determined by reference to their 
quoted closing bid price at the reporting date, where available. If there 
is no market price available, the fair value is calculated based on other 
valuation techniques, including assessments of future cash flows, 
estimated selling price and other available information. The fair value 
of held to maturity investments is determined on initial recognition 
and thereafter for disclosure purposes only.
( iii ) 	t r ade 	 and 	 o t her 	 rec ei v ab le s
Trade receivables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently 
recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
as reduced by allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
An allowance for irrecoverable amounts is established when there is 
objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts 
due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of 
allowance is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and 
the present value of estimated future cash flows.
( i v ) 	t r ade 	 p a y ab le s
Trade payables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently 
recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
( v ) 	 Deri v at i ve s
The fair value of foreign currency contracts, fuel forward contracts and 
option contracts is their forward market price at the balance sheet date, 
based on external valuations or internal valuations using market data. 
( v i ) 	n on - deri v at i ve 	 fi n anc i al 	 li abili t ie s
Fair value, which is determined for disclosure purposes, is calculated 
based on the present value of future principal and interest cash flows, 
discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. For 
finance leases, the market rate of interest is determined by reference 
to similar lease agreements.
( v ii) 	 Sh are - b as e d 	 pa y men t s
The fair value of the shares awarded is measured using option 
valuation models, taking into account the terms and conditions upon 
which the awards were made. The valuation basis is identical whether 
the awards will be settled in cash or shares.

( t ) 	 R elated 	 par ties
For the purpose of these consolidated financial statements, parties 
are considered to be related to the Group if the Group has the ability, 
directly or indirectly, to control the party or exercise significant influence 
over the party making financial and operating decisions, or vice versa, 
or where the Group and the party are subject to common control or 
significant influence. Related parties may be individuals or entities.
(U) 	 Segment 	 r epor tin g
An operating segment is a component of an entity that:
• engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues 
and incur expenses (including revenues and expenses relating 
to transactions with other components of the same entity);
• whose operating results and financial position are regularly 
reviewed by the chief operating decision maker to make decisions 
about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its 
performance; and
• for which discrete financial information is available.
As described in Note 3, all underlying operating items are allocated 
to the segment’s underlying profit except central costs and net 
financial expenses.
( v ) 	 Use 	 of 	 estimates 	 and 	 judgement s
The preparation of financial statements requires management to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the application 
of accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, 
income and expenses. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
Estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. 
Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which 
the estimates are revised and in any future periods affected. Details of 
critical judgements, significant estimates and assumptions are disclosed 
in the relevant notes to the consolidated financial statements. The key 
accounting estimates and judgements are described in Note 2.
( W ) 	 Determinati on 	 of 	 fa ir 	 values
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the 
determination of fair value, for both financial and non-financial assets 
and liabilities. Fair values have been determined for measurement and/
or disclosure purposes based on the following methods. When applicable, 
further information about the assumptions made in determining fair 
values is disclosed in the note specific to that asset or liability.
( i ) 	i nt ang ible 	 a s s e t s
The fair value of intangible assets recognised as a result of a business 
combination, including brands, customer relationships and the customer 
order book at the date of acquisition, is valued by reference to income-
based methods. For all intangible assets, current use is determined 
to be the highest and best use of that asset. Income-based methods 
estimate the future economic benefits to be derived from ownership 
of the asset by identifying, quantifying and separating cash flows 
attributable to the asset and capitalising their present value. TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014 125

2. 	 K e y 	 ac c o u n ti n g 	 esti ma t es 	 a n d 	 j u d g e m e n ts
The preparation of consolidated financial statements under adopted 
IFRS requires the Directors to make estimates and judgements that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, the disclosure 
of contingent assets and liabilities and the reported amount of revenue 
and expenses during the year. The Directors evaluate the estimates 
and judgements on an ongoing basis. Such estimates and judgements 
are based upon historical experience and other factors they believe to 
be reasonable under the circumstances. Actual results may differ from 
estimates. The Audit Committee has reviewed management’s selection, 
development and disclosure of the Group’s critical accounting policies 
and estimates and the applications of these policies and estimates. 
Key estimates and judgements have been made in respect of the 
following areas:
( A) 	 e stimates
i n t ang ib le 	 a s s e t s 	 – 	 G ood w ill 	 c arr y ing 	 v alue
A full impairment review has been performed of all goodwill, together 
with intangible assets and property, plant and equipment held across 
the Group on a CGU basis. In the current year, the impairment review 
has been performed on a ‘value in use’ basis for all CGUs, which requires 
estimation of future net operating cash flows, the time period over which 
they will occur and appropriate discount and growth rates. 
Significant estimates for revenues and costs are required in building 
financial budgets extending over a five year period, which are based 
upon internal and macroeconomic factors such as the Group’s strategy 
for each CGU, the brand strength within that CGU, consumer demand, 
supplier cost increases, oil prices and the penetration of differentiated 
holidays. All inputs into the Group’s long-term plans are challenged 
and considered by the Board until achievable and realistic budgets 
are approved. 
( X ) 	n ew 	 Standards 	 and 	 interpr et ati ons 	 not 	 y et 	 a dopted
The following standards are applicable to the Group and will be applied 
to the accounting period beginning on 1 October 2014:
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’. This new standard 
replaces all guidance on control and consolidation currently within 
IAS 27 and SIC 12 and builds on existing principles by identifying the 
concept of control as the determining factor in whether an entity 
should be included within the consolidated financial statements. 
The adoption of this new standard, including the amendment to 
IFRS 10 on transition guidance, is not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group’s profit before tax. 
• IFRS 11 ’Joint arrangements’. This new standard establishes 
principles for financial reporting by parties to a joint arrangement. 
The IFRS supersedes IAS 31 and SIC-13 and is concerned principally 
with the structure of the arrangement. Proportional consolidation  
of joint ventures is no longer allowed, but this itself will not impact 
the Group as all of the Group’s joint ventures are currently equity 
accounted. The adoption of this new standard, including the 
amendment to IFRS 11 on transition guidance, is not expected  
to have a material impact on the Group’s profit before tax. 
• IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’. This new standard 
sets out the required disclosures for entities reporting under the 
two new standards, IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’,  
and IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’ and replaces the disclosure 
requirements currently found in IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates’. 
The IFRS requires an entity to disclose information that enables 
users of financial statements to evaluate both the nature of, and 
risks associated with, its interests in other entities and the effects  
of those interests on its financial position, financial performance  
and cash flows. The adoption of this new standard, including the 
amendment to IFRS 12 on transition guidance, is not expected to 
have an impact on the Group’s results but will amend certain 
disclosures in relation to joint ventures and associates. 
• IAS 27 (revised 2011) ‘Separate financial statements’. This revision 
includes the provisions on separate financial statements that are left 
after the control provisions of IAS 27 have been included in the new 
IFRS 10. 
• IAS 28 (revised 2011) ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’. 
This revision includes the requirements for joint ventures, as well as 
associates, to be equity accounted following the issue of IFRS 11. 
• Amendments to IAS 32 on offsetting financial assets and liabilities. 
This amendment updates the application guidance in IAS 32 to 
clarify some of the requirements for offsetting financial assets and 
liabilities on the balance sheet. 
• IFRIC 21 ‘Levies’. This interpretation is in respect of IAS 37 
‘Provisions, contingent liabilities and contingent assets’, clarifying 
that the obligating event that gives rise to a liability is the activity 
described in the relevant legislation that triggers the payment of the 
levy. Management are currently assessing the impact of adopting 
this pronouncement. 126 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

This financial year saw the Group incur further costs to enable a new 
type of aircraft, the Boeing 787 Dreamliner, to continue to be brought 
into service. As part of the funding of these costs, the Group is entitled 
to certain credits from Boeing which in some cases are taken directly to 
the income statement and in others are used to offset against the cost 
of each aircraft. These are therefore reported as sale and leaseback 
profits in the income statement when the aircraft is delivered and the 
sale and leaseback transaction is executed. Significant judgement is 
involved in the accounting treatment of these credits, both in terms 
of recognition and classification in the income statement, since entry 
into service costs will continue to be incurred in the next financial year 
as further Boeing 787 deliveries occur and more aircraft are brought 
into service. 
S e p ar at e l y 	 di s c lo s e d 	 i t em s
Separately disclosed items are those significant items which in 
management’s judgement are highlighted by virtue of their size 
or incidence to enable a full understanding of the Group’s financial 
performance. Such items are included within the income statement 
caption to which they relate (Note 4).
i mp airmen t 	 o f 	 fi n anc i al 	 a s s e t s
In light of the ongoing challenging trading conditions in the Russian and 
Ukrainian source markets, together with the need for continued financial 
support from the Group, the Directors have considered the recoverability 
of term loans totalling £28m made to its joint venture that were made 
in previous years, the current year, and after the year end. 
R ev e n u e 	 re c og n i t io n
In recognising revenue, judgement is required in the consideration 
of whether each individual business acts as a principal or agent and 
whether revenues should be recognised on a gross or net basis, in 
accordance with IAS 18. Judgement is required when considering 
the balance of risk and rewards of the sale, including delivery and 
non-performance risk, credit risk, inventory risk and the ability to 
establish prices. 
L i ab i l i t ie s
In accounting for provisions, judgement is required in determining 
occurrence probability, maturity and level of risk. Judgement and 
estimation is required in determining aircraft maintenance, restructuring, 
legal (including denied boarding compensation) and onerous lease 
provisions. It is also required to determine the provision methodology 
and for certain provisions, considering external information on which to 
base the amount of provision. Due to the volume of transactions and the 
materiality of period end accruals, judgement is also required in respect 
of the recognition and derecognition of airline and accommodation 
operating accruals. Details of provisions made and the basis on which 
the provisions have been calculated are disclosed in Note 22 and the 
accounting policy is set out in Note 1(S).
2. 	 K e y 	 ac c o u n ti n g 	 esti ma t es 	 a n d 	 j u d g e m e n ts continued
For the purpose of the Group’s impairment testing, we have then 
considered the key inputs that can impact discounted cash flows the 
most, these being in relation to the discount rate and earnings growth 
(both within the long-term plans and thereafter). This year we have 
also used external advisers to assist in the calculation of the weighted 
average cost of capital, using more robust long-term data to reduce the 
impact of short-term stock market volatility. Further details, including 
sensitivity analysis, are given in Note 10 and the accounting policy is 
set out in Note 1(Q)(ii).
De fi ne d 	 bene fi t 	 pen s ion 	 pl an s
A qualified independent actuary undertakes the estimation of the 
present value of the Group’s obligations under defined benefit pension 
schemes using assumptions taken from a range of possible actuarial 
assumptions. These assumptions may not be borne out in practice, 
especially due to the long timescales involved. In particular, the valuation 
of scheme assets is based on the fair value at the balance sheet date. 
As these assets are not intended to be sold in the short term, their 
value may change significantly prior to realisation. In reviewing the work 
of the qualified independent actuary, management was required to 
exercise judgement to satisfy itself that appropriate weight had been 
afforded to macroeconomic factors. Details of the actual assumptions 
used, including sensitivity analysis, are set out in Note 6(C).
During the final quarter of the year, agreement was reached with the 
Trustees of our three main UK defined benefit pension schemes to 
give members not yet drawing their pension the option to exchange 
non-statutory future increases in their pension for a higher initial 
pension at retirement with only limited (statutory) increases to be 
applied thereafter. A one-off reduction in pension liabilities of £28m has 
been recognised in respect of this, with the key estimated assumption 
in this calculation being the expected level of take up of the option on 
retirement to be 40% of those members offered. This key assumption 
of 40% has been made based on the experience of the exercise 
undertaken during the first half of the financial year, which was with 
current (as opposed to future) pensioner members, considerations 
specific to the non-pensioner population and evidence from other 
similar exercises. If the assumption had been set at 5% lower or higher 
than 40%, both of which are reasonably possible changes to this 
assumption, the one-off credit in respect of the reduction in pension 
liabilities would have been £3.5m lower/higher.
Der iv at i ve 	 fi n anc i al 	 in s t r ument s
Judgement is required in the assessment of prospective effectiveness 
and specifically in the assessment of the probability of forecast 
transactions, both at hedge inception and during the period over which 
hedge accounting is adopted. The fair value of derivative financial 
instruments can also involve judgement. Where appropriate, external 
valuations from financial institutions are undertaken to support the 
carrying value of such items. Details of sensitivity analysis are set out 
in Note 26(K). TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014 127

The Group has, from time to time, contingent tax liabilities arising from 
trading and corporate transactions in the UK and overseas jurisdictions. 
After taking appropriate external advice, the Group makes provision for 
these liabilities based on the probable level of economic loss that may 
be incurred and which is reliably measurable. Items relating to open 
areas often require significant judgement, including the probability, 
timing and size of any amounts that may become payable. Judgements 
in respect of significant tax liabilities are given in Note 8. Judgement is 
also required in the assessment of the future recoverability of tax losses 
and recognition of deferred tax assets. Details of unrecognised tax 
losses are given in Note 14.
R ecover able 	 amount s 	 o f 	 depo s it s 	 and 	 prep a yment s
Judgements have been made in respect of the volumes of future trading 
with hoteliers and the credit-worthiness of those hoteliers in order to 
assess the recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments made to 
those hoteliers. Judgement can often be based upon an understanding 
of the financial strength of those hoteliers and the quality of, and 
demand for, each hotel over the coming seasons.
F air 	 v alue 	 me a s urement s
Management has to make judgements regarding the valuation of some 
financial instruments that use inputs that are not observable in active 
markets. These are disclosed in Note 26(H).

IFRS 8 requires segmental information to be presented on the same 
basis as that used for internal management reporting. Segmental 
information is reported by the Group’s business sectors to the Group 
Management Board (GMB). The GMB consists of tour operating and 
functional experts drawn from across the Group who execute TUI 
Travel’s day-to-day operations, allocate resources to and assess the 
performance of the operating segments. Consequently, the GMB is 
considered to be the chief operating decision maker for the purposes 
of IFRS 8.
Gr o up 	 struc tur e
The Group presents segmental information in respect of its Sectors. 
The businesses within our Mainstream Sector are reported via each 
key source market instead of regionally. Emerging Markets remains 
outside of the Mainstream Sector for internal management reporting 
purposes and is reported separately. 
The Mainstream Sector consists of the following source markets: 
UK & Ireland, Germany, France, the French scheduled airline, 
the Nordic countries, Canada, Belgium & Morocco, the Netherlands, 
Austria, Switzerland, Poland, Southern Europe and the Hotels division 
(comprising hotel management companies and joint ventures in 
hotel assets). 
Each source market represents an individual operating segment. 
Aggregation criteria is used to combine certain of these operating 
segments into reported segments.
The Specialist & Activity Sector operates under five divisions: 
Adventure, Education, North American Specialist, Events and Specialist 
Holidays Group. The Sector has over 100 international specialist and 
activity brands delivering a range of unique customer experiences. 
The Specialist & Activity Sector is considered to be one operating 
segment, in line with internal management reporting.
The Accommodation & Destinations (A&D) Sector provides a range 
of services in destinations to tour operators, travel agents, corporate 
clients and direct to the consumer worldwide. A&D consists of 
Online Accommodation (comprising Accommodation Wholesaler and 
Accommodation OTA) and Inbound Services. The A&D Sector in 
total is considered as one operating segment, in line with internal 
management reporting. 
The Emerging Markets Sector is a growing portfolio of travel businesses 
in the source markets of Russia, Ukraine, India and China and is 
considered to be one operating segment.
R epor table 	 and 	 r epor ted 	 segment s
The results of the UK & Ireland, Germany, Nordics and the French tour 
operator are reported separately due to the size and importance of 
these source markets and meeting the threshold for being individual 
reportable segments. The results for the French scheduled airline, 
Corsair, are shown separately to that of the French tour operator as it 
has a different business model to the rest of the Group’s integrated tour 
operators. All of the other Mainstream source markets, except for the 
Hotels division, meet the aggregation criteria set out in IFRS 8 and are 
reported as one segment, the Rest of Mainstream. All of the aggregated 
businesses are considered to be similar in nature and economically 
similar over the long term. The Hotels division is reported separately 
as this does not meet the aggregation criteria of IFRS 8. 
Emerging Markets, the Specialist & Activity and A&D Sectors are all 
reported as separate Sector totals as this is consistent with internal 
management reports.
All reportable segments derive their revenues from the sale of leisure 
travel and ancillary services. Segmental information for both the current 
and prior year has been presented using this structure. Corporate costs 
are in respect of central costs including finance, human resources, legal, 
facility costs and some information technology costs that do not relate 
to each business segment and hence are not allocated.
Information regarding the results of each reportable segment is provided 
below. Segmental performance is evaluated based on underlying 
operating profit and is measured consistently with underlying operating 
profit or loss in the consolidated financial statements and as defined in 
Note 1(B)(ii). Intersegmental sales and transfers reflect arm’s length 
prices as if sold or transferred to third parties. Financial income and 
expenses are not allocated to the reportable segments as this activity is 
managed by the Group’s treasury function which manages the overall 
net cash/debt position of the Group. No one customer exceeds 10% of 
external entity revenues in any segment. Goodwill impairment losses 
arising are detailed in Note 10 and are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement. 
Segment assets comprise capital expenditure (as this is the only measure 
of assets reported monthly to the GMB) and represent the amounts 
purchased in the year. 128 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

R estruc turin g 	 and 	 other 	 separately 	 disclosed 	 items
The overall charge of £30m includes £37m of restructuring costs. Within Mainstream these are primarily related to the ‘One Mainstream’ initiative 
and comprise: £14m in Germany arising from the restructure of support functions and the airline engineering department, £10m in France from 
the ongoing restructure of both the tour operator and the airline and £5m across other Mainstream businesses. In addition, £4m of restructuring 
charges have arisen in the Accommodation & Destinations Sector and £4m in Marine. There has then been £7m of credits arising from the profit 
on disposal of subsidiaries and the change in value of unhedged foreign currency derivative instruments relating to future seasons. 
Included in the year ended 30 September 2013 charge of £59m were: Mainstream restructuring costs of £29m which principally related to the 
restructuring programmes in the French tour operator and airline; £18m restructuring costs incurred across the Specialist & Activity Sector due 
to the removal of the Sector management team, the closure of a business in the Education division, further restructuring of the PEAK adventure 
business based in Melbourne, Australia and rationalisation of overseas bases in the Marine division; and £7m of restructuring costs across the 
Accommodation & Destinations Sector due to several programmes aimed at rationalising the business structure and moving to a number of 
regional shared service centres in Europe, Asia and the Americas. 
Air craf t 	 and 	 other 	 asset s
During the year ended 30 September 2014, a total credit of £6m has been recognised which arises from various aircraft transactions. £5m of this 
arose from sale and lease back transactions through taking delivery from Boeing of nine aircraft in the year, net of entry into service costs being 
incurred as additional Boeing 787 Dreamliners are brought into service. The comparative credit for various aircraft transactions for the year ended 
30 September 2013 was £18m. There was also a credit of £1m (2013: £5m credit) recognised in the year on finalising the disposal of the majority 
of our interests in The Airline Group Limited, the transaction completing in March 2014. 
P ensi on 	 r elated 	 cr edit	
The £67m non-cash credit recognised in the year ended 30 September 2014 arose mainly from two UK pension transactions which generated 
a total credit of £61m. During the first half of the year the current pensioner members of the three main UK defined benefit pension schemes 
were given the option to exchange non-statutory future increases in their pension for a higher pension now with only limited (statutory) increases 
to be applied in future years. The level of acceptances reduced the present value of future pension liabilities and the resulting credit has been 
taken to the consolidated income statement under IAS 19 (revised) as it represents a change in plan benefits. Net of adviser costs, the credit to 
the consolidated income statement arising from this transaction was £33m. 
In the fourth quarter, agreement was also reached with the Trustees of these three pension schemes to make the same option available to the 
members not yet drawing their pension and such members were notified in September. An assumption with respect to the expected level of take up 
of the option on retirement has been made based on the experience with current pensioner members, considerations specific to the non-pensioner 
population and evidence from other similar exercises and applying this assumption has resulted in a one-off reduction in pension liabilities of 
£28m. This credit has also been taken to the consolidated income statement under IAS 19 (revised) as it represents a change in plan benefits.
In addition to the UK transactions, in Norway management agreed with the employees to close the defined benefit pension scheme and move the 
members into a defined contribution scheme. This change has been classified as a settlement gain on scheme closure under IAS 19 (revised) and the 
resultant reduction in accrued pension liabilities of £4m has been recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which it occurred.
During the year ended 30 September 2013, the management and works council of TUI Nederland NV agreed to close their defined benefit pension 
scheme and replace it with a defined contribution scheme. This change was also classified as a past service gain under IAS 19 (revised) and the 
resultant reduction in accrued pension liabilities of £14m was recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which it occurred. 
The management of TUI Nederland NV and the pension scheme trustees also agreed to transfer the existing pension fund assets and liabilities to 
AEGON, a multinational life insurance, pensions and asset management company headquartered in the Netherlands. This transfer of the pension 
assets and liabilities generated a further credit in the consolidated income statement of £11m.
v A t	 r egularisati on
During the year ended 30 September 2014, advice was taken on the VAT position of Hotelbeds Product SLU, registered in Spain and located in the 
Canary Islands. Given the stricter interpretation of VAT regulations in Spain relating to businesses operating in the Canary Islands, the external advice 
received was to regularise the VAT position. Therefore during the year additional VAT payments of £40m have been made which relate to years 
prior to the current financial year and so have been included within separately disclosed items. A final payment of approximately £1m is expected 
to be made before the end of the calendar year to finalise the matter and has been accrued for accordingly. Late payment interest of £3m relating 
to this item has been included within financial expenses.
Li ti g ati o n 	 p r o v isi o ns
At the year end the Group has continued to assess the likely outcome of the legal actions in which it is involved and, in accordance with IAS 37, has 
recognised provisions where it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation. This year the process 
has resulted in a charge to the consolidated income statement of £1m. 
In the year ended 30 September 2013, the Group’s assessment of the likely outcome of the legal actions in which it was then involved resulted in 
a charge to the consolidated income statement of £13m (€15m) in respect of the penalties agreed with the Spanish tax authorities on 11 October 
2013 under the terms of the settlement reached. 131 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

The Group operates pension schemes for employees eligible and wishing to participate in the schemes. These comprise both defined contribution 
and defined benefit schemes. Pension obligations vary reflecting the different legal and market conditions in each country of operation. Defined 
contribution schemes are funded by the payment of contributions to private and state-run organisations, whilst defined benefit schemes comprise 
both funded and unfunded schemes. The assets of all the funded defined benefit schemes are held separately from the assets of the Group.
De fi ne d 	 cont r ibu t ion 	 s c heme s 	 for 	 emplo yee s 	 and 	 Direc t or s 	
Current contributions are recognised as an expense in the year and, once paid, the Group has no further liability. 
De fi ne d 	 bene fi t 	 pen s ion 	 s c heme s 	
The movement of defined benefit pension obligations and assets is detailed below, summarised as the UK making up 85% (2013: 86%) of the Group’s 
defined benefit obligation (DBO), Germany making up 12% (2013: 10%) and Other making up 3% (2013: 4%). Other obligations include funded 
schemes in Ireland, the Netherlands (up until the date of closure of this scheme in the year ended 30 September 2013), Switzerland and Norway 
(up until the date of closure in the current financial year), whilst the main unfunded arrangements are in Austria and France. Almost all UK schemes 
are funded whilst German schemes are unfunded. 
The three largest UK Schemes are the Britannia Airways Limited Superannuation and Life Assurance Scheme, the TUI Pension Scheme (UK) and 
the Thomson Airways Pension Scheme and, at 30 September 2014, they account for 99.6% (2013: 99.6%) of the UK’s DBO. These funded Schemes 
are closed to new members with the level of retirement benefit generally based on capped pensionable salary at retirement and length of service.
The principal unfunded Schemes in Germany are shown below. These were all subject to a full actuarial valuation within three months preceding 
the balance sheet date:
Scheme name Status
Versorgungsordnung’ Hapag-Lloyd Fluggesellschaft GmbH Open to new members
Versorgungsordnung’ TUI Deutschland GmbH Closed to new members
Versorgungsordnung’ TUI Leisure Travel GmbH Closed to new members
Unless otherwise stated, the information included within sections (i) – (vii) of this note below relates to the Group’s UK DBO. 
( i ) 	 Role 	 o f 	t r u s t ee s	
The UK Schemes are funded with the assets held in separate trustee administered funds. The Trustees comprise representatives appointed by 
both the employer and Scheme members and include independent Trustees. The Trustees are required by law to act in the interest of all relevant 
beneficiaries and are responsible in particular for the asset investment policy plus the day-to-day administration of the benefits. They are also 
responsible for jointly agreeing with the employer the level of contributions. 
( ii ) 	 F u n ding 	 re q uir e me n t s	
Valuations of the Schemes are made by qualified actuaries using market-based valuations for assets and the projected unit method for liabilities. 
UK legislation requires that pension schemes are funded prudently (i.e. to a level in excess of the current expected cost of providing benefits). 
Within 15 months following each valuation date, the Trustees and the Group must agree the contributions required (if any) to ensure that the 
Schemes are fully funded over time on a suitably prudent measure. Contributions agreed in this manner constitute a minimum funding requirement.
As part of the funding of the UK Schemes, the Group has established a Pension Funding Partnership arrangement (PFP) including TUI Travel Amber 
Scot LP (SLP) and TUI Travel Amber E&W LLP (LLP), together the Partnerships. The main operating brands of the UK business, namely Thomson 
and First Choice, were transferred to the LLP and the three largest pension Schemes subscribed for interests in the LLP via the SLP. TUI UK Limited 
pays a royalty to the LLP for the use of the brands. The Britannia Airways Limited Superannuation and Life Assurance Scheme, the TUI Pension 
Scheme (UK) and the Thomson Airways Pension Scheme in aggregate are entitled to an annual income distribution of approximately £17m. The PFP 
has a life of 15 years from inception in 2011, after which the Schemes will receive a payment equal to their outstanding funding deficit, up to a 
maximum of £275m in aggregate, in return for their interest in the PFP.
The Partnerships are controlled by the Group and their results are consolidated by the Group. There is no net impact on the consolidated balance 
sheet, equity, the IAS 19 (revised) deficit, or the consolidated income statement. The investment held by the pension Schemes does not meet the 
definition of a scheme asset under IAS 19 (revised), and is therefore not included within the fair value of Scheme assets disclosed in the consolidated 
financial statements. The recognition of the brand assets in the consolidated financial statements remains unaffected by the establishment of the 
PFP, although the Thomson and First Choice brands, the latter of which is recognised on the consolidated balance sheet, are now being held as 
security for the PFP. See Note 10 for further information.  133 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Valuations for the Britannia Airways Limited Superannuation and Life Assurance Scheme, the TUI Pension Scheme (UK) and the Thomson Airways 
Pension Scheme are currently held every two years and the latest valuations were undertaken as at 31 March 2012 by independent actuaries 
appointed by the Trustees. Agreement on the 2012 Scheme valuations and associated funding contributions was reached in September 2013. Based 
upon these valuations, employer contributions to the funded UK Schemes are expected to be £82m (2013: £116m) over the next year, including £17m 
(2013: £17m) in respect of income distribution from the PFP. Details of the current funding commitments of these three UK Schemes are shown in 
the table below. In addition to this funding, there is a performance related payment, based on the higher of annual growth in declared dividend 
payments or annual growth in underlying earnings before interest, tax and amortisation, measured on a constant currency basis. Once annual growth 
reaches 7%, payment is triggered, at the rate of £0.33m per 0.1% of growth above 7% up to annual growth of 10%. At 10%, the rate increases to 
£0.5m per 0.1%, subject to a cap of £85m for total deficit contributions, inclusive of the PFP payment of £17m. 
The PFP contributions will terminate in 2026. The current level of deficit contributions detailed below are scheduled to end in October 2021, although 
they are subject to revision by the funding valuations. The performance related payment element of deficit funding is scheduled to end in 2016.

The sensitivity analysis above has been determined based on reasonably possible changes of the respective assumptions occurring at the end of the 
financial year and may not be representative of the actual change. It is based on the key assumptions while holding all other assumptions constant. 
The approach used in preparing the sensitivity analysis did not change compared with the previous financial year. Sensitivity analysis for Other 
Schemes has not been provided as there is no reasonably possible change to an assumption that would lead to a materially different DBO than 
currently recognised.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
( vii ) 	 R i s k s
Approximately 85% (2013: 86%) of the Group’s defined benefit obligations as at 30 September 2014 are concentrated in the UK and this exposes 
the Group to a number of financial risks (asset risk, interest rate risk, inflation risk and foreign exchange risk) and demographic risk (mortality risk).
Asset risk
59% (2013: 64%) of the main UK Scheme’s assets are invested in equity, property and alternatives which are expected to outperform corporate 
bonds in the long term, but are likely to increase the volatility of the balance sheet and risk of deficit in the short term. Investing in these asset classes 
also creates concentration and liquidity risk. Concentration risk is the risk that the performance of a single investment might negatively impact on 
the Trustees‘ ability to meet their objectives. Liquidity risk is the risk of a shortfall in cash relative to the short-term liabilities. 
During the current financial year, two of the three main UK Schemes implemented Liability driven investment (LDI) strategies. The aim of these 
strategies is to invest in assets that hedge against interest rate risk and inflation risk (mentioned below).
The allocation of assets is reviewed by the Trustees to ensure it remains appropriate given the Schemes‘ long-term objectives and 
liquidity requirements.
Interest rate risk
All Schemes are subject to interest rate risk, where a decrease in corporate bond yields would increase the value placed on the DBO for accounting 
purposes, resulting in an increased deficit. However, this is partially mitigated by investing 41% (2013: 36%) in government bonds (gilts), corporate 
bonds, LDI and cash.
Inflation rate risk
A significant proportion of the Group’s DBO is indexed in line with price inflation, specifically inflation in the UK Retail Price Index and Consumer 
Price Index, subject to defined caps and collars. Inflation risk is considered less significant due to the use of the caps and collars, such as pension 
increases not being fully linked to inflation. Additionally, the three main UK Schemes collectively hold some inflation-linked assets, which provide 
a partial hedge against higher than expected increases in inflation. 
Foreign exchange risk
Overseas Schemes account for 15% (2013: 14%) of the Group‘s DBO and face similar risks compared to the UK Schemes, including asset risk, where 
funded. The Group faces two types of foreign exchange risk. The first is from assets within the UK Scheme that are denominated in a currency 
other than Sterling, the second from the consolidation of the Group’s overseas Schemes that are in a functional currency other than Sterling. This 
latter risk is increased where a Scheme is unfunded, as foreign exchange movements on those Schemes‘ DBO are not matched by a corresponding 
foreign exchange movement in related assets. 
Mortality risk
The majority of the Schemes’ obligations are to provide benefits for the life of the member, so increases in life expectancy will result in an increase 
in the liability.
The Group has recently taken steps to reduce exposure to inflation and mortality risks. In November 2013, the Group commenced a Pension Increase 
Exchange (PIE) exercise with pensioner members of the three main UK schemes. Members were given the option to exchange non-statutory 
increases for a higher initial annual pension which increases in line with lower statutory requirements. 28% of members who received this offer 
chose to accept it, and this became effective from 1 April 2014. This exercise gave rise to a past service credit of £33m, net of adviser costs in the 
consolidated income statement.
In the fourth quarter of the year ending 30 September 2014, a second PIE exchange was implemented, to introduce PIE as part of the normal 
retirement options for all active and deferred members. This exercise gave rise to a past service credit of £28m, net of adviser costs in the 
consolidated income statement. Further details of the calculation of this credit is given in Note 2(A).
( viii ) 	 Pa s t 	 s er vic e 	 co s t s 	 and 	 s e t t lement s
Details of the Group’s PIE and the impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2014 are included above.
The Norwegian defined benefit Scheme was closed in the financial year and the Scheme assets were used to buy insurance policies covering 
accumulated benefits. The closure of this Scheme generated a settlement gain of £4m, disclosed as a separately disclosed item in the consolidated 
income statement.
In the year ended 30 September 2013, the management and Works Council of TUI Nederland NV agreed to close the defined benefit pension Scheme 
and transferred those pension fund assets and liabilities to AEGON, a multinational life insurance, pensions and asset/management company 
headquartered in the Netherlands. The closure and transfer of assets and liabilities resulted in a past service credit of £14m and a settlement 
credit of £11m, both disclosed as separately disclosed items in the consolidated income statement. 136 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

The Company operates three principal share award schemes which are designed to link remuneration to the future performance of the Group. The 
schemes are the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme (DABS) and the Deferred Annual Bonus Long-Term Incentive 
Scheme (DABLIS). All shares under these schemes involve both service and performance conditions and are awarded at nil cost to participants.
The DABLIS scheme is described below and the other two schemes are described in the Remuneration Report along with the relevant vesting criteria. 138 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

In addition to the above shares, there are 2,813,458 (2013:3,118,873) deferred shares that are outstanding and allocated, but not subject to 
performance conditions, in relation to the Deferred Annual Bonus Scheme. These are due to vest between 7 December 2014 and 12 December 2016.
In respect of the Deferred Annual Bonus Long-Term Incentive Scheme there are an additional 4,411,903 (2013: 4,465,568) deferred shares that 
are outstanding and allocated but which are not subject to performance conditions. These are due to vest between 7 December 2014 and

No material awards have been made to date under the Group’s HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan, which is an all-employee share plan. 
The fair value of services received in return for shares awarded during the year is measured by reference to the fair value of the shares awarded. 
The fair value at the date the shares were awarded has been estimated using a binomial methodology for all schemes except where there is a 
market-based performance condition attached to vesting, in which case a Monte Carlo simulation was used. The principal assumptions required 
by these methodologies were:

The Deferred Annual Bonus Long-Term Incentive Scheme (DABLIS) is for participants below the GMB level and requires a 25% deferral of any 
annual performance bonus award into shares. Matching shares may also be awarded up to four times the deferred amount and are subject to the 
achievement of stretching performance conditions over a three year period. Awards of deferred and matching shares are subject to forfeiture 
conditions until the release date. The earliest point at which the shares are eligible for release is at the end of three years following deferral. 
For awards of matching shares made during the year, no shares will vest unless the annual average of the ratio of the Group’s return on invested 
capital (ROIC) to the weighted average cost of capital (WACC) meets or exceeds one over the three year period. A hurdle of ROIC, being at least 
equal to WACC, is used to ensure that the relevant long-term incentive awards pay out only when shareholder value is being created over the 
performance periods. If the ROIC/WACC hurdle is met, shares will only vest to the extent to which three further performance conditions are 
satisfied over the three year period as follows:
• Up to half of the matching shares will vest based on achievement of an aggregate EBITA profit target for the participants’ Sector over the three 
year performance period.

Comparative figures for the year ended 30 September 2013 have been restated to reflect the adoption of revised IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’. 
Further details are provided in Note 1.
Following a review of the Group’s deferred tax balances in the year, the Directors have written off certain deferred tax assets totalling £26m where 
there is no longer sufficient certainty of the timing of any benefits that might arise in the future and which have been treated as a separately disclosed 
tax item for the purpose of calculating underlying earnings per share, as disclosed in Note 33. As part of this review, £23m of deferred tax liabilities 
have been written back to reserves in the year, principally in respect of the convertible bonds.
In the year ended 30 September 2013, certain tax balances were adjusted to reflect the position of the latest local statutory accounts and tax returns. 
These adjustments were reflected in the consolidated income statement in that year but due to their underlying nature, were not treated as separately 
disclosed tax items for the purpose of calculating underlying earnings per share.

The total tax charge (2013: charge) for the year is higher (2013: higher) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 22% (2013: 23.5%).

Comparative figures for the year ended 30 September 2013 have been restated to reflect the adoption of revised IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’. 
The underlying effective rate of taxation for the year ended 30 September 2014 is calculated based on the underlying profit before tax (excluding 
separately disclosed items, acquisition related expenses and impairment charges) and equates to 31%. The actual tax rate of 46% differs from the 
underlying effective tax rate primarily due to the separately disclosed tax item referred to in Note 8(i) above.  142 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

(iv ) 	 F a c tors 	 af fec tin g 	 futur e 	 t ax 	 charge
A) At the balance sheet date, the Finance Act 2014 had been enacted confirming that the main UK corporation tax rate will reduce to 20% with effect 
from 1 April 2015. Therefore, at 30 September 2014, deferred tax assets and liabilities have been calculated based on a rate of 20% where the temporary 
difference is expected to reverse after 1 April 2015. These reductions may also reduce the Company’s future current tax charges accordingly.
B) During 2012, the German tax authorities issued new guidance on how certain items of expenditure should be treated for the purposes of German 
trade tax. In 2013 the German tax authorities provided some additional clarification and informed the Group that, in their opinion, the guidance is 
applicable to tour operating activities in Germany. There have been no substantive administrative, legislative or judicial developments on this matter 
during 2014. 
The Group continues to disagree with the German tax authorities‘ interpretation of this matter. It is possible that this issue will have to be litigated 
through the German tax courts and it could take a considerable amount of time to bring to a resolution. 
It is difficult to estimate accurately the potential liability should the German tax authorities challenge successfully the Group’s interpretation of the 
guidance due to the differing nature of the contracts which could be impacted by any such challenge. As a result there is a range of possible outcomes. 
If the Group is successful in its arguments there would be no exposure. However, it is possible that the liability over the last seven years (2013: six 
years) could be up to a total of approximately £90m (2013: £80m), although the Group believes that German trade tax law should not apply to 
standard tour operating contracts and that any liability would be substantially less than this.
C) Other factors which may affect the future tax charge include the mix of jurisdictions with different tax rates in which profits and losses arise, changes 
in tax rates and the potential future recognition of tax losses for which a deferred tax asset has not been recognised at the year end (Note 14).
( v ) 	 Spanish 	 tax 	 case
The Spanish tax case came to a conclusion in the year with the final hearing in the Spanish courts occurring on 31 March 2014. In line with the 
settlement agreement reached on 11 October 2013, the interest and penalties levied of €20m were paid prior to that final hearing and the matter 
is now closed.  143 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Additions to computer software and software in development totalling £105m (2013: £101m) include costs relating to major IT development projects 
across all Sectors within the Group, including the implementation of SAP across certain Mainstream source markets and the development of digital 
solution platforms for our customers.
Amortisation of intangible assets is recognised within cost of sales in the consolidated income statement. Amortisation of business combination 
and other intangibles together with depreciation of property, plant and equipment is disclosed by segment in Note 3. 
The Group has established a Pension Funding Partnership arrangement (PFP). The main operating brands of the UK business, namely Thomson 
and First Choice, were sold into the PFP and three UK pension schemes subscribed for interests in the PFP. The recognition of the two brand assets 
in the consolidated financial statements remains unaffected by the establishment of the PFP, although the Thomson and First Choice brands, the 
latter of which is recognised on the Group balance sheet at a value of £87m (2013: £94m), are now being held as security for the PFP.

IAS 36 requires that impairment tests are carried out on CGUs, following the level at which the Group’s management measures returns on operations. 
Once every year, or more frequently if events or a change in the economic environment indicate a risk of impairment, the Group assesses the 
recoverable amount of goodwill allocated to its CGUs as required by IAS 36 ‘Impairment of assets’. The recoverable value of goodwill for all CGUs 
has been determined to be ‘value in use’. 
The calculation of recoverable value for CGUs based on value in use includes the following assumptions:
• Cash flow projections based on the Group’s latest Board approved three year business plan, which management has extended by two years 
to create a five year plan.
• Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using a real growth rate of between 1.0% and 3.55% (2013: between 1.0% and 3.9%). 
The growth rate used is less than or equal to third party estimates of the medium term GDP growth rates of the key geographic markets in 
which the specific CGU operates at the time the projections are prepared. 
• Cash flows are discounted using the Group’s WACC adjusted as appropriate for business specific factors, such as geographic risk. 
• Cash flows exclude planned enhancement capital expenditure, together with the associated benefit that the expenditure is expected to produce.
• Cash flows include the impact of working capital in both the asset base and the impact on cash flows over the five year plan period.
• Central Group overheads are borne in full by CGUs and are allocated pro rata to the CGU’s underlying operating profit. 
Assumptions used in the five year plan take past experience into account with CGU-specific and central contingencies in the five year plan being 
allocated across all CGUs. 
Since determination of an appropriate Group WACC is judgemental, sensitivities also address how increases in the base Group WACC might impact 
the results of the impairment tests. The Group’s WACC is based on a capital asset pricing model calculation using a mixture of in-house data and 
externally available information, with input from external advisers.
An analysis of the aggregate and material carrying amounts of goodwill allocated to each principal CGU, including goodwill for those CGUs which 
are sensitive to reasonably possible changes in key assumptions, together with the growth rates being applied to cash flows beyond the five year 
plan period and the pre-tax discount rates used for each CGU is as follows:

If the recoverable amount of a CGU is estimated to be less than the total of its operating non-current assets, goodwill and other intangibles, an 
impairment loss is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement. The impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying 
amount of any goodwill allocated to the CGU and then to the other assets on a pro rata basis.  146 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

No goodwill impairment charges have arisen in the year ended 30 September 2014 since the recoverable amount for all CGUs tested was at least

All of the impairment charges arising from the Group’s annual impairment test in the year ended 30 September 2013, which totalled £178m, arose 
as a result of a deterioration in forecast trading results. The impairment test for all of these CGUs was based on the value in use calculation. 
The impairment charges are disclosed within administrative expenses and shown separately on the face of the consolidated income statement. 
The impairments arose since the cash flow model based on the current five year plan did not support the carrying amount of goodwill for these CGUs. 
Sensitivit y 	 analysis 	 for 	 g oodwill
The calculation of recoverable amount is particularly sensitive to forecast future earnings, the discount rate and the long-term growth rate. 
The Directors have considered the separate impacts of: i) increasing WACC by 0.5%; ii) a reduction in underlying earnings of 5% across all years; 
and iii) a reduction in the long-term percentage growth rate beyond the five year plan to nil as being reasonably possible changes.

448 7 10 129
In respect of the North American Education and Events CGUs, the recoverable amount equals the carrying amount and therefore any change to 
an assumption used in the test will cause an impairment. For the Marine, Adventure and Accommodation OTA CGUs, the recoverable value would 
equal the carrying amount if the long-term percentage growth rate reduced by 0.7%, 2.4% and 0.8% respectively. Additionally, the recoverable 
value would equal the carrying amount if the cash flows do not increase by £6m, £6m and £30m over the five year plan in the Adventure, Events 
and Accommodation OTA CGUs respectively.
The sensitivities disclosed immediately above do not take account of any mitigating action that management would take should earnings decrease. 
No other material impairments to goodwill or assets would arise following these reasonably possible changes in these key assumptions. Based on 
all of the calculations undertaken, the Directors consider that the recoverable amount of goodwill in each CGU is at least equal to its current 
carrying value. 147 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Advance 	 pa yment s 	 for 	 futur e 	 deliv er y 	 of 	 a ir craf t
Additions of £169m (2013: £140m) to advance payments for future delivery of aircraft were due to payments made for the future delivery of 
75 aircraft (2013: 76 aircraft) and interest of £8m (2013: £8m) that has been capitalised during the year at a rate of 5.4% (2013: 5.4%). 
The disposal of £187m (2013: £136m) from advance payments for future delivery of aircraft arises from the delivery and then sale and leaseback 
of nine aircraft (2013: 13 aircraft).

The Group’s share of joint venture and associate profit after interest and tax was £8m (2013: £17m). The result in the current year is shown before 
an impairment of £28m (2013: £nil) against loans made to the Group’s joint venture operating in the Russian and Ukrainian source markets given 
the ongoing challenging trading conditions in that environment and £11m (2013: £nil) of losses not recognised for this joint venture, the latter amount 
being because it would have reduced the Group’s carrying value for its share of the joint venture’s net assets below zero. Including the impairment of 
£28m, the share of losses of joint ventures and associates disclosed in the consolidated income statement is £20m (2013: £17m profit) for the year.

The above results exclude an impairment of £28m against loans made to the Group’s joint venture operating in the Russian and Ukrainian source 
markets given the ongoing challenging trading conditions in that environment and £11m (2013: £nil) of losses not recognised for this joint venture 
as it would have reduced the Group’s carrying value for its share of the joint venture’s net assets below zero. See Note 31 for details of loans with 
Togebi Holdings Limited.
t o ge b i 	 h o l din gs 	 Limi t e d
The Group has an agreement with S-Group Capital Management Limited (SGCM), regarding Togebi Holdings Limited, a jointly-owned investment 
holding company, owned 51% by SGCM and 49% by the Group. The joint venture owns subsidiary tour operators and travel agency groups in Russia 
and Ukraine. All major decisions have to be agreed by both shareholders and under IAS 31 ‘Interests in joint ventures’ the entity is accounted for as 
a joint venture. SGCM is owned by a significant shareholder of TUI AG and is therefore considered to be a related party. Togebi Holdings Limited 
and its subsidiary undertakings are therefore considered to be related parties by virtue of SGCM being the joint venturer to this investment.
During the year ended 30 September 2014, TUI Travel Holdings Limited, a direct subsidiary of the Company, injected a further £8m of capital into 
Togebi Holdings Limited and provided one year interest-bearing loans totalling £10m for the purpose of providing short-term liquidity. These loans 
have been included within the £28m impairment disclosed above. After the year end, TUI Travel Holdings Limited provided further loans to Togebi 
Holdings Limited totalling £10m for the same purpose. As the Group had a constructive obligation to lend this amount at the year end, the amount 
has been included within the £28m impairment noted above.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Trade and listed investments at 30 September 2014 represent the Group’s 3.8% (2013: 4.4%) shareholding in Air Berlin PLC and a 10% (2013: 10%) 
holding in Atlantica Leisure Group Limited. The Group’s investment in Air Berlin PLC is carried at fair value, determined by reference to its equity 
share price at the balance sheet date. Due to the prolonged decline in the equity share price of Air Berlin PLC, in accordance with IAS 39, a diminution 
in value of the investment of £1m, which was previously recognised in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, has now been charged 
to the consolidated income statement and separately analysed within impairment of financial assets.
Non-consolidated entities are recorded at cost and reflect the Group’s net investment held in subsidiaries which, due to the immaterial size of 
their revenues, result and financial position, have not been consolidated. Balances between these entities and consolidated subsidiaries have not 
been eliminated.

Acquisitions were made in the year for a total investment value of £31m in order to expand business operations in line with the Group’s growth 
strategy. In accordance with the provisions of IFRS 3 (revised), incidental acquisition costs of £3m have been expensed within administrative expenses 
(and disclosed as an acquisition related expense) in the consolidated income statement in the year. These acquisitions gave rise to provisional 
goodwill of £23m. 
The one significant business acquired in the year, on 20 December 2013, was a further 41% of the voting equity shares of Le Passage to India Tours 
and Travels Private Limited (‘LPTI’), a tour operator and destination management company incorporated in India. The Group previously owned 50% 
of LPTI and accounted for this as a joint venture. The total consideration for this step acquisition was £20m, including £10m of non-cash consideration 
for the Group’s share of LPTI that it previously owned.
Two other step acquisitions made during the year, in which the Group acquired the remaining 50% of the voting equity shares that the Group did not 
previously own, were of OFT Reisen Gmbh, incorporated in Germany, and Voukouvalidis Tours Tourism, SA, incorporated in Greece.
Other individually insignificant businesses include six German-based travel agency businesses and 51% of the voting share capital of Global Obi, S.L, 
(known as ROI Back).

All acquisitions have been accounted for using the purchase method, as required by IFRS 3 (revised). Certain non-significant fair value adjustments 
have necessarily been prepared on a provisional basis due to the recent timing of certain acquisitions. Experience may result in revisions to fair 
values in the subsequent accounting period. No material amount of goodwill is expected to be deductible for tax purposes. There are no material 
accounting policy adjustments nor any significant differences between the book and fair values of assets and liabilities acquired. No single acquisition 
in the current year is considered material to goodwill and, as such, the provisional net asset table shown above has been presented as a total for all 
acquisitions in the year.
R esidua l 	 g o od w il l
A consistent process is undertaken for each acquisition to identify the fair value of separable assets and liabilities acquired, including the fair value 
of intangible assets, such as brands, order books, licences, customer relationships and other intangible assets that may exist. The residual goodwill 
on acquisition represents the value of assets and earnings that do not form separable assets under IFRS 3 (revised) but nevertheless are expected 
to contribute to the future results of the Group. Residual goodwill in respect of acquisitions in the current year predominantly relates to the 
acquisition of LPTI and represents the ability to control fully that business with a view to driving economies of scale and participating fully in the 
Indian market. 152 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Acquisiti on 	 r elated 	 expenses
IFRS 3 (revised) requires consideration that is contingent on future service by the vendor to be expensed over the service period and acquisition costs 
to be expensed as incurred. In this respect, £10m (2013: £8m) has been expensed in the year and included within the acquisition related expenses 
in the consolidated income statement. A further £6m has been incurred as part of the forthcoming merger with TUI AG.

Contingent consideration payable is dependent on the results of the businesses over a number of future periods and in some cases is also 
dependent upon the previous owners or management of those businesses remaining in employment with the Group during the earnout period.
A £1m adjustment to amounts recognised in respect of prior year acquisitions has been made during the year. This follows the latest assessment of 
expected earnings figures for these acquired entities, with the consideration payable being based upon a multiple of the appropriate earnings figures.
An estimate of the range of undiscounted amounts of contingent consideration payable for current and prior year acquisitions is listed below. 
The expected contingent consideration for all acquisitions is calculated using multiples of underlying earnings, with some amounts payable

If the results of the acquired businesses had been included in these consolidated financial statements from 1 October 2013 until each of their 
respective acquisition dates, the Group‘s revenue would have been approximately £35m higher and underlying earnings and profit before tax 
would have been approximately £1m higher. 
Since the respective acquisition dates, the acquired businesses contributed revenues of £48m. Underlying earnings and profit after tax were not 
materially impacted.
(D ) 	 P ri or 	 y ear 	 r e visi ons 	 to 	 fa ir 	 values
In the year ended 30 September 2013, the Group acquired various businesses for a total consideration of £30m. The finalisation of the acquisition 
balance sheets for these businesses has not led to a material adjustment to goodwill presented in the 2013 accounts and therefore there is no 
restatement of the results for the year ended 30 September 2013 or balance sheet as at 30 September 2013 in respect of these finalisations.

These assets have not been recognised principally because the Directors are not certain of the timing of any benefits that might arise in the future. 
Other tax losses are primarily trading losses and include £4m which are subject to a four year expiry period and £12m which expire within one year. 
The balance of losses are not subject to time expiry and are available for utilisation against profits arising in future periods in the territories in which 
they have arisen. There are no other unprovided deferred tax liabilities nor unrecognised deferred tax assets.

Comparative figures for the year ended 30 September 2013 have been restated to reflect the adoption of revised IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’.
Intangible asset temporary differences arise in respect of assets recognised on acquisition. Property, plant and equipment temporary differences 
principally relate to tax depreciation in the UK, France and Germany. Employee benefits’ temporary differences arise in respect of defined benefit 
pension scheme liabilities and future deductions available on the vesting of employee awards. Financial instruments and foreign exchange temporary 
differences arise in respect of financial instruments accounted for under IAS 39 and principally reflect the fair value at 30 September 2014 of cash 
flow hedging derivatives that will be settled against future transactions. Other short-term temporary differences relate to operating expenses and 
related accruals and provisions for which a tax deduction has not yet been recognised.

No individually material bad debt provision movements or charges have been recorded in the year. Based on past experience and the post balance 
sheet period to the date of approval of these consolidated financial statements, the Group considers that the provision allowance recorded is 
adequate. Within the provision there are no individually material amounts held. Trade receivables not overdue and not impaired include amounts 
due from travel agencies, tour operators and hoteliers in respect of Mainstream, Specialist & Activity and Accommodation & Destinations Sectors. 
Provisions for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivable balances are managed by each underlying business unit where the debts arise and are 
based on local management experience. Factors considered include the age of the receivable, previous experience with the counterparty and the 
economic environment in which the counterparty is located. 
Credit exposure to individual customers booking holidays directly is limited as full payment is required before the issue of tickets and holiday 
departure. In the case of travel services sold by third party agents, the credit risk depends on the creditworthiness of those third parties, but this 
risk is also limited because of the relatively short period of credit. The Directors do not consider there to be significant concentration of credit risk 
relating to trade and other receivables.
Deposits and prepayments include amounts paid in advance to suppliers of hotel and other services in order to guarantee the provision of those 
supplies. There is a credit risk in respect of the continued operation of those suppliers during the period over which the supplies are made. The 
provision against overdue receivables of £40m (2013: £44m) relates to gross receivables of £52m (2013: £74m). 
There are £132m of receivables that are overdue and not impaired at 30 September 2014 (2013: £118m). 
Amounts owed by related parties are disclosed further in Note 31.

At 30 September 2014, cash and cash equivalents have been shown net of specific overdraft balances within the Group’s pooling facilities where 
the Group has demonstrated both the intention and ability to exercise its right to settle these particular balances simultaneously. At 30 September 
2013, £491m of cash and cash equivalents within the Group’s pooling facilities were shown gross of specific overdraft balances as the Group did 
not have the intention to settle those particular balances simultaneously at that point in time.
Cash and cash equivalents includes £50m (2013: £47m) that is not available for immediate use by the Group. This is made up of monies held to meet 
regulatory requirements, together with cash balances on short-term deposits, held on a restricted basis by the Group’s captive insurance funds as 
part of their ongoing operations.
In addition to the above restricted cash balances, the Group is involved in a long-running VAT case with the Belgian government. During the previous 
financial year a total of €116m was received from the Belgian government in relation to the disputed VAT for the years up to and including 
30 September 2011, to stop the interest charge from accumulating should they lose the case eventually. The outcome of the case remains uncertain 
and is not expected to be finalised in the near future. Given the uncertainty, the Group continues to accrue VAT payable on the existing basis. If the 
Group were to win the legal case, the amount recovered would be subject to corporation tax in Belgium. This money, totalling €116m (£90m) as 
at 30 September 2014, is currently held on a bank deposit account in order that a collateralised bank guarantee can be provided to the Belgian 
government for the duration of the legal proceedings to give them assurance that they will be paid the money back should they win the case. 
This receipt in 2013 of €116m (£98m) is shown in the consolidated statement of cash flows as the item fulfils the IAS 7 criteria for cash and cash 
equivalents and therefore the balance is included in cash and cash equivalents. In view of the guarantee provided to the Belgian government, the 
Group’s ability to use this cash is restricted.  156 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

At 30 September 2014, bank overdrafts have been shown net of specific cash balances within the Group’s pooling facilities where the Group has 
demonstrated both the intention and ability to exercise its right to settle these particular balances simultaneously. At 30 September 2013, £491m 
of bank overdrafts were shown gross of specific cash balances within the Group’s pooling facilities where the Group did not have the intention to 
settle those particular balances simultaneously at that point in time. 
Other financial liabilities mainly comprise the fair value of three put options written by the Group. Two of these options are to the sole remaining 
non-controlling interest shareholder in L’TUR Tourismus AG that may require the Group to purchase the non-controlling interest shareholding 
totalling 30%. The first put option over 20% of the shares may be exercised at any time until 31 December 2015. A second put option written by the 
Group to the same non-controlling interest shareholder for the remaining 10% shareholding has no time limit. The third put option is to the sole 
remaining partner of GeBeCo Gesellschaft fur internationale Begegnung und Cooperation mbH & Co. KG, a German registered partnership and is 
to purchase the remaining non-controlling interest of 49%. This may be exercised at any time until 1 September 2017. Details of the fair value of 
these options are included in Note 26(H).
Fair value changes in the put option liability are included within financial expenses or financial income.

Certain loans are secured on the underlying assets of the company in whose name the borrowings are made, including all finance leases which are 
secured against their respective underlying assets. The comparative figures for the maturity analysis of bank loans and loan notes payable after 
more than one year at 30 September 2013 have been reclassified to better reflect their maturity profile. Further details of debts falling due after 
more than five years is given in Note(F).
Details of amounts owed to related parties are included in Note 31.
Finance lease liabilities relate primarily to the leasing of aircraft, boats, cruise ships and equipment. The increase in amounts due after five years 
is driven by aircraft acquired in the year. These are treated as finance leases based on the terms of the leases, which include purchase options.

At 30 September 2014, the Group had two convertible bonds in issue, details of which are as follows:
• A £350m fixed rate 6% bond issued in October 2009. The bond was convertible at the option of the holders, before or upon maturity in 
October 2014. Conversion into ordinary shares occurred prior to 30 September 2014 in respect of £348m (at par value) of the original bond, 
the carrying value of which was £347m at the respective dates of conversion. Further details are given in Note 24. The balance of £2m was 
repaid in full on 5 October 2014.
• A £400m fixed rate 4.9% bond was issued in April 2010. The bond is convertible at the option of the holders, before or upon maturity in April 
2017. Conversion into ordinary shares will occur at a premium of 33% to the Group’s share price on the date of issuance.
The Group holds an issuer call option to redeem the convertible bonds at their principal amounts, together with accrued interest, upon fulfilment 
of certain pre-determined criteria. The fair value of this option was negligible at 30 September 2014. The equity portion of the bonds of £67m 
(2013: £114m) is included in the convertible bond reserve.

In respect of aircraft, provision is made for maintenance, overhaul and repair costs of operating leased airframes, engines and certain other 
components based on the anticipated external costs of the next maintenance event calculated by reference to costs experienced and published 
manufacturers’ data. The charge to the consolidated income statement is calculated by reference to the number of hours and cycles flown and 
by reference to the length of the full overhaul cycle. Costs incurred are charged against the provision. Neither the timing nor the value of the 
expenditure can be precisely determined but they can be averaged over time and over the number of aircraft in the fleet.
The provision is expected to be fully utilised within 12 years of the balance sheet date depending upon the timing of maintenance events or end 
of lease dates where compensation is payable.
R estruc tu r i n g
Restructuring, which includes severance payments, relates to provisions arising as a result of reorganisation and restructuring plans that are irrevocably 
committed. Further details of significant restructuring projects in the current year are set out in Note 4. The provision is expected to be utilised 
within 12 months of the balance sheet date.  159 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

O t he r
Other provisions relate to outstanding claims, litigation, obligations under denied boarding compensation regulations, onerous lease contracts 
that have been entered into in the ordinary course of business and other future obligations, the amount or timing of which is uncertain. The Group 
provides for outstanding claims, including settlement expenses, using a consistent methodology based upon historical claims patterns, average 
claims amounts, external legal advice and future expectations.
The Group has a policy to mitigate the financial risk of claims, litigation and disaster through insurance with third party providers and the use of 
captive insurance companies. The Group’s exposure to risk is capped by single event and aggregate limits, with insurance in place for exposures 
above these limits. At 30 September 2014, amounts totalling £65m (2013: £61m) was provided for by the Group’s captive insurance companies and 
included within other provisions.
Other provisions also includes an amount of £10m (2013: £nil) relating to the constructive obligation at 30 September 2014 for additional funding 
loans to be paid to Togebi Holdings Limited after the year end and which is included within the £28m impairment of Russian loans, as disclosed in 
Note 12.
A significant portion of the provision is anticipated to be utilised within 12 months of the balance sheet date, while the remainder is expected to be 
utilised within one to four years of the balance sheet date, although the timing and payments related to individual litigation claims are estimated 
and are inherently uncertain.

Following the receipt of irrevocable conversion notices from convertible bond holders during August 2014, 15,831,658 ordinary shares of 10p each 
were issued in September 2014 for a total consideration of £55m, representing the carrying value of the convertible bond extinguished at the date 
of conversion. As such, no cash was received on the issuance of these shares. The nominal value of the ordinary shares issued was £2m. £53m was 
credited to the share premium account on the issuance of these shares.
Following the receipt of irrevocable conversion notices from convertible bond holders in September 2014, 83,710,258 ordinary shares of 10p each 
were issued between 1 and 7 October 2014 for a total consideration of £292m, representing the carrying value of the convertible bond extinguished. 
No cash was received on the issuance of these shares. As the date of receipt of conversion notices represents the date of the extinguishment of 
the convertible bond liability, the 83,710,258 ordinary shares are deemed paid up in accordance with Section 583(2)(3) of Companies Act 2006, 
notwithstanding the fact that they were issued in October 2014. The nominal value of these ordinary shares of £8m, together with share premium 
of £284m, has been recognised in called up share capital and the share premium account respectively. 
As described more fully in Note 36, the ultimate parent company, TUI AG, is the beneficial owner of 53.72% (2013: 54.48%) of the Company’s issued 
ordinary share capital as at 30 September 2014.
At 30 September 2014, 7,451,101 shares (2013: 8,047,575 shares) were held by the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust. Based on the 30 September 2014 
closing mid share price of £3.89 (2013: £3.68) the value of shares held was £29m (2013: £30m). 
Details of dividends debited to equity in the year are set out in Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements. Whilst the Company has the authority 
to purchase its own shares in the open market, it has not done so in either the current or prior years. 160 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Following the receipt of irrevocable conversion notices from convertible bond holders during August and September 2014, 99,541,916 ordinary 
shares of 10p were issued in September and October 2014 for a total consideration of £347m, representing the carrying value of the convertible 
bond extinguished at the dates of conversion. No cash was received on the issuance of these shares. The nominal value of the ordinary shares 
issued was £10m and £337m was recognised in the share premium account on the issuance of these shares.

The convertible bond reserve comprises the equity element of the convertible bonds and the related portion of the bonds’ issue costs (see Note 20). 
The equity element is calculated in accordance with the accounting policy described in Note 1(E)(ii) and is presented net of deferred tax. £47m has 
been transferred from the convertible bond reserve to the profit and loss reserve on the conversion and extinguishment of the equity element of 
the convertible bond.

( A ) 	t r easur y 	 risk 	 o v er view
The Group is exposed to a variety of financial risks:
• Market risk (in respect of foreign currency rate risk, jet fuel price risk and interest rate risk);
• Liquidity risk (in respect of the Group’s ability to meet its liabilities); 
• Credit risk (in respect of recovery of amounts owing to the Group); and
• Capital risk (in respect of its capital structure and cost of capital).
The Group’s key financial market risks are in relation to foreign currency rates and jet fuel prices. Currency risk results from the substantial 
cross-border element of the Group’s trading and arises on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the 
functional currencies of individual Group businesses. The risk is managed by the use of foreign exchange forward, swap and option contracts.  
The Group’s exposure to jet fuel prices results from the aircraft fleet operations and is managed using commodity swaps and options.
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk that arises principally from the Group’s floating rate aircraft leases and floating rate bank loans and cash 
balances. Certain finance leases and loans have fixed interest rates.
Credit risk and liquidity risk are considered in Notes 26(D) and 26(F) respectively. Capital management, including capital risk and cash conversion, 
is considered in Notes 34 and 27(B) respectively.
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework and for ensuring 
that the Group has adequate policies, procedures and controls to successfully manage the financial risks that it faces. These form part of the Group’s 
overall Risk Management Framework (the framework). 
Incorporated within the framework’s terms of reference are the determination of all treasury policies and the monitoring of the effectiveness 
of those policies. Group Treasury implements the agreed policies on a day-to-day basis. The procedures also stipulate the levels of authority 
applied to approving and to dealing the types of hedging financial instrument used to manage these exposures. Transactions are only undertaken 
to hedge underlying exposures. Financial instruments are not traded, nor are speculative positions taken.
The treasury position of the Group, including liquidity, foreign exchange and fuel hedging exposure, is managed centrally in accordance with 
policies appropriate to cover specific risks faced by each business unit and is the responsibility of the Chief Financial Officer and Group Treasurer.
Group Treasury conducts regular reviews of financial risks with business unit management teams and receives regular cash flow forecasts and, 
where relevant, jet fuel usage forecasts from each business unit to ensure hedging instruments match the currency or fuel requirements of each 
operating business. Reports and forecasts for the Group, showing hedging instruments and forecast requirements, are submitted monthly to the 
GMB and to each Board meeting of TUI Travel PLC.
In line with its established policy, the Group has monitored its counterparty exposure with individual financial institutions throughout the year. 
Such counterparty risk can arise by way of cash deposited or derivative instruments traded.
(B ) 	c urr enc y 	 risk 	 mana gement
The Group is exposed to currency risk on sales, purchases and borrowings that are denominated in a currency other than the functional currencies 
of individual Group businesses (which are principally Sterling, US Dollar, Euro and Swedish Krona). 
The Group hedges its foreign currency exposures on a seasonal basis, that is Winter and Summer, with each season comprising a six-month period. 
At the start of a season the Group will have hedged substantially all of its foreign currency exposure (forecast sales and purchases and related 
assets and liabilities) for that season, using predominantly forward exchange contracts and option based instruments, most with a maturity of less 
than one year from the reporting date. 
In respect of other monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies, the Group ensures that its net exposure is kept to an 
acceptable level, principally by using forward contracts in respect of non-Sterling denominated airline maintenance provision balances, loan 
balances and deposits.
The Group presents its consolidated financial statements in Sterling and, as a result, it is also subject to foreign currency exchange translation risk 
in respect of the translation of the results and underlying net assets of its foreign operations into Sterling.
The following significant exchange rates were used to translate to presentation currency (excluding the impact of hedged transactions) and are 
illustrative of the rates applied during the current and prior year:

( c ) 	c ommodit y 	 risk
Fuel commodity risk arises from the Group’s operation of aircraft.
The Group hedges its fuel commodity exposures on a seasonal basis, being Winter and Summer, with each season comprising a six-month period. 
At the start of a season the Group will have hedged substantially all of its fuel commodity exposure for that season, using predominantly commodity 
swaps or options, most with a maturity of less than one year from the reporting date. 
As at 30 September 2014, the Group has hedged transactions for fuel of 1.7m metric tonnes (2013: 1.7m metric tonnes) for periods up until 
Winter 2015. 
Details of fuel forward derivative instruments are set out in Note 26(I).
(D ) 	c r edit 	 risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. Credit risk arises 
from cash balances (including bank deposits and cash and cash equivalents) and derivative financial instruments, as well as credit exposures to 
customers, including outstanding receivables, financial guarantees and committed transactions. Credit risk is managed separately for treasury and 
operating related credit exposures. 
The Group minimises its financial credit risk through the application of risk management policies approved and monitored by the Board. While 
counterparties are limited to major banks and financial institutions, Group policy ensures that individual counterparty limits are adhered to and 
that there are no significant concentrations of credit risk. The only exception to this at 30 September 2014 was the €116m (2014: £90m, 2013: £98m) 
received from the Belgian government in relation to the long running VAT case (Note 17). This money is currently deposited with two (2013: one) 
financial institutions to enable a collateralised bank guarantee to be provided to the Belgian government. The Group monitors the credit ratings of 
its counterparties (where applicable) as part of its ongoing assessment of its credit exposure. Material financial instruments are only transacted 
with major financial institutions with a strong credit rating of A1/P1 or A2/P2. 
Loans and other receivable exposures are managed locally in the operating units where they arise and credit limits are set as deemed appropriate 
for the customer. There is no material concentration of credit risk with respect to trade and other receivables as the Group has a large number of 
internationally dispersed customers. 
The maximum credit exposure to the carrying amount of financial assets at the balance sheet date is shown in the table below.

The maximum exposure to credit risk for total trade and other receivables at the balance sheet date and by geographic region as well as their 
ageing is disclosed in Note 16. Trade and other receivables are shown net of provision for bad and doubtful debts of £51m (2013: £49m).
Cash equivalents and other investments principally comprise money market deposits and other short-term investments. The investments are 
predominantly with counterparties with a strong credit rating of A1/P1 or A2/P2. At 30 September 2014, approximately 20% (2013: 42%) of the 
Group’s unrestricted cash and cash equivalents was invested with counterparties based in the United Kingdom, and 63% (2013: 38%) was based 
with counterparties based in the Republic of Ireland. 
Trade and other receivables exclude prepaid accommodation and other prepayments which do not meet the definition of a financial instrument. 
Prepayments for hotel accommodation, whilst not meeting the definition of a financial asset under IAS 39, give rise to a risk similar to credit risk 
due to the inherent risk of the Group not recovering the prepayment through full delivery of the related goods and services. From time to time 
prepayments can concentrate risk with specific counterparties which are based overseas. The carrying amount of prepayments (which are presented 
within current and non-current assets) forms their maximum credit exposure, before taking into account any security or collateral held by the Group. 
Where appropriate, the Group obtains security collateral over the related accommodation property to mitigate credit risk. At 30 September 2014, 
prepaid accommodation which is recoverable after more than one year was £102m (2013: £108m).  164 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

(e ) 	i nter est 	 rate 	 risk
The Group manages interest rate risk by fixing interest rates for the majority of the Group’s longer term debt. Variable interest generally applies to 
shorter term debt and that which fluctuates with working capital flows. Variable rate interest on pooled bank overdrafts is offset by similar credit 
interest on cash held elsewhere in the currency pools. The Group has exposure to interest rate risk arising principally on Sterling, US Dollar and 
Euro floating interest rates that are attached to the Group’s fixed/floating rate aircraft and cruise ship leases and floating rate bank loans and 
cash balances. 
The Group’s loans and borrowings are measured at amortised cost with the exception of the other financial liabilities which are carried at fair value

The interest rate applicable to bank overdrafts in 2013 was the amount charged in respect of the balance shown. Any balances offsetting this in the 
Group’s pooling arrangements were credited at a similar rate to the entities concerned.
(F ) 	 Liquidit y 	 risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach is to ensure that 
it will have sufficient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both normal and stressed circumstances. The Group’s liquidity peaks in July 
and August, during the European summer holiday season, with the liquidity low point being in December and January. To manage the liquidity 
position the Group is able to draw cash advances under its existing bank facilities which, at 30 September 2014, principally comprised the following 
main sources of long-term debt funding:
• The external bank revolving credit facilities totalling £1,225m (2013: £1,120m) plus bonding and letter of credit facilities totalling £175m 
(2013: £185m) which all mature in June 2018. From these facilities, £120m has been utilised for letter of credit purposes at 30 September 2014 
(2013: £136m); 
• A £400m convertible bond (due April 2017) issued in April 2010; and
• A £150m bank syndicated facility which matures in April 2016 and which is only available in the event of a requirement to redeem the Group’s 
2017 convertible bond.
The external bank revolving credit facility is used to manage the seasonality of the Group’s cash flows and liquidity. Cash positions, liquidity  
and available facility headroom are monitored daily by the Group Treasury Department.
The Board remains satisfied with the Group’s funding and liquidity position. This is the case in the scenario that the merger with TUI AG does not 
proceed, which is considered unlikely, and the scenario once the merger is completed, as TUI AG has agreed to provide facilities to enable, based 
on current expectations, TUI Travel PLC and its subsidiaries to continue for the forseeable future. 
Fixed charges cover and the ratio of net debt to EBITDA, which the Board believes to be the most useful measures of cash generation and gearing, 
as well as being the main basis for covenants in the external credit facilities, were met at the year end and throughout the year. Fixed charges cover 
is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation, amortisation and operating lease rentals charge (EBITDAR) divided by net interest plus 
operating lease rentals. EBITDA is defined as earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation. Both covenants are measured on an 
‘underlying basis’ as defined in Note 1(B)(ii).
In respect of the delivery of new aircraft, the Group’s established strategy is to refinance new aircraft in advance of their delivery dates and 
therefore the Group does not forecast to use internal cash resources for new aircraft purchases. Details of aircraft purchase commitments at the 
year end are given in Note 29. 165 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

The timing reflected in the tables above is based on the first date that the Group can be contractually required to settle the liability. In respect of 
revolving credit facilities, the timing of repayments will vary. Trade and other payables exclude customers’ monies received in advance, deferred 
income, contingent consideration and other non-contractual payables.
Debts falling due for repayment after five years with an aggregate value at 30 September 2014 of £405m (2013: £297m) comprise secured bank 
loans of £53m (2013: £57m) and finance leases of £352m (2013: £240m), all of which are payable in either monthly, quarterly or six-monthly 
instalments. These are secured on the aircraft, cruise ships and buildings to which the borrowings relate.
At 30 September 2014, the Group had available undrawn committed borrowing facilities of £1,301m (2013: £1,192m), comprising letters of credit, 
guarantees and revolving, floating rate credit facilities for cash borrowings. Any non-compliance with covenants underlying the Group’s financing 
arrangements could, if not waived, constitute an event of default with respect to any such arrangements. The Group was in full compliance with  
its financial covenants throughout both years.
Undrawn facilities are analysed as follows:

O f f set ti ng
The table below shows the Group’s financial assets and liabilities that are subject to offset in the Group’s balance sheet and the impact of enforceable 
master netting or similar agreements. Contracts for derivative financial instruments are governed by standardised master netting agreements 
creating a right of set-off only if certain specified future events occur. As this conditional right to set-off is not enforceable in the ordinary course 
of business, the derivative financial assets and liabilities are shown on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet at the reporting dates.

The basis for fair value measurement of financial assets and liabilities is set out in Note 1(W).
F air 	 value 	 measur ement s
IFRS 13 requires enhanced disclosures about fair value measurements of financial instruments through the use of a three level fair value hierarchy 
that prioritises the valuation techniques used in fair value calculations.
The levels can be broadly described as follows:
• Level 1 – use of unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2 – use of observable inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1, such as quoted prices for similar assets or liabilities. 
in active markets.
• Level 3 – use of inputs not based on observable market data but reflecting management’s own assumptions about pricing the asset or liability. 168 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

The Group maintains policies and procedures to value instruments using the most relevant data available. If there are multiple inputs available that 
fall into different levels of the hierarchy, the instrument is categorised on the basis of the lowest level input.

As at 30 September 2014, £11m (2013: £42m) of trade and other investments were categorised as level 3 instruments. These consist of the Group’s 
£5m (2013: £35m) investment in The Airline Group Limited and other trade investments in the equity of unlisted companies of £6m (2013: £7m). 
In the year ended 30 September 2013, of the £35m in respect of The Airline Group Limited, £30m was disclosed as an other investment in current 
assets (Note 18) and £5m was disclosed as an other investment in non-current assets (Note 12). 
The Group’s investment in The Airline Group Limited is valued using the offer received during 2013 for the majority of the investment, the disposal 
of which occurred in March 2014. The level 1 trade investment mainly consists of the Group’s holding in Air Berlin PLC. See Note 12 for further 
details of this investment.
Derivativ e 	 asset s 	 and 	 liabilities
Derivatives are valued in the market using discounted cash flow techniques. These techniques incorporate level 2 inputs, such as interest rates 
and foreign currency exchange rates. These market inputs are used in the discounted cash flow calculation incorporating the instrument’s term, 
notional amount, volatility, discount rate and taking credit risk into account. As significant inputs to the valuation are observable in external 
markets, these instruments are categorised as level 2 in the hierarchy. 169 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Other 	 financial 	 liabilities
The principal element of the put options to acquire the remaining equity stake in L’TUR Tourismus AG (£38m) (2013: £38m) is classified as an other 
financial liability with changes in fair value included in operating profit. They have been valued using the minimum price stipulated in the contracts 
plus adjustments based on estimated operating results in the three years preceding any exercise of the options. Contingent consideration of £4m 
(2013: £7m) is also measured at fair value based on the relevant contracts. 
A new put option recognised in the year is to the sole remaining partner of GeBeCo Gesellschaft fur internationale Begegnung und Cooperation 
mbH & Co. KG, a German registered partnership (£5m) (2013: £nil). This has been valued using the price stipulated in the contract, based upon 
the two years’ profit before tax, plus a portion of retained earnings, preceding any exercise of the option.
There are no reasonably possible changes in assumptions which would materially alter the value of these level 3 financial instruments.
c o n v e r ti b le 	 b o n ds
The fair value of the convertible bonds for disclosure purposes was £476m (2013: £883m) and is derived from quoted market prices from Bloomberg. 
As such, the convertible bonds are categorised as level 1 financial instruments. 
Finance 	 leases
The fair value of finance leases for disclosure purposes was £381m (2013: £280m) and is calculated based on the present value of future principal 
and interest cash flows, discounted at the market rate of interest at the reporting date. This market rate of interest for finance leases is determined 
by reference to similar lease agreements. These finance leases are categorised as level 3 financial instruments. 
t ransfers 	 bet w een 	 le v els 	 of 	 financial 	 instrument s
The Group transfers financial instruments between different levels in the fair value hierarchy when, as a result of an event or change in circumstances, 
the valuation methodology applied in determining their fair values alters in such a way that it meets the definition of a different level. There were 
no transfers between the level 1, level 2 and level 3 fair value measurement categories in the period.

Gains/losses on derivatives not hedge accounted have been recognised within net financial expenses within the consolidated income statement. 
The gain recognised in the year ended 30 September 2014 of £73m (2013: loss of £114m) has been offset by an equal and opposite loss (2013: gain) 
due to the revaluation of non-functional currency balance sheet exposures.
The following table indicates the periods in which the cash flows associated with derivatives are expected to occur. Future cash flows have been 
estimated based on spot rates and prices at 30 September 2014 and have been shown net for each instrument.

Ineffectiveness in respect of cash flow hedges has been recognised in the consolidated income statement for the year. Ineffectiveness for the year 
ended 30 September 2014 comprised a charge of £1m (2013: £3m) relating to fuel hedging and this is included within cost of sales in the consolidated 
income statement. In respect of foreign exchange hedging ineffectiveness, this comprised a gain of £1m (2013: £1m) which is included in cost of sales

Fair value of cash flow hedges recycled to the consolidated income statement 113 (5)
85 (81)
The fair value loss of £113m on cash flow hedges recycled to the consolidated income statement during 2014 arose primarily due to Sterling 
strengthening against the Euro and the US dollar, as well as the Euro strengthening against the US dollar, when comparing the average achieved 
hedge rate and the average spot rate at maturity of the derivative contracts. This spread was larger in 2014 compared to 2013. The fair value gain 
of £5m on cash flow hedges recycled to the consolidated income statement during 2013 arose primarily due to Sterling weakening against the 
Euro and the US dollar, when comparing the average achieved hedge rate and the average spot rate at maturity of the derivative contracts.
Deferred tax on the above items recognised outside of the consolidated income statement is shown in Note 8(iii). The fair value of cash flow hedges 
recycled to the consolidated income statement is recognised within cost of sales.
(K) 	 Sensitivit y 	 analysis
This sensitivity analysis is for illustrative purposes only and should not be considered a projection of likely future events and gains or losses.
This sensitivity analysis includes the following assumptions:
• changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense of variable financial instruments;
• changes in market interest rates only affect interest income or expense in relation to financial instruments with fixed interest rates if these are 
recognised at fair value;
• changes in market interest, currency and fuel rates affect the fair value of derivative financial instruments designated as hedging instruments 
and the majority of hedges are expected to be highly effective; and 
• changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments and other financial assets or liabilities are estimated by discounting the future cash 
flows to net present values using appropriate market rates prevailing at the year end.
The Group has used a sensitivity analysis technique that measures the estimated change to the consolidated income statement and equity of a 1% 
(100 basis points) difference in market interest rates or a 10% strengthening or weakening in Sterling against all other currencies and in fuel prices, 
from the rates applicable at the balance sheet date, with all other variables remaining constant, these being considered to be reasonably possible 
changes to interest rates, Sterling rates and fuel prices.
i nter est 	 rate 	 risk
Under the above assumptions, a 100 basis points increase in interest rates would result in a less than £1m increase in interest expense in the 
consolidated income statement and equity (2013: increase of less than £1m). A 100 basis points reduction in interest rates is not considered 
reasonably possible.
c urr enc y 	 risk
The Group hedges substantially all of its foreign currency exposures not denominated in the functional currency of individual Group companies. 
This mitigates the sensitivity impact of fluctuations in the underlying exchange rates. 171 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
The vast majority of hedging instruments used by the Group qualify for hedge accounting with the fair value movements booked to equity. However, 
the Group uses structured foreign exchange instruments to hedge a small proportion of its Euro and US Dollar requirements. As these contracts do 
not qualify for hedge accounting, the fair value movements are recognised in the consolidated income statement. A 10% strengthening or weakening 
of Sterling against the Euro and US Dollar on these instruments would have reduced profit before tax by £5m (2013: £21m) or increased it by £5m 
(2013: £21m) respectively.
Similarly, under the above assumptions, a 10% strengthening or weakening of Sterling against all principal exchange rates the Group is exposed to 
would have reduced profit before tax by £20m (2013: reduced profit before tax by £16m) or increased it by £25m (2013: increased profit before 
tax by £18m) respectively. Equity (before tax) would have decreased by £210m (2013: £226m) or increased by £257m (2013: £276m) respectively. 
F uel 	 price 	 risk
The sensitivity analysis is based on a 10% increase or decrease in fuel prices and the sensitivity will differ correspondingly if the fuel markets are 
more or less volatile. Under these assumptions, with a 10% increase or decrease in the unit price of fuel, profit before tax would neither increase 
nor decrease materially, because of the fuel price hedging policy and appropriate pricing adjustments. Equity (before tax) would increase by £88m 
(2013: £97m), or decrease by £88m (2013: £96m) respectively.

As set out in Note 17, cash and cash equivalents included £140m (2013: £145m) of restricted cash.
The 2014 non-cash movement of £324m (2013: £(22)m) in convertible bonds relates to the net amount of the conversion of £348m (at par value)
of the 2014 £350m bond (issued October 2009) converting during the year and accretion of the equity portion of the convertible bonds up to the 
earlier of the conversion or 30 September 2014. 
The 2014 non-cash movement of £(491)m (2013: £491m) between cash and cash equivalents and bank loans and overdrafts reflects the impact  
of specific overdraft balances being presented on a net basis, previously shown gross. Other non-cash movements in 2014 in finance leases 
predominantly relate to advances in respect of additions to aircraft within property, plant and equipment.

Operating lease commitments in respect of land and buildings comprise commitments in respect of the Group’s retail estate, its hotel estate, 
including those commitments that are required to be disclosed as leases under IFRIC 4, and its office premises.
The future commitment under the Group’s floating rate aircraft operating leases at 30 September 2014 was £61m (2013: £80m) and is included 
within the table above.
In total the Group operates 119 aircraft on operating leases at 30 September 2014 (2013: 123 aircraft), a minority of which contain purchase options. 
Yachts are held on operating leases in TUI Marine as part of the Group’s Sunsail and The Moorings fleets, whilst cruise ships are held on operating 
leases in the UK & Ireland source market.

In addition to the above items, at the year end the Group had contracted to purchase 72 (2013: 79) aircraft with initial deliveries to start in the first 
quarter of the financial year 2014/15. At list price, the total order value was US$9,135m (2013: US$9,772m) before discounts.
The Group intends to finance these aircraft in advance of their delivery dates and therefore does not expect to use its own cash resources for 
their purchase.
The Group’s share of the capital commitments of its joint ventures and associates at 30 September 2014 was £28m (2013: £13m).

The Group is at any time defending a number of actions against it arising in the normal course of business. Provision is made for these actions where 
this is deemed appropriate. The Directors consider that adequate provision has been made for all known liabilities. See Note 8 for more details on 
contingent tax exposures and Note 22 for details on provisions.

Apart from with its own subsidiaries which are included in the consolidated financial statements, the Group, in carrying out its ordinary business 
activities, maintained direct and indirect relationships with related parties including consolidated or related companies of its ultimate parent company, 
TUI AG. These companies either purchased or delivered services to companies in the Group.
c o n v e r ti b le 	 b o n d
In April 2010, the Company issued a £400m fixed rate 4.9% convertible bond, of which Antium Finance Ltd, an independent special purpose company, 
subscribed for 50%. TUI AG entered into a forward purchase agreement with Antium Finance Ltd for these £200m convertible bonds, in order 
to prevent dilution of its majority shareholding. TUI AG is entitled to receive the interest coupon on these bonds and to repurchase these bonds 
by July 2016 at the latest. The latest repurchase date was extended from July 2014 to July 2016 through a new contractual arrangement dated 
10 October 2013. 173 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

Receivables due from related parties are reported in Note 16. Amounts owed from TUI AG and its subsidiaries of £3m (2013: £3m) are in respect 
of current trade and other receivables. 
Amounts owed by joint ventures of the Group that are due after more than one year of £30m (2013: £35m) principally comprises hotel prepayments 
made to the Atlantica Leisure Group of companies. In the prior year the balance also included a loan of US$12m, equating to £8m from TUI Travel 
Holdings Limited, a direct subsidiary of the Company, to Togebi Holdings Limited. This loan has been provided for within the £28m (2013: £nil) 
impairment recognised against loans made to our joint venture operating in the Russian and Ukrainian source markets, given the ongoing challenging 
trading conditions in that environment (also refer to Note 12). 
Amounts owed by joint ventures that are due within one year of £42m (2013: £43m) include accommodation costs due from Togebi Holdings Limited 
and its subsidiaries of £17m (2013: £15m), which were non-interest bearing balances. The remaining balance due within one year includes current 
hotel prepayments made to the Atlantica Leisure Group of companies.

Amounts payable to hotel and resort subsidiaries of TUI AG and joint ventures and associates of TUI AG are in respect of current trade payables 
primarily associated with accommodation and destination services costs. The payables to joint ventures of the Group also includes £10m (2013: £nil) 
relating to the constructive obligation at 30 September 2014 for additional funding loans to be paid to Togebi Holdings Limited. Further details 
of these amounts, which were loaned after the year end, are disclosed in Note 12 and are included within the current other provision balance in 
Note 22.
The Group’s share of bank guarantees given by the Company for bank loans drawn by Togebi Holdings Limited and its subsidiaries totalled £12m 
at 30 September 2014 (2013: £12m). No payable has been recognised at 30 September 2014 (2013: £nil) as no cash outflow is currently expected 
under the terms of these guarantees.
The above balances exclude £200m (nominal value) of the Group’s convertible bonds 4.9% April 2017 which have been sold to Antium Finance Ltd. 
TUI AG is entitled to receive the interest coupon on these bonds and to repurchase these bonds by July 2016 at the latest. Further details of the

The basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the result attributable to ordinary shareholders by the applicable weighted average number 
of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the Employee Benefit Trust. The diluted earnings per share is calculated on the result 
attributable to ordinary shareholders divided by the adjusted potential weighted average number of ordinary shares, which takes account of the 
outstanding share awards and the impact of the conversion of the convertible bonds, where their conversion is dilutive. The additional 
underlying earnings per share measures have been presented to provide the reader of the accounts with a better understanding of the results. 
Comparative figures for the year ended 30 September 2013 have been restated to reflect the adoption of revised IAS 19 ‘Employee benefits’.

As disclosed in Note 8(i), following a review of the Group’s deferred tax balances in the year, the Directors have written off £26m of deferred tax 
assets where there is no longer sufficient certainty of the timing of any benefits that might arise in the future. These charges have been treated 
as separately disclosed tax items and have been excluded from the underlying earnings per share calculations.
The tax base difference represents the remaining difference between the actual tax charge in the consolidated income statement (£175m) and the 
Group’s underlying tax charge (£147m), as disclosed below, after taking account of the separately disclosed tax item. 
The dilutive effect of the convertible bonds is included solely to calculate diluted underlying earnings per share.

The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to the Parent Company. The Board’s policy 
has been to maintain a strong capital base in order to maintain investor, creditor and market confidence and to sustain future development of the 
business. The Board’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure. This includes maintaining the level of 
dividends at a level commensurate with underlying operating profitability of the Group and obtaining sufficient long and short-term debt facilities 
that are appropriate for the seasonality of the business. 
The Group has a roadmap to deliver sustainable long-term value to shareholders with a return on invested capital (ROIC) greater than the Group’s 
post-tax weighted average cost of capital of 7.5% (2013: 8.1%). This objective has been achieved again this year with a ROIC of 14.6% (2013: 14.8%).
The Group is required to comply with external banking credit facility covenants, with compliance being tested twice a year. The Group has complied 
with these covenants throughout the year and up to the date of signing these financial statements. Further information on these covenants is 
provided in Note 1(B)(v). 178 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

ROIC is defined as ‘Underlying NOPAT’/‘Average Invested Capital’. Underlying NOPAT is underlying net operating profit after tax charged at the 
effective annual rate. ‘Underlying’ as a measure of operating profit is defined in Note 1(B)(ii). As such, ROIC is considered to be a non-GAAP measure 
of performance. Average Invested Capital comprises an average of the net assets (at the start and end of the year) of the Group, adjusted to add 
back net debt, cumulative goodwill impairment charges and defined benefit pension scheme net deficits. There is also an adjustment to net debt 
to reflect a seasonal average cash balance. Calculations for the current and prior years are:

capital position. An analysis of net cash at the year end is in Note 27(A).
Certain subsidiaries have external capital requirements as a result of applicable travel industry regulations in their jurisdictions. Compliance 
with these regulations is mandatory for the relevant operating businesses in those countries in order that they are able to continue trading. 
Key countries with such mandatory capital requirements are France, Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany and Australia. The capital requirements 
in these countries stipulate maintaining minimum equity/net asset levels in operating subsidiaries. All such capital requirements were complied 
with as at 30 September 2014. None of these requirements place any significant restriction on the Group’s funding or operations.

On 15 September 2014, the Independent Directors of the Company and the Executive Board (Vorstand) of TUI AG announced that they had 
reached agreement on the terms of a recommended all-share nil-premium merger of the Company and TUI AG (the “Merger”), to be implemented 
by way of a scheme of arrangement of the Company under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Scheme”). The scheme document in connection 
with the Scheme, containing the notice of the Court Meeting and Notice of General Meeting, was published on 2 October 2014 (the “Scheme 
Document”). The Scheme Document contained a profit estimate for the year ended 30 September 2014 for the purposes of Rule 28 of the UK Code 
for Takeovers and Mergers, which was stated as being full year underlying operating profit growth of at least 9% on a constant currency basis. The 
actual results for the year ended 30 September 2014 are consistent with this profit estimate, as full year operating profit growth has been 11% on 
a constant currency basis. 
At the Court Meeting of the Scheme Shareholders and the General Meeting of the TUI Travel Shareholders, both held on 28 October 2014, the 
resolutions contained in the notice of the Court Meeting and Notice of General Meeting were duly passed by the requisite majorities. It is expected 
that the Court Hearing to sanction the Scheme will be held on 10 December 2014 and that the Scheme will be effective on 11 December 2014  
(as set out in the Scheme Document).

The Directors consider the ultimate parent company to be TUI AG, a company registered in Berlin and Hanover (Federal Republic of Germany).  
At 30 September 2014, TUI AG was the beneficial owner of 53.72% (2013: 54.48%) of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company. 
In addition, a number of bonds are held indirectly by TUI AG and, if converted, would give rise to 52,309,463 of new shares. On a fully diluted basis, 
if all bonds were converted, TUI AG’s shareholding would be 50% at 30 September 2014.
TUI AG prepares consolidated financial statements which include the results of the Group. TUI AG is the parent undertaking of the smallest 
and largest group to consolidate these financial statements. The accounting reference date of TUI AG is 30 September. Copies of the TUI AG 
financial statements are publicly available and can be obtained from the registered office of TUI AG situated at Karl-Wiechert-Allee 4, 30625

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
Other Companies Act 2006 reporting
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion, certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this 
responsibility.

Our 	 r esponsibilities 	 and 	 those 	 of 	 the 	 Dir ec tors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and ISAs (UK & Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3  
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown 
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
What 	 an 	 audit 	 of 	 financial 	 statement s 	 in v olv es 	
We conducted our audit in accordance with ISAs (UK & Ireland). An 
audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures  
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that 
the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and 
• the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the Directors’ 
judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, 
and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements. 
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing 
techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide a reasonable 
basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through 
testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive procedures or a 
combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in  
the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the 
knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Oth er 	 ma t ter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements  
of TUI Travel PLC for the year ended 30 September 2014.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
The second condition is that where the instrument will, or may be 
settled in the Company’s own equity instruments, it is either a 
non-derivative that includes no obligation to deliver a variable number 
of the Company’s own equity instruments, or is a derivative that will be 
settled by the Company, exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other 
financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments.
c o n v e r ti b le 	 b o n ds
The convertible bonds are split into two components: a debt 
component and a component representing the embedded derivatives 
in the bond. The debt component represents the Group’s liability 
for future interest coupon payments and the redemption amount. 
The embedded derivatives represent the value of the option that 
bondholders have to convert into ordinary shares of the Company. 
These derivatives were valued on inception and recognised in the 
convertible bond reserve in equity.
The debt component of the convertible bonds is measured at amortised 
cost and therefore increases as the present value of the interest coupon 
payments and redemption amount increases, with a corresponding 
charge to finance cost. The debt component decreases by the cash 
interest coupon payments made. The embedded derivatives are 
measured at fair value at each balance sheet date and changes in fair 
value are recognised in the income statement. 
Issue costs are apportioned between the liability and derivative 
components of the related convertible bond based on the allocation 
of proceeds to the liability and derivative components when the 
instruments are first recognised. Derecognition occurs on the date on 
which an irrevocable conversion notice to convert the bond to ordinary 
shares is received from the bond holder. The carrying value of the bond 
at the date of derecognition is extinguished and replaced by the nominal 
value of the ordinary share capital being issued with the balance being 
recognised in the share premium account, notwithstanding that the 
relevant ordinary shares may not have been legally issued on the date 
of derecognition. No gains or losses are recognised in the consolidated 
income statement on conversion.
Shar e 	 capit al 	 and 	 shar e 	 pr emium
Ordinary shares are classified as equity within shareholders’ funds. 
On derecognition of convertible bonds, the carrying value of the bond 
is extinguished and replaced by the nominal value of the ordinary share 
capital being issued with the balance being recognised in the share 
premium account, notwithstanding that the relevant ordinary shares may 
not have been legally issued on the date of derecognition. No profits or 
losses are recognised in the profit and loss account on conversion.
Sh a r e - b as e d 	 pa y m e n t s
The Company operates share-based payment schemes for the 
employees of the Company and its subsidiaries. The fair value of shares 
awarded to employees is an employee expense and is borne by fellow 
Group subsidiaries. The fair value is measured at the award date and 
is spread over the period during which the employee becomes 
unconditionally entitled to the awards. Calculating the fair value takes 
into account various factors including the expected volatility of the 
shares, the dividend yield and the risk free interest rate.
The Company makes awards of its own shares to the employees of its 
subsidiaries and as such recognises an increase in the cost of investment 
in its subsidiaries equivalent to the equity-settled share-based payment 
charge recognised in its subsidiaries’ financial statements with the 
corresponding tax inclusive credit being recognised directly in equity. 
Further information on the share schemes is provided in Note 6(D) to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
A . 	 A c c o u n ti n g 	 p o l i ci es	
Basis 	 of 	 pr eparati on
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in 
dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the 
Company’s financial statements. The Company’s financial statements 
are presented in the Company’s presentation currency of Sterling, 
rounded to the nearest million.
A cco u n ti n g 	 co n v en ti o n
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006 and applicable UK accounting standards and 
under the historical cost convention. The financial statements have 
been prepared on the going concern basis, which assumes that the 
Company will continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under 
Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 from presenting its own  
profit and loss account and the exemption from the requirement to 
prepare a cash flow statement under FRS1 (revised 1996) on the 
grounds that the cash flows are included within the consolidated  
cash flow statement. The profit after tax included in the financial 
statements of the Company, determined in accordance with the Act, 
was £345m (2013: £270m). 
F o r e i gn 	 cur r e nci es
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange 
rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are 
translated to Sterling at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. 
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in 
the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are 
measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated 
using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
t axati o n
The charge for taxation is based on the profit or loss for the period 
and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences 
between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting 
purposes. Except as otherwise required by accounting standards, 
full provision without discounting is made for all timing differences 
which have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date. Timing 
differences arise when items of income and expenditure are included 
in tax computations in periods different from their inclusion in the 
financial statements.
i n v estme n t s
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost less provision for 
impairment. Dividends received and receivable are credited to the 
Company’s profit and loss account on the date of receipt.
i nt e r est -be a ri n g 	 bo rr o wi n g s
Interest-bearing borrowings are recognised initially at fair value less 
attributable transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, 
interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any 
differences between cost and redemption value being recognised  
in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an 
effective interest rate basis.
c lassificati on 	 of 	 financial 	 instrument s 	 issued
Financial instruments issued by the Company are treated as equity 
only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions. 
The first condition is that they include no contractual obligation upon 
the Company to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange 
financial assets or financial liabilities with another party under 
conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Company. 
Notes to the Company’s financial statements 182 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014
FINaNCIal STa Te Me NTS
Notes to the Company’s financial statements  
continued
Additions in the year of £268m includes the following increases in 
investments: £204m increase in the cost of investment into TUI France 
SAS during the year for the purposes of recapitalising the Group’s 
French business, £24m increase in the cost of investment into TUI 
Travel Overseas Holdings Limited for the purposes of providing capital 
to that company’s subsidiaries and indirect joint ventures, £21m increase 
in the cost of investment in TUI Travel Holdings Limited for the 
purpose of effecting an intra-group entity reorganisation and £19m of 
share-based payment liabilities incurred. The costs of the share-based 
schemes, which are operated for employees of the Company’s 
subsidiaries, are borne by the subsidiaries, subject to local accounting 
standards. The Company recognises an increase in the investment in 
the subsidiary and a credit to other reserves in accordance with FRS 20 
‘Share-based payments‘. 
Details of the principal operating subsidiaries held directly and 
indirectly by the Company in the year ended 30 September 2014 
can be found in Note 32 of the consolidated financial statements. 
Included within the total impairment charge of £169m is an £8m 
impairment in Sportsworld Holdings Limited to reduce the net book 
value of the investment to its recoverable value of £nil. As part of 
effecting an intra-group reorganisation, it is planned for Sportsworld 
Holdings Limited to be liquidated in due course. An impairment of £161m 
(2013: £133m) has been charged in the year in respect of the cost of 
investment into TUI France SAS, following the recapitalisation during the 
year and the outcome from the Group’s annual impairment exercise. 
The investment into TUI France SAS principally relates to two CGUs 
that are the same as those used in the Group’s annual impairment test. 
These two CGUs are the French tour operator and the French airline, 
Corsair. Detailed disclosure of the impairment test and the basis for 
calculation have been set out in Note 10 of the consolidated financial 
statements. The cost of investment has been compared against the 
value in use of Corsair and the French tour operator, using discounted 
cash flows as a basis of measurement. 
The calculation of recoverable value for these two CGUs uses the 
following assumptions:
• Cash flow projections based on the Group’s latest Board approved 
three year business plan which management has extended by two 
years to create a five year plan; 
• Cash flows beyond the plan period are extrapolated using a real 
growth rate of 1.80% (2013: 1.75%); 
• Cash flows include the impact of working capital in both the asset 
base and the impact on cash flows over the plan period; and
• Cash flows are discounted using the Group’s WACC adjusted as 
appropriate for business specific factors, such as business risk.  
The risk-adjusted pre-tax WACC for these two CGUs was 9% 
(2013: 10%).
The Directors believe the carrying value of all investments is supportable.
A c c ou n tin g 	 p oli c i es 	continued
Any transactions of the Company’s Employee Benefit Trust are 
included in the Company’s financial statements. In particular, the Trust‘s 
purchases and sales of shares in the Company are debited and credited 
directly to equity.
R elated 	 par ties
For the purpose of these financial statements, parties are considered 
to be related to the Company if the Company has the ability, directly or 
indirectly, to control the party or exercise significant influence over the 
party making financial and operating decisions, or vice versa, or where 
the Company and the party are subject to common control or common 
significant influence. Related parties may be individuals or entities.  
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption contained within 
FRS 8 and has not therefore disclosed transactions or balances with 
entities which are wholly-owned subsidiaries.
Dividends on shares presented within shareholders’ funds Dividends 
distributed to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability 
and deducted from equity in the Company’s financial statements in the 
period in which the dividends are appropriately authorised and approved 
for payment and are no longer at the discretion of the Company. 
Unpaid dividends that do not meet these criteria are disclosed in the 
notes to the financial statements.

Following the receipt of irrevocable conversion notices from convertible bond holders during August 2014, 15,831,658 ordinary shares of 10p each 
were issued in September 2014 for a total consideration of £55m, representing the carrying value of the convertible bond extinguished at the date 
of conversion. As such, no cash was received on the issuance of these shares. The nominal value of the ordinary shares issued was £2m. £53m was 
credited to the share premium account on the issuance of these shares.
Following the receipt of irrevocable conversion notices from convertible bond holders in September 2014, 83,710,258 ordinary shares of 10p each 
were issued between 1 and 7 October 2014 for a total consideration of £292m, representing the carrying value of the convertible bond extinguished. 
No cash was received on the issuance of these shares. As the date of receipt of conversion notices represents the date of the extinguishment of 
the convertible bond liability, the 83,710,258 ordinary shares are deemed paid up in accordance with Section 583(2)(3) of Companies Act 2006, 
notwithstanding the fact that they were issued in October 2014. The nominal value of these ordinary shares of £8m, together with share premium 
of £284m, has been recognised in called up share capital and the share premium account respectively.
As described more fully in Note 36 of the consolidated financial statements, the ultimate parent company, TUI AG, is the beneficial owner of 
53.72% (2013: 54.48%) of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital as at 30 September 2014.
At 30 September 2014, 7,451,101 shares (2013: 8,047,575 shares) were held by the Group’s Employee Benefit Trust. Based on the 30 September 
2014 closing mid share price of £3.89 (2013: £3.68) the value of shares held was £29m (2013: £30m). 
Details of dividends debited to equity in the year are set out in Note 9 of the consolidated financial statements. Whilst the Company has the 
authority to purchase its own shares in the open market, it has not done so in either the current or prior years.

SHAREHOLDER INFORMATION
M. 	 c on tin ge n t 	 li a b i li ti es
There were contingent liabilities at 30 September 2014 in respect of 
guarantees and indemnities entered into as part of the ordinary course 
of the Group’s business. These guarantees cover payables by the 
Company’s subsidiaries for items such as insurance and credit facilities, 
car leases, aviation fuel, ground handling and airport services. The 
Company has also guaranteed the contractual obligations of various 
subsidiary companies in respect of the supply of a number of the 
Group’s aircraft fleet. No material losses are currently expected to be 
incurred by the Company from such contingent liabilities. 
Where the Company enters into financial guarantee contracts in order 
to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within its Group, 
the Company considers these to be insurance arrangements and 
accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the 
guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it 
becomes probable that the Company will be required to make a 
payment under the guarantee. At 30 September 2014, the Company 
had contingent liabilities in respect of counter-guarantees for letters of 
credit amounting to £120m (2013: £136m). The Company has also 
guaranteed £15m of external bank facilities of its Russian joint venture, 
TT-Travel LLC, of which it indirectly owns 49%.
The Company is an obligor to the Group’s revolving credit facilities 
totalling £1,225m, details of which are set out in Note 26(F) of the 
consolidated financial statements. At 30 September 2014, the 
drawndown portion of this facility was £nil (2013: £nil). 
As disclosed in Notes 6 and 10 of the consolidated financial statements, 
the Group has established a pension funding partnership as part of the 
deficit funding arrangements for the three main UK defined benefit 
pension schemes. The arrangements between the parties involved, one 
of which is the Company, include an obligation on the Company to pay 
cash into the TUI Travel Amber E&W LLP should TUI UK Limited’s 
turnover fall below certain thresholds, should either of the Thomson or 
First Choice brands (‘Brand Assets’) be sold, should a formal valuation 
conclude that the distressed value of the Brand Assets, together with 
any other permitted assets, have declined to a value below £276m and, 
during the final five years of the structure, should the Company have 
insufficient bank facilities to pay the total capital payments due to 
the schemes. 
Under the terms of guarantees given to the Civil Aviation Authority 
and other relevant authorities by the Company in respect of certain 
subsidiaries, in the event of default the Company could be held liable 
to the extent of the subsidiaries’ net trading liabilities at the time 
of default.
No amount is recognised in the Company’s balance sheet in respect 
of any of the above guarantees as it is not probable that there will be 
an outflow of resources.
The Company may be required to recapitalise direct subsidiaries in 
certain countries where there is a legal requirement to do so in the 
event that the net assets or reserves fall below a determined level. 
Where recapitalisation is required, the recapitalisation will be accounted 
for as an increase in the cost of investment in that subsidiary, and 
subsequently tested for impairment (see Note D).
The Company, and its subsidiaries, is at any time defending a number of 
actions against it arising in the normal course of business. Provision is 
made for these actions where this is deemed appropriate. The Directors 
consider that adequate provision has been made for all known liabilities.

In April 2010 the Company issued a £400m fixed rate 4.9% convertible 
bond, of which an independent special purpose company (Antium 
Finance Ltd) subscribed for 50%. TUI AG entered into a forward 
purchase agreement with Antium Finance Ltd for those £200m of 
convertible bonds (representing 86,967,049 shares), in order to prevent 
dilution of its majority shareholding. TUI AG is entitled to receive the 
interest coupon on these bonds and to purchase them. According to a 
new contractual arrangement dated 10 October 2013, Antium Finance 
Ltd has assigned its rights to Deutsche Bank AG and the entitlement 
of TUI AG to purchase the bonds is extended to July 2016 at the latest. 
By way of security, TUI AG has transferred to Antium Finance Ltd 
86,967,049 shares, representing 7.14% of the Company’s share capital 
on an undiluted basis, and these shares are restricted from being 
transferred. However, TUI AG remains entitled to the dividend yields, 
to exercise the voting rights attached to them and to repurchase them 
by July 2016 at the latest. 
Further details of the convertible bonds are given in Notes 20 and 31 
of the consolidated financial statements.

On 15 September 2014, the Independent Directors of the Company 
and the Executive Board (Vorstand) of TUI AG announced that they 
had reached agreement on the terms of a recommended all-share 
nil-premium merger of the Company and TUI AG (the ‘merger’), to 
be implemented by way of a scheme of arrangement of the Company 
under Part 26 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘Scheme’). The scheme 
document in connection with the Scheme, containing the notice of the 
Court Meeting and Notice of General Meeting, was published on 2 
October 2014 (the ‘Scheme Document’). 
At the Court Meeting of the Scheme Shareholders and the General 
Meeting of the TUI Travel Shareholders, both held on 28 October 2014, 
the resolutions contained in the notice of the Court Meeting and 
Notice of General Meeting were duly passed by the requisite majorities. 
It is expected that the Court Hearing to sanction the Scheme will be 
held on 10 December 2014 and that the Scheme will be effective on 
11 December 2014 (as set out in the Scheme Document).  186 TUI Travel P l C Annu Al Repo Rt & Accounts 2014

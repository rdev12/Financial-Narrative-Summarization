Governance Strategic report  Market overview
The digital inkjet  
opportunity
Most things we come into  
contact with on a daily basis  
are patterned, decorated, printed 
or finished in some way. In fact, 
even after excluding printing  
in the office or the home, over  
3 trillion m
2
 of material is printed, 
patterned, decorated or finished 
each year – that’s roughly equivalent 
to the surface area of India.
These items can be broadly split into  
four areas: products, packaging, promotion 
and publishing. Products includes things  
like ceramic tiles and laminate flooring. 
Packaging includes labels on bottles and 
bar codes on boxes. Promotion includes 
advertising banners and posters. Publishing 
includes books and newspapers. 
Perhaps surprisingly around 97%  
of production processes used in the 
manufacture of these items still use 
traditional analogue technology. Analogue 
(sometimes referred to as ‘fixed image’) 
solutions can be very effective when  
the same image is replicated many, many 
times. However, where frequent changes 
are required or run lengths are shorter,  
then digital (also known as ‘variable image’) 
processes can provide significant cost  
and inventory reduction whilst improving 
time-to-market versus analogue techniques. 
Over the last 20 years digital imaging 
technologies, including digital inkjet, have 
emerged for applying images, patterns  
or finishes in more efficient, flexible and 
cost-effective ways. Because of its ability  
to work with a variety of jetting fluids and 
substrates, and in difficult environments, 
inkjet has the unique ability to potentially 
replace all current printing techniques.
The pace of inkjet’s adoption and the rate it 
displaces existing technologies is driven by 
some key factors, including cost, speed and 
image quality, which must be met in order 
for the adoption to take place. Because of 
these characteristics the adoption of inkjet 
has typically occurred through ‘waves of 
conversion’ in distinct market segments,  
as the developing technology meets the 
individual conversion requirements of 
particular applications.
Xaar, a world leader in industrial inkjet, has 
successfully developed digital technology 
and manufactured and sold inkjet products, 
predominantly printheads, into a number of 
sectors. The printhead is the heart of the 
digital process, depositing fluids, including 
inks and coatings, in precisely the right 
quantity and in the right place on the 
substrate, without even touching  
the surface.
To date Xaar has driven, and benefited  
from, ‘waves of conversion’ in two particular 
applications: outdoor advertising (including 
billboards, posters and banners) and 
ceramic tile decoration, which have both 
adopted digital inkjet technology. These two 
applications presently use inkjet to annually 
produce over 7 billion m
2
, but represent  
only 0.2% of the 3 trillion m
2
 entire global 
print production.
Xaar’s challenge is to expand its existing 
digital inkjet printhead technology into new 
markets and to develop new technology to 
maximise the opportunity that exists from 
the conversion of much larger applications 
to digital inkjet.
Looking forward, the opportunities for digital 
print continue to develop, with industry 
forecasts projecting that the conversion to 
digital over the next 10 years is expected  
to be twice that seen over the last 20 years.
Products includes things like 
ceramic tiles and laminate flooring. 
Packaging includes labels on  
bottles and bar codes on boxes.  
Promotion includes advertising 
banners and posters. Publishing 
includes books and newspapers.

www.xaar.com 3 Our business at a glance
Xaar is a world leader in the development of inkjet technology 
and a manufacturer of piezoelectric drop-on-demand 
industrial inkjet printheads, the key component in a digital 
printing system. Unlike analogue printing, digital printing 
requires no physical master image to copy from, and hence 
enables economic short run, or variable data, printing. The 
printhead is the device which converts the electronic image 
data into the physical image on the substrate. To achieve this, 
Xaar technology is a combination of high speed mixed signal 
electronics, micro-mechanics, and fluid dynamics. 
Our flagship printhead is the Xaar 1001, but our full range 
includes numerous other printheads. A typical industrial inkjet 
machine could be firing up to 300 million drops of ink per 
second – that’s over 1 trillion drops per hour, all controlled 
within the picolitre range of volume and the micron range  
of placement accuracy (a picolitre is a millionth of a millionth  
of a litre, and a micron is a millionth of a metre).
Xaar sells its technology in component form (the printhead)  
to Original Equipment Manufacturers (OEMs) who produce 
and sell the end digital printing product to the end market. In 
addition to our close engagement with OEMs we also actively 
partner and co-develop with fluid suppliers, hardware and 
software integrators, and substrate suppliers to deliver a 
robust and attractive total solution to the end user. 
Our technology is used all over the world in a wide range of 
manufacturing applications.
We design and manufacture our printheads in the UK and 
Sweden, exporting over 90% of our production to customers 
around the world. We also develop and sell ink systems, 
electronics, and fluid optimisation services to accelerate  
inkjet system development and adoption.
Industrial
The Industrial sector presently includes ceramic tile 
decoration, decorative laminate, and advanced/additive 
manufacturing processes.
Packaging
The Packaging sector presently includes primary  
labels, secondary labels, coding and marking,  
and direct-to-shape printing.

Ceramic tile production 
Ceramics is a 10.5 billon m
2
 market currently and 
digital conversion was estimated to be around 
40% at the end of 2013. There are c. 10,000 
production lines around the world, with almost  
half of these in China. Decoration is the key feature 
which sells the tile. Xaar digital inkjet solution 
provides an end result which is superior in terms  
of image quality, at a lower cost, plus with the 
advantages of flexibility, inventory reduction,  
and larger tile size capability. Tile manufacturing 
operates in a harsh industrial environment with 
high reliability/duty cycle requirements; hence any 
technology deployed needs to be appropriately 
robust. The market has been moving to digital 
inkjet decoration over the last ten years but 
the pace of change has recently accelerated 
significantly because the Xaar 1001 with TF 
Technology™ delivers both quality and cost 
advantages over traditional analogue methods 
within a robust architecture suitable to this  
harsh environment. 
Coding and marking 
Coding and marking is an application of printing 
predominantly monochrome bar codes and  
logos on outer case/secondary packaging of 
consumer goods. This is an established and 
stable business based on bulk piezo which 
competes with alternative technologies  
including laser and thermal inkjet.
Grand/Wide-format graphics 
Grand/Wide-format graphics (GWFG)  
includes both internal and external signage  
and advertising, including billboards, posters 
and point of sale advertising. It is the most 
mature industrial inkjet market, active for over 
15 years. Xaar’s growth to date has been based 
on its original set of bulk piezo products, which 
delivered annual growth from 2003 to 2007 .  
To stimulate further material growth for Xaar 
new product developments are required to 
enhance the portfolio, the first of which is 
expected to launch during 2014.
Decorative laminates
Decorative laminates is estimated to be at  
7 .9 billon m
2
 of annual output with c. 1,600 
production lines around the world supplying 
simulated wood materials to the furniture and 
building industries. Decoration is often the key 
feature which sells the board/plank/finished item 
and digital quality is now being demonstrated 
which matches the analogue process, thereby 
offering the opportunity for more economic  
short run work to be undertaken whilst reducing 
inventories and improving time to market. Inkjet  
is the only digital solution which meets the high 
reliability and high duty cycle requirements 
needed within this industry. Digital adoption  
is still at the very early stages in this application, 
and the rate of adoption is expected to grow  
over the next few years.
Primary label 
Primary label printing is estimated to be  
a market producing over 55 billion m
2
 annually,  
with only 5% of this market converted to digital 
printing to date. The change driver is the delivery 
of lower cost per copy on run lengths up to 
100,000 impressions (versus only 50,000 
impressions 3 years ago). There is a large range 
of substrates and inks in this application which 
adds complication to the conversion process; 
however, over the past year progress in this  
space is clear.
Advanced/additive manufacturing 
Applications include demand for the fine coating, 
patterning and printing of functional fluids onto 
numerous substrates in numerous industries.  
The square meterage of these types of 
applications is smaller than many mainstream 
printing processes; however, the value of the  
fluid deposition process is considerably higher. 
Applications are challenging and push inkjet to  
its known limits and beyond in fields such as 
nano imprinting, solar cell manufacturing and 
display screen production. Xaar has been 
working with multiple partners in laboratories  
all over the world exploring what may be possible  
in the future. Technical progress is promising but 
volume commercial implementation of many of 
these applications is still believed to be some 
years into the future.
Direct-to-shape 
Direct-to-shape is a new application  
where the bottles and containers are directly 
imaged without the need for a label. This 
emerging sector will undergo first field trials 
during 2014. The solution is aimed at shortening  
time to market whilst simultaneously reducing 
inventory and unit costs versus existing 
methods. This approach also enables mass 
customised marketing and event targeting.

Well placed in  
a growing market
I am delighted to report on a year of 
significant progress in our business during 
the 12 months ended 31 December 2013. 
Continuing the theme from my 2013 Interim 
Report, we have continued to deliver 
excellent financial results, whilst investing 
heavily for the future. All of our investments 
during the period in additional staff, facilities, 
and assets have been self-funded.  
Due to the substantial rise in our market 
capitalisation we were pleased to be 
admitted to the FTSE 250 in June 2013.
We have grown our revenue in each of  
our markets such that we achieved record 
revenue in the year, growing 55% over 2012 
and more than trebling revenue over the last 
four years. Adjusted profit before tax has 
more than doubled over 2012, which was 
itself a 7 4% increase over 201 1. Adjusted 
diluted earnings per share has also more 
than doubled to 43.2p in 2013 (2012: 20. 1p), 
this being the fourth year in a row of 
substantial earnings growth. We continue  
to generate cash despite the investments 
referred to above and ended 2013 with  
net cash (cash and cash equivalents  
and treasury deposits) of £53.5 million  
and no debt resulting in a very strong 
balance sheet.
Sales into the industrial sector continue  
to account for a high proportion of our 
revenues, driven primarily by the continued 
conversion of the global ceramic tile market 
and success of Platform 3 (P3) products. 
Other applications in the sector, including 
decorative laminates and additive 
manufacturing, continue to make good  
early stage progress, albeit generating 
modest revenues to date. The packaging 
market continues to be a key focus area  
for the Company, and during the year we 
achieved strong growth in the primary label 
application. It was also pleasing to see the 
first public demonstrations of ‘direct-to-
shape’ printing technology during the  
second half of the year and we will continue 
to work with our OEM partners in this space 
to support the field trials of the technology 
during 2014. Sales into the graphics market 
continue to be dominated by our older 
generation of products; this will be 
addressed by the launch of a new 
generation product during 2014 which is 
intended to re-start growth in this market.
Our excellent profit performance has  
been achieved as a result of extremely  
high asset and people utilisation. In order to 
bring utilisation back to standard levels and 
create the opportunity for further growth we 
are investing £30 million in manufacturing 
assets at the Huntingdon facility to generate 
an additional 75% manufacturing capacity 
for the Xaar 1001/2 product, which is 
scheduled to be in place by mid-2014. The 
dramatic, but virtually trouble free, increase 
in output during 2013 could not have been 
achieved without the dedication and talent 
of the Xaar Operations team. 
During this rapid growth phase we have 
continued to hire talent globally. Whilst  
the majority of hires have been from the UK, 
the specialised nature of our business and 
our desire to employ only the best means 
that we have attracted people from around 
the world and have built a truly multi-national 
team of approximately 800 staff. Our 
Huntingdon manufacturing site has 
increased staff by 57% during 2013. 
Additionally, we have increased research 
and development (R&D) staff by 64% and 
this has required us to take a third building 
on the Cambridge Science Park.
I reserved comment on our new thin film 
piezo technology (Platform 4) deliberately  
until after mentioning the significant 
additional investment we are making in 
R&D. We anticipate that our bulk piezo 
technology has a strong future, but we 
know that there is plenty of opportunity  
for a new supplementary technology  
Phil Lawler
Chairman 
18 March 2014
6 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 with different attributes. Progress has  
been made during 2013 culminating 
in a successful internal technology 
demonstration in December 2013. We 
remain on track with our plan to deliver  
the first thin film product commercially  
in late 2016. Our plans are ambitious and 
therefore come with risks. However, as a 
global leader in this very large but highly 
segmented market, we believe this is 
unquestionably the right decision. 
Xaar’s consistent approach is one of 
delivery and we have deliberately chosen  
to be relatively low profile. However, it was 
pleasing during one week in November 
2013 to receive the following awards:
• ‘Main Stock Market Company of the Year’ 
– Shares Magazine
• ‘Tech Growth Business of the Year’ –  
UK Tech Awards
• ‘UK Manufacturing Site of the Year’ – 
National Microelectronics Institute
Additionally, in March 2014 Xaar plc won 
‘Company of the Year’ for 2013 at the  
PLC Awards.
These awards are a testament to the 
increased standing the Group has achieved, 
due entirely to the high quality and 
dedication of its management and staff.
Xaar’s continuing financial performance  
and increased net cash in 2013 has enabled 
the Board to recommend a final dividend of 
5.5 pence. This, together with the 2.5 pence 
interim dividend paid on 4 October 2013, 
equals 8 pence for the year, a doubling  
of the total dividend paid for 2012.
There were no changes to Board 
membership during 2013; however,  
due to the significant growth of the 
Company there will be changes during 
2014. Due to the significantly enlarged scale 
of the R&D function, the Board has decided 
to appoint a Chief Technical Officer (CTO) 
and I am delighted to announce that 
Edmund Creutzmann will join the Board  
as CTO on 1 April 2014. Edmund brings 
over 30 years of digital printing R&D 
expertise to the Company following an 
extensive career at Siemens AG and Océ 
Printing Systems GmbH. Reporting to the 
CTO the R&D function has been split into 
two departments, with R&D 1 focusing on 
bulk piezo technology products (Platform  
1, 2, 3) and R&D 2 focusing on thin film 
technology products (Platform 4). Ramon 
Borrell, previously R&D Director, will  
become Director of R&D 2, and a new  
hire, Brian James, will head up R&D 1.  
As a consequence Ramon Borrell will step 
down from the Board effective 1 April 2014, 
allowing him to concentrate all his efforts  
on the critical task of successfully bringing 
Platform 4 to market. We welcome Edmund 
to the Board and thank Ramon for all his 
contributions as R&D Director. We look 
forward to his success on the thin film 
programme. A second planned change  
to the Board anticipated for 2014 is the 
recruitment of an additional experienced 
Non-Executive Director to bring 
organisational development experience  
to the Board as well as improving the 
balance of Executive to Non-Executive 
Board membership.
After 12 years of dedication and focus  
to Xaar, Ian Dinwoodie, CEO, has informed 
the Board of his intention to retire during 
2015. Ian has overseen the significant 
development of the Company, with an 
adjusted diluted earnings per share of  
1.6 pence when he took over as CEO  
in 2003, growing to a record 43.2 pence  
in 2013. An extensive search will now  
be undertaken for Ian’s successor.
The annual report and accounts have  
been re-designed for 2013 to provide a 
more focused and useful document to 
readers of the accounts, giving a good 
understanding of both the opportunities  
and risks faced by the Group. This is in  
line with recommendations from the 
Combined Code and best practice. The 
Group continues to comply with the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2010. Board 
meetings are supported by detailed papers 
and timely minutes. Attendance by all 
members remains excellent and I take  
this opportunity to thank them for their 
continuing commitment, professionalism 
and, above all this year, results. The Board 
continues to take dedicated days to 
consider and review the Group’s strategy. 
Detailed market and competitive analysis  
is undertaken in advance and the future 
direction and capabilities of the Group are 
debated in detail. The Board, its Executives, 
Chairman and Non-Executives are all 
evaluated annually against specific and 
relevant performance criteria.
Whilst 2013 has been an excellent year  
of progress for the Company, and the  
next period is expected to be more modest 
in terms of growth, we believe we are still 
very much at the start of the analogue  
to digital print transformation and as  
such we continue to see significant 
opportunities ahead.

A clear strategy 
for growth
2013 has been an exceptional year for  
Xaar and represents the fourth year in a  
row of substantial growth in both revenue 
and profits for the Company. This year’s 
excellent financial performance has been 
mainly driven from the acceleration of  
the adoption of Xaar’s market-leading 
technology in the Chinese ceramic  
tile market and good progress in the 
development of the packaging market. 
Sales growth has been enabled by a 
rapid ramp in output from the Huntingdon 
facility which has been working at well  
over 100% of its standard capacity  
for the majority of the year.
Two important investment decisions  
were taken during 2013. Firstly, we began  
a programme to further increase capacity  
at the Huntingdon site to ensure that growth 
over the next few years would not be 
restricted by the availability of production 
capacity. Secondly, we accelerated the 
growth in R&D resources and re-organised 
the R&D function to ensure that appropriate 
resources are allocated to the development 
of both our existing bulk piezo technology 
and our new thin film piezo technology. 
Given that the industry is still at an early 
stage of the transition from analogue to 
digital printing, and the size of the potential 
opportunity, we are committed to continuing 
to make substantial R&D investment for 
many years to ensure that Xaar maximises 
its future potential. 
Our strategy is to drive the development  
of Xaar technology into selected multiple 
applications and industries, delivering 
sustainable profitable growth. Our tactics 
are to become the primary enabler of 
change in our target markets, leading the 
initial wave of conversion, and then to 
protect our position through replacement 
product sales enabled by continuous 
product development. The size of the 
conversion opportunity, the rate of change, 
and the key characteristics enabling that 
change will vary from market to market. 
OEMs are mostly market specific which 
means we work with a number of OEM 
customers in developing their inkjet 
solutions for a discrete market.
Further detail on our strategy and  
progress made in 2013 is set out  
in the ‘Our strategy’ section.
Market adoption of our technology 
strengthened during the year with revenues 
from industrial applications growing 79% 
and packaging applications growing 31%. 
Our graphics business grew very modestly 
and is expected to grow faster following  
the launch of the Xaar 501 in 2014. Within 
Industrial applications, the ceramic tile 
business moved ahead very strongly  
with laminate and advanced/additive 
manufacturing applications making 
encouraging but early modest progress. 
Ian Dinwoodie
Chief Executive 
18 March 2014
8 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Within the packaging applications the 
primary label revenues grew strongly  
whilst the coding and marking revenues 
were stable. Good technical progress was 
made in the ‘direct-to-shape’ application; 
material revenues are not expected until 
2015 at the earliest.
The doubling of R&D spending and the 
creation of two discrete R&D labs, each 
focused on its own technology stream, is 
intended to enable a multi-year pipeline  
of new products based on both bulk and 
thin film piezo technology. During 2014  
both the Xaar 1002 and the Xaar 501 
products will launch, which are intended  
to both strengthen our offering in existing 
markets and open up new opportunities. 
Also releasing in early 2014 is our gigabit 
ethernet based electronics sub-system 
named XPM. This product offers customers 
significantly increased data transfer rates 
and memory for data intensive applications. 
Additionally, during 2014 we will market  
test a completely new bulk piezo jetting 
structure aimed at significantly higher film 
weight applications where drop sizes up  
to 10,000 times the size normally used in 
digital printing are required. If successful, 
material revenues could be expected from 
2015 onwards. 
Significant progress has been achieved  
on our thin film technology development 
during the year, culminating in a successful 
internal technology demonstration in 
December 2013. The first thin film product 
development is now under way and as 
previously stated we would anticipate 
sampling this to customers in 2015 with  
first commercial revenues planned for late 
2016. The thin film programme is aimed at 
converting new markets and accelerating 
the conversion of others through a portfolio 
of new products.
Substantial capacity and capability have 
been added to the Company during the 
year including £19.8 million of capital asset 
additions, 2,500 m
2
 of additional laboratory 
and design/development space, and over 
300 people hired. I would like to thank all  
of our staff for their efforts to achieve  
this substantial change in scale of the 
Company over such a short period.
Whilst growth is expected to be more 
modest over the next period, looking further 
forward the opportunities for digital print 
continue to develop, with industry forecasts 
projecting that the conversion to digital over 
the next 10 years is expected to be twice 
that seen in the last 20 years. Technology 
and product developments are key to  
this change and Xaar is committed to 
maximising its opportunity by continuing  
to push at the forefront of this revolution. 
After 12 challenging and enjoyable years  
at Xaar I have decided to retire during 2015. 
My decision is entirely a personal one, and  
I remain fully committed to continuing the 
development of the Company between  
now and my planned retirement date. We 
are beginning the search for my successor 
now, and I will ensure that a smooth 
transition occurs during 2015.
‘ 2013 has been an exceptional year 
for Xaar and represents the fourth 
year in a row of substantial growth  
in both revenue and profits. ’

www.xaar.com 11 Developing new products  
and new technology
We manage our product development programmes 
across three horizons: short term by delivering updates 
and improvements; medium term by developing new 
products or derivatives using existing technologies;  
and longer term through research and development  
of novel technologies.
Over the short to medium term to create and maintain 
competitive advantage it is critical that we continue to 
improve existing products as well as developing new 
products. Over the medium to long term to access a 
greater proportion of the enormous industrial print 
market we must continue to develop new technology 
which can open up new opportunities for the application 
of digital inkjet in established analogue markets. 
We develop and maintain the different sets of skills  
and processes needed to successfully execute the 
programmes in each of the three horizons, and we 
balance our programme portfolio to achieve short, 
medium and long term objectives targeted at  
achieving sustained profitable growth.
Products developed to date use our patented Xaar bulk 
piezo technology. Our thin film piezo programme is at an 
early development stage but is on track with the first 
product launch targeted in late 2016. This technology  
will enable us to target a wider range of applications.
Inkjet is a heavily patented area and managing our IP is 
critical to our success, both in terms of protecting our 
position and avoiding infringing other parties, IP . Our 
technology is protected by over 500 patents to date.
We allocate significant resources to research and 
development to enable the successful completion  
of programmes which will generate future sales. 
12 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Progress in 2013
During 2013 we have worked on making our world-
leading Xaar 1001 product even better, and this 
culminated in the launch of the 1002 in early 2014 which 
delivers even higher print quality and unrivalled reliability. 
We have also continued to work on development of the 
Xaar 501 product, which is targeted to build back our 
position in Graphic Arts. This product will commence 
sampling to customers during the first half of 2014.
Our new gigabit ethernet based electronic driver 
sub-system named XPM was also developed during 
2013, offering customers significantly increased data 
transfer rates and memory for data intensive applications. 
The first units are presently in field trial with commercial 
shipments expected to commence in H1 2014.
Our thin film programme aims to open up more  
of the existing analogue market to Xaar through the 
development of a solution which offers a generational 
shift in performance. In December 2013 an internal 
technology demonstration was successfully delivered 
by the R&D team, and although there is a long  
way to go on this challenging programme, progress  
is encouraging and remains on track versus  
our expectations. 
Also during 2013 the base concept design has  
been completed for a jetting structure capable of firing 
droplets 10,000 times larger than those normally used 
in the imaging/decoration process. This structure will  
be market tested during 2014 in applications requiring 
significantly higher drop weights and film thicknesses 
than standard.
In 2013 we increased our investment in R&D  
by 105% versus 2012 to £16.4 million, which 
represented 12% of revenue.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements 
www.xaar.com 13 Building the  
eco-system
 
To successfully penetrate a market, an eco-system of 
technical and commercial partnerships must be formed 
to drive and support market conversion.
Xaar’s direct customers are OEMs, who manufacture 
equipment for patterning, decorating, finishing or printing 
products in a number of different market sectors.  
We provide our OEM partners with the know-how and 
ability to incorporate our innovative range of printheads, 
systems components, and electronics into their 
equipment to increase the value and functionality of  
their own products, and minimise the time required  
to bring products to market.
In addition to our close engagement with OEMs we  
also actively partner and co-develop with fluid suppliers, 
hardware and software integrators, and substrate 
suppliers to deliver a robust and attractive total solution 
to the end user. We operate an open ink policy so that 
our customers can choose the ink supplier that best 
suits them and their application. In addition, we work in 
partnership with the world’s leading ink manufacturers  
to develop and approve a wide range of inks which are 
optimised for our printheads and the end application.
Given the complexity of the final integrated solution,  
it is typical that our partners’ development cycles are 
measured in years rather than months, with successful 
solutions then benefiting from long commercial 
lifecycles. To support these developments we deploy 
sales and technical support staff globally ensuring a 
local presence in each of the key geographical regions.
14 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Progress in 2013
We continue to work with the leading OEMs in our 
target sectors as well as the appropriate fluid suppliers, 
hardware and software integrators, and substrate 
suppliers in order to deliver a robust and attractive  
total solution to the end user.
The selection of Xaar by multiple OEMs for the 
direct-to-shape programmes is a strong indication  
of our position as market leader in the development  
of new applications.
Across all markets and applications Xaar now has 
approaching 250 active eco-system partners.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements 
www.xaar.com 15 Converting  
multiple markets
The markets and applications that use Xaar’s printheads 
can be diverse but can be grouped to have similar 
characteristics and general imaging requirements.
Xaar’s products are designed to provide benefits  
across multiple applications. This strategy means we 
can offer solutions across multiple applications through 
efficiency in development and implementation. We also 
continuously enhance product performance which 
allows our OEMs to take advantage of upgrades with 
minimal changes at the system level.
The Xaar 1001, with its high resolution greyscale  
(variable drop size) and TF Technology™ (fluid 
recirculation), ensures an exceptional quality of print in 
one single pass of the substrate under the printhead, 
which maximises productivity and delivers significant 
quality and cost advantages over traditional analogue 
methods in ceramics and other industrial applications. 
Although the Xaar 1001 is the market-leading printhead 
in the ceramics sector, it is also used for printing primary 
labels, decorative laminates and packaging. 
To date we have focused on three main sectors: 
Industrial, which covers ceramics, decorative laminates 
and advanced/additive manufacturing; Packaging, 
which includes product labelling, direct-to-shape 
(printing directly onto bottles and containers) and coding 
and marking (printing bar codes and data); and Graphic 
Arts, which includes wide-format graphics (typically 
outdoor advertising, posters and banners), commercial 
print, and varnishing. The wide-format graphics sector 
was the first to adopt industrial inkjet and is, therefore, 
the most mature. The ceramics market has been 
moving into digital inkjet decoration over the last ten 
years. However, the pace of change accelerated 
significantly after the Xaar 1001 was launched in 2007 .
16 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Progress in 2013
The market-leading Xaar 1001 has continued to  
make progress in 2013 through multiple applications. 
Following the success of the product in European 
ceramic tile manufacturing from 2010 onwards, the 
Xaar 1001 has been quickly adopted as the solution of 
choice for ceramic tile decoration in China, the largest 
producer and consumer of ceramic tiles with c.45%  
of the world’s volume. 
Success in the digital decoration of ceramic tiles  
has uncovered the potential for digital inkjet to provide 
benefits in other areas of the ceramic tile manufacturing 
process, such as glaze, structure, and finishing effects. 
Whilst some of these areas may be serviced by the Xaar 
1001 technology, it is likely that new technology may be 
required to address the balance of those opportunities.
The Xaar 1001 has also made further progress in 
packaging applications, with five major OEMs delivering 
leading edge digital presses to the label market in 2013 
and four OEMs demonstrating the potential of direct-to-
shape technology solutions for the first time in public.
The first digital inkjet decorative laminate lines were 
installed during 2013, again based on the Xaar 1001. It 
is expected that after a successful evaluation phase this 
technology will gain incremental adoption in this market.
The advanced/additive manufacturing development 
programmes which use the Xaar 1001 range from 
semiconductors through solar cells to display screens.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements 
www.xaar.com 17 Enhancing  
our capability
In order to successfully develop new products  
and new technology, and to sustain or grow sales 
into multiple end markets, we must constantly 
develop our capability in terms of our human and 
other resources, specifically both our R&D and 
manufacturing capacity and capability, and the 
structure of our organisation.
The success of our business depends on our people 
so we recruit only the best. We offer competitive 
salary and benefits packages as well as share 
incentive plans and our employees benefit from 
extensive training and development opportunities. 
We aim to build long term relationships with all our 
employees by helping them grow and develop and 
by making Xaar a great place to work and a great 
Company to be involved with. The result sees our 
employees staying with us for longer and developing 
a key understanding of the business. This makes 
sense for our people, our customers and our 
shareholders – we know that employees who  
are engaged with our business deliver better 
solutions, leading to increased employee  
satisfaction and increased sales.
Our state-of-the-art manufacturing facilities are 
located in Huntingdon, UK (5,000 m
2
) and Järfälla, 
Sweden (7 ,000 m
2
). Manufacturing is cleanroom 
based with 24/7 demands for complex facilities 
requirements including climate control, gases  
and chemicals. The cleanrooms contain islands  
of processing automation, with custom made or 
specially modified processing and test equipment. 
Operation is multi-shift and runs with small 
processing windows and micron scale tolerances. 
Production involves multiple non-reworkable 
processing steps, resulting in a highly sensitive 
cumulative yield; unit cost and throughput are  
highly dependent upon yield.
Manufacturing is capital intensive; at 31 December 
2013 we had already invested over £40 million in our 
Huntingdon facility since it opened in 2006, and we 
will be investing a further £20 million before the end  
of 2014. Capacity must be planned in advance; 
increments are on a 12 month lead time.
18 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 As noted throughout this report our investment in 
headcount grew strongly in 2013, with headcount 
up 43% year on year, closing 2013 at just short of  
800 employees.
We continue to develop our induction programme and 
the training and development opportunities on offer to 
our staff.
Our efforts to provide competitive benefit and reward 
packages, to communicate regularly with all staff and to 
issue clear and fair policies have paid dividends in terms 
of employee engagement and low absence rates.
In 2012 we completed an 18 month, £22 million 
expansion programme in our Huntingdon facility to 
support the success of our technology in the ceramic 
tile application. Following the rapid acceleration of  
the adoption of our technology in China ceramic tile 
production in quarter four 2012 and early 2013, we 
began a programme to further increase capacity at  
the Huntingdon site to ensure that growth over the  
next few years would not be restricted by the availability 
of production capability. We are investing around  
£30 million in total during 2013 and the first half of 2014 
to grow capacity c.75% above the level delivered by the 
expansion programme which completed in 2012.
R&D facility space including both laboratories and 
design/development space was increased in the year 
by 2,500 m
2
, and Xaar now occupies three buildings  
on the prestigious Cambridge Science Park.

A year of  
exceptional  
growth  
Revenue
Adjusted revenue increased by 55% in 2013 
to £134. 1 million (2012: £86.3 million). The 
majority of Xaar’s revenue is generated by 
product sales, commissions and fees 
(£127 .2 million or 95% of total sales in 2013), 
with 5% of revenue in 2013 derived from 
adjusted licensee royalty income. Revenue 
reported under International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) was £137 . 1 
million in 2013 (2012: £86.3 million). In 2013, 
£3.0 million of licensee royalty income was 
recorded which related to the settlement  
of under-reported licensee royalties for the 
period 2006 to 2012, and this is excluded 
in the calculation of adjusted revenue.
Industrial markets (i.e. associated with  
the production of physical end products) 
continue to be the largest end application 
for Xaar’s technology. Business in these 
markets grew by 79% over 2012, generating 
sales of £98.2 million (2012: £55.0 million), 
which accounted for 73% of total adjusted 
revenue (2012: 64%).

Xaar’s technology in China, the world’s 
largest market for the production and 
consumption of ceramic tiles. OEMs in  
both Europe and China service the Chinese 
market with Xaar’s market-leading 1001 
product, which delivers substantial benefits 
over traditional analogue processes and  
has now established digital inkjet as the 
desired standard method of manufacture. 
Competition in this field has grown from 
well-established competitors in Xaar’s  
other end markets, including some Xaar 
licensees, but to date we have been 
successful in maintaining our dominant 
market share through the superiority of our 
technology and products, combined with a 
competitive pricing strategy. In March 2014 
we launched the Xaar 1002, a re-design  
of the world-beating 1001 product, which 
provides benefits to OEMs and end users  
in terms of image quality and ease of use.
Ceramics accounts for well over 90% of 
sales in the industrial sector, but progress  
in other industrial applications, including 
decorative laminates (false wood), continues 
to be encouraging, with modest growth in 
year on year sales.
Alex Bevis
Finance Director  
18 March 2014
22 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Sales into the packaging market were  
31% higher compared with the previous 
year at £15.7 million (2012: £12.0 million) and 
represent 12% (2012: 14%) of total sales. 
The well-established coding and marking 
application, serviced by Xaar’s original 
product portfolio, continues to provide  
a steady contribution, with around 50%  
of sales in the total packaging segment. 
However, the Xaar 1001 product in primary 
labels and other packaging applications 
such as direct-to-shape provided the 
majority of growth in the sector. 
Sales into Xaar’s initial end market 
application, Graphic Arts, delivered 2% 
growth and totalled £13.3 million for the  
year (2012: £13. 1 million) representing 10% 
of total sales (2012: 15%). The planned 
release of the Xaar 501 is due in 2014,  
and sales from this product are required  
to build a recovery of sales in this segment 
closer to the levels seen in earlier years.
As a supplier of technology to OEM 
partners, our geographic sales split reflects 
where our products are integrated into the 
manufacturing equipment, which is not 
necessarily the end-user location.
In 2013, Europe, Middle East and  
Africa (EMEA) remained the Company’s 
largest sales region at £67 .5 million (2012: 
£50.0 million), representing 35% growth 
over the previous year. The primary growth 
application in Europe was ceramic tile 
decoration through OEM partners located in 
Spain and Italy who increasingly addressed 
the Chinese market, but who also continued 
to service Europe and made progress in  
the conversion of manufacturing in South 
America. Outside of ceramics, primary  
label and decorative laminate applications 
continued to grow, albeit on a smaller scale. 
For 2013 the EMEA region represented 50% 
of total revenue, compared with 58% in the 
previous year, although we continue to see 
European OEMs innovate with digital inkjet 
technology in a wide range of applications.
During the year, the acceleration of the 
conversion in the Chinese ceramic tile 
market was well supported by our Chinese 
partners as well as our OEMs in Europe. 
Total adjusted sales in Asia increased by 
99% to £59.8 million (2012: £30.0 million) 
representing 45% (2012: 35%) of total 
adjusted revenues. In addition to ceramics 
the Graphic Arts sector continues to be 
important for sales into Asia. 
Total sales to the Americas in 2013 were 
£6.8 million, an increase of 8% versus the 
£6.3 million in 2012. As previously stated,  
we would expect the Americas to remain 
the smallest geographic region for Xaar  
due to the distribution of printing equipment 
manufacturers which tend to be localised 
in Asia and Europe.
Profitability
Adjusted profit before tax of £41. 1 million 
was achieved for 2013, more than double 
the £18.4 million recorded for 2012. Profit 
before tax as reported under IFRS was 
£40. 1 million (2012: £15.7 million). The main 
reconciling items between the adjusted  
and IFRS measures are the £3.0 million of 
royalty income noted earlier and £4.2 million 
of share scheme related charges recorded 
under IFRS, but also include exchange 
differences relating to Swedish operations, 
unrealised gains/losses on derivative 
financial instruments, and R&D expenditure 
credit (per the reconciliation of adjusted 
financial measures on page 75).
The growth in adjusted profit before tax  
was ahead of the 55% increase in sales 
through manufacturing efficiency and 
operating leverage. Adjusted gross margin 
increased to 53% (2012: 47%) mainly as a 
result of the increase in volumes produced 
in the Huntingdon facility. Manufacturing at 
Huntingdon was running at 24/7 for the 
majority of 2013, which is financially efficient 
but operationally undesirable for long term 
sustained profitability and risk management. 
As the capacity expansion programme 
delivered additional assets during the 
second half of 2013 margins reduced 
slightly as depreciation charges increased 
and this effect is expected to continue as 
the programme completes during the first  
half of 2014.
Adjusted operating expenses in 2013  
grew 33% versus 2012 to £30.3 million. 
Expenditure on R&D more than doubled 
year on year from £8.0 million to £16.4 
million, mainly through investment in 
headcount, facilities and engineering  
costs. For 2013, following a review of cost 
allocations, an element of IT , facilities and 
other business support costs previously 
entirely charged into general and 
administrative expenses were allocated to 
R&D expenses, reflecting the growth of the 
R&D function in terms of headcount and 
office and laboratory space. Had a similar 
re-allocation of costs been applied for 2012 
then R&D expenses would have been  
£9.0 million, with growth in 2013 versus  
2012 on this comparative basis of 82%.
Net interest income of £0.4 million was 
recorded in 2013 (2012: £0.2 million),  
with interest income on cash and treasury 
deposits exceeding interest charges  
on a remaining finance lease.
The tax charge on adjusted profit before  
tax was £8.0 million (2012: £3.4 million), 
representing an effective tax rate of 19.5% 
(2012: 18.6%). This tax charge is the product 
of the UK and Sweden corporation tax rates 
(23.25% and 22.0% respectively) reduced 
by the impact of the patent box scheme  
and R&D tax credits. 
The tax charge on IFRS profit before  
tax was £8.2 million (2012: £3. 1 million) 
representing an effective tax rate of 
20.5% (2012: 19.6%). 
Adjusted profit after tax for 2013 (see  
note 12) was £33. 1 million, up 121%  
from the £15.0 million recorded in 2012. 
Adjusted diluted earnings per share 
increased 1 15% to 43.2 pence in 2013 
(2012: 20. 1 pence).
Financial position
The strong financial performance in 
2013 drove an increase in net cash  
(cash and treasury deposits less financing 
arrangements) of £24.6 million to £53.5 
million at 31 December 2013. The increase 
in net cash is £8.5 million below the 
£33. 1 million figure for adjusted profit  
after tax, mainly due to capital additions  
to support the capacity expansion 
programme. Total cash outflow relating  
to intangible and tangible assets was 
£17 .0 million in the year, compared with a  
total amortisation and depreciation charge 
of £8.3 million. Working capital excluding 
payables related to capital expenditure  
and the accrual for NI on potential share 
option gains, increased by £1.0 million 
during 2013; inventory grew £2. 1 million, 
receivables increased by £3.0 million,  
and payables ended the year £4. 1 million 
higher than 2012. 
Dividend
The Board will recommend a final dividend 
of 5.5 pence for 2013 at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting (AGM), giving a 
total dividend for the year of 8 pence (2012:  
4 pence). An interim dividend of 2.5 pence 
was paid during the year (2012: 1 pence). 
Subject to approval by shareholders at  
the AGM the final dividend will be paid  
on 20 June 2014 to shareholders on  
the register at close of business on  
23 May 2014.

www.xaar.com 23 Risk management
Protecting  
future value
Effective risk management is key to our 
success against the characteristics both of 
the industry that we operate in and within 
our chosen business model. Our industry, 
being the world of print, is, in general, 
declining in terms of total output, tends  
to be capital intensive, is slow to react to 
change and is resistant to the adoption of 
new technology. Product lifecycles tend  
to be long. Our business model is reliant  
on us first driving the conversion of well-
established processes to our technology, 
then maintaining our market position to 
maximise sales through both the initial 
conversion cycle and replacement sales  
in order to generate profits to enable us  
to invest in new technology and open up 
new applications.
Our risks are set out in more detail in a table 
on page 25 but the key risk areas can be 
identified as being associated with the 
following:
• Opportunity identification – selection  
and identification, and selection of the 
appropriate end applications for 
conversion and defining correctly  
the market requirements, including  
time scales
• Development – successfully developing  
a product with the characteristics that 
meet the market requirements
• Adoption – working with OEMs and  
other partners to achieve adoption of  
the technology in the target application
• Competition – maximising returns over 
the long term in the target application 
through early adoption to achieve a 
market-leading position and then 
retention of that position
• Operations – having the appropriate 
manufacturing arrangements and other 
operational structures in place. 
The first approach to managing these risks 
is to have high quality individuals within the 
necessary functions that these risks tend to 
fall into. Other examples of the effective day 
to day management of these risks include 
operating multi-functional teams to share 
knowledge across the business, having 
regular stage gates in the management of 
development programmes, and the regular 
assessment of manufacturing capacity 
against future potential needs. In addition  
to day to day processes the Group’s risk 
register is formally reviewed twice per  
year at senior management and Board  
level, including the assessment of the 
performance of risk management during  
the preceding period.
The Board has applied principle C.2 of 
the UK Corporate Governance Code  
by establishing a continuous process for 
identifying, evaluating, and managing the 
significant risks the Group faces which has 
operated throughout the year and up to  
the date of this report. Such a system is 
designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business 
objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance with respect to 
the preparation of financial information and 
the safeguarding of assets and against 
material misstatement or loss.
In compliance with provision C.2. 1 of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code, the Board 
regularly reviews the effectiveness of the 
Group’s system of internal control. The 
Board’s monitoring covers all controls, 
including financial, operational and 
compliance controls and risk management 
systems. It is based principally on reviewing 
reports from management to consider 
whether significant risks are identified, 
evaluated, managed and controlled and 
whether any significant weaknesses are 
promptly remedied and indicate a need for 
more extensive monitoring. The Board has 
also performed a specific assessment for 
the purpose of this annual report. This 
assessment considers all significant aspects 
of internal control arising during the period 
covered by the report. The Audit Committee 
assists the Board in discharging its review 
responsibilities.
During the course of its review of the risk 
management and internal control systems, 
the Board has not identified or been advised 
of any failings or weaknesses which it has 
determined to be significant. Therefore a 
confirmation in respect of necessary actions 
has not been considered appropriate.

uncertainty
Impact Mitigation
Product sales into established 
applications fail to deliver 
sustained revenue growth  
due to competitor activity,  
and associated market share 
loss, market maturity or other 
market changes.
Lower than anticipated revenues are 
achieved resulting in excess production 
capacity and lower levels of profit.
Competitive pricing policies are employed.
The product portfolios and pricing of competitors are constantly 
monitored.
Manufacturing cost reduction programmes are established to ensure 
that products remain competitive.
Close customer relationships are maintained with supply agreements  
in place where appropriate.
New product variants are developed to constantly improve the product 
portfolio on offer.
Product sales into new 
applications fail to achieve  
their targets.
Lower than anticipated revenues are 
achieved resulting in excess production 
capacity and lower levels of profit.
Regular reviews of OEM partners are held to ensure that appropriate  
and extensive market coverage is achieved together with a focus on  
new equipment manufacture.
New products and product variants are developed to meet market 
requirements.
Competitive pricing policies are employed.
Manufacturing cost reduction programmes are established to ensure 
that products remain competitive.
New products fail to achieve 
their targets through either a 
failure to identify the appropriate 
products to meet future market 
requirements, or the products 
are identified but are not 
successfully developed in time 
or to the required specification.
Longer term revenue and profit  
is impacted.
Regular, specific and detailed reviews are held to assess current and 
anticipated market requirements. These reviews include input from 
customers and other external sources. Product developments are 
selected on appropriate criteria. Product development activity is properly 
managed with regular reviews of progress against project plans, and 
gated milestone reviews. Appropriate resource is applied to product 
development activity.
Manufacturing output fails to 
meet demand due to supplier 
issues, an event at one of the 
manufacturing facilities, delays 
or problems associated with 
production equipment, a lack of 
manufacturing capacity, or for 
other reasons.
Demand is not satisfied resulting in 
lower levels of revenue and profit.
Customers may start purchasing (or 
increase their level of purchasing) with 
Xaar’s competitors, leading to a longer 
term reduction in market share, revenue 
and profit.
Detailed sales forecasts are prepared and reviewed regularly to minimise 
unexpected changes in short term demand. Suppliers are managed 
carefully. Appropriate sourcing, inspection and inventory holding policies 
are applied to ensure continuity and consistency of product supply. 
Appropriate contingency factors are applied to capacity planning. 
Manufacturing facilities are fitted with the appropriate safety and  
security systems. Staff are properly trained. 
Significant and sustained 
quality problems are identified 
with products which have been 
sold or which are held in 
inventory.
Lower levels of revenue in the short term 
whilst the issues are resolved. 
Unexpected costs associated with 
resolving the issues, which may include 
product scrap, warranty costs and/or 
customer compensation. Potentially 
longer term revenue loss if customers 
start purchasing (or increase their level 
of purchasing) with Xaar’s competitors.
Standard operating procedures are in place for all products. Staff are 
properly trained. The quality of supplies is constantly monitored. Quality 
performance is regularly reviewed by senior management who apply 
appropriate resources to systematically address recurrent problems. 
New products are thoroughly tested before launch. Xaar’s Swedish  
and UK manufacturing facilities are ISO 9001 accredited. Customer 
returns are reviewed quickly using a consistent and thorough 
investigation process.

Developing a  
sustainable business 
• A new charitable giving programme  
was launched by Xaar in 2012, whereby 
employees could nominate and vote for  
six charities to each receive a £2,000 
donation. The chosen charities for 2013 
were Hinchingbrooke Hospital, ABF The 
Soldiers Charity, The Rosie Hospital 
Campaign, the British Heart Foundation, 
the Swedish Childhood Cancer Foundation 
(Barncancerfonden), and the Swedish 
Cancer Society (Cancerfonden). In addition 
to the chosen charity donations, Xaar  
has sponsored a number of staff and  
their families engaging in charity events  
or team activities throughout the year .
• Xaar also made donations to the Oxfam 
Philippines Typhoon Appeal, Young 
People of the Year, Comic Relief, Children 
in Need and the East Anglian Children’s 
Hospice. In total, the Group made 
charitable contributions to children’s,  
local and national charities during the  
year totalling £20,204 (2012: £16,806).  
No political donations were made in  
the year (2012: £nil).
• The social club, which is aimed at 
encouraging staff to have fun and get  
to know each other socially, held several 
events throughout the year including 
theatre trips, comedy nights, a punting 
excursion, sporting events, gliding 
evenings, Duxford Air Show, ice skating, 
Cirque du Soleil and nights at the races.
• During 2013 Xaar began sponsorship  
of an Imagineering Foundation club at  
a Huntingdon primary school. The 
Foundation introduces 8-16 year olds  
to the fascinating world of engineering 
and technology through fun, hands-on 
activities. A visit to the Huntingdon  
factory introduced the pupils to Xaar’s 
manufacturing processes and several 
engineering staff members explained  
how different education streams can  
lead to exciting careers in technology.
The Group strongly believes that corporate 
responsibility is integral to business success. 
The Group is compliant with all relevant 
regulation and legislation whilst enhancing 
the working environment for our employees 
and minimising the environmental impact of 
our manufacturing processes. There is 
internal reporting of key metrics throughout 
the business, and each member of staff is 
expected to take individual responsibility for 
their performance and to work together to 
achieve shared goals.
Formal directives and certification
The Group manufactures products in  
both Sweden and the UK and undertakes 
R&D in the UK. The Group complies with  
all local and European legislation relevant  
to the respective territories. The Group’s 
manufacturing facilities in Järfälla and 
Huntingdon are both ISO 9001 and ISO 
14001 certified. It is the Group’s policy to 
maintain this level of certification for its 
manufacturing facilities and to comply at 
all times with all relevant environmental  
and other legislation in the territories in 
which the Group operates. The Group  
is compliant with REACH (Registration, 
Evaluation, Authorisation and restriction  
of Chemicals), WEEE (Waste Electrical  
and Electronic Equipment) and RoHS 
(Restriction of the Use of Certain  
Hazardous Substances) directives, as 
required under European legislation.

Safety System modelled on OHSAS 18001 
in Cambridge, Huntingdon and Sweden.
Social responsibility
• Xaar employees took part in a range of 
events to raise money for Comic Relief on 
Red Nose Day in March 2013, and Xaar 
entered two teams into the BBC Children 
in Need fun run around the Cambridge 
Science Park in November 2013.
• Xaar continues to sponsor PrintIT!. PrintIT! 
is a major initiative to encourage young 
people to embark on careers in the UK 
printing industry. 
• In 2013, Xaar invested £1 million in 
bonds to support the Future Business 
Centre in Cambridge. The centre 
provides affordable workspace with

social and environmental enterprises.
Health and safety
It is Xaar’s intention to conduct business  
in a manner that protects the public,  
the environment, and employee safety. 
Xaar’s Health & Safety policy provides a 
framework for setting and reviewing of 
Occupational Health & Safety Objectives. 
This demonstrates Xaar’s commitment  
to the prevention of injury and ill health  
and also the continual improvement in 
Occupational Health & Safety Performance. 
Xaar recognises that the combination  
of a safe place of work and safe working 
practices, together with a productive and 
innovative environment, are critical to the 
continued success of the Company.
The management of Xaar is committed to 
achieving and maintaining full compliance 
with health and safety legislation. Although 
certain responsibilities under this policy  
can be attributed to specific roles within the 
organisation, and in particular with different 
levels of management, each and every  
Xaar employee shares the core basic  
duty to understand their responsibilities  
to observe instructions put in place and, 
where necessary, to draw these to the 
attention of others.
To achieve its Health & Safety policy, the 
Company will ensure that the organisation  
is led by example; systems are in place  
to engage, train, develop and maintain 
competent and informed personnel; 
26 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The Group’s aim is that its employees 
should be able to work in an environment 
free from discrimination, harassment and 
bullying, and that employees, job applicants, 
customers, retailers, business introducers 
and suppliers should be treated fairly 
regardless of:
• race, colour, nationality (including 
citizenship), ethnic or national origins
• gender, sexual orientation, marital or 
family status
• religious or political beliefs or affiliations
• disability, impairment or age
• real or suspected infection with HIV/AIDS
• membership of a trade union
and that they should not be disadvantaged 
by unjust or unfair conditions or 
requirements.
The Group aims to ensure that applications 
for employment from people with 
disabilities, and other under-represented 
groups, are given full and fair consideration 
and that such people are given the same 
training, development and job opportunities 
as other employees. Every effort is also 
made to retrain and support employees 
who suffer from disabilities during their 
employment, including the provision of 
flexible working to assist their re-entry  
into the workplace.
Human Resources policies are reviewed 
regularly to ensure that they are non-
discriminatory and promote equality of 
opportunity. In particular, recruitment, 
selection, promotion, training and 
development policies and practices are 
monitored to ensure that all employees 
have the opportunity to train and develop 
according to their abilities.
The Group places considerable value on  
the involvement of its employees and has 
continued to keep them informed of the 
various factors affecting the performance  
of the Group. This is achieved through 
formal and informal meetings. All employees 
participate in a bonus scheme based on 
individual performance and Group business 
targets and, in the UK, have the opportunity 
to participate in an HMRC approved Share 
Save Scheme and Share Incentive Plan.
Environmental
The Group has manufacturing sites in 
Huntingdon, UK and Järfälla, Sweden, R&D 
and head office functions in Cambridge, 
UK, and sales offices worldwide. The Group 
is committed to minimising its impact on the 
environment through the reduction of waste 
and by operating its facilities as efficiently as 
possible. Production material scrap, waste 
levels and energy usage are all monitored 
regularly. Our printhead technology 
improves process efficiency and reduces 
wastage in our end markets.

Human rights
The Group respects all human rights  
and in conducting its business the Group 
regards those rights relating to non-
discrimination, fair treatment and respect  
for privacy to be the most relevant and  
to have the greatest potential impact on  
its key stakeholder groups of customers, 
employees and suppliers.
The Board has overall responsibility for 
ensuring that the Group upholds and 
promotes respect for human rights. The 
Group seeks to anticipate, prevent and 
mitigate any potential negative human rights 
impacts as well as enhance positive impacts 
through its policies and procedures and, in 
particular, through its policies regarding 
employment, equality and diversity, treating 
customers fairly and information security. 
Group policies seek both to ensure that 
employees comply with the relevant 
legislation and regulations in place in the  
UK and other operating locations and to 
promote good practice. The Group’s 
policies are formulated and kept up to date 
by the relevant business area, authorised  
by the Board and communicated to  
all employees.
The Group undertakes extensive monitoring 
of the implementation of all of its policies 
and has not been made aware of any 
incident in which the organisation’s activities 
have resulted in an abuse of human rights.
Equality and diversity
The Group is committed to providing a

www.xaar.com 33 Annual General Meeting
The notice convening the AGM is set out  
on pages 1 14 to 1 16. Resolutions 1 to 14  
set out in the notice of the meeting deal with 
the ordinary business to be transacted at 
the meeting. The special business at the 
meeting to be transacted at the meeting  
is set out in Resolutions 15-17 . 
Re-election of Directors
Resolutions 5-12
The Company’s Articles of Association 
require the Directors to retire by rotation  
at least once every three years, with  
the number to retire by rotation at each 
AGM being the number nearest to but not 
exceeding one-third of the Board. However, 
the UK Corporate Governance Code 
provides that all directors of FTSE 350 
companies should be subject to re-election 
by their shareholders every year. In 
accordance with this provision of the  
UK Corporate Governance Code and in 
keeping with the Board’s aim of following 
best corporate governance practice, the 
Board has decided that all Directors  
should retire at each AGM. 
Directors’ remuneration report
Resolutions 13 and 14
These Resolutions seek shareholder 
approval for the Directors’ remuneration 
report, which includes the Directors’ 
remuneration policy. The Directors’ 
remuneration report can be found  
on pages 44 to 67 (inclusive) of the  
annual report and accounts. 
New regulations came into force on 1 
October 2013 in this area, which require  
the Company to offer shareholders: (i) an 
annual advisory vote on the implementation 
of the Company’s existing remuneration 
policy, which is set out in the Directors’ 
remuneration report; and (ii) a binding  
vote on the Company’s forward-looking 
Directors’ remuneration policy, at least  
every three years.
Resolution 13 contains the advisory 
resolution relating to the Directors’ 
remuneration report, and Resolution 14 
contains the binding resolution in relation  
to the Directors’ remuneration policy.
The Directors’ remuneration policy sets out 
the Company’s future policy on Directors’ 
remuneration. If Resolution 14 is approved, 
the effective date of the remuneration policy 
will be the date of the AGM.
Authority to purchase own shares
Resolution 15
It is proposed by Resolution 15, by Special 
Resolution, to authorise the Company 
generally and unconditionally to purchase  
its own shares at a price of not less than the 
par value of the shares and not more than 
the higher of: (i) 5% above the average of the 
middle market quotations of the shares as 
derived from the London Stock Exchange 
Daily Official List for the five dealing days 
immediately preceding the day on which  
the purchase is made; and (ii) the amount 
stipulated by article 5(1) of the Buy-back  
and Stabilisation Regulation 2003 (in each 
case exclusive of any expenses payable  
by the Company).
The authority will be for a maximum of 
14.9% of the Company’s issued share 
capital and will expire at the earlier of the 
next AGM of the Company or within 15 
months from the date of the passing of this 
resolution. The Directors currently have no 
intention to exercise the authority and will 
only purchase shares if it is in the best 
interests of shareholders as a whole.
The total number of options to subscribe  
for ordinary shares outstanding at 31 
December 2013 (including options awarded 
under the Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) 
which may be satisfied by the subscription 
of new shares) was 3,237 ,052. This 
represents 4% of the issued ordinary share 
capital at that date. If Xaar plc was to buy 
back the maximum number of ordinary 
shares permitted pursuant to the passing  
of this resolution, then the total number of 
options to subscribe for ordinary shares 
outstanding at 31 December 2013 would 
represent 5% of the reduced issued 
ordinary share capital.
Power to issue securities
Resolution 16
Under the Companies Act 2006 the 
Directors of the Company may only allot 
shares (whether for cash or otherwise)  
with the authority of shareholders given  
at a general meeting of the Company. In 
accordance with institutional guidelines, 
under Resolution 16, to be proposed  
as an Ordinary Resolution, authority is 
sought to allot shares:
(i) in relation to a pre-emptive rights issue 
only, up to an aggregate nominal amount 
of £5,073, 1 17 .73, which represented 
two-thirds of the Company’s ordinary 
share capital as at 18 March 2014, and
(ii) in any other case, up to an aggregate 
nominal amount of £2,536,558.87 ,  
which represented one third of the 
Company’s ordinary share capital  
as at 18 March 2014.
The Directors do not currently have an 
intention to exercise the authority.
Resolution 17
This resolution, to be proposed as a Special 
Resolution, will give the Directors power to 
allot shares:
(i) up to an aggregate nominal amount  
of £5,073, 1 17 .73 (representing 
approximately 66% of the Company’s 
issued share capital) on an offer to 
existing shareholders on a pre-emptive 
basis (subject to any adjustments,  
such as for fractional entitlements  
and overseas shareholders, as the 
Directors see fit), and
(ii) for cash up to a maximum aggregate 
nominal value of £380,483.83, 
representing 5% of the ordinary share 
capital of the Company as at 18 March 
2014, otherwise than in connection with 
an offer to existing shareholders.

Report on the affairs of the Group continued

intention to exercise any power given to 
them by shareholders to allot shares for 
cash on a non pre-emptive basis and, in  
any event, the Directors do not intend to 
allot any shares for cash on a non pre-
emptive basis if such allotment would 
exceed the limits established by the 
guidance published by the investment

The authorities contained in Resolutions 16 
and 17 will expire no later than 15 months 
after the passing of those resolutions.

Strategic report Governance Financial statements 
www.xaar.com 35 Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future 
development, performance and position 
are set out in the strategic report on pages 
8 to 19. Notes 19, 20 and 23 include a 
description of the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing  
its capital; its financial risk management 
objectives; details of its financial instruments 
and hedging activities; and its exposure to 
credit risk and liquidity risk.
The Group has considerable financial 
resources and through a diverse customer 
base is exposed not only to the Western 
economies but also China, India and Latin 
America. As a consequence, the Directors 
believe that the Group is well placed to 
manage its business risks successfully.
After making enquiries, the Directors have  
a reasonable expectation that the Group 
has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable 
future, based on the Group’s forecasts and 
projections for the next four years, taking 
account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance. For this reason, we 
continue to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.
Auditor
Deloitte LLP have expressed their 
willingness to continue in office as auditor 
and a resolution to reappoint them will be 
proposed at the forthcoming AGM.
Directors’ statement as to 
disclosure of information to auditor
The Directors who were members of the 
Board at the time of approving the Directors’ 
report are listed on page 32. 
Having made enquiries of fellow Directors, 
each of these Directors confirm that:
• to the best of each Director’s knowledge 
and belief, there is no information relevant 
to the preparation of their report of which 
the Group’s auditor is unaware, and
• each Director has taken all the steps  
a Director might reasonably be expected 
to have taken to be aware of relevant 
audit information and to establish  
that the Group’s auditor is aware 
of that information.
This confirmation is given and should  
be interpreted in accordance with  
the provisions of section 418 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
Directors’ report 
Report on the affairs of the Group continued 
36 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The Company is committed to the principles 
of corporate governance contained in the 
UK Corporate Governance Code which was 
issued in 2010 by the Financial Reporting 
Council (‘the Code’) for which the Board is 
accountable to shareholders. 
Statement of compliance  
with the Code 
Throughout the year ended 31 December 
2013 the Company has been in compliance 
with the provisions set out in the Code.
The Board confirms that the 2013 annual 
report and accounts, taken as a whole, is 
fair, balanced and understandable, and 
provides the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the performance, 
strategy, and business model of the 
Company, in accordance with C. 1. 1  
of the Code.
Statement about applying the 
principles of the Code
The Company has applied the principles of 
the Code, including both the Main Principles 
and the supporting principles, by complying 
with the Code as reported above. Further 
explanation of how the Main Principles have 
been applied is set out below and, in 
connection with Directors’ remuneration,  
in the Directors’ remuneration report. 
Board of Directors
The Board of Directors comprises the 
Chairman, five Executive Directors and two 
Non-Executive Directors. Brief biographical 
details of all members of the Board are set 
out on page 31. 
The Board considers Robin Williams and 
David Cheesman to be independent within 
the meaning of the Code, in compliance with 
Code provision B. 1. 1. To be considered as 
independent each Non-Executive Director is 
sufficiently separate to management and free 
from any business or other relationships 
which could affect their judgement, 
impartiality or objectivity.
The Board is responsible for the formulation 
of strategy; the monitoring of financial and 
non-financial performance and the approval 
of major transactions; financial statements; 
other formal communications with 
shareholders; and operating and capital 
expenditure budgets. Comprehensive Board 
papers, dealing with all aspects of the 
business, are distributed by the Company 
Secretary typically one week in advance of 
each Board meeting. The Board met ten 
times during 2013.
The Non-Executive Directors attend the 
Board meetings, and form the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees. 
They are responsible for scrutinising the 
performance of management and 
determining appropriate levels of 
remuneration of Executive Directors, and 
have a key role in appointing and, where 
required, removing Executive Directors.
There exists a clear division of 
responsibilities between the Chairman  
and the Chief Executive. The Chairman’s 
primary role includes ensuring that the 
Board functions properly, that it meets its 
obligations and responsibilities, and that its 
organisation and mechanisms are in place 
and are working effectively. The Chief 
Executive’s primary role is to provide overall 
leadership and vision in developing, with  
the Board, the strategic direction of the 
Company. Additionally, the Chief Executive 
is responsible for the management of the 
overall business to ensure that strategic and 
business plans are effectively implemented, 
the results are monitored and reported to 
the Board, and financial and operational 
objectives are attained. 
The Board delegates management of  
the business to the Executive Committee, 
headed by the Chief Executive (Ian 
Dinwoodie). The Executive Committee 
meets weekly and is responsible for 
implementing Group strategy, monitoring 
business performance, preparing the 
operating and capital expenditure budgets 
for recommendation to the Board, and 
ensuring efficient management of  
the Group.
The committee has formally identified  
Ted Wiggans as Director responsible  
for health and safety and Alex Bevis as 
Director responsible for risk assessment.

Conflicts of interest
Following the changes made to the Company’s Articles of Association to incorporate the provisions of section 175 of the Companies Act 
2006 which gave Boards the statutory power to authorise conflicts of interest, any potential conflict of interest is approved by the Board  
in advance of any action or appointment that could result in a conflict of interest arising. Each member of the Board is familiar with the 
procedure to follow in relation to conflicts of interest and the process is operated efficiently.

The Audit Committee has a set agenda  
for each of its regular meetings, which  
is then augmented by specific matters 
concerning the Company and in assessing 
the appropriateness of the financial 
statements. Key areas of focus during  
the year included:

The Audit Committee considered the 
legislative changes that impact the  
Group 2013 financial statements relating  
to narrative reporting, including GHG 
emissions statements and remuneration 
reports, patent box and R&D expenditure 
credit. Potential issues in these areas

planned and actions agreed and taken, to 
successfully implement these modifications.
Royalty audits
The results of completed royalty audits  
in the year were discussed by the Audit 
Committee, including the required 
accounting treatments for the financial 
statements. The actions relating to the 
outcomes of completed audits and the 
ongoing royalty audits were agreed.
System audits and the ERP system
Following the implementation of the  
Epicor ERP system in 2012, KPMG were 
engaged to perform process reviews and 
internal audit procedures over a number  
of specifically targeted areas. The Audit

reference were updated in 2013, following 
their annual review. The Chairman of the 
Audit Committee will be available at the

40 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 External audit
• Reviewed and agreed the scope of the 
audit work to be undertaken by the 
auditor, and reviewed non-audit services 
provided and the level of this compared 
with the audit services provided
• Agreed the fees to be paid to the  
external auditor in respect of their  
services rendered for the annual  
audit and interim review
• Reviewed audit work performed on 
significant risk areas, including those 
areas identified and discussed by the 
external auditor in their report, and 
ensured the independence and objectivity 
of the external auditor and reviewed the 
audit partner rotation requirement.
External auditor
Deloitte LLP have been the Company’s 
auditor since 2009 and there has been  
no tender held for audit services during  
that time. The committee considers that  
the auditor’s knowledge of the Group’s 
business and systems gained through 
experience has contributed to the 
effectiveness of the audit process.  
The committee intends the Company  
to continue to comply fully with the FRC 
Audit Committees Guidance regarding  
the frequency of audit tender. The current 
audit engagement partner steps down this 
year under the standard rotation process.
The Audit Committee has noted that  
there are no contractual obligations to 
restrict the choice of external auditor  
and has considered the likelihood of a 
withdrawal of the auditor from the market.
The committee meets with the Company’s 
auditor at least twice a year. The Chief 
Executive and Finance Director, and other 
relevant managers as required, attend by 
invitation, except for a period of each meeting 
where the committee members may meet 
with the auditor without any member of the 
Group management present. 
The committee is required to assess  
the qualifications, expertise, resources,  
and independence of the external auditor, 
and the objectivity and effectiveness of the 
audit process. The committee reviews the 
type of work, effectiveness of, and level of 
fees charged by the auditor on an annual 
basis and recommends to the Board the 
appointment, reappointment, term, 
remuneration, and terms of engagement  
of the external auditor. Auditor objectivity 
and independence is safeguarded by the 
committee monitoring fees paid to the 
auditor in respect of both audit and 
non-audit work, and approving all additional 
work performed by the external auditor. 
Non-audit services include tax compliance 
and advice services, and recruitment and 
remuneration services. 
Note 6 to the consolidated financial 
statements includes disclosures of  
the auditor’s remuneration for the year, 
including an analysis of audit services,  
audit related services, and other non- 
audit services under those headings 
prescribed by law. The committee  
monitors the level of non-audit fees in 
relation to the audit fee for its bearing  
on external auditor independence.
The independence and objectivity of  
the auditor is regularly considered by  
the committee taking into consideration 
relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements. The committee receives  
an annual statement from the auditor 
detailing their independence policies  
and safeguards and confirming their 
independence, taking into account relevant 
ethical guidance regarding the provision of 
non-audit services by the external auditor. 
Under the standard rotation process, the 
current audit engagement partner steps 
down this year, and a new audit partner  
has been appointed for 2014.
The committee considers the effectiveness 
of the external audit and the Group’s 
relationship with the external auditor,  
Deloitte LLP , on an ongoing basis, and have 
conducted a review of the effectiveness of 
the annual audit. This review consisted of 
considering a number of key points together 
with the senior financial management of the 
Group, without the external auditor present, 
and then discussing the evaluation with  
the auditor. The committee was able to 
conclude, on the basis of this exercise and 
its experience over the year, that the external 
audit process remained effective. A further 
review will be carried out following the 
completion of audit procedures on all Group 
companies and reported on in next year’s 
annual report.

Governance
The Remuneration Committee is appointed 
by the Board from the Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company. The Chairman  
of the committee is David Cheesman.  
The Chief Executive and Finance Director 
attend meetings by invitation, except when 
their own remuneration package is being 
discussed. The written terms of reference  
of the committee are available on request 
from the Company Secretary.
Responsibilities
The Remuneration Committee’s primary 
responsibilities are:

remuneration for Senior Managers, and
• to determine the individual remuneration 
packages on behalf of the Board for the 
Executive Directors of the Group. 
Key issues and activities
The committee has access to professional 
advice, both inside and outside the 
Company, in the furtherance of its duties. 
The committee has received information on 
best practice and market rates for Directors’ 
remuneration from Deloitte LLP and PwC

any individuals known to the committee 
would be suitable for the role. If no 
candidates can be identified through this 
process then an external search consultancy 
will be approached. Shortlisted candidates 
are interviewed by members of the 
committee and other Executive and 
Non-Executive Directors as the committee 
deems appropriate. Once a suitable 
candidate has been identified, the Chairman 
of the committee will recommend to the 
Board that the Company make a formal 
offer of employment to the candidate. 
All Directors are required to submit 
themselves for reappointment every year 
and Directors appointed during the year are 
required to seek reappointment at the first 
AGM following their appointment.

42 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Performance evaluation
The Board’s policy for individual Executive 
Director performance reviews is for a  
formal and rigorous appraisal process 
based on performance by the individual 
Director against specific targets. Individual 
Director performance is reviewed at least 
annually. The Senior Independent Director, 
in consultation with the other Non-Executive 
Directors and taking into account the views 
of the other Directors, appraises the 
performance of the Chairman. The Executive 
Directors, in consultation with the Chairman, 
appraise the performance of the Non-
Executive Directors.
When new Directors are appointed, they 
receive a complete and specifically bespoke 
induction and training, aimed at introducing 
and familiarising them to the management 
team, the Group’s activities and processes, 
and to give them the knowledge required  
to effectively execute their role.
The Board reviewed both its own 
performance and the performance of  
the Board committees once during the  
year through a questionnaire issued to all 
members of the Board. The results were 
reviewed by the Board as a whole and it 
was concluded that individual Board 
members are satisfied that the Board  
works well and operates effectively in an 
environment where there is constructive 
challenge from the Non-Executive Directors. 
They are also satisfied with the contribution 
made by their colleagues and that Board 
committees operate properly and effectively. 
It is the Board’s intention to review its own 
performance, and that of its committees,  
at least once a year.
Group structure
The Group has three main locations.  
The head office functions, R&D, Western 
sales, marketing function and business 
support functions are based in Cambridge, 
UK. The Group also has two manufacturing 
facilities: one in Järfälla, Sweden and the 
other in Huntingdon, UK. The Group also 
has representatives in other global locations 
including India, Brazil, Hong Kong and  
the USA.
Refer to page 10 for the Xaar  
business model.
Dialogue with institutional 
shareholders
The Directors seek to build on a mutual 
understanding of objectives between the 
Group and its institutional shareholders by 
meeting at least twice per year, following 
interim and annual results, to provide an 
update on trading and obtain feedback. 
Additionally, the Group has hosted 
institutional investors at its Huntingdon 
facility during the year.
The Group’s financial public relations 
advisors give all investors and potential 
investors, who have met with the Group’s 
investor relations team, the opportunity to 
provide feedback on the meetings. The 
feedback is coordinated by the financial PR 
advisors into a single document which is 
circulated to all members of the Board. 
Additionally, the Chief Executive and Finance 
Director provide feedback to the Board at the 
meeting following shareholder meetings to 
ensure that the Board, and in particular the 
Non-Executive Directors, possess an 
understanding of the views of the Company’s 
major shareholders. Both the Chairman and 
the Senior Independent Director are available 
to meet with shareholders as required.
Shareholders can access up-to-date 
Company information from the Investor 
Relations section of the Xaar website at 
www.xaar.com.
Constructive use of the  
Annual General Meeting
The Board uses the AGM to  
communicate with investors and  
to encourage their participation. 
Risk management and  
internal control 
The Group’s policies relating to risk 
management and internal control can be 
found in the ‘Risk management’ section of 
the strategic report on page 24.
Whistle-blowing, and anti-bribery 
and corruption policies
The Company conducts its business  
with the highest standards of integrity  
and honesty at all times and expects its 
employees to maintain the same standards 
in everything they do. Employees are 
therefore required to report any wrongdoing 
by Xaar or its members of staff that falls 
short of these principles. The whistle-
blowing, and anti-bribery and corruption 
policies are available and communicated  
to all employees via the Company intranet, 
and all employees confirm in writing that 
they have read and comply with the 
whistle-blowing and anti-bribery and 
corruption policies. All reported incidences 
of actual or suspected bribery or corruption 
will be promptly and thoroughly investigated 
and dealt with appropriately. The purpose  
of the anti-bribery and corruption policy  
is to protect Xaar and its employees from 
breaches of anti-bribery and corruption 
laws. Xaar does not tolerate any employee 
or third party being involved in any level of 
bribery or corruption. Xaar is committed to 
complying with applicable anti-bribery and 
corruption laws in all countries in which it 
conducts business.

Statement from the Chairman of 
the Remuneration Committee
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to 
present our Directors’ remuneration report 
for 2013, which sets our policy on pay, 
benefits and incentives for the Directors  
and the amounts earned by the Directors  
for the year ended 31 December 2013.
The Remuneration Committee’s policy is to 
attract and retain individuals of the highest 
calibre by offering remuneration competitive 
with comparable publicly listed companies, 
and to drive Company performance by 
providing arrangements which fairly and 
responsibly reward individuals for their 
contribution to the success of the Group. 
Performance related bonuses and equity-
based remuneration represent a substantial 
proportion of Executive Directors’ potential 
remuneration, which the committee feels 
aligns the interests of the individuals with 
those of the shareholders.
Governance 
Directors’ remuneration report 
David Cheesman
Chairman of the Remuneration Committee
44 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Remuneration for 2013
Throughout the year, the Remuneration 
Committee continued to apply the 
remuneration policy with a strong  
alignment to the interests of shareholders. 
As described in the business review section 
of this Annual Report, 2013 was a very 
successful year for Xaar. Significant growth 
was sustained across the spectrum of 
operations, from record financial results  
to increased headcount and operational 
facilities. Consequently, 100% of base salary 
was earned by the Executive Directors for 
the Company profit performance element  
of the annual bonus plan, compared with  
a target rate of 50% of base salary and a 
maximum of 100% of base salary. The 
bonus earned is then subject to a multiplier 
in the range of 0-1.33 which is applied to 
reflect individual performance, where 1.0 is 
used for ‘on-target’ individual performance. 
Details of the bonus amounts earned by 
individual directors are outlined within the 
annual report on remuneration. Furthermore, 
annualised compounded EPS growth over 
the three year performance period ended  
31 December 2013 was 87% and as a result 
100% of the Performance Share awards 
granted under the LTIP on 1 1 April 201 1  
will vest on 1 1 April 2014.
Base salary increases for Executive 
Directors were in the range 0%-5% from  
1 January 2013 for Alex Bevis, Ted 
Wiggans, Ramon Borrell and Richard 
Barham, which was in line with the range  
of salary increases across the Group. A  
12% base salary increase was awarded to 
Ian Dinwoodie to reflect his performance, 
experience and contribution to the Group 
and that his base salary had fallen 
significantly below market positioning.
Further details regarding base salary 
increases, bonus payments and the vesting 
of LTIP awards made to the Executive 
Directors are set out in the annual report  
on remuneration.
Key remuneration decisions  
for 2014
The existing remuneration policy and 
fundamental structure of the package 
remains unchanged and the overall 
quantum of the incentives (as a percentage 
of base salary) has not changed. However, 
given the outstanding performance and 
sustained growth of the business, the 
Remuneration Committee recognises  
that there exists a significant shortfall in 
Executive Director base salaries compared 
with companies of a similar size and 
complexity. The Non-Executive Director  
fees have also been reviewed by the Board 
during the year. Therefore, we have  
resolved to:
• move base salaries, over a three year 
period, towards the lower end of the 
market range, subject to the sustained 
and continued performance of both the 
business and of individual Directors. This 
phased approach (as opposed to 
awarding the whole increase in one year) 
has the benefit that it recognises the 
challenges of the current executive 
remuneration environment and allows the 
Remuneration Committee to reassess the 
intended increases in 2015 and 2016 and 
consider whether it remains appropriate 
at that time
• move the Non-Executive Director fees 
towards the lower end of the market 
competitive range over the following  
three years
• introduce a 1 x salary shareholding 
guideline for Executive Directors who  
will have until the later of the fifth 
anniversary of appointment or  
fifth anniversary of the introduction  
of the policy to build this level of 
shareholding, and
• introduce a malus provision, for future 
awards under the LTIP , to allow the 
Remuneration Committee to adjust 
unvested bonus matching awards and 
unvested Performance Share awards in 
the event of material misstatement, 
material failure of risk management, or 
serious reputational damage.
The Remuneration Committee has 
consulted with the Company’s major 
shareholders regarding these changes.

Directors’ remuneration report continued
46 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The figures in the single figure table on the left are derived from the following:
(a) Salary/fees The amount of base salary/fees received in the year.
(b) Benefits This is the taxable value of benefits and the flexible benefits allowance received in the year. 
(c) Bonus The value of the bonus earned in respect of the year, including any part of the bonus invested into bonus 
investment shares for a period of three years. Performance against the targets which applied for the 
financial year is provided on page 48. 
(d) Long term incentives The value of performance related incentives vesting in respect of the financial year (including any 
Matching Share Awards granted under the LTIP) and the value of SAYE options and Matching Shares 
under the HMRC approved Share Incentive Plan (SIP) granted based on the fair value of the options/
shares at grant.
The performance condition for the Performance Share Awards and Matching Share Awards granted 
under the LTIP on 1 1 April 201 1 was EPS growth against RPI over the three year performance period 
ending 31 December 2013. 
For the year ended 31 December 2013, the Company’s annualised, compounded EPS growth over the 
three year performance period commencing 1 January 201 1 and ending 31 December 2013 was 87%; 
therefore 100% of the Performance Share Awards and Matching Share Awards in respect of the year 
ending 31 December 2013 will vest. The estimated face value of the vested shares is based on a share 
price of 932p being the average market value of Xaar’s shares for the last quarter of year ended  
31 December 2013 (267p for comparative calculation in 2012 analysis).
For the year ended 31 December 2012 comparative figures, 100% of the Performance Share plan 
Awards and Matching Share Awards in respect of the performance period commencing 1 January 2010 
and ending 31 December 2012 vested.
Also included in the long term incentives figure are:
SAYE options granted in the year, valued at the accounting value on date of grant. Matching Share Awards 
granted under the SIP scheme during the year, again valued at the accounting value on date of grant.
(e) Pension The value of the employer contribution to the defined contribution pension plan (or the value of a salary 
supplement paid in lieu of a contribution to this pension plan).
Individual elements of remuneration
Base salary and fees
Base salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed by the Remuneration Committee prior to the beginning of each year and when an 
individual changes position or responsibility. In deciding appropriate levels, the Remuneration Committee considers the role, responsibility, 
and experience of the individual, corporate and individual performance, market conditions, and the range of salary increases awarded 
across the Group.
Base salary increases for Executive Directors were in the range 0%-5% from 1 January 2013 for Alex Bevis, Ted Wiggans, Ramon Borrell 
and Richard Barham which was in line with the range of salary increases across the Group. A 12% base salary increase was awarded to  
Ian Dinwoodie to reflect his performance, experience and contribution to the Group and that his base salary had fallen significantly below 
market positioning.
The remuneration policy for the Non-Executive Directors is reviewed periodically. The fees for the Non-Executive Directors were not 
increased during 2013.
Strategic report Governance Financial statements 
www.xaar.com 47 Benefits
Benefits principally comprise a company car 
or car allowance, private medical insurance 
and basic levels of other insurances (such 
as critical illness cover). In addition, all UK 
staff, including Executive Directors, are 
provided with an allowance of 5% of base 
salary which they can apply to a range  
of benefits such as life insurance, critical 
illness insurance etc.
Pension 
The Company operates a self-administered, 
defined contribution, HMRC approved 
pension scheme. All current Executive 
Directors participate in this scheme. In 
appropriate circumstances, Executive 
Directors may take a salary supplement 
instead of contributions into a pension plan. 
Non-Executive Directors do not receive 
pension contributions.
Annual bonus
For the year ended 31 December 2013, the 
annual bonus was based on performance 
against a Group profit target. The maximum 
bonus opportunity for achievement of the 
Group profit targets was 100% of salary  
and this bonus was then subject to a 
multiplier of between 0 and 1.33 according 
to individual performance. The maximum 
possible bonus entitlement was therefore 
133% of base salary and this represents the 
maximum level of Group profit performance 
and exceptional performance of the 
individual and the Group.
Group profit is defined as Group adjusted 
profit before tax, which for 2013 was  
£41. 1 million.
The Board considers the Group profit  
target to be a matter that is commercially 
sensitive and should therefore remain 
confidential to the Company. The Board 
believes that disclosure of this commercially 
sensitive information could negatively impact 
the Company’s competitive position by 
providing our competitors with insight into 
our business plans, expectations and, in the 
case of individual performance, our strategic 
actions resulting in significant risk to future 
profitability and shareholder value. However, 
the Remuneration Committee will review this 
annually, and may disclose some details on 
a retrospective basis where it considers it 
appropriate to do so. 
Details of the Executive Directors for 2013 are 
set out in the table below.
Performance against the above measures 
was assessed by the Remuneration 
Committee after the end of 2013.
The annual bonus is delivered in cash. 
Executive Directors may choose to invest 
the bonus earned (on a post-tax basis) in 
bonus investment shares, in return for 
participation in the bonus matching element 
of the LTIP (see below for further details). 
Bonus investment shares are beneficially 
owned by the individual and are not subject 
to forfeiture. Additionally the Executive 
Directors can opt to participate in the SIP 
(refer to note 32 for details of the scheme).
Value earned from long term 
incentive awards
The LTIP was approved by shareholders  
in April 2007 and comprises two elements: 
Matching Share Awards and Performance 
Share Awards.
• Performance Share Awards: subject  
to the achievement of performance 
conditions
• Matching Share Awards: as described 
above, Executive Directors may choose  
to invest the bonus earned (on a post-tax 
basis) in bonus investment shares. 
Matching Share Awards are granted 
subject to the achievement of 
performance conditions on a one for  
one basis (based on the pre-tax) value  
of the bonus used to acquired bonus 
investment shares (subject to an overall 
maximum of 50% of salary). 
Performance Share Awards and  
Matching Share Awards granted to 
Executive Directors on 1 1 April 201 1  
were based on growth in EPS against  
RPI as shown below:

Although there were no formal shareholding guidelines in place in 2013, the majority of Executive Directors already held significant value  
in shares. With effect from the date of the AGM, the Remuneration Committee will introduce a shareholding guideline of 1 x salary. Executive 
Directors will have until the later of the fifth anniversary of appointment or the fifth anniversary of introduction of the policy to build this level of 
shareholding. The extent to which each Executive Director has met the shareholding guideline is shown in the table below:

www.xaar.com 51 All employee share plans
The Executive Directors may participate in the Company’s all employee share plans, the Xaar plc 2007 SAYE Scheme (SAYE Scheme)  
and the Xaar SIP , on the same basis as other employees. 
The SAYE Scheme provides an opportunity to save a set monthly amount (currently up to £250) over three years towards the exercise  
of a discounted share option, which is granted at the start of the three years. 
The SIP provides an opportunity for employees to buy shares from their pre-tax remuneration up to the limit permitted by the relevant  
tax legislation (currently £1,500 per year) and are awarded additional shares for free on a matching basis; the Company currently operates 
the plan on the basis of a 1:1 match but may award Matching Shares up to the maximum ratio permitted by the relevant tax legislation 
(currently a 2:1 ratio). 
Options and awards under these plans are not subject to performance conditions.

Payments made to former Directors during the year
Phil Eaves resigned from the Board in March 2012 and ceased employment with the Company in June 2012. In respect of Mr Eaves’ 
unvested long term incentive awards under the LTIP granted on 22 November 2010 and 1 1 April 201 1, the Remuneration Committee 
exercised discretion and determined that he would be treated as a ‘good leaver’ under the terms of the plan. The number of shares  
which vested on 22 November 2013 was determined by applying the original performance conditions and reducing the number granted  
on 22 November 2010 to reflect his length of service during the performance period. Phil Eaves has one outstanding LTIP award, which  
is due to vest on 1 1 April 2014. The number of shares vesting will be determined by applying the original performance conditions and 
reduced on a pro-rata basis to reflect his length of service during the performance period.
Payments for loss of office made during the year
No payments for loss of office have been made to Directors during the year ended 31 December 2013.
Performance graph and table
The graph on page 53 shows the Company’s performance measured by total shareholder return (TSR), compared with the performance of 
the FTSE TechMARK All Share Index and the FTSE 250, which the Remuneration Committee considers to be the most appropriate indices 
for comparison because they illustrate the Company’s TSR performance against a broad equity market index of similar UK companies.

Implementation of Directors’ remuneration policy for the financial year commencing 1 January 2014
Information on how the Company intends to implement the policy for the financial year commencing 1 January 2014 is set out below.
The fundamental structure of the package remains unchanged and we are not changing the annual bonus opportunity, deferred bonus 
matching and long term incentive opportunity or defined contribution rate for pensions.
Basic salary and fees
Our approach on base salary continues to be to provide a fixed remuneration component which reflects the experience and capabilities  
of the individual in the role, the demonstrated performance of the individual in the role, and which is competitive in the markets in which  
we operate.
The Group has grown significantly over the last few years. Over this period of substantial growth, base salaries have increased but  
have remained below lower quartile compared with both FTSE Small Cap and FTSE 250 companies. The Remuneration Committee  
has therefore resolved to move base salaries progressively, over a three year period, to a level which is market competitive (in general, 
positioned towards the lower end of the market range). The proposed base salary increases for the Executive Directors with effect 
from 1 January 2014 are shown below:
Year ended 31 December 2013 2014 % increase
Ian Dinwoodie £232,000 £260,000 12%
Alex Bevis £151,000 £169,000 12%

Governance 
Directors’ remuneration report continued
54 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 The Remuneration Committee will reassess the intended increases in 2015 and 2016 and consider whether it remains appropriate  
at that time.
The Non-Executive Directors’ fees have also been reviewed by the Board during the year and the Board has resolved to move the  
Non-Executive Directors’ fees towards the lower end of the market competitive range over the next three years. The fees for the  
Non-Executive Directors with effect from 1 January 2014 are set out below:
Year ended 31 December 2013 2014 % increase
Phil Lawler (Chairman) £80,000 £90,000 13%
David Cheesman £35,000 £39,000 11%
Robin Williams £38,000 £42,000 11%
Annual bonus
The Remuneration Committee has reviewed 
the performance metrics and targets for the 
annual bonus to ensure that they remain 
appropriately stretching in the current 
environment and continue to be aligned  
with the business strategy. No changes  
to the quantum, performance conditions  
or performance targets are proposed.
The Board considers the Group profit target 
for 2014 to be a matter that is commercially 
sensitive and should therefore remain 
confidential to the Company. It provides our 
competitors with insight into our business 
plans, expectations and, in the case of 
individual performance, our strategic actions. 
However, the Remuneration Committee may 
disclose on a retrospective basis how the 
Company’s performance relates to any 
annual bonus payments made.
Long term incentives
No changes to the quantum, performance 
conditions or performance targets are 
proposed. The current LTIP rules (which 
also include the provisions which govern the 
Matching Share Awards) expire in April 2017 . 
The Remuneration Committee intends to 
review the structure of the package and 
operation of the incentive arrangements  
and will seek shareholder approval for  
any new plans prior to this date. However,  
in the meantime, in line with best practice, 
the Remuneration Committee will introduce 
in 2014:
• a 1 x salary shareholding guideline for 
Executive Directors who will have until the 
fifth anniversary of appointment to build 
this level of shareholding, and
• a malus provision, for future awards  
under the long term incentive plan, to 
allow the committee to adjust unvested 
Matching Share Awards and unvested 
Performance Share Awards in the event  
of material misstatement, material failure 
of risk management or serious 
reputational damage.
Consideration by the Directors  
of matters relating to Directors’ 
remuneration
Membership
The Company has established a 
Remuneration Committee which is 
constituted in accordance with the 
recommendations of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The terms of reference  
of the Remuneration Committee can  
be obtained by contacting the  
Company Secretary.
The Remuneration Committee is chaired  
by David Cheesman and its other members 
during the year ended 31 December 2013 
were Phil Lawler and Robin Williams. All 
members of the Remuneration Committee 
are considered independent within  
the meaning of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. 
Strategic report Governance Financial statements 
www.xaar.com 55 The principal function of the Remuneration Committee is to determine, on behalf of the Board, the specific remuneration and other benefits 
of Executive Directors, including pension contributions, bonus arrangements, long term incentives and service contracts. The fees paid to 
the Non-Executive Directors are determined by the Chief Executive Officer and the Chairman. The fees paid to the Chairman are 
determined by the Chief Executive Officer and the Non-Executive Directors.
Additionally, the Remuneration Committee makes recommendations to the Board on the framework of Executive Director remuneration  
as well as principal company-wide compensation programmes.
The members of the Remuneration Committee have no personal financial interest, other than as shareholders, in the matters to be decided,  
no actual or potential conflicts of interest arising from other directorships and no day to day operational responsibility within the Company. 
Executive Directors are entitled to accept appointments outside the Group providing that the Chairman’s permission is sought.
Advisors to the Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is assisted in its work by the Head of Human Resources. Ian Dinwoodie, Chief Executive Officer, and  
Alex Bevis, Finance Director, also assisted the Remuneration Committee during the year. The Chief Executive Officer is consulted on  
the remuneration of those who report directly to him and also of other senior executives. No Executive Director or employee is present 
or takes part in discussions in respect of matters relating directly to their own remuneration. 
During the year, the Remuneration Committee was assisted in its work by the following external consultants:

Directors’ remuneration policy
This part of the report sets out the Company’s Directors’ remuneration policy, which, subject to shareholder approval at the 2014  
AGM, shall take binding effect from the date of that meeting. The policy is determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
The Directors’ remuneration policy is not audited.
Policy table for Executive Directors
The table below describes each of the elements of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors:
Alignment with strategy/purpose Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base salary
Core element of fixed remuneration that provides the  
basis to recruit and retain talent necessary to deliver 
the business strategy.
Normally reviewed annually, any increases generally apply from  
1 January (but may be reviewed more frequently if required).
When determining base salary levels, consideration is given  
to the following:
• Role, responsibility and experience of the individual
• Corporate and individual performance
• Market conditions including typical pay levels for comparable 
roles in companies of a similar size and complexity
• The range of salary increases awarded across the Group.
No maximum salary opportunity has been set out in this policy report  
to avoid setting expectations for Executive Directors and employees.  
The base salaries effective as at 1 January 2014 are shown on page  
54. The Remuneration Committee has resolved to move base salaries 
progressively to a level which is market competitive (in general, positioned 
towards the lower end of the market range) taking account of individual 
factors such as:
• increase in scope and responsibility
• a new Executive Director being moved to market positioning over time
• alignment to market level.
Not applicable.
Benefits 
Provide a market-competitive benefits package to recruit and 
retain Directors of the calibre required for the business.
Participation in the Company’s Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) and 
Share Save Scheme (“SAYE”) encourages share ownership 
and alignment with the wider workforce.
Executive Directors receive base benefits including car allowance 
(or company car), private medical insurance, and basic levels of 
other insurances (such as critical illness cover).
All UK staff, including Executive Directors, are also provided with  
a benefit allowance which they can apply to a range of benefits, 
including pension contributions. In some circumstances, and 
subject to Remuneration Committee approval, the allowance  
may be paid in cash rather than utilised to purchase benefits.
The SIP and SAYE are HMRC approved share plans for all 
employees facilitating the acquisition of shares in the Company  
at a discount.
Other benefits may be provided based on individual circumstances, 
such as, but not limited to: housing or relocation allowances, travel 
allowance or other expatriate benefits.
Whilst the Remuneration Committee has not set an absolute maximum  
on the level of benefits Executive Directors receive, the value of benefits  
is set at a level which the Remuneration Committee considers to be 
appropriately positioned taking into account relevant market levels based 
on the nature and location of the role and individual circumstances.
The flexible benefits allowance is currently up to 5% of base salary.  
The Remuneration Committee has the authority to review and amend  
this rate as appropriate. Individuals have the choice to invest all or part  
of this amount in their pension scheme, in addition to the benefits  
outlined in the ‘Retirement benefits’ section of this table.
SAYE and SIP limits as permitted in accordance with the relevant  
tax legislation.
Not applicable.
Retirement benefits
Provide market competitive post-employment benefits  
to recruit and retain Directors of the calibre required for  
the business.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the defined 
contribution pension scheme (or such other pension plan  
as may be deemed appropriate).
In appropriate circumstances, Executive Directors may take a 
salary supplement instead of contributions into a pension plan.
Current rates are 1 1% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer  
and 10% of base salary for the other Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee has the authority to review and amend  
this rate as appropriate.
Not applicable.
Annual bonus
Rewards performance against annual targets which support  
the strategic direction of the Company. The majority of staff 
participate in the same scheme.
Targets are set annually and any pay-out is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee after the period-end, based on 
performance against those targets. The Remuneration Committee

Overall maximum annual bonus 133% of salary.
Financial performance:
The Company profit performance element has a linear relationship with 
adjusted profit before tax. The pay-out has the following parameters:
Below threshold performance: 0% of salary.
On-target performance: 50% of salary.
Maximum: 100% of salary.
The bonus is then subject to a multiplier in the range of 0-1.33 which is 
applied to reflect individual performance, where 1.0 is used for ‘on-target’ 
individual performance. 
Stretching performance targets are set each year reflecting the business

100% of salary can be earned based on achieving these performance 
targets. 
58 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Directors’ remuneration policy
This part of the report sets out the Company’s Directors’ remuneration policy, which, subject to shareholder approval at the 2014  
AGM, shall take binding effect from the date of that meeting. The policy is determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
The Directors’ remuneration policy is not audited.
Policy table for Executive Directors
The table below describes each of the elements of the remuneration package for the Executive Directors:
Alignment with strategy/purpose Operation Maximum opportunity Performance measures
Base salary
Core element of fixed remuneration that provides the  
basis to recruit and retain talent necessary to deliver 
the business strategy.
Normally reviewed annually, any increases generally apply from  
1 January (but may be reviewed more frequently if required).
When determining base salary levels, consideration is given  
to the following:
• Role, responsibility and experience of the individual
• Corporate and individual performance
• Market conditions including typical pay levels for comparable 
roles in companies of a similar size and complexity
• The range of salary increases awarded across the Group.
No maximum salary opportunity has been set out in this policy report  
to avoid setting expectations for Executive Directors and employees.  
The base salaries effective as at 1 January 2014 are shown on page  
54. The Remuneration Committee has resolved to move base salaries 
progressively to a level which is market competitive (in general, positioned 
towards the lower end of the market range) taking account of individual 
factors such as:
• increase in scope and responsibility
• a new Executive Director being moved to market positioning over time
• alignment to market level.
Not applicable.
Benefits 
Provide a market-competitive benefits package to recruit and 
retain Directors of the calibre required for the business.
Participation in the Company’s Share Incentive Plan (“SIP”) and 
Share Save Scheme (“SAYE”) encourages share ownership 
and alignment with the wider workforce.
Executive Directors receive base benefits including car allowance 
(or company car), private medical insurance, and basic levels of 
other insurances (such as critical illness cover).
All UK staff, including Executive Directors, are also provided with  
a benefit allowance which they can apply to a range of benefits, 
including pension contributions. In some circumstances, and 
subject to Remuneration Committee approval, the allowance  
may be paid in cash rather than utilised to purchase benefits.
The SIP and SAYE are HMRC approved share plans for all 
employees facilitating the acquisition of shares in the Company  
at a discount.
Other benefits may be provided based on individual circumstances, 
such as, but not limited to: housing or relocation allowances, travel 
allowance or other expatriate benefits.
Whilst the Remuneration Committee has not set an absolute maximum  
on the level of benefits Executive Directors receive, the value of benefits  
is set at a level which the Remuneration Committee considers to be 
appropriately positioned taking into account relevant market levels based 
on the nature and location of the role and individual circumstances.
The flexible benefits allowance is currently up to 5% of base salary.  
The Remuneration Committee has the authority to review and amend  
this rate as appropriate. Individuals have the choice to invest all or part  
of this amount in their pension scheme, in addition to the benefits  
outlined in the ‘Retirement benefits’ section of this table.
SAYE and SIP limits as permitted in accordance with the relevant  
tax legislation.
Not applicable.
Retirement benefits
Provide market competitive post-employment benefits  
to recruit and retain Directors of the calibre required for  
the business.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the defined 
contribution pension scheme (or such other pension plan  
as may be deemed appropriate).
In appropriate circumstances, Executive Directors may take a 
salary supplement instead of contributions into a pension plan.
Current rates are 1 1% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer  
and 10% of base salary for the other Executive Directors.
The Remuneration Committee has the authority to review and amend  
this rate as appropriate.
Not applicable.
Annual bonus
Rewards performance against annual targets which support  
the strategic direction of the Company. The majority of staff 
participate in the same scheme.
Targets are set annually and any pay-out is determined by the 
Remuneration Committee after the period-end, based on 
performance against those targets. The Remuneration Committee 
has discretion to vary the bonus pay-out should any formulaic 
output not produce a fair result for either the Executive Director or 
the Company, taking account of the Remuneration Committee’s 
assessment of overall business performance.
The annual bonus is delivered in cash. Executive Directors may 
choose to invest the bonus earned (on a post-tax basis) in bonus 
investment shares, in return for participation in the bonus matching 
element of the LTIP – see below for further details.
Bonus investment shares are beneficially owned by the individual 
and are not subject to forfeiture.
Additionally Directors may opt to invest in the Company SIP (refer  
to note 32 for details).
Overall maximum annual bonus 133% of salary.
Financial performance:
The Company profit performance element has a linear relationship with 
adjusted profit before tax. The pay-out has the following parameters:
Below threshold performance: 0% of salary.
On-target performance: 50% of salary.
Maximum: 100% of salary.
The bonus is then subject to a multiplier in the range of 0-1.33 which is 
applied to reflect individual performance, where 1.0 is used for ‘on-target’ 
individual performance.

targets.

The LTIP was approved by shareholders in April 2007 and comprises two elements: 
Performance Share Awards and Matching Share Awards.
Performance Share Awards: are usually made on an annual basis and will vest 
subject to the achievement of performance conditions.
Matching Share Awards: as described above, Executive Directors may choose  
to invest the bonus earned (on a post-tax basis) in bonus investment shares, in return  
for the opportunity to earn a Matching Share Award subject to the achievement of

For both elements of the LTIP , awards of conditional shares, restricted stock or nil cost 
options can be made with vesting dependent on the achievement of performance 
conditions, normally over a three year performance period. Vested LTIP options must  
be exercised within ten years of the date of grant. Under the rules of the LTIP , the 
Remuneration Committee has discretion to satisfy vested LTIP awards in cash.
On the vesting/exercise of an LTIP award, the Remuneration Committee has  
the discretion to decide that executives can receive an amount (in cash or shares)  
equal to the dividends paid or payable between the date of grant and the vesting  
of an award on the number of shares which have vested.

For awards granted on or after 1 January 2014, the Remuneration Committee has the 
right to reduce any LTIP awards which have not yet vested (i.e. a malus provision) if an act 
or omission contributes to a material misstatement of the Group’s financial statements or 
results in material loss or reputational damage for the Company.
The Remuneration Committee may at its discretion structure awards as Approved Long 
Term Incentive Plan (‘ALTIP’) awards. ALTIP awards enable the participant and Company 
to benefit from HMRC approved option tax treatment in respect of part of the award, 
without increasing the pre-tax value delivered to participants. ALTIP awards may be 
structured either as an approved option for the part of the award up to the HMRC limit 
(currently £30,000) with an unapproved option for the balance and a ‘linked award’ to 
fund the exercise price of the approved option, or as an approved option and an LTIP 
award, with the vesting of the LTIP award scaled back to take account of any gain made 
on the exercise of the approved option. Other than to enable the grant of ALTIP awards, 
the Company will not grant awards to Executive Directors under the Executive Share 
Option Plan.
Maximum Performance Share Award: 100% of salary. 
Maximum Matching Share Award: 1 for 1 match on the (pre-tax) value of 
the bonus used to acquire bonus investment shares (subject to an overall

The table below sets out an overview of the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors.
Alignment with strategy/purpose Approach of the Company
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ fees
Provide an appropriate reward to attract and retain 
Directors of the calibre required for the business.
The remuneration of the Chairman of the Board is set by the Remuneration Committee and the  
Chief Executive Officer. Fees are set at a level which reflects the skills, knowledge, and experience  
of the individual, whilst taking into account appropriate market data.
The fee is set as a fixed annual fee and may be paid wholly or partly in cash or Company shares.
The Chairman and the Chief Executive Officer are responsible for deciding Non-Executive Directors’ 
fees. Fees are set taking into account several factors, including the size and complexity of the 
business, fees paid to Non-Executive Directors of UK listed companies of a similar size and  
complexity, and the expected time commitment and contribution for the role.
The fees are set as a fixed annual fee and may be paid wholly or partly in cash or Company shares.
Overall fees paid to Directors will remain within the limit stated in our Articles of Association,  
currently £200,000.
The Board has resolved to move the Chairman and Non-Executive Directors’ fees progressively to a 
level which is market competitive (in general, positioned towards the lower end of the market range).
Non-Executive Directors do not participate in any incentive scheme.
Directors may be eligible to benefits such as the use of secretarial support, travel costs or other 
benefits that may be appropriate.
Explanation of performance 
metrics chosen
The annual bonus is assessed against 
financial targets which are determined by 
the Remuneration Committee, typically 
Group adjusted profit before tax. This 
incentivises Executive Directors to focus  
on delivering the key financial goals of the 
Company. The annual bonus multiplier 
reflects individual performance which is 
aligned to delivering the overall business 
strategy and to encourage behaviours 
which facilitate profitable growth and the 
future development of the business. These 
targets therefore ensure that the interests of 
the Executive Directors are aligned with 
those of the shareholders.
For the LTIP , long term performance 
measures are chosen by the Remuneration 
Committee to provide a robust and 
transparent basis on which to measure 
Xaar’s performance over the longer term 
and to provide alignment with Xaar’s 
business strategy. Currently EPS growth is 
deemed to be the key measure of success 
of the execution of our long term strategy.
The Remuneration Committee retains  
the discretion to adjust the performance 
targets and measures where it considers it 
appropriate to do so (for example, to reflect 
changes in the structure of the business  
and to assess performance on a fair and 
consistent basis from year to year).
Awards may be adjusted in the event of a 
variation of capital in accordance with the 
scheme rules.
Pay policy for other employees
The Company values its wider workforce 
and aims to provide a remuneration 
package that is market competitive, 
complies with any statutory requirements, 
and is applied fairly and equitably across  
the wider employee population. Where 
remuneration is not determined by statutory 
regulation, the key principles of the 
compensation philosophy are as follows:
• We remunerate people in a manner  
that allows for stability of the business  
and the opportunity for sustainable  
long term growth
• We seek to remunerate fairly and 
consistently for each role with due regard 
to the marketplace, internal consistency 
and the Company’s ability to pay
• The Company operates HMRC approved 
SIP and SAYE and invites all employees to 
participate, therefore encouraging wider 
workforce share ownership.

Three scenarios have been illustrated for each Executive Director. 
Minimum performance • No bonus pay-out
• No vesting under the LTIP
Performance in line with expectations • 50% of salary pay-out under the annual bonus
• Assume bonus earned invested in bonus investment shares and shares equivalent to 17 .5% of 
salary vesting under the Matching Share Award element of the LTIP (i.e. 50% of salary equal to 
gross bonus invested x 35% Matching Share Award vesting)
• Shares equivalent to 35% of salary vesting under the LTIP
Maximum performance • 133% of salary pay-out under the annual bonus

Approach to recruitment 
remuneration
When appointing a new Executive  
Director, whether with an internal or  
external candidate, the Remuneration 
Committee will typically seek to use the 
policy detailed in the table on page 63  
to determine the Executive Director’s  
ongoing remuneration package.
To facilitate the appointment of candidates of 
the appropriate calibre required to implement 
the Group’s strategy, the Remuneration 
Committee also retains the discretion to 
include any other remuneration component 
or award which is outside the policy. The 
Remuneration Committee does not intend  
to use this discretion to make a non-
performance related incentive payment (for 
example, a ‘golden hello’). In determining 
appropriate remuneration, the Remuneration 
Committee will take into consideration all 
relevant factors (including the quantum and 
nature of remuneration) to ensure that the 
arrangements are in the best interests of the 
Company and its shareholders. This may,  
for example, include (but is not limited to)  
the following circumstances:
• an interim appointment being made  
to fill an Executive Director role on a  
short term basis
• exceptional circumstances require that 
the Chairman or a Non-Executive Director 
takes on an executive function on a short 
term basis
• an Executive Director is recruited at a time 
in the year when it would be inappropriate 
to provide a bonus or long term incentive 
award for that year as there would not be 
sufficient time to assess performance. 
The quantum in respect of the months 
employed during the year may be 
transferred to the subsequent year so  
that reward is provided on a fair and 
appropriate basis
• the executive received benefits  
at his previous employer which the 
Remuneration Committee considers  
it appropriate to offer.
The Remuneration Committee may also 
alter the performance measures, 
performance period and vesting period  
of the annual bonus or long term incentive, 
subject to the rules of the scheme, if the 
Remuneration Committee determines  
that the circumstances of the recruitment 
merit such alteration. The rationale will be 
clearly explained.
In determining appropriate remuneration 
arrangements on hiring a new Executive 
Director, the Remuneration Committee  
will take into account relevant factors  
such as the calibre of the individual, local 
market practice, the existing remuneration 
arrangements for other executives and the 
business circumstances. It will seek to 
ensure that arrangements are in the best 
interests of both the Company and its 
shareholders and seek not to pay more  
than is appropriate.
The Remuneration Committee may  
make an award or payment to ‘buy-out’ 
remuneration arrangements forfeited on 
leaving a previous employer. In doing so the 
Remuneration Committee will take account 
of relevant factors regarding the forfeited 
arrangements which may include the form 
of any forfeited awards (e.g. cash or shares), 
any performance conditions attached to 
these awards (and the likelihood of meeting 
those conditions), and the time over which 
they would have vested. It will generally seek 
to structure buy-out awards and payments 
on a comparable basis to remuneration 
arrangements forfeited. These awards or 
payments are excluded from the maximum 
level of variable pay referred to below; 
however, the Remuneration Committee’s 
intention is that the value awarded or paid 
would be no higher than the expected value 
of the forfeited arrangements.
Appropriate costs and support will be 
covered if the recruitment requires the 
relocation of the individual. All buy-out 
awards and payments will normally be  
liable to forfeiture or ‘clawback’ on early 
departure. For Executive Directors, early 
departure is typically defined as being  
within the first two years of employment 
although the Remuneration Committee  
has the ability to amend this definition  
in appropriate circumstances.
The maximum level of variable pay  
which may be awarded to new Executive 
Directors, excluding buy-out arrangements, 
would normally be in line with the maximum 
level of variable pay that may be awarded 
under the annual bonus plan and LTIP , but 
in any event the Remuneration Committee 
would not make an award of annual  
variable pay above 283% of salary. The 
Remuneration Committee may determine 
that such awards will be forfeited if 
performance or continued employment 
conditions are not met and it is deemed 
appropriate to do so.
Any share awards referred to in this  
section will be granted as far as possible 
under the Company’s existing share plans.  
If necessary, and subject to the limits 
referred to above, in order to facilitate the 
awards mentioned above, the committee 
may rely on exemption 9.4.2. of the Listing 
Rules which allows for the grant of awards 
to facilitate, in exceptional circumstances, 
the recruitment of a Director.
Where a position is fulfilled internally,  
any ongoing remuneration obligations  
or outstanding variable pay elements  
shall be allowed to continue according  
to the original terms.
Fees payable to a newly-appointed 
Chairman or Non-Executive Director  
will be in line with the fee policy in place  
at the time of appointment.

Policy
Notice period on termination by employing company 12 months. The committee has the discretion to determine what proportion  
of the notice period will be utilised in active service.
Termination payment Severance payments are limited to no more than one year’s salary plus benefits 
in kind (including company car or car allowance and private health insurance) 
and pension contributions (which may include salary supplements). 
Benefits provided in connection with termination of employment may also 
include, but are not limited to, outplacement and legal fees.
Vesting of incentives for leavers The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to determine appropriate 
bonus amounts taking into consideration the circumstances in which an 
Executive Director leaves. Typically for ‘good leavers’ bonus amounts will be 
determined by reference to the applicable performance targets, pro-rated for 
time in service to termination and paid at the usual time. The Remuneration 
Committee may decide to pay a good leaver’s bonus earlier than the usual time 
in appropriate circumstances. ‘Good leavers’ typically include leavers due to 
death, illness, injury, disability, redundancy, retirement with the consent of the 
Company, or any other reason as determined by the Remuneration Committee.
The vesting of share-based awards is governed by the rules of the relevant 
incentive plan, as approved by shareholders.
Under the LTIP , the provisions for good leavers provide that awards will vest  
at the end of the normal vesting period, subject to the satisfaction of the 
performance conditions. However, the Remuneration Committee has the 
discretion to accelerate vesting to the date of cessation of employment. 
If accelerated to the date of cessation of employment, the Remuneration 
Committee will determine the extent to which the performance conditions  
are considered satisfied. In either case, the extent to which an award vests  
will be subject to pro-rating for time (although the Remuneration Committee  
has discretion not to apply time pro-rating). In circumstances other than  
good leavers, awards will lapse. 
Were a buy-out award is to be made under Listing Rule 9.4.2 then the leaver 
provisions would be determined at the time of the award.
Payments may be made under the Company’s SAYE and SIP which  
are governed by HMRC approved plan rules and which cover certain

66 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Non-Executive Directors
Under the terms of their engagement, the 
notice period to be given by the Non-
Executive Directors on the Company is six 
months and the Company is obliged to give 
the same length of notice. Discretion is 
retained to terminate with or without due 
notice or paying any payment in lieu of 
notice dependent on what is considered to 
be in the best interests of the Company in 
the particular circumstances. 
Statement of consideration of 
employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Company
Salary, benefits and performance related 
reward provided to employees is taken into 
account when setting policy for Executive 
Directors’ remuneration (although 
employees are not formally consulted in 
relation to the setting of the policy). This 
includes consideration of:
• salary increases for the general employee 
population
• company-wide benefit (including pension) 
offerings
• overall spend and participation levels in 
the annual bonus and LTIP , and
• relevant ad-hoc information.
Existing contractual arrangements
The Remuneration Committee reserves  
the right to make any remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office 
notwithstanding that they are not in line  
with the policy set out below where the 
terms of the payment were agreed: 
(i) before the policy came into effect, or 
(ii)  at a time when the relevant individual 
was not a Director of the Company and, 
in the opinion of the Remuneration 
Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual 
becoming a Director of the Company. 
For these purposes ‘payments’ includes  
the Remuneration Committee satisfying 
awards of variable remuneration and, in 
relation to an award over shares, the terms 
of the payment are ‘agreed’ at the time  
the award is granted.
The Remuneration Committee may make 
minor changes to this policy, which do  
not have a material advantage to Directors, 
to aid in its operation or implementation 
without seeking shareholder approval  
but taking into account the interests  
of shareholders.
Statement of consideration  
of shareholder views
In the interests of ensuring ongoing and 
transparent dialogue with shareholders, the 
Remuneration Committee consulted major 
shareholders on changes to the Executive 
Director base salaries and Non-Executive 
fees for 2014. There were no other 
significant changes to the Directors’ 
remuneration policy proposed for 2014.

www.xaar.com 67 The Directors are responsible for preparing 
the annual report and the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to 
prepare financial statements for each 
financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare the Group financial 
statements in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and Article 
4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected  
to prepare the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law the Directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are 
satisfied that they give a true and fair  
view of the state of affairs of the Company 
and of the profit or loss of the Company  
for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and 
then apply them consistently
• make judgements and accounting 
estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent
• state whether applicable UK Accounting 
Standards have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements, and
• prepare the financial statements on the 
going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
Governance 
Directors’ responsibilities statement
In preparing the Group financial statements, 
International Accounting Standard 1 
requires that Directors:
• properly select and apply accounting 
policies
• present information, including accounting 
policies, in a manner that provides 
relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information 
• provide additional disclosures when 
compliance with the specific requirements 
in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and 
financial performance, and
• make an assessment of the Company’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for  
keeping adequate accounting records  
that are sufficient to show and explain  
the Company’s transactions and disclose 
with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and 
enable them to ensure that the financial 
statements comply with the Companies  
Act 2006. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for 
the prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the 
maintenance and integrity of the corporate 
and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the 
United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements 
may differ from legislation in other 
jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our 
knowledge:
• the financial statements, prepared in 
accordance with the relevant financial 
reporting framework, give a true and  
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial 
position, and profit or loss of the company 
and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole
• the strategic report includes a fair review 
of the development and performance of 
the business and the position of the 
company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face, and
• the annual report and financial 
statements, taken as a whole, are  
fair, balanced and understandable, and 
provide the information necessary for 
shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model,  
and strategy.

statements of Xaar plc
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of 
the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit for 
the year then ended
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance  
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the  
European Union
• the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of 
the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 
of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Reconciliation of Adjusted 
Financial Measures, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated 
Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related 
notes 1 to 34, and the Parent Company Balance Sheet and the related notes 1 to 10. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group 
financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent 
company financial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement in the 
Directors’ report that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
• we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting 
in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; and
• we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on 
the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement 
is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.

Independent auditor’s report to the members  
of Xaar plc continued
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Inventory valuation
We consider there to be a significant risk with respect to the 
valuation of raw materials, work-in-progress and finished 
goods at all stages of the assembly process owing to the 
judgemental nature of determining the costs used in the 
inventory standard costing model.
The inventory provision, which is based on review of old and 
obsolete inventory lines in addition to historic evidence of 
inventory write-offs, is also considered to be a significant risk 
owing to the judgmental nature of the inventory provision.
 
We tested the inventory standard costing valuation methodology to assess whether it is 
determined in accordance with International Accounting Standard 2 (IAS 2). This has 
included testing the controls in relation to the inventory standard costing system, such 
as the review of variance reports, and the data generated by that system.
We challenged the assumptions used in the derivation of the cost absorption rates 
through performing independent checks against actual costs for the year and 
comparing cost absorption rates with prior years for consistency. Our testing assessed 
the reasonableness of the amendments to inventory valuation for changes in actual 
costs of production.
We tested the completeness and accuracy of the year end inventory valuation, 
assessing whether standard costs have been applied appropriately to items of raw 
materials, work-in-progress and finished goods. We tested the inventory provision for 
completeness by reference to inventory damage/obsolesence issues identified through 
interviews with inventory management personnel external to the finance function. We 
challenged the assumptions that underlie the provision and substantiated via reference 
to third party transactions and evidence.
Revenue recognition
The Xaar Group accounts for revenue on printheads  
and system components at the point of despatch as this is 
the point at which the risks and rewards of the products 
held as stock are transferred to the customer. The Group 
has no significant distribution/consignment agreements in 
place with third parties.
We consider there to be a significant risk with respect to  
the accounting for customer contract pricing with Xaar’s 
significant customers owing to the degree of estimation 
involved in accounting for contract pricing and the associated 
revenue in line with IFRSs and the Group’s accounting policy.
 
When auditing revenue streams we considered the Group’s revenue recognition policy, 
per International Accounting Standard 18 ‘Revenue’ (IAS 18), to assess whether 
revenue recognition is acceptable under IFRSs and whether the policy has been 
applied consistently through the year.
We performed testing over customer contract pricing agreements granted to 
customers during the year by testing a sample of these agreements, reviewing the 
terms and conditions of sale and agreeing the accounting treatment and revenue 
recognition applied; also ensuring compliance with IFRSs. For the most significant 
customers we obtained the customer contract pricing agreement and reconciled this  
to the accounting treatment per the financial statements.
70 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Capitalisation of internally generated 
intangible assets
We consider there to be a significant risk in relation to 
development costs being incorrectly recognised through  
the profit or loss during the year, in contravention of IAS 38. 
Owing to the quantum of investment in R&D in the year and 
the number of R&D projects to be approaching technical and 
economic feasibility, the failure to capitalise appropriate costs 
could result in material misstatement of profit and loss for  
the year.
 
We challenged management’s accounting treatment of development costs by 
reviewing research and development project costs and discussing those projects with 
significant expenditure with the Research and Development Director, in order for us to 
assess whether projects have reached the development phase and therefore require 
capitalisation. For each project we made an assessment of the technical feasibility and 
likelihood of future economic benefit by reference to product test stage classifications 
and communications with the markets.
Warranty provision
There are two components to the warranty provision,  
a general provision (based on the historic product return  
rate over a twelve month period) and a specific provision.
We consider there to be a significant risk with respect to the 
completeness and valuation of the specific warranty provision 
owing to the judgemental nature of the provision calculations 
which are estimated with reference to known product issues 
which have arisen during the year.
 
We performed a review of sales returns to identify any specific warranty issues that 
have arisen over the course of the year. All specific issues identified are included in  
the specific provision. We discussed warranty issues with staff external to finance  
and challenged estimates and assumptions when our wider audit procedures indicated 
to us that product issues may exist that have yet to be updated for in the warranty 
provision calculation. In addition, we assessed the current year warranty provision by 
reference to historic product return reports and the accuracy of the prior year provision. 
We also agreed all known issues back to the specific warranty calculation.
Depreciation of property, plant  
and equipment (PPE)
As a result of the growth of the business and resulting 
expansion of the Huntingdon manufacturing facility, £19.4 
million of PPE additions had been recognised during the year 
ended 31 December 2013. The depreciation of PPE has 
been considered to be a significant audit risk due to the 
judgemental nature of the point at which depreciation 
commences and the potentially material effect if accounted 
for the incorrect accounting period.
 
We tested a sample of PPE additions and transfers from ‘assets under construction’  
(on which no depreciation is charged) to ‘live’ assets categories in order to assess 
whether depreciation has commenced when the asset was available for use, in 
accordance with International Accounting Standard 16 ‘Property, Plant and  
Equipment’ (IAS 16).

www.xaar.com 71 Financial statements
Independent auditor’s report to the members  
of Xaar plc continued
The Audit Committee’s consideration of these risks is set out on page 40.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an 
opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, 
and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of 
materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the 
economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality 
both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the group to be £1.9 million, which is below 5% of pre-tax profit.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the committee all audit differences in excess of 
£40,000, as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We 
also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation 
of the financial statements.
An overview of the 
scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that assessment, we focused 
our Group audit scope primarily on the audit work at the UK headquarters in Cambridge. Five entities were subject  
to a full audit (Xaar plc, XaarJet Ltd, Xaar Technology Ltd, XaarJet (Overseas) Ltd and Xaar Digital Ltd) performed 
directly by the Group audit team. Three entities (XaarJet AB, Xaar Group AB and Xaar America Inc.) were subject to 
specified audit procedures where the extent of our testing was based on our assessment of the risks of material 
misstatement and of the materiality of the Group’s operations at those locations. The eight entities subject either to  
a full audit or specified audit procedures account for 100% of the Group’s net assets, 100% of the Group’s revenue 
and 100% of the Group’s profit before tax. They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis for undertaking 
audit work to address the risks of material misstatement identified above. Our audit work for each entity was 
executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual entity which were lower than Group materiality.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures to confirm 
our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated financial information  
of the remaining components not subject to audit or audit of specified account balances. As the Group auditor we 
planned the work conducted by the component auditor, reviewed their work and attended conference call audit 
planning, status update and close meetings.
Opinion on other 
matters prescribed  
by the Companies  
Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the information given in the strategic report and the Directors’ report for the financial year for which the financial 
statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

72 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of 
explanations received 
and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit  
have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of Directors’ 
remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from these matters.
Corporate governance 
statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the corporate governance statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report 
arising from our review.
Our duty to read other 
information in the 
annual report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, 
information in the annual report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or
• otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the annual report appropriately discloses those matters that we communicated to the 
Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective 
responsibilities  
of Directors and 
auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on 
Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit 
methodology and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our 
quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team, strategically focused second 
partner reviews and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit  
of the financial 
statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent 
company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In 
addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become 
aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

1. General information 
Xaar plc (‘the Company’) is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is given on the 
inside back cover. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activity is set out in the Strategic report starting on page 2.  
2. Key sources of estimation uncertainty and critical accounting judgements 
The key assumptions concerning the future and other sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a significant risk of causing 
a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are as follows: 
Asset valuations 
Throughout the year, management considers the carrying value of both receivables and inventory balances. Provisions against both balances are 
made on the basis of past losses, current trading patterns and anticipated future events. 
Provisions 
Management regularly consider the potential liabilities which may arise from product warranty claims, commercial disputes, restructuring or other 
activities which may result in future losses or charges. Management create and maintain appropriate financial provisions based on specific known 
issues and underlying historical experience. 
Impairment of goodwill 
The Group determines whether goodwill is impaired at least on an annual basis. This requires an estimation of the ‘value-in-use’ of the cash-generating 
units to which the goodwill is allocated. Estimating a value-in-use amount requires management to make an estimate of the expected future cash flows 
from the cash-generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. The carrying 
amount of goodwill at 31 December 2013 was £720,000 (2012: £720,000). Further details are given in note 13. 
Impairment of trade investments 
The Group determines whether its trade investments are impaired at least on an annual basis. Unquoted investments are evaluated against the 
opportunity for return through trading gains as a result of continuing to hold the investment. An impairment review of trade investments was performed 
in 2012 and the carrying value of the trade investment held was deemed to be fully impaired and therefore as at 31 December 2012 and 2013 the 
carrying value was £nil. Further details are given in note 17. 
3. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’), as adopted for use in the 
European Union. Therefore the Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with Article 4 of the EU IAS regulation. 
The financial information has been prepared on the basis of all applicable IFRS, including all International Accounting Standards (‘IAS’), Standing 
Interpretations Committee (‘SIC’) interpretations and International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) interpretations issued by 
the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) that are applicable to the financial period, as adopted by the European Union. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of financial instruments. The Group financial 
statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£’000) except when otherwise indicated. 
The principal accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
Basis of consolidation 
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (‘its subsidiaries’) 
made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date of 
acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries 
to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.  
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Foreign exchange gains and losses arising on the 
retranslation of trading balances with subsidiaries with different functional currencies are reported in the income statement. 
Going concern 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and position, are set out in the strategic 
report on pages 8 to 11. Notes 19, 20 and 23 include a description of the Group’s objectives; policies and processes for managing its capital; its 
financial risk management objectives; details of its financial instruments and hedging activities; and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk. 
The Group has considerable financial resources and through a diverse customer base is exposed not only to the Western economies but also China, 
India and Latin America. As a consequence, the Directors believe that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks successfully despite the 
current uncertain economic outlook. 
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future, based on the Group’s forecasts and projections for the next four years, taking account of reasonably possible changes in 
trading performance. For this reason, we continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.  Financial statements

3. Significant accounting policies continued 
Business combinations 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the acquisition method. 
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination over 
the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the Group’s 
interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination,  
the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Goodwill 
Goodwill arising on consolidation is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the income 
statement and is not subsequently reversed. 
For the purposes of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies  
of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there  
is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than the carrying amount of the unit, the 
impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro rata  
on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period. 
On disposal of the cash-generating unit, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS has been retained at the previous UK GAAP amounts subject to being tested for 
impairment at that date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any 
subsequent profit or loss on disposal. 
Revenue recognition 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided 
in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes, but gross of any tax withheld.  
Sales of goods are recognised when all of the following conditions are satisfied: 
• the Company has transferred to the buyer the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods  
• the Company retains neither a continuing managerial involvement to the degree normally associated with ownership, nor effective control over  
 goods sold  
• the amount of revenue can be measured reliably  
• it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the entity; and  
• the costs incurred, or to be incurred, in respect of the transaction can be measured reliably.  
For sales of goods to a distributor with consignment stock arrangements, revenue is recognised at the point of sale by the distributor which is when 
the risks and rewards of ownership of inventory have transferred. 
Development fees gained from joint development agreements are treated as income over the periods necessary to match them with the related costs. 
Funding received for internally generated intangible assets is recognised on a straight-line basis to match the amortisation period of the related 
intangible fixed asset.  
Royalties are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the actual revenue trend in the most recent quarterly statements received from  
each licensee. 
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that 
discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 
Leases 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease, except where another more 
systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern in which the economic benefits from the lease asset are consumed. Contingent rentals 
arising under operating leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred. 
In the event that lease incentives are received to enter into operating leases, such incentives are recognised as a liability. The aggregate benefit  
of incentives is recognised as a reduction of rental expense on a straight-line basis, except where another systematic basis is more representative  
of the time pattern in which economic benefits from the leased asset are consumed.  Governance Financial statements Strategic report 
 
  www.xaar.com 81 
3. Significant accounting policies continued 
Foreign currencies 
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates  
(its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group company are 
expressed in sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the consolidated financial statements.  
Exchange differences arising on the settlement of monetary assets and liabilities, and on the retranslation of monetary assets and liabilities, are 
included in the income statement for the period.  
In order to hedge its exposure to certain foreign exchange risks, the Group may enter into forward contracts (see page 83 for details of the Group’s 
accounting policies in respect of such derivative financial instruments). 
For the purposes of presenting consolidated financial statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at the 
exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. 
Exchange differences arising are recognised in other comprehensive income and taken to the translation reserve. Exchange differences on the 
translation of net investments are taken to the translation reserve of the applicable entity. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and translated 
at the closing rate. The Group has elected to treat goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on acquisitions before the date of transition to IFRS 
as sterling denominated assets and liabilities.  
Government and EU grants 
Government and EU grants are not recognised until there is reasonable assurance that the Group will comply with the conditions attached to them 
and that the grant will be received. 
Government and EU grants relating to research and development are treated as income over the periods necessary to match them with the 
related costs.  
Operating profit 
Operating profit is stated after charging restructuring costs but before investment income and finance costs. 
Retirement benefit costs 
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state managed 
retirement benefit schemes are dealt with as payments to defined contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are 
equivalent to those arising in a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme.  
Taxation 
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it 
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. 
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not 
recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) 
of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.  
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control 
the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.  
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that 
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.  
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or 
credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.  
To the extent that the Group receives a tax deduction relating to share-based payment transactions, deferred tax is provided at the appropriate tax 
rate on the difference in value between the market price of the underlying equity as at the date of the financial statements and the exercise price 
of the outstanding share options. As a result, the deferred tax impact of share options will not be derived directly from the expense reported in the 
consolidated income statement. The amount by which the deductible difference exceeds the cumulative charge to the consolidated income statement 
is recorded in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  Financial statements

3. Significant accounting policies continued 
Taxation continued 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured on an undiscounted basis and are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax 
assets against current tax liabilities and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.  
Property, plant and equipment 
All property, plant and equipment is shown at original historical cost less accumulated depreciation and any recognised impairment loss.  
Assets in the course of construction for production or administrative purposes are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation  
of these assets, on the same basis as other assets in the same class, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost or valuation of assets, less their residual values, other than assets in the course of construction, 
over their estimated useful lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:  
Leasehold property improvements ten years or, where shorter, over the term of the relevant lease 
Plant and machinery  three to five years 
Furniture, fittings and equipment  three to five years 
Motor vehicles  three years 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term 
of the relevant lease. 
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset 
and is recognised in income.  
Internally generated intangible assets – research and development expenditure 
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred. 
In accordance with IAS 38 ‘Intangible assets’ where a project has entered the development phase and is sufficiently self-contained that the expected 
future economic benefits can be traced directly to the assets developed within the project, it is probable that the expected future economic benefits 
that are attributable to the asset will flow to the entity, and the cost of the asset can be measured reliably, the development costs related to the project 
will be capitalised as an intangible asset. 
Internally generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful lives. Where no internally generated intangible asset can  
be recognised, development expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.  
Other intangible assets 
Costs incurred in maintaining the patent and trademark portfolio are written off to the income statement as incurred.  
Payments in respect of software, external product development costs and licence rights acquired are capitalised at cost and amortised on  
a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. 
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication 
that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from other assets, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs.  
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value-in-use. In assessing value-in-use, the estimated future cash flows are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset  
(cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately. 
Where an impairment loss is subsequently reversed, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate  
of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined  
had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as  
income immediately. 
Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is calculated using the first in, first out (FIFO) cost formula, by applying the 
standard cost methodology, with costs including direct materials, direct labour costs and an attributable proportion of manufacturing overheads based 
on normal levels of activity that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents 
the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution. Provision is made for 
obsolete, slow-moving or defective items where applicable. 
Financial instruments 
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions  
of the instrument.  Governance Financial statements Strategic report 
 
  www.xaar.com 83 
3. Significant accounting policies continued 
Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are measured at initial recognition at fair value. Appropriate allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts are recognised in profit 
or loss when there is objective evidence that the asset is impaired. The allowance recognised is measured as the difference between the asset’s 
carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash flows discounted at the effective interest rate computed at initial recognition.  
Investments 
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require 
delivery of the investment within the time frame established by the market concerned and are initially measured at fair value, equating to cost, including 
transaction costs. Investments are classified as available for sale, and on the basis that the investments have no active market and their fair values 
cannot be reliably determined using valuation techniques, the investments are carried at cost. 
If there is objective evidence that an impairment loss on an unquoted equity investment that is not carried at fair value because its fair value cannot be 
reliably measured, the amount of the loss is measured as the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future 
cash flows discounted at the current market rate of return for a similar financial asset. 
Bonds with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified 
as held-to-maturity investments. Held-to-maturity investments are measured at amortised cost using effective interest method less any impairment. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits and other short term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible  
to a known amount of cash within a period of up to three months post balance sheet and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Treasury deposits 
Treasury deposits comprise demand deposits that are convertible to a known amount of cash with an original maturity of up to twelve months, which 
are due to mature more than three months after the balance sheet date and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value. 
Financial liabilities and equity 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity instrument 
is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting policies adopted for 
specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out within the policy on derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting below. 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings 
Interest-bearing loans and bank overdrafts are measured initially at fair value, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums payable 
on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the income statement using the effective interest rate 
method and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
Trade payables 
Trade payables are measured at original cost.  
Equity instruments 
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting 
The Group’s activities expose it primarily to the financial risks of changes in foreign currency exchange rates and interest rates and liquidity risk.  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments (primarily foreign currency forward contracts) to hedge its risks associated with foreign currency 
fluctuations relating to certain firm commitments and forecast transactions.  
The Group’s interest rate risk arises mainly from its funds invested in short term bank deposits. To mitigate these risks, limits have been set by the 
Board in relation to maturity period and maximum deposits with any one institution.  
In order to mitigate the Group’s liquidity risks, the Group can choose to fund significant fixed asset purchases by finance leases repayable over  
a period of three to five years dependent on the individual asset being financed and interest-bearing loans.  
The use of financial derivatives is governed by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors, which provides written principles on the use of financial 
derivatives consistent with the Group’s risk management strategy. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.  
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are remeasured to fair value at subsequent reporting dates.  
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated as hedges of future cash flows and deemed to be effective are 
recognised directly in equity and the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow hedge of a firm 
commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition of an asset or a liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is recognised, the 
associated gains or losses on the derivative that had previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or 
liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of an asset or a liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in the income statement in 
the same period in which the hedged item affects net profit or loss. However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the recognition  
of a non-financial asset or non-financial liability, the gains and losses previously accumulated in equity are transferred from equity and included in the 
initial measurement of the cost of the non-financial asset or non-financial liability.   Financial statements

84 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
3. Significant accounting policies continued 
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting continued 
Changes in fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised in the income statement as they arise. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated, exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. 
At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in equity is retained in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. If a 
hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is transferred to net profit or loss for the period. 
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are 
not closely related to those of host contracts and the host contracts are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the income statement. 
Provisions 
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that the Group will be required to 
settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet 
date and are discounted where the effect of the time value of money is material. 
A restructuring provision is recognised when the Group has developed a detailed formal plan for the restructuring and has raised a valid expectation  
in those affected that it will carry out the restructuring by starting to implement the plan or announcing its main features to those affected by it, and  
the plan has reached a stage where the decision is unlikely to be reversed. The measurement of a restructuring provision includes only the direct 
expenditures arising from the restructuring, which are those amounts that are both necessarily entailed by the restructuring and not associated with 
the ongoing activities of the entity. 
Provisions for the expected cost of warranty obligations under local sale of goods legislation are recognised in the month of sale of the relevant 
products, at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the Group’s obligation. 
Share-based payments 
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payment’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS 2 has been applied  
to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005. 
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect of  
non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments  
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for  
the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. 
The fair value of options issued under the Group’s Long Term Incentive Plan is measured using a stochastic (Monte Carlo binomial) model for grants 
made between 2007 and 2009 inclusive. The fair value of all other equity-settled share-based payments is measured using the Black-Scholes pricing 
model. The expected life used in these models has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
SAYE share options granted to employees are treated as cancelled when employees cease to contribute to the scheme. This results in accelerated 
recognition of the expenses that would have arisen over the remainder of the original vesting period. 
Own shares 
Own shares are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the income statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the 
Group’s own shares.  Governance Financial statements Strategic report

New standards and interpretations 
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted: 
• IFRS 7 (amended) ‘Disclosures – Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities’ 
As the Group does not have any offsetting arrangements in place, the application of the amendments has had no impact on the disclosures or on the 
amounts recognised in the consolidated financial statements. 
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these financial 
statements were in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU): 
The Directors do not expect that the adoption of the standards listed above will have a material impact on the financial statements of the Group  
in future periods.

The Audit Committee has considered the independence of the auditor in relation to non-audit services throughout the year. A description of the work 
of the Audit Committee is set out in the corporate governance statement on pages 39 to 41 and includes an explanation of how the auditor’s 
objectivity and independence is safeguarded when non-audit services are provided by the auditor. 
The Group paid £10,000 (2012: £7,000) to Cambridge Network Limited, an associate of Deloitte LLP. Cambridge Network is a networking 
organisation which draws its members from companies and individuals interested in the Cambridge technology industry. Neither Deloitte LLP

9. Finance costs 
10. Tax 
The blended standard rate of tax for the year, based on the UK standard rate of corporation tax, is 23.25% (2012: 24.5%). Taxation for other 
jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the respective jurisdictions.  
The Finance Act 2013, which provides for reductions in the main rate of corporation tax from 23% to 21% effective from 1 April 2014 and to 20% 
effective from 1 April 2015, was substantively enacted on 2 July 2013. These rate reductions have been reflected in the calculation of deferred tax at 
the balance sheet date. 
In 2013, the Company benefited from the enhanced tax deduction for research and development expenditure for three months of the year under the 
large company scheme, compared with the full year 2012 under the SME scheme. The Company has opted into the research and development 
expenditure credit scheme from 1 April 2013, which is not a tax deduction and is taken as income included in operating profit. 
The charge for the year can be reconciled to the profit per the income statement as follows:  
The effective tax rate for the year is 21% (2012: 20%).

11. Dividends 
The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the AGM and has not been included as a liability in these financial statements.  
12. Earnings per ordinary share - - - basic and diluted 
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:  
The weighted average number of ordinary shares for the purposes of basic earnings per share is calculated after the exclusion of ordinary shares in 
Xaar plc held by Xaar Trustee Ltd and the Xaar plc ESOP trust. 
For 2013, there were no anti-dilutive share options at the period end. For 2012, there were share options granted over 477,752 shares that had not 
been included in the diluted earnings per share calculation because they were anti-dilutive at the period end.  
For 2012, the performance conditions for share options granted over 35,191 shares were not met and therefore the dilutive effect of the number of 
shares which would have been issued at the period end was not included in the diluted earnings per share calculation. There were no comparable 
anti-dilutive options or LTIPs to exclude from the current period diluted earnings per share calculation.

12. Earnings per ordinary share - - - basic and diluted continued 
Adjusted earnings per share 
This adjusted earnings per share information is considered to provide a fairer representation of the Group’s trading performance year on year,  
as it removes items which, in the Board’s opinion, do not reflect the underlying performance of the Group. 
The calculation of adjusted EPS excluding share-based payment charges, exchange differences relating to the Swedish operations, the gain or loss on 
derivative financial instruments, non-recurring royalty income, and impairment of investments and associated loans is based on earnings of:  
The denominators used are the same as those detailed above for both basic and diluted earnings per share.  
Share-based payment charges include the IFRS 2 charge for the period of £2,103,000, per note 32 (2012: £1,358,000) and the charge relating to 
National Insurance on the outstanding potential share option gains of £2,101,000 (2012: £184,000). 
Adjusted earnings per share is earnings per share excluding the items adjusted for as detailed above:  
13. Goodwill 
The carrying amount of goodwill at 31 December 2013 was £720,000 (2012: £720,000). There were no accumulated impairment losses at the end  
of the year. 
Goodwill acquired in a business combination is allocated, at acquisition, to the cash-generating units (CGUs) that are expected to benefit from that 
business combination. The carrying amount of goodwill had been allocated as follows:  
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. 
The recoverable amount of the CGU is determined from a value-in-use calculation. The key assumptions to which the value-in-use calculation is most 
sensitive are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. 
The Group prepares cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial forecasts reviewed by management for the next four years and these 
have been used in the value-in-use calculation. The discount rate applied to the cash flow projections is 8% (2012: 8%) and reflects management’s 
estimate of return on capital employed.  
Sensitivity analysis has been completed on each key assumption in isolation and this indicates that reasonable changes in key assumptions on which 
we have based our determination of the recoverable amount would not cause the carrying amount of goodwill to exceed its recoverable amount. 
Having performed impairment testing, no impairment has been identified and therefore no impairment loss has been recognised in either period.

17. Investments 
The unquoted trading investments represent investments in companies that present the Group with opportunity for return through trading gains. 
The charge in 2012 for the impairment of a trade investment relates to a minority stake in an inkjet solutions provider. The full value of this investment 
was recognised as an impairment loss in the income statement in the prior period, within general and administrative expenses, as the value is  
no longer deemed recoverable. 
Held-to-maturity investments represent investment in bonds returning interest at 3% per annum, which mature on 22 November 2018.

The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 24 days (2012: 32 days). No interest is charged on the receivables for the period agreed in the 
Requirements Contract or, if not specified or applicable, the first 30 days from the date of the invoice. Thereafter, the Group reserves the right to 
charge interest at a daily rate of the greater of either 3% per annum above the base rate of Barclays Bank plc from time to time, or the maximum rate 
of interest allowable under the Late Payment of Commercial Debts (Interest) Act 1998, on all sums outstanding until payment in full is received. The 
Group has provided fully for all receivables over 120 days because historical experience is such that receivables that are past due beyond 120 days 
are generally not recoverable. Trade receivables between 30 days and 120 days are provided for based on estimated irrecoverable amounts from  
the sale of goods, determined by reference to past default experience.

The maximum exposure to credit risk is the carrying amount of the financial assets as disclosed on page 95. Before accepting any new customer, the 
Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines credit limits by customer. Credit limits are 
reviewed at least once per year. Letters of credit may be used. Credit insurance has typically been taken out over the most significant customers. Of 
the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, seven customers each represented greater than 5% of the total receivables balance, totalling £7.2 
million (2012: £5.3 million). The total due from these customers represents 49% (2012: 38%) of the Group’s revenue; there are no other customers 
who represent more than 5% of the total balance of trade receivables. 
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are debtors with a carrying amount of £1.7 million (2012: £1.1 million) which are past due at the 
reporting date for which the Group has not provided as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered 
recoverable. Of these amounts, the Group is in possession of letters of credit to the value of £1,667,000 (2012: £818,000) which had not reached 
maturity as at the reporting date. The Group does not hold any other collateral over these balances. The average age of these receivables  
is 32 days (2012: 34 days). 
Ageing of past due but not impaired receivables: 
Movement in the allowance for doubtful debts: 
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit 
was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large and unrelated. Accordingly, 
the Directors believe that there is no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts. 
Ageing of impaired trade receivables: 
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. 
Treasury deposits 
Treasury deposits comprise bank deposits with an original maturity of six months or less, which do not mature until more than three months after the 
balance sheet date. The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.

19. Other financial assets continued 
Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash held by the Group and short term bank deposits with an original maturity of three months or less.  
The carrying amount of these assets approximates their fair value.  
The analysis of cash and short term bank deposits is as follows: 
The credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by 
international credit rating agencies.  
20. Financial instruments 
Categories of financial instruments 
Financial assets of £14,770,000 (2012: £11,759,000) are categorised as loans and receivables. Financial liabilities of £22,496,000 (2012: £13,770,000) 
are categorised as measured at amortised cost. Derivative financial assets and liabilities are derived from quoted prices (unaudited) in active markets 
for identical assets and liabilities. 
Financial risk management objectives 
The Group’s policy is to manage the Group’s financial risk, secure cost effective funding for the Group’s operations and to minimise the adverse 
effects of fluctuations in the financial markets on the value of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities, on reported profitability and on the cash flows 
of the Group.  
The Group finances its activities with a combination of bank loans, finance leases, cash and fixed term deposits and forward contracts as deemed 
appropriate. Other financial assets and liabilities, such as trade debtors and trade creditors, arise directly from the Group’s operating activities. The 
Group also enters into derivative transactions – forward currency contracts. The purpose is to manage the currency risks arising from the Group’s 
operations. It is Group policy that no trading in derivatives shall be undertaken. 
Financial instruments give rise to foreign currency, interest rate, credit and liquidity risk. The Group’s management of its exposure to credit risk is 
discussed in note 19 and to liquidity risk is discussed in note 24. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group’s policy is to manage its cost of borrowing using fixed rate debt. Whilst fixed rate interest-bearing debt is not exposed to cash flow interest 
rate risk, there is no opportunity for the Group to enjoy a reduction in borrowing costs in markets where rates are falling. In addition, the fair value risk 
inherent in fixed rate borrowing means that the Group is exposed to unplanned costs should debt be restructured or repaid early as part of the liquidity 
management process. 
The sensitivity analysis prepared below relates to cash balances, since borrowings are at fixed rates of interest. The closing cash and cash equivalents, 
and treasury deposits balance at the year end have been used as the basis for the calculations. A 2% increase or decrease represents management’s 
assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates. 
If interest rates had been 2% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended 31 December 2013 would 
increase by £1.1 million or decrease by £0.4 million (2012: increase by £0.6 million/decrease by £0.2 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s 
exposure to interest rates on its cash balances. There would be no effect on equity reserves.  
Foreign currency risk 
The Group receives approximately 5% of its revenues in US dollars and 25% of its revenue in Euros, which are partially naturally hedged by supplies 
in these currencies, but the remainder requires conversion into sterling in order to fund the remaining costs of the UK offices. The Group has a 
manufacturing facility in Sweden which necessitates the need for the Group to convert sterling into Swedish kronor in order to fund the running costs 
of this manufacturing facility. The Group may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to foreign currency risk, 
including forward contracts.

20. Financial instruments continued 
Foreign currency risk continued 
The Group is mainly exposed to foreign currency risk resulting from transactions in US dollars, Euros and Swedish kronor. The following table 
demonstrates the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase and decrease in the sterling exchange rate against the relevant foreign currencies on the 
Group’s profit before tax and equity (due to changes in the fair value of monetary assets, liabilities and forward currency contracts). 10% represents 
management’s assessment of the reasonably possible movement in exchange rates. The sensitivity analysis includes only outstanding foreign currency 
denominated monetary items and adjusts their translation at the period end for a 10% change in foreign currency rates. The sensitivity analysis 
includes inter company balances within the Group where the denomination of the balance is in a currency other than the functional currency of 
the debtor or the creditor. A positive number below indicates an increase in profit or equity. 
Forward foreign exchange contracts 
The Group utilises currency derivatives to hedge significant future transactions and cash flows. The Group does not currently designate its foreign 
currency denominated debt as a hedging instrument for the purpose of hedging the translation of its foreign operations. 
At 31 December 2013, the Group had open currency derivative assets of £6,000 (2012: liabilities £4,000). 
As at 31 December 2013 the Group held outstanding forward contracts to cover a proportion of the expected monthly currency exposures for the 
period January 2014 to February 2014. In total the contracts represented a conversion of €2.4 million into £2.0 million.  
Capital risk management 
The primary objective of the Group’s capital management is to ensure that it maintains a strong credit rating and healthy capital ratios in order to 
support its business, maximise shareholder value and provide flexibility for value enhancing investments. The Group manages its capital structure and 
makes adjustments to it in light of changes in economic conditions or as a result of corporate strategy. To maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may adjust the dividend payment to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or issue new shares. In addition, any potential value enhancing 
investments may be funded through additional debt instruments. No changes were made in the objectives, policies or processes during the current  
or prior year, except for the proposed increase in final dividend for 2013, as detailed in note 11 on page 91. 
The Group monitors capital using a gearing ratio, which is determined as the proportion of debt to equity. Debt is defined as long and short term 
borrowings. Equity includes all capital and reserves of the Group attributable to the equity holders of the parent. The Group’s policy for its existing 
business is to use debt where appropriate, whilst maintaining the gearing ratio at a level under 10%.  
The gearing ratio at the year end is as follows: 
The Group is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements. 
Credit risk management 
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group has adopted 
a policy of only dealing with creditworthy counterparties and obtaining sufficient collateral where appropriate, as a means of mitigating the risk of 
financial loss from defaults. 
Trade receivables consist of a large number of customers, spread across different industries and geographical areas. Ongoing credit evaluation is 
performed on the financial condition of accounts receivable. 
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit ratings assigned by international credit rating agencies.

23. Other financial liabilities 
Other financial liabilities consist of lease incentives, and in 2012 a bank loan for £594,000.  
The borrowings are repayable as follows: 
The amounts included above are not considered to be materially different from the present value of their carrying amounts. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generation by its operations and applying cash collection targets throughout the Group. 
Investment is carefully controlled, with authorisation limits operating up to Group Board level and cash payback periods applied as part of the 
investment appraisal process. In this way the Group aims to maintain a good credit rating to facilitate fund raising. 
In its funding strategy, the Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of overdrafts, bank 
loans, finance leases and hire purchase contracts. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities by 
continually monitoring cash flows and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities. 
The Group is inherently a net generator of cash at the operating level. Excess cash used in managing liquidity is only invested in financial instruments 
exposed to insignificant risk of changes in market value, being placed on interest-bearing deposit with maturities no more than 12 months allowed  
per the policy. Short term flexibility is achieved by overdraft facilities. 
24. Provisions 
The warranty and commercial disputes provision represents management’s best estimate of the Group’s liability related to claims against product 
warranties or commercial sales agreements. The timing of the utilisation of this provision is uncertain.

31. Operating lease arrangements 
At the balance sheet date, the Group had outstanding commitments for future minimum lease payments under non-cancellable operating leases, 
which fall due as follows: 
The operating leases in respect of fixtures, fittings and equipment extend over a period of up to six years.  
32. Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share option scheme 
The Company’s share option schemes are open to all employees of the Group. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted market 
price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. The standard vesting period is three years.  
An option granted under the Xaar plc 2004 Share Option Plan before 2011 will be exercisable over shares with a market value at the date of grant not 
exceeding a person’s annual salary if at the third anniversary of grant the EPS growth of the Company since grant has exceeded the growth in the 
Retail Prices Indent (RPI) over the same period by at least 12%. To the extent that an option relates to shares with a market value as at the date of 
grant in excess of a person’s annual salary, the option will be exercisable over all of the excess shares if EPS growth over this period has exceeded 
RPI growth by at least 15%. For EPS performance between these two points, options will be exercisable over the excess shares on a sliding scale. In 
addition, options can only be exercised if EPS is at least 5.5p for the financial year preceding the third anniversary of grant. Performance may be 
retested once only from the date of grant to the fourth or fifth anniversary of grant (at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee), but the original 
EPS growth targets will be increased from 12/15% to 16/20% and 20/25% respectively. The 5.5p target will apply for the final financial year in the 
extended period. 
An option granted under the Xaar plc 2004 Share Option Plan from 2011 onwards will be exercisable over shares with a market value at the date of 
grant not exceeding a person’s annual salary, if at the third anniversary of grant, Xaar plc has achieved positive adjusted profit before tax as shown in 
the consolidated income statement in the Company’s Annual Report and Accounts for any of the three years ending during the vesting period. One 
third of the shares subject to the option granted rounded to the nearest whole share, will vest based on the performance condition being met per year 
for each of the three years ending in the vesting period. If the adjusted profit before tax as shown in the consolidated income statement in Xaar plc’s 
Annual Report and Accounts for any relevant year is restated before the option becomes exercisable, the restated figure shall, unless the 
Remuneration Committee determines otherwise, be applied in determining whether the above targets are met. In addition, options shall only become 
exercisable in respect of any shares if the committee in its absolute discretion determines that the overall financial performance of Xaar plc over the 
performance period is satisfactory. 
The Xaar 2007 Share Save Scheme provides an opportunity to all UK employees to save a set monthly amount (currently up to £250) over three years 
towards the exercise of a discounted share option, which is granted at the start of the three years.  
The Xaar Share Incentive Plan provides an opportunity for all UK employees to buy shares from their pre-tax remuneration up to the limit permitted by 
the relevant tax legislation (£1,500 per year for the 2013/2014 tax year) and are awarded additional shares for free on a matching basis; the Company 
currently operates the plan on the basis of a 1:1 match but may award matching shares up to the maximum ratio permitted by the relevant tax 
legislation (currently a 2:1 ratio).  
Options and awards under the Xaar 2007 Share Save Scheme and Xaar Share Incentive Plan are not subject to performance conditions. 
If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, or 42 months in the case of the Share Save Scheme, or five years 
in the case of the Share Incentive Plan (being the contractual lives), the options expire. Save as permitted in the share option scheme rules, options 
lapse on an employee leaving the Group.

32. Share-based payments continued 
Equity-settled share option scheme continued 
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was £6.42 (2012: £2.38). The options 
outstanding at 31 December 2013 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of eight years (2012: six years). In 2013, options were granted  
on 17 April and 1 November. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is £0.78 million. In 2012, options were 
granted on 1 May, 18 October and 1 November. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is £0.76 million.  
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over periods ranging from the previous one to three 
years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise 
restrictions and behavioural considerations. 
Long Term Incentive Plan 
The Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan is open to all employees of the Group. As at 31 December 2013 all unvested LTIP share awards are subject 
to the achievement of EPS performance conditions, as follows: 
The number of shares that vest will depend on the EPS growth of the Company for the three financial years of the Company commencing on  
1 January of the year of grant. 
(1) None of the Awards will vest if the Company’s EPS growth does not exceed growth in the Retail Prices Index (RPI) by at least  
4% compound p.a. 
(2) 35% of the Awards will vest if the Company’s EPS growth exceeds growth in the RPI by at least 4% compound p.a. 
(3) All of the Awards will vest if the Company’s EPS growth exceeds growth in the RPI by at least 10% compound p.a. 
(4)  Awards will vest on a straight-line basis for EPS growth in excess of growth in the RPI of between 4% and 10% compound p.a. 
Awards that will vest will be calculated on a straight-line basis.  
All awards made under this scheme are exercisable within three to ten years after the date of grant. Save as permitted in the Long Term Incentive Plan 
rules, awards lapse on an employee leaving the Group. 
Key individuals are invited to participate in a bonus matching scheme where matching LTIP share awards are granted when the employee invests their 
bonus in Xaar shares and retains ownership of these shares for the duration of the LTIP share award vesting period. The matching share award is a 1 
for 1 match on the pre-tax value of the bonus used to acquire bonus investment shares. Matching LTIP share awards are subject to the same 
performance criteria as all other LTIP awards.

Details of Performance Share Awards outstanding during the year are as follows: 
In 2013, Performance Share Awards were made on 2 April and 15 May. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of grants made on those dates is 
£2.1 million. In 2012, Performance Share Awards were made on 2 April and 1 May. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of grants made on 
those dates is £1.3 million. 
The estimated fair values for 2010 grants onwards were calculated using the Black-Scholes model, whereas the estimated fair value of 2009 grants 
were calculated using a stochastic (Monte-Carlo binomial) model. The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 
The Group recognised total expenses of £2,103,000 and £1,358,000 related to all equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2013 and 
2012, respectively. 
33. Retirement benefit schemes 
Defined contribution schemes 
The UK-based employees of the Group’s UK companies have the option to be members of a defined contribution pension scheme managed by a 
third party pension provider. For each employee who is a member of the scheme the Company will contribute a fixed percentage of each employee’s 
salary to the scheme. The only obligation of the Group with respect to this scheme is to make the specified contributions. 
The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in Sweden are members of a state managed retirement benefit scheme operated by the Government  
of Sweden. The subsidiaries are required to contribute a specified percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to fund the benefits. 
The only obligation of the Group with respect to the retirement benefit scheme is to make the specified contributions. 
The total cost charged to the income statement in respect of these schemes during 2013 was £1,096,000 (2012: £847,000). As at 31 December 
2013 contributions of £191,000 (2012: £100,000) due in respect of the current reporting period had not been paid over to the schemes. 
 
34. Related party transactions 
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed 
in this note.

108 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
1. Significant accounting policies 
Basis of accounting 
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law. 
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year. 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption of FRS 8 “Related party disclosures” not to show transactions with other companies 
in the Group headed by Xaar plc. 
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption in paragraph 2D of FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure’ and not disclosed information 
required by that standard as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures for 
the Group under IFRS 7 “Financial Disclosures”. 
Own shares 
Own shares are deducted from equity. No gain or loss is recognised in the profit and loss account on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation 
of the Company’s own shares. 
Share-based payments 
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 “Share-based payment”. In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been 
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1 January 2005. 
The Company issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. These payments are measured at fair value (excluding the effect  
of non-market based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-based payments  
is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of the shares that will eventually vest and adjusted for 
the effect of non-market based vesting conditions. 
The fair value of options issued under the Company’s Long Term Incentive Plan is measured using a stochastic (Monte Carlo binominal) model for 
grants made between 2007 and 2009 inclusive. The fair value of all other equity-settled share-based payments is measured using the Black-Scholes 
pricing model. 
Taxation 
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.  
Deferred taxation is provided in full on timing differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, 
at a future date, at rates expected to apply when the timing differences crystallise based on current tax rates and law. Timing differences arise from the 
inclusion of items of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different from those in which they are included in financial statements. 
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not discounted. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries are shown at cost less provision for impairment.  
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration, including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by reference 
to the nominal value only of the shares issued. Any premium is ignored. 
Bonds with fixed or determinable payments and fixed maturity dates that the Group has the positive intent and ability to hold to maturity are classified 
as held-to-maturity investments and are measured at amortised cost using effective interest method less any impairment. 
2. Profit for the year 
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the year. 
Xaar plc reported a profit for the financial year ended 31 December 2013 of £9,411,000 (2012: £4,342,000), which includes a dividend received from 
Xaar Technology Limited of £10,000,000 (2012: £6,000,000). 
The average number of employees throughout 2013 was 42 (2012: 32). Staff costs amounted to £2.3 million (2012: £2.6 million). Information about 
the remuneration of Directors is provided in the audited part of the Directors’ remuneration report on page 46 of the consolidated financial statements. 
The audit fee for the audit of the Company’s annual accounts in 2013 was £22,000 (2012: £19,000).   Governance Financial statements Strategic report

9. Share-based payments 
Equity-settled share option scheme 
The Company’s share option schemes are open to all employees of the Company. Options are exercisable at a price equal to the average quoted 
market price of the Company’s shares on the date of grant. The vesting period is three years. The vesting criteria of these options are disclosed 
in note 32 to the consolidated financial statments. If the options remain unexercised after a period of ten years from the date of grant, 42 months in the 
case of the Share Save Scheme, or five years in the case of the Share Incentive Plan, the options expire. Save as permitted in the share option 
scheme rules, options lapse on an employee leaving the Company. 
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows: 
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for share options exercised during the period was £5.81 (2012: £2.52). The options 
outstanding at 31 December 2013 had a weighted average remaining contractual life of six years (2012: five years). In 2013, options were granted on 
17 April and 1 November. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is £48,000. In 2012, options were granted 
on 1 May, 18 October and 1 November. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on those dates is £97,000. 
The performance conditions relating to the above share options and the exercise prices of options outstanding at the year end are given in note 32 to 
the consolidated financial statements. 
The inputs into the Black-Scholes model are as follows: 
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Company’s share price over periods ranging from the previous one  
to three years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, 
exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

Notes 
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting is also entitled to appoint one or more proxies to attend and, on a show of hands or on a poll, 
vote instead of him. Where more than one proxy is appointed, each proxy must be appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or 
shares held by the appointing shareholder. The proxy need not be a member of the Company. 
2. To be effective, the instrument appointing a proxy and any authority under which it is executed (or a notarially certified copy of such authority) must 
be deposited at the office of the Company’s registrars not less than 48 hours before the time for holding the meeting or adjourned meeting. A form 
of proxy is enclosed with this notice. Completion and return of the form of proxy will not preclude ordinary shareholders from attending and voting 
in person. 
3. Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 to enjoy information rights (a 
‘Nominated Person’) may, under an agreement between him/her and the shareholder by whom he/she was nominated, have a right to be 
appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the AGM. If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not 
wish to exercise it, he/she may, under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights. 
4. The statement of the rights of shareholders in relation to the appointment of proxies in paragraphs 1 and 2 above does not apply to Nominated 
Persons. The rights described in these paragraphs can only be exercised by shareholders of the Company. 
5. In accordance with Regulation 41 of the Uncertified Securities Regulations 2001, the Company specifies that only those members entered on the 
register of members of the Company as at 9.30am on 12 May 2014 (or in the event the meeting is adjourned, on the register of members 48 
hours before the time of any adjourned meeting) shall be entitled to attend or vote at the meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in 
their name at that time. Changes to entries on the register of members after 9.30am on 12 May 2014 (or in the event the meeting is adjourned, on 
the register of members less than 48 hours before the time of any adjourned meeting) shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person 
to attend or vote at the meeting.

116 Xaar plc Annual Report and Accounts 2013 
6. Copies of Directors’ service agreements, the terms of appointment of Non-Executive Directors, the register of Directors’ interests kept by the 
Company under section 808 of the Companies Act 2006, the Xaar plc 2004 Share Option Plan, the Xaar plc 2007 Share Save Plan and the Xaar 
plc 2007 Long Term Incentive Plan will be available 15 minutes prior to the commencement of the meeting and will remain open and accessible 
during the continuance of the meeting to any person attending the meeting. 
7. Biographical details of all Directors offering themselves for reappointment are set out on pages 30 and 31 of the annual report and accounts. 
8. Shareholders should note that it is possible that, pursuant to requests made by shareholders of the Company under section 527 of the 
Companies Act 2006, the Company may be required to publish on a website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the audit of the 
Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid before the AGM; or (ii) any circumstance 
connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts and reports were laid in 
accordance with section 437 of the Companies Act 2006. The Company may not require the shareholders requesting any such website 
publication to pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of the Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required to place a 
statement on a website under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006, it must forward the statement to the Company’s auditor not later than the 
time when it makes the statement available on the website. The business which may be dealt with at the AGM includes any statement that the 
Company has been required under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on a website. 
9. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place at the meeting so that: (i) if a corporate 
shareholder has appointed the chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all of 
the other corporate representatives for that shareholder at the meeting, then on a poll those corporate representatives will give voting directions to 
the chairman and the chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance with those directions; and (ii) if more than 
one corporate representative for the same corporate shareholder attends the meeting but the corporate shareholder has not appointed the 
chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate 
representatives who attend, who will vote on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate 
representative. Corporate shareholders are referred to in the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and Administrators on 
proxies and corporate representatives (www.icsa.org.uk) for further details of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of appointment 
letter if the chairman is being appointed as described in (i) above. 
10. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service may do so by using the 
procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST Personal Members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who 
have appointed a service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate 
action on their behalf. 
11. In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST message (a ‘CREST Proxy 
Instruction’) must be properly authenticated in accordance with CRESTCo’s specifications, and must contain the information required for such 
instruction, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment 
to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent (ID 
RA10) by 9.30am on 12 May 2014. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp applied to 
the message by the CREST Application Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to CREST in the manner 
prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee 
through other means. 
12. CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors, or voting service providers should note that CRESTCo does not make available 
special procedures in CREST for any particular message. Normal system timings and limitations will, therefore, apply in relation to the input of 
CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST Personal 
Member, or sponsored member, or has appointed a voting service provider, to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) 
take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this 
connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting system providers are referred, in particular, to those 
sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. 
13. The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001. 
14. As at 7.00am on 18 March 2014 (the date of publication of this Notice), the Company’s issued share capital comprised 76,096,766 Ordinary 
shares of 10p each. Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at a general meeting of the Company, except for the shares held in trust for 
the Xaar Share Incentive Plan totalling 52,894 shares and, therefore, the total number of voting rights in the Company as 7.00am on 18 March 
2014 is 76,043,872.  
15. Any member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions. The Company must answer any such question relating to the business being 
dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if: (a) to do so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve 
the disclosure of confidential information; (b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question; or (c) it is 
undesirable in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.

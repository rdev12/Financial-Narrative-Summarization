The Wolseley Group 
is the world’s number one
distributor of heating and
plumbing products and 
is a leading supplier of
building materials to the
professional market
Wolseley is a unique business. No other organisation,
anywhere in the world, is truly comparable.
Where many distributors are nationally focused, 
we cross geographies. Where they may concentrate 
on narrow product lines, we distribute a diverse 
range to meet a wide spectrum of needs.
Our customers are drawn from across the industry; 
self-employed contractors, large construction 
businesses and governments all depend on 
Wolseley’s expertise.
We meet the demands of these customers by 
providing the products and services they need, 
when and where they need them, at prices that 
help them to achieve their objectives.

Chairman
WO10065_01-43  12/10/04  11:14 am  Page 06 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 07 Chairman’s statement
One year ago, in my first statement to you as Chairman, I said that it was
clear that the Wolseley strategy was delivering shareholder value. Twelve
months on, I am pleased to preface an Annual Report and Accounts that
documents the most successful year in the Company’s history. 
We continue to meet customer needs through strong businesses operating
in local markets across Europe and North America. The Board is particularly
pleased with the Group’s performance in the UK, USA and Ireland. Across
these countries, we have worked with considerable success to fully reap
the benefits of market conditions.
Elsewhere in this report you will find details of the Group’s core strategy,
which remains at the heart of the Wolseley business. This strategy is a 
real and practical policy, which our management is actively implementing
with commitment and expertise in every corner of our organisation.
Charlie Banks and his fellow Executive Directors lead the management
team with vision and energy. This ranges from implementing a Group-wide
information technology project that will transform our infrastructure and 
our potential for improvement, through to exploiting growth opportunities 
in the marketplace be they organic or by acquisition.
The Group is increasingly recognised by our peers and external
commentators for our consistently strong financial performance, 
as well as for our leading role in the marketplace.
This year our results have been particularly impressive despite weaknesses
in the US dollar and in some of the economies of Continental Europe.
From an international perspective, we have continued to promote the
Wolseley name and I look forward to our brand not only being increasingly
recognised as the authority on building materials distribution across all 
the countries in which we operate, but also representing the generation 
of shareholder value.
Dividend
With our earnings per share before goodwill amortisation rising to 
74.84 pence, the Board is recommending a final dividend of 16.0 pence,
which represents a total dividend for the year of 23.8 pence. This is an
increase of 12.3 per cent over the total dividend paid last year.
The Board
There have been four major changes to your Board during the year.
John Allan reluctantly decided that the demands of his Chief Executive role
at Exel plc, together with a range of new industry responsibilities, meant that
he was no longer able to fulfil his Non Executive duties. Jacques Descours
left the Board on 7 October 2004 in anticipation of his expected retirement
from Wolseley France in 2005. I would like to thank both John and Jacques
for their insight and active contributions that each has brought to the Board
over the last few years and wish them every success in the future.
During the year we were delighted to welcome Nigel Stein and Andrew Duff
to the Board as Non Executive Directors. Appointed on 1 December 2003,
and subsequently joining the audit committee, Nigel is Finance Director of
GKN plc. Andrew was appointed on 1 July 2004 and is a member of the
remuneration and nominations committees. Following 14 years at BP plc, 
he is Chief Executive of RWE npower. I look forward to working closely 
with both of them and am confident that they will bring new skills and
experiences to the Board.
The issue of corporate governance has continued to exercise the minds 
of the business community and I am pleased to report that Gareth Davis 
has now taken on the role of Senior Independent Non Executive Director. 
In common with many other UK companies with US listings, we are finding
that we need to put significant time and effort into complying with the
requirements of the US Sarbanes-Oxley Act. We are formalising many internal
processes and are ensuring that they are documented in a form that can 
be externally verified. We are on track to comply with the requirements in 
this financial year.
In conclusion, I would like to thank all of our stakeholders for their support
over the past year. From suppliers, customers and investors, we rely 
on your goodwill and commitment as we strive to maintain our record of
double-digit growth. I must reserve special thanks though for our 50,000
people, each of whom has played their part in making this such a very
successful year for Wolseley.
Together, we face the future with confidence and optimism. Buoyed by 
a strategy that continues to deliver, along with strong management teams 
in our operating businesses who demonstrate leadership as well as
management skill, we will generate further growth and improvement 
as we go forward.

Group Chief Executive’s review
An eighth consecutive 
record year for Wolseley:
High quality businesses
directed by a proven 
strategy and led by 
outstanding managers
I am proud and honoured to report that this has been the eighth consecutive
record year for Wolseley. In 22 of the last 23 years, we have seen either
increased sales or trading profits. Sales and profits stand at record levels 
as we once again produced double-digit growth. On a constant currency
basis, these figures are more impressive still.
What has driven our growth? The principal reason that we have out-performed
the market to a significant degree is due to our focus on high quality businesses
directed by a proven strategy and led by outstanding managers. We are 
also fortunate that a good economic environment in the UK and an improving 
one in the USA have played their part and that the bulk of our business is
generated in these economies. This year’s figures have also benefited from
increased commodity prices, particularly those for lumber, copper and steel.

WO10065_01-43  12/10/04  11:14 am  Page 08 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 09 Group Chief Executive’s review
Meeting customer needs across two continents
Whether they distribute pipes in Ottawa, help 
to fix leaking taps in Provence or sell boilers in
Arkansas, Wolseley companies are high quality
businesses that meet customer needs more
effectively than the competition.
Amongst the investments made during the year was a further expansion 
of our distribution centre network on both continents. In the USA, Ferguson
opened a new distribution centre in Richland, in the state of Washington,
and progress is well underway in expanding two of its existing facilities. 
In France, Brossette has reorganised its branch and distribution network 
to improve operational efficiency. With better distribution to an expanded
network of branches, customers are sure that when they visit one of our
outlets, the products they require will either be in stock or be available in 
the shortest possible time, with most branches receiving next day delivery.
Customers tell us that they want easy access to branches and when they
get there, they want to find the widest possible range of products and
employees who are knowledgeable and well trained in those products and
their applications. Wolseley as a Group is constantly increasing the number
of products available at our branches so that whether a customer needs
building materials, plumbing parts or underground pipes, more can be
obtained from one place. And for those customers who don’t have the
opportunity to visit the branch, we can take orders over the phone, by fax
or through our websites which allows them to order from home and take
delivery of our products to the job site. 
Building for the long-term
Wolseley is not in the business of continuously 
re-inventing itself to achieve short-term gain. 
We remain faithful to the strategy established 
over three years ago and which has proven 
itself as the platform for long-term success. This
strategy includes continuing with the aggressive
branch opening programme, seeking growth 
from acquisitions, investing in infrastructure, and
leveraging the Group’s unique international position.
A key component of the strategy is our target of double-digit growth through
acquisitions and organic growth, which we once again achieved in 2003/4.
In contrast to last year, when our acquisitions included the purchase of the
French business PB & M (formerly Pinault Bois et Matériaux) (“PBM”), at a
cost of some m565 million (£390 million), the last 12 months have witnessed
fewer acquisitions but greater organic growth from existing businesses. As I
mentioned in last year’ s report, the opportunities for acquisitions do not present
themselves in a neat, evenly spread fashion to enable us to hit our target 
for bolt-on acquisitions of £200 million per year. Provided they fit in with our
strategy and meet our financial criteria, we seize them whenever and wherever
they arise, which could mean spending over £500 million, as we did in 2002/3,
or spending considerably less, as is the case with the year under review.
Fifteen acquisitions were completed for an aggregate spend of £124 million
and I relish the prospect of bringing these companies into the Wolseley family.
The most significant purchase in the 2003/4 financial year was the £54 million
acquisition of Tobler, which heralded our entry into the Swiss heating market.
+
23.2
%
> Group sales 
up 23.2% to 
£10.1 billion
With a market share of around 24 per cent, Tobler is Switzerland’s leading
wholesaler for heating, ventilation, air-conditioning and ‘behind the wall’
sanitation products, and is also one of the leading providers of technical
maintenance services. Three further acquisitions were made in Europe, all in
the French building materials sector, at a total cost of £6 million. We continue
to look at opportunities in both Europe and North America, although the
balance in the year under review was weighted towards North America,
where 11 acquisitions were made for a total consideration of £64 million.
Stock Building Supply (“SBS”) acquired four businesses during the year 
for £36 million in total, the largest of which was Bellevue Building Supply of 
New York State. Bellevue operates from seven branches, a distribution centre,
a truss manufacturing centre, a kitchen warehouse and a manufacturing
centre that specialises in doors, stairs, worktops and wall panels.
Another source of growth has been the expansion of our branch network.
Branch numbers worldwide increased by 5.5 per cent to 3,637, with 62 added
through acquisitions and the remaining 126 being net new branch openings. 
In the UK, a net 97 branches were added, bringing the total to 1,513. In
mainland Europe, our branch network now numbers 880, including 30 new
branches. In North America, we welcomed a further 61 branches into the
Group and our network currently stands at 1,244. 
Whilst acquisitions fuel some of the step-changes in our performance,
organic growth delivered by continuous improvement underpins the steady
increase in Group efficiency and profitability. During the year, our companies
completed a number of reorganisations. Ferguson integrated Familian
Northwest, creating one plumbing and heating company across the USA,
while SBS reorganised itself into ten districts and changed the way it
interfaced with suppliers and customers with specialist sector teams set 
up to service, for example, the national house builders. Brossette in France
changed its management structure to enable managers to specialise and
focus on either sales or branch operations and its branch structure was
reorganised to optimise regional infrastructure and synergies. 
WO10065_01-43  12/10/04  11:14 am  Page 09 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 10 Group Chief Executive’s review
Group Chief Executive’s review continued
During the year both the UK and French businesses took the first steps to
moving to new office accommodation to support their national businesses.
For Wolseley UK, this means that ten offices are to close while the move to 
a new head office will create a much more cohesive and efficient management
team, leading all the UK brands.
Investment continues to be made in distribution centres, either with new
sites being constructed as in the case of Richland, USA, which opened 
in November 2003, or through the expansion of existing sites, for example 
at Front Royal and Fort Payne in the USA. 
International leverage
As Wolseley grows, so too does the potential
for leveraging our size and expertise across the
business. During the year, further investment 
was made in our Group’s infrastructure, in logistics,
systems and human resources. In order to support
our ambitious growth targets and as part of our
continuous improvement programme, we are
bringing about greater cohesion across our operating
units through leveraging our international purchasing,
international sourcing and supply chain efficiencies. 
In support of these initiatives, we committed to a major investment 
in a common IT software platform. We have created a dedicated team, 
led by Rob Marchbank, Director of Information and Processes, which 
has appointed PeopleSoft as the key contributor for the project to manage
the implementation of the technology throughout the Group, starting in 2005. 
In the first two years, we expect to spend £30 million, and this investment
marks the beginning of a concerted drive to bring our companies closer
together, allowing them to share resources and work together to streamline
the supply chain and generate new efficiencies. Initially, the IT project is
focusing on a common financial application which will provide all companies
with detailed information, in a consistent way, giving us greater knowledge
and control whilst helping us to address the complex governance issues
which we face in different countries.
A number of other applications are also being developed for the common
IT platform including, for example, a branch warehouse management
package, which is being piloted by some of our plumbing and heating
businesses. Significant benefits are expected to arise over the next 
few years from the Group’s improvement programme, enabled by 
the common IT platform.
The common IT platform investment will leverage our software 
spend ensuring that all operating companies benefit from leading-edge
technology and lower prices. Long term, the IT project will bring even
higher standards of consistency and reliability to Group-wide data and 
key performance indicators. 
As we begin to make our size count, we will be the winners, in terms of
reduced costs, increased efficiency and a better return on our investments.
We will gain from purchasing economies, from international sourcing, 
an increase in the use of our own brand products and economies of 
scale from greater market penetration, and our distribution centre network. 
In addition, our customers will also benefit from access to more products,
which will be supplied with even greater reliability and cost-effectiveness as,
in partnership with our suppliers, we take costs out of the supply chain.
New segments, new geographies
We have continued to implement a strategy 
of diversification, bringing new products to
customers in new geographic areas and in 
new business segments. 
For example, our acquisition of PBM means that Wolseley’s proven
expertise in building materials can now win new customers among French
construction professionals. PBM, which trades under the principal brands
of Reseau Pro and Panofrance, is the natural complement to our Brossette
business, which already meets customer needs in the plumbing and heating
segment. Together, these companies have given us a greater market share
in France and provide a solid platform for future growth. PBM will gain
significant benefits in the year ahead, as they draw on the building materials
and timber expertise of Build Center in the UK and of SBS in the USA.

This expertise in building materials distribution will also be available to 
the Brooks Group, acquired in Ireland after the year-end. The addition 
of building materials and timber distribution to the existing plumbing 
and heating business, Heatmerchants, offers the scale and cross-selling
opportunities already seen in the UK and France.
In terms of geographic diversity, the acquisition of Tobler has given us access
to the important and profitable Swiss marketplace. Tobler currently focuses
on ‘behind the wall’ sanitation, the hidden pipework of a typical bathroom
or plumbing project. Now Tobler is eager to examine ways of selling a more
diverse product offering such as ‘in front of the wall’ products where our
expertise will help them. At the same time, we intend to exploit Tobler’s
knowledge of underfloor heating and, where appropriate, to incorporate 
it into our other businesses.
In 2003/4, SBS expanded into several new cities in the USA. High quality,
cost-effective building materials are now available to customers in cities as
far apart as Los Angeles, California to Boston, Massachusetts and Rush
City, Minnesota to McAllen, Texas.
In the UK, Bathstore.com completed its first full financial year as part of the
Wolseley Group. Where our other UK businesses, such as Plumb Center,
sell to customers through warehouse-style operations, Bathstore.com
enables us to reach a new customer base through a network of stylish, 
up-market showrooms. Over the 12 months, the number of showrooms
has increased from 33 to 58.
Best practice sharing has become a strong feature of the Wolseley culture
in the past year and this has been demonstrated in the way that the
Wolseley UK model of small express branches were piloted at five 
Ferguson locations in the USA. The success of these pilots has resulted 
in the decision to roll-out more than 50 of such “XpressNet” branches in 
the year to 31 July 2005.
People make the difference
What is it that makes Wolseley the company 
it is today? Looking beyond the branches and 
the distribution centres, the products and the
logistics, I believe that it is the quality of our
people that sets us apart. Our customers rely 
on the combined efforts of our 50,000 people 
to provide the right products and services, 
when and where they need them.
Over the last year we have continued to expand our commitment to
developing human resources. We are unique and too large to rely on our
peers to train the talent we need for the future, so we invest considerable
sums to ensure that we attract and retain the brightest people in the industry.
Our Executive Education programmes are delivered by the Darden School 
of Business at the University of Virginia and also by the IMD in Lausanne,
Switzerland. More than 160 senior executives have attended Darden since
2000, while 80 attended IMD in November 2003 alone. We intend to double
our commitment in the coming year, with two programmes scheduled for
each venue. 
Towards the close of the financial year, we launched the European
Graduate Recruitment Programme, under the banner headline of
‘Wolseley: Europe’s best-kept secret’. The Programme complements 
our established graduate initiatives in individual companies, and will
provide us with a pipeline of skilled, multi-lingual professionals able 
to bring a pan-European perspective to our business. 
We have also identified a set of management competencies that will 
help us to improve our performance appraisal processes, assess our
current pool of talent and develop programmes that meet our future
human resources needs. A new programme of long-term international
assignments is enabling our people to share knowledge across national
borders and cultures. The past 12 months have seen a steady flow of
Wolseley managers crossing the Atlantic to apply the lessons learnt in 
one business to the challenges faced in another.
More efficient, lower cost, enhanced margins
We have enjoyed a tremendous year but there is
always room for improvement. At the heart of the
Wolseley culture is the desire to create innovative
solutions for our customers. Armed with expertise
gained through experience in 13 countries, we
constantly invest in our infrastructure in the hunt
for more efficient, lower cost and better ways 
of working, which enhance our margins. 
One of the highlights of the year under review was the inaugural Wolseley
Cup, a new internal competition aimed at generating and circulating
innovative thinking. As we get bigger, we need to leverage our creativity
and resources, and the high quality of the Cup presentations demonstrated
what we can do when we begin to share and work together. The following
pages detail just six of the ways in which we are providing innovative new
solutions for our customers, including the winning Wolseley Cup entry
from our Ferguson business in the USA, together with those from the
two runners-up: Wolseley Canada and Wolseley UK.
The ideas that sprang forth from the Cup are practical as well 
as inspirational. These are real examples of how innovation and
commitment are transforming the way in which we work. Great ideas
have to be nurtured if they are to fulfil their full potential, so I have asked
all seven Cup finalists to update the evaluation committee on their
progress and compete in a new competition, the Graduate Cup.
Next year’s Wolseley Cup will reflect our increased focus on human
resources and focus on achievements which have promoted our 
people recruitment, retention and development throughout the Group.

diversification, and are investing significantly in the human and

Enhancing our
business diversity
Construction, plumbing and heating professionals depend on Wolseley 
for the timely and reliable delivery of a vast range of products. We aim 
to increase their choice through a strategy of diversification: of geography;
of lines of business; and of products and services. This diversity has enabled
us to achieve a more resilient business performance over a variety of
different economic cycles.
Developing our 
human resources
We rely on our people on the ground to drive sales. We continue to 
expand our commitment to developing human resources, ensuring that 
we attract and retain the best and the brightest people. Our efforts include
the establishment of a programme of management development at IMD 
in Switzerland and Darden School of Management in the USA, and the
introduction of our European Graduate Recruitment Programme.
Creating innovative solutions
to meet our customers’ 
changing needs
We invest resources in anticipating customers’ changing needs, and also 
in creating new and better ways of meeting those needs. We encourage
innovation within Wolseley and remain flexible and open to new ideas 
at all levels of the business. During the year, we launched the Wolseley 
Cup to reward innovation within our businesses. This award will be given
annually to a team from within Wolseley that develops the most innovative
and beneficial concepts that support the key business focus for that year.
The focus for 2004 was to provide enhanced value for our customers;
examples of our businesses’ response to this challenge can be found 
in this report.
A proven strategy delivering measurable results
And here are some
examples of what
we are doing...
Our strategy has played a key role in helping
Wolseley companies achieve both short and 
long-term success. The strategy has six key
components:
Growing through acquisition
and organic growth
Our target is double-digit growth, year on year. We aim to achieve this
through a combination of organic growth including new branch openings
and acquisitions. We continually monitor and evaluate possible acquisitions,
paying particular attention to evidence of a sound financial position and 
the ability of the target company to grow.
Continuous improvement
Although we set the highest standards in terms of sustained growth 
and profitability, we are never complacent. The pursuit of double-digit
growth demands continuous improvement from all Wolseley businesses.
For example, we have a number of business change programmes 
in place such as organisational restructurings in the USA, France and 
the UK, and investment in our distribution centre network. Our investment
in the common IT platform will support these and other business 
initiatives, including global sourcing, international procurement and 
supply chain efficiencies.
Leveraging our
international position
With 3,637 branches in 13 countries, we have access to a tremendous
fund of experience and expertise that we are increasingly leveraging in
order to share benefits across the business. We plan to develop a diverse
footprint through an international supply chain, the establishment of
synergies across our European businesses, increased global sourcing 
and international purchasing. This includes the increasing use of own 
brand products and the transfer of ideas from one country to another, 
such as the establishment of our express stores, “XpressNet” in the 
USA based on the successful UK format.

in Rhode Island
Guy Clermont
GEM Plumber
With its stores operation hampered by lack of
choice, poor availability and extensive waiting
time, GEM Plumbing was a typical Rhode Island
plumbing business. But where others could 
see only inevitability and working methods cast 
in stone, the team from our US plumbing and
heating division, Ferguson, identified opportunity.
Working with our Integrated Systems Division,
which operates warehousing functions for major
customers such as General Electric, Johnson &
Johnson and General Motors, Ferguson designed
an internal ‘joint venture’ for GEM. We now run
the warehouse and manage all supply chain
logistics for GEM, leaving GEM free to focus on 
its core business: fixing the leaks and servicing
the boilers in Providence, Rhode Island.
WO10065_01-43  12/10/04  11:14 am  Page 14 At Wolseley, people are encouraged 
to be innovative and to put their ideas 
into practice.
At GEM, the time that the firm’s technicians
spend waiting for parts has been reduced by
50 per cent. And the company is therefore
able to complete several more jobs in an
average day. 
For Ferguson, the local branch has seen 
sales increase by 23 per cent, and from a
standing start, we now have a 65 per cent
share of GEM’s business. We are also paid 
an additional fee for managing the warehouse.

WO10065_01-43  12/10/04  11:14 am  Page 15 At Wolseley, we constantly strive to create new
and better ways of meeting customer needs.
We work with our customers, not just for them,
to help them achieve their business objectives.
For customers on the pilot scheme, such as
Apollo Heating Limited, the wireless solution
generates a total overview of workforce activity
and job progress. Work can be planned,
tracked and billed more efficiently.
For the engineers, the PDA is a hand-held tool
that helps to eliminate wasted trips and queues
at parts stores. The device can access the
Wolseley UK parts database, transmit data 
to head office and notify job completion 
via Signature Capture. It even incorporates 
a camera, which can be used for parts
identification.
For Wolseley UK, the wireless solution
underpins the company’s reputation for
innovation and service and is a platform 
for building long-term relationships with 
key customers.

Steven Maclean
Finance Director of 
Apollo Heating Limited
The management of remote workforces has long been an issue in the
construction and maintenance industries. Employee downtime is a key
aspect of cost management and the monitoring of productive time is difficult.
Wolseley UK has a long history of implementing innovative technology
solutions that bring significant benefits to customers. Since 1999, the
company has launched eight transactional websites and also introduced 
a fully-integrated XML trading platform for suppliers and customers. Building
on this experience and expertise, and working in partnership with O
2
and
ESB, Wolseley UK has developed a wireless solution that utilises PDA
technology to enable customers to manage their remote workforce more
effectively. Engineers are now linked directly to their office network so jobs
can be scheduled and tracked throughout the day.

Ferguson products,

travelling 83 miles
to the nearest
Ferguson branch
As more than 13 million people discover every year, the Myrtle Beach
coastline in South Carolina is a great location for a holiday. For motorists, 
it is the second-most popular resort destination in America. Unfortunately, 
the vehicles that they bring with them congest the county’s roads to such 
an extent that the journey to the nearest Ferguson branch is simply not
feasible for plumbing and heating contractors based around Little River. 
Instead of encouraging customers to go to Ferguson, we brought Ferguson
to them, via a unique partnership with our Stock Building Supply (SBS)
business. The SBS branch in Little River was refurbished to incorporate 
a dedicated area for a Ferguson Express branch, including signage, 
display racking, a sales counter and a separate customer entrance.
WO10065_01-43  12/10/04  11:14 am  Page 18 The new joint SBS/Ferguson branch in Little River is winning new business for both
organisations. Customers are now able to source plumbing and heating supplies from
the same location that they pick up lumber and hardware. And they can do so quickly
and conveniently without battling through the traffic on Highway 31.
For SBS, the re-modelled branch is more customer-focused and efficient, with counter
sales rising by 20 per cent. For Ferguson, the advantages include access to a previously
untapped market at a cost that is around 50 per cent less than a comparable store
opening in a new market.

The opportunity to provide customers with what they want, where and 
when they want it, is a key driver for Wolseley. Wherever we find that these
demands are not being met, we endeavour to create an appropriate solution.
Our m565 million (£390 million) acquisition of PBM in July 2003 meant that, 
for the first time, French customers could access building materials as well 
as plumbing and heating products from Wolseley companies.
PBM, which trades under the principal brands of Reseau Pro and Panofrance, 
is an established player in the building materials and timber sector, and the
perfect complement to our Brossette business, which focuses on plumbing,
heating and sanitaryware supplies.

for Houle Plumbing &
Heating of Brockville
Canada is a huge country where logistics can
present major difficulties, especially during the
winter months. So when Houle Plumbing &
Heating of Brockville, Ottawa, moved onto a 
site that was a considerable distance from their
office and our locations, materials deliveries would
traditionally be accompanied by extensive delays
and significant costs. 
We developed a mobile warehouse concept that 
is as simple as it is effective. Housed in a secure,
custom-fitted trailer, the warehouse gives the
Houle technicians instant access to the parts 
that they need. 
WO10065_01-43  12/10/04  11:14 am  Page 22 We work hard to devise services that bring benefits to customers as well as to ourselves.
Now being rolled-out across other Canadian territories, the mobile warehouse allows customers
on remote sites to work as efficiently as if they were next door to their main office. There’s no
unnecessary travelling, no interruptions for ad-hoc deliveries and less paperwork. The trailer even
incorporates fax and phone facilities. And if the weather deteriorates, technicians can move inside
to carry out simple pre-fabrication work.
For Wolseley Canada, the concept is winning new business and also delivering operational
efficiencies, including reduced freight costs. The trailer also acts like a giant billboard promoting
the company far and wide across Canada.

will be able to reap the benefits as the Tobler team shares in our global best practice initiatives.
Increased choice, greater efficiency and lower costs will all become available, both across the
trade counter and at the click of a mouse.
For the Wolseley Group, we are able to move into a new country and build a new customer base.
There is also the opportunity to enhance product diversity across the business by exploiting Tobler’s
expertise in alternative energy systems and, in particular, in underfloor heating.

Managing Director 
of Karl Waechter Ing
With the purchase of Swiss company Tobler for £54 million in December 2003,
we acquired a company that was already building a reputation for outstanding
customer service.
Tobler offers around 47,000 items across the key sectors of comfort heating
systems: heat generation, heat distribution and ‘behind the wall’ sanitation
products. It is the clear leader in this sector, with a 24 per cent market share.
The company also has proven capability in underfloor heating systems, 
a product line that currently heats around 80 per cent of Swiss homes 
and something that has great potential elsewhere in the Wolseley Group. 
In addition, Tobler has a fine reputation in alternative energy such as solar
panels and rainwater systems.
Tobler’s 9,500 plumbing and heating trade customers access Tobler products
via three sales channels: logistics and regional centres which serve the sales
organisation; strategically located pick-up points; and, increasingly, an e-shop
through which they can place orders 24 hours a day.

Dynamics of the business
The principal business drivers relating to each of the three business
segments are shown below:
Financial targets
The Group’s overall financial objective is to increase shareholder value by
achieving, on average, double-digit growth in its sales, profits and earnings
per share each year whilst producing an incremental return on gross capital
employed of 4 per cent in excess of the pre-tax weighted average cost of
capital. The Group’s key performance indicators are as follows:

REVIEW OF OPERATIONS
GROUP PERFORMANCE
Overall results
The trading results for the year ended 31 July 2004 are a record for the
Group for an eighth consecutive year. These results reflect both strong 
organic growth and the additional contribution from acquisitions. Each of
the principal businesses increased market share. Benefits have also been
gained from the restructuring of certain activities within the Group which
have improved market focus and increased operational efficiency.
In US Plumbing and Heating, organic sales growth of around 15 per cent,
including the beneficial effects of commodity price inflation, was achieved.
The UK, French, Italian and Canadian businesses also performed well 
in their markets. The US Building Materials Distribution division (“SBS”)
performed particularly strongly with an increase in organic sales of nearly 
26 per cent as a result of its restructuring programme and higher lumber 
and structural panel prices.
Trading margin improvements were achieved in the North American Plumbing
and Heating and US Building Materials Divisions. European Distribution’s
trading margin was down slightly, primarily due to the inclusion for the first
time of PBM, which has a lower margin than the divisional average, and 
as a result of higher central costs allocated to the division. Improvements 
in trading margin were, however, seen in the UK, French, Austrian, Italian
and Luxembourg businesses. During this year the Group achieved its
financial targets in respect of sales and profit growth and in addition saw 
an improvement in both its key ratios of return on capital and working
capital to sales.

Operating and financial review continued
Turnover
After taking account of currency translation, Group sales increased 
by 23.2 per cent from £8,221.0 million to £10,128.1 million.
Operating profit
Operating profit increased by 31.0 per cent from £443.0 million to
£580.2 million. Trading profit rose by 30.9 per cent from £472.9 million 
to £619.2 million, before deducting goodwill amortisation of £39.0 million
(2003: £29.9 million).
Currency translation
Currency translation has had a significant impact on the Group’s reported
sterling results for the year compared to the previous year, reducing 
Group sales by £400.1 million (4.9 per cent) and Group trading profit by
£21.5 million (4.5 per cent). Over the past five years the constant currency
growth of the Group is as follows:
2004 2003 2002 2001 2000
Annual sales growth in 
constant currency 29.5% 8.5% 11.0% 6.4% 15.4%
The effect of US dollar depreciation has been to reduce translated US profits
by £23.5 million (5.0 per cent) compared to 2003. US dollar denominated
profits account for around 55 per cent of the Group’s trading profit. 
The strengthening of the Euro has partly mitigated the currency effect, 
with Euro denominated profits accounting for around 18 per cent of Group
trading profit. If the results of the Group are translated into US dollars at the
average rate for the appropriate year, the results of the Group are as follows:
US$ million 2004 2003 2002 2001 2000
Sales 17,746 13,113 11,608 10,407 10,141
Trading profit 1,085 754 676 599 611
Operating profit 1,017 707 637 573 591
Further US$ figures can be found within the Information in US dollars section
on page 90.
Interest
Net interest payable of £21.1 million (2003: £17.0 million) reflects an increase
in the interest payable on Group debt as a result of acquisitions and an
increase in working capital principally in the USA, offset by the effect of
lower interest rates on the Group’s borrowings compared to the prior year.
Interest cover was 27 times (2003: 26 times).
Tax
The effective tax rate reduced from 28.0 per cent to 27.1 per cent and 
it is expected that this will be the rate for the next financial year, provided 
the geographical contributions to profits remain broadly similar and there
are no significant changes to tax legislation.
Earnings per share
Before goodwill amortisation, earnings per share increased by 32.0 per cent
from 56.69 pence to 74.84 pence. Basic (FRS 3) earnings per share were up
by 32.3 per cent to 68.15 pence (2003: 51.53 pence). The average number
of shares in issue during the year was 582.6 million (2003: 579.1 million). 
Dividends
The Board is recommending a final dividend of 16.0 pence per share 
(2003: 15.6 pence per share) to be paid on 30 November 2004 to
shareholders registered on 8 October 2004. The small increase in the final
dividend reflects, as announced at the interim results, the rebalancing of 
the split of the total dividend paid so that a greater proportion, approximately
one-third, is paid at the interim stage. The total dividend for the year 
of 23.8 pence per share is an increase of 12.3 per cent on last year’s 
21.2 pence. Dividend cover is 2.9 times. The increase in dividend for the
year reflects the Board’s confidence in the future prospects of the Group
and its strong financial position. The dividend reinvestment plan will
continue to be available to eligible shareholders.
Acquisitions
The level of acquisition spend in each division will vary each year as
opportunities arise. Following is a chart which shows the acquisition 
spend in each division over the last five years:

Acquisitions by segment
The Group continues to seek acquisitions to expand all areas of its
activities. A total of 15 acquisitions were completed during the year.
Acquisition spend during the period, including any deferred consideration
and debt, amounted to £123.5 million (2003: £512.5 million). The
acquisitions within each division, together with their likely contribution 
to turnover in a full year, may be summarised as follows:
Full year 
Spend contribution 
£m £m
European Distribution 59.5 117.2
North American Plumbing and Heating Distribution 28.1 94.7
US Building Materials Distribution 35.9 92.9
Total 123.5 304.8
Since the year-end, there have been a further six acquisitions, one of 
which is conditional on court approval, for a combined consideration
of £142.6 million.
The Group’s target remains to spend, on average £200 million per annum
on bolt-on acquisitions. In addition, it is envisaged that, if opportunities
present themselves, a larger acquisition should arise every 2-3 years.
Financial position
Shareholders’ funds increased by £127.7 million from £1,774.2 million 
to £1,901.9 million. The net increase comprised the following elements:
£m
Retained profits 257.9
New share capital subscribed (exercise of share options) 17.0
Exchange translation (147.2)
Increase in shareholders’ funds 127.7
The movement of sterling against overseas currencies, particularly the
US dollar, resulted in a translation difference of £85.0 million which decreased
borrowings on the balance sheet. Net borrowings, excluding construction
loan borrowings, at 31 July 2004 amounted to £941.4 million compared to
£826.7 million at 31 July 2003, giving gearing of 49.5 per cent compared 
to 46.6 per cent at the previous year-end. The increase in borrowings is
primarily due to the acquisition spend of £123.5 million during the year. 
Construction loan receivables, financed by an equivalent amount 
of construction loan borrowings, were £187.7 million compared to
£176.2 million at 31 July 2003. The increase is due to an expanding 
loan book, partly offset by the weaker US dollar. 
Return on capital increased strongly from 16.7 per cent to 18.4 per cent 
as a result of the significant organic growth in profit and the improved
working capital ratio.
The unamortised balance of acquisition goodwill in the balance sheet 
as at 31 July 2004 is £665.9 million (2003: £686.8 million). The decline 
is principally due to the fall in the value of the dollar against sterling, 
and goodwill amortisation, offset by the goodwill arising on acquisitions 
in the year.
Provisions for liabilities and charges in the balance sheet (note 19) include
the estimated liability for asbestos claims on a discounted basis. This liability
has been determined actuarially as at 31 July 2004 by independent
professional advisors. The asbestos related litigation is fully covered by
insurance and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been
included in debtors. The level of insurance cover available significantly
exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash flow
impact is therefore expected to arise in the foreseeable future. There 
were 308 (2003: 484) claims outstanding at the year-end.
Details of the pension schemes operated by the Group are set out in 
note 33 to the accounts. Were FRS 17 to have been fully adopted in 
the accounts at 31 July 2004, shareholders’ funds of £1,901.9 million
would have been reduced by £94.1 million.
The Group is in the process of finalising the triennial actuarial valuation 
as at 1 May 2004 of the UK scheme. It is expected that it will give rise 
to an incremental profit and loss charge under SSAP 24 of approximately
£6 million in the year to 31 July 2005.
Cash flow

Maintenance capex is considered as equivalent to depreciation.
The Group continues to target free cash flow of at least £200 million 
per annum, on average, in order to fund acquisitions and expansion 
capex. In 2004 the high level of organic growth seen across the Group, 
and notably in the US businesses, has required the investment of cash into
a higher level of working capital with a consequent impact on free cash flow.
WO10065_01-43  12/10/04  11:14 am  Page 29 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 30 Operating and financial review
Operating and financial review continued
Net cash flow from operating activities decreased from £607.7 million to
£325.2 million, due to a net absorption of working capital of £401.9 million.
Group inventory levels increased by £274.3 million during the year as a
result of the rapid growth in sales of the North American operations, the
effects of opening an additional distribution centre in the US Plumbing 
and Heating Distribution business, an increase in US inventory levels in
response to the market shortage of copper and steel commodities and 
the effects of inflation on the value of items carried. Creditors increased 
by £108.6 million during the period, compared with an increase of £123.0
million in the previous year. Debtors increased by £236.3 million, compared
with an increase of £32.9 million in the prior year, driven by the growth in sales.
As the rate of sales growth outpaced that of working capital, the working
capital to sales ratio showed a further improvement from 15.4 per cent 
to 15.2 per cent. The targeted working capital ratio remains 15 per cent. 
Net capital expenditure increased by £27.4 million (25.3 per cent) on the 
prior year to £135.6 million reflecting continued investment in the business,
including the new Richland distribution centre in the USA, the new head
office in France, and the initial investments in the new head office for
Wolseley UK and the common IT platform. 
DIVISIONAL PERFORMANCE
European Distribution
The division produced 41.9 per cent (2003: 36.0 per cent) of the 
Group’s turnover and 42.5 per cent (2003: 40.9 per cent) of the 
Group’s trading profit.
The results in the European Distribution division benefited from a number 
of factors with PBM performing well ahead of expectations, another strong
performance in the UK and profit improvements in nearly all of the other
European operations.
Sales for this division increased by 43.7 per cent from £2,956.7 million 
to £4,248.0 million, including £1,093.0 million (37.0 per cent) which relates 
to acquisitions, predominantly PBM in July 2003 and Tobler in December
2003. The organic increase in sales was 5.6 per cent. Trading profit rose 
by 36.2 per cent from £193.2 million to £263.2 million.
Wolseley UK, Brossette in France, Manzardo in Italy, ÖAG in Austria and
CFM in Luxembourg all increased their trading margin, although the overall
divisional trading margin reduced from 6.5 per cent to 6.2 per cent of sales
primarily due to the inclusion for the first time of PBM which has a lower
margin than the divisional average and as a result of higher central costs
allocated to the division.
In the year a further net 127 branches were added to the European network,
giving a total of 2,393 locations (2003: 2,266). 
UK (including Ireland)
Wolseley UK grew strongly during the year as the strength of the UK
economy and housing market continued. The repair, maintenance and
improvement (“RMI”) market remained the principal driver, buoyed by strong
consumer demand against the backdrop of historically low (albeit rising)
interest rates, low unemployment and house price inflation. Sales increased
by 11.5 per cent to £2,106.9 million (2003: £1,888.8 million). Organic growth
was 6.3 per cent, which was in excess of the market generally, with the
plumbing and heating businesses being the strongest performers and
building materials having a strong second half. The commercial and industrial
business improved its position although the sector remained difficult.
The distribution centres continue to support the expanding branch network
through improved efficiency with costs per stock pick down 5 per cent 
over the prior year. These and other operational efficiencies were reflected 
in an improvement in trading margin from 7.6 per cent to 7.8 per cent.
During the period, 97 net new locations were added taking the total 
number of branches for Wolseley UK (including Ireland) to 1,513. Since the
year-end, Brooks Group has been acquired for m183 million (£120 million), 
a leading Ireland based timber and builders merchant with 18 branches
located throughout Ireland.
France
The French construction market started the year nervously, with the
industrial environment weak and high levels of unemployment holding back
consumer confidence. In the second half, however, there were signs of an
improvement with lead indicators such as housing permits and housing starts
increasing and public works and infrastructure projects more evident.

Wolseley’s French operations generated sales of £1,621.5 million, an increase
of £963.2 million compared to the prior year, principally as a result of the
PBM acquisition. 
Local currency sales in Brossette were up 6.0 per cent on the previous 
year due to acquisitions and organic growth of more than 3.0 per cent. 
The trading margin also improved to above 6.0 per cent due to more
stringent cost control and the emerging benefits of the reorganisation 
of Brossette’s branch and management structure which was completed
during the year. The move from a single branch to a multi-branch
organisation is a significant change to the way that Brossette conducts its
business, enabling management specialisation and focus. Further benefits
should result from this in 2005. 
PBM performed above expectations, as a result of the post acquisition
initiatives taken by the Group. Sales and profits were up on the prior year 
in a gradually improving market, although the first half started slowly due to
the heatwave in France in August 2003 and a sluggish timber import market.
Underlying trading margins were higher before absorbing the additional costs
of redundancies and of the branch rebranding programme which was
completed during the year. Working capital management was a particular
area of the post acquisition focus and this showed good progress. The
return on capital for PBM in its first full year was in excess of the Group’s
weighted average cost of capital. PBM is on track in delivering synergies
with other Wolseley Group companies in order to achieve its return target 
of 16.7 per cent by the year ending 31 July 2006.
Rest of Europe 
The Group’s other Continental European operations enjoyed generally 
good results in uninspiring markets. 
Following a number of management changes in Austria, ÖAG performed
well to increase sales and achieve a double-digit trading profit increase,
even though the new housing market remained depressed and increased
competition put pressure on prices. Good progress was made in Hungary
with sales up 17 per cent in local currency and sales in the Czech Republic
were also up slightly. In Italy, despite a weak economy and a fall in the
overall construction and renovation markets, Manzardo’s branch opening
programme helped achieve organic sales growth of more than 9 per cent,
trading profit growth of 30 per cent, and a trading margin above 5 per cent
for the first time. 
In Luxembourg, CFM increased sales by more than 10 per cent and 
further improved the trading margin, demonstrating resilience against 
the fall in the local construction market. Wasco, in The Netherlands, was
adversely affected by the poor economy and lower construction and new
housing expenditure. In response to these market conditions, Wasco has
expanded its product range, moved to a central distribution centre, opened
new express branches and is seeking to expand its small customer base 
in the more profitable RMI market. While sales increased by more than 
10 per cent, additional costs and competitive market conditions led to a fall
in profits. Tobler, in Switzerland, which was acquired on 1 December 2003,
performed ahead of expectations with sales, trading profits and margins up
on the prior year.
The European Distribution division has made good progress during the year
in implementing its strategy to manage the businesses in a more integrated
way across Europe. Several key appointments were made during the year
in marketing, finance and supply chain management, which incorporates
sourcing, procurement and logistics. Additional investment is planned 
over the current year to build further the infrastructure necessary to obtain 
cross-border synergies, facilitate the sharing of best practice and accelerate
the benefits from the growth opportunities that exist. 
North American Plumbing and Heating Distribution
The division produced 37.9 per cent (2003: 43.2 per cent) of the Group’s
turnover and 40.7 per cent (2003: 42.7 per cent) of the Group’s trading
profit. The North American Plumbing and Heating division performed
strongly with significant rises in sales and profits and the highest ever
trading margin. 
Reported sales of the division were up 8.0 per cent from £3,551.5 million 
to £3,836.4 million despite the adverse impact of currency translation.
Trading profit, in sterling, increased by 24.6 per cent from £202.2 million 
to £252.0 million. 
Currency translation reduced divisional sales by £276.8 million (7.8 per cent)
and trading profit by £15.9 million (7.9 per cent). There was a net increase
of 47 branches in North American Plumbing and Heating Distribution to
1,008 locations (2003: 961).
Ferguson
In the USA, Ferguson produced an outstanding performance, generating
strong organic growth and benefiting from commodity price inflation.
Local currency sales in the US plumbing operations rose by 18.0 per cent
to $5,941.1 million (2003: $5,032.8 million) with trading profit up by 
40.3 per cent. Organic sales growth was 15 per cent and included 
the beneficial effects of price inflation in products such as copper, 
steel and plastics. Around 40 per cent of the increase in trading profit was
commodity price driven, with the remainder reflecting an increase in the
gross margin as a result of continuing benefits from the distribution centre
network, a focus on organic growth and operational leverage. 
WO10065_01-43  12/10/04  11:14 am  Page 31 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 32 Operating and financial review
Operating and financial review continued
A new distribution centre was opened at Richland, Washington, in November
2003 and volumes through the distribution centre network as a whole
increased 49 per cent over the prior year. Ferguson’s eighth distribution
centre is planned to open in Iowa in the current financial year. The trading
margin, at 6.8 per cent, was substantially ahead of the prior year 
(2003: 5.7 per cent), and exceeds the 6 per cent target a year ahead 
of the original schedule. 
During the year, the final phases of the integration of Familian Northwest
were completed and the business realised the benefits of having a single
plumbing and heating organisation in the USA, including the elimination 
of duplicated costs. The completion of this integration enables Ferguson
management to focus more attention on the achievement of organic
growth. During the year, the Wolseley UK model of small express branches
was piloted at five Ferguson locations in the USA, including Washington DC
and Boston, and proved to be very successful. A roll-out programme of
similar “XpressNet” branches is planned with more than 50 new locations
expected to open in the year to 31 July 2005. 
Of the sectors in which Ferguson operates, housing related activity held 
up well and the more positive economic environment benefited the RMI
sector. RMI is becoming an increasingly important element of overall
construction spend in the USA and with the new express branch format
being introduced, should lead to further growth opportunities. The commercial
sector started to show some signs of improvement towards the end of 
the year, underpinned by increased government spending. The weakest
segment continues to be industrial, although the energy sector has been
more buoyant as a consequence of higher oil prices. 
Investment in working capital was increased substantially during the year 
to support the significant organic growth that Ferguson achieved, to build
inventory levels at the new distribution centre, as a consequence of the
higher unit cost of materials, and to ensure customer demand was met 
at a time of tightening supply of commodities such as copper and steel. 
Wolseley Canada
Following a slow start to the year in Canada due to external factors, positive
business sentiment returned and once again it proved to be an attractive
business environment. Low interest rates supported a strong residential
market and the buoyant energy sector in Western Canada helped sales 
in the industrial and commercial business. However, the cooler summer
dampened sales in the HVAC/R (heating, ventilation, air conditioning and
refrigeration) business and the strong Canadian dollar has affected sales 
to a number of customers who are dependent on exports. 
Local currency sales increased by 10.7 per cent to more than C$1 billion for
the first time. Around half of the sales increase was organic growth, slightly
ahead of the market. Local currency trading profit rose by nearly 10 per cent,
slower than the sales growth as a result of pricing pressure in some product
areas, the additional costs of restructuring the Industrial Products Group
and the increase in headcount in order to sustain future growth. 
US Building Materials Distribution
The division produced 20.2 per cent (2003: 20.8 per cent) of the Group’s
turnover and 16.8 per cent (2003: 16.4 per cent) of the Group’s trading profit.
The performance of SBS benefited from the completion of the NOVA
restructuring project which improved market focus and resulted in cost
savings in excess of the $5 million originally targeted. Net benefits of at
least $10 million are expected to be achieved in the next financial year and,
more importantly, the reorganisation into 10 districts and the new market
focused approach for example, in its relationship with national house
builders, will build on the improvements already achieved. Plans to increase
the number of value-added products and services being offered and
increase the penetration into the RMI market, are already making inroads,
with value-added sales up 30 per cent on the prior year. 
Average lumber and structural panel prices were higher but the division 
was negatively impacted by currency translation. Reported sales in sterling
grew 19.3 per cent to £2,043.7 million (2003: £1,712.8 million) despite 
an adverse currency impact of £153.6 million (9.0 per cent). The division’s
trading profit was up 34.2 per cent at £104.0 million (2003: £77.5 million),
after an adverse currency impact of £7.2 million (9.3 per cent). The
divisional trading margin, after the allocation of central costs, increased 
to 5.1 per cent, from 4.5 per cent in the prior year. The return on capital 
of SBS was also substantially higher at 16.4 per cent (before allocation 
of central costs and assets), reflecting higher profits and an improvement 
in the working capital ratio.
In local currency, sales were up 31.1 per cent to $3,581.0 million 
(2003: $2,732.3 million) with trading profit up by almost 50 per cent.
Organic sales growth was 25.8 per cent, including the beneficial effects 
of commodity price inflation. Acquisitions added $142.9 million of sales. 
Commodity lumber and structural panel prices, which directly affected
around 35 per cent and 9 per cent of SBS’s product range respectively,
rose strongly compared to the prior year. Average lumber prices rose
31.7 per cent to $378 per thousand board feet (2003: $287) and average
structural panel prices rose 86.5 per cent to $496 per thousand square feet
(2003: $266). Together these price increases had the effect of increasing
sales by $514.6 million (18.8 per cent). Organic sales volumes were higher
in the year with organic growth from on-going branches up by more than
6 per cent.
New housing, which accounted for 88 per cent (2003: 93 per cent) of the
activity in this division, has generally continued to be a bright spot in the 
US economy. Aggregate housing starts during the period continued at a
high level of more than 1.8 million. In addition, the inventory of unsold new
homes at 4.2 months in July 2004, compared to the longer term average 
of around 6 months, further demonstrates the overall strength of the
housing market. There continues to be significant variations in regional
housing markets where SBS operates. The markets in California, Florida,
Virginia and the Carolinas have been strong. Colorado, Ohio, Dallas and
Michigan have been weak markets, while Atlanta and Georgia have improved.

GROUP OUTLOOK
The Group has made a good start to the new financial year with the
positive momentum in the latter part of the financial year carrying through
into the new financial year.
In the UK, including Ireland, the RMI and new housing markets are expected
to continue to show steady growth, against the backdrop of a relatively
strong UK economy.
In France, there are signs that the market is starting to improve and further
progress by PBM is expected in the coming year. Whilst the markets in 
the rest of Continental Europe are likely to remain broadly flat, Wolseley’s
operations are expected to continue the good progress achieved this year. 
US markets will continue to vary both in terms of geography and business
sector. Residential housing and RMI markets are expected to hold up well
and there are signs that demand from the commercial sector is picking 
up. As the US economic recovery continues, this should present further
opportunities for organic growth, although industrial markets are expected
to remain relatively weak. The upward trend in the performance of the US
Building Materials business should continue as further benefits of its market
focus and restructuring are realised. 
In Canada, the overall environment is expected to remain positive.
There are uncertainties relating to the possible effects of commodity price
and exchange rate movements on the Group’s results in the coming year.
There are a number of business improvement initiatives in place relating to
supply chain, sourcing and procurement that will deliver increasing benefits
to the bottom line. The Board views the future with optimism and expects
another year of good progress. 
OPERATIONAL AND TREASURY RISK MANAGEMENT
Risk management
The risk management processes of the Group are described on page 49 
of the Report of the Directors.
Environmental and community responsibilities
The Group’s approach to the environment and the communities in which 
it operates are described in the Corporate Social Responsibility Report, 
on pages 39 to 43.
Treasury risk management
The Group is exposed to market risks arising from its international
operations. The Group has well defined and consistently applied policies 
for the management of foreign exchange and interest rate exposures. 
There has been no change since the year-end in the major financial risks
faced by the Group. The main risks arising from the Group’s financial
instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk. 
The treasury committee of the Board reviews and agrees policies for
managing each of these risks and they are summarised below. These
policies are regularly reviewed. The Group’s financial instruments, other 
than derivatives, comprise borrowings, cash and liquid resources and
various items, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly
from its operations. The Group also enters into derivative transactions
(principally interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts). 
The purpose of such transactions is to hedge certain interest rate and
currency risks arising from the Group’s operations and its sources of finance.
Details of financial instruments are shown in note 32 to the accounts.
Derivatives are also used to a limited extent to hedge movements in the
price paid for lumber. These options and futures hedging contracts mature
within one year and all are with organised exchanges. The Group’s policy 
is to control credit risk by only entering into financial instruments with
authorised counterparties after taking account of their credit rating. 
It is, and has been throughout the period under review, the Group’s policy
that no trading in financial instruments or speculative transactions be
undertaken.
Interest rate risk
The Group finances its operations through a mixture of retained profits and
bank and other borrowings. The Group borrows in the desired currencies
principally at floating rates of interest and then uses interest rate swaps 
to generate the desired interest rate profile, so managing the Group’s
exposure to interest rate fluctuations. 
At the year-end, approximately £507.1 million of the Group’s net borrowings
were at fixed rates for one year or more after taking account of swaps. 
The Group reviews deposits and borrowings by currency at treasury
committee and Board meetings. The treasury committee gives prior
approval to any variations from floating rate arrangements.
WO10065_01-43  12/10/04  11:14 am  Page 33 Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 34 Operating and financial review
Operating and financial review continued
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks a balance between certainty of funding and a flexible,
cost-effective borrowings structure. The Group’s policy is to ensure that, 
as a minimum, all projected net borrowing needs are covered by committed
facilities arranged and provided by the corporate office, supplemented
where appropriate by local facilities.
The Group’s strong earnings and low gearing are such that the ratio 
of net debt to EBITDA (Earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation and
amortisation) for the year was 1.29:1 (2003: 1.46:1). This decrease on the
prior year is principally due to strong earnings. In the absence of significant
acquisitions, or a perpetuation of this year’s exceptional growth, the Group
would anticipate having surplus funds within the medium term. Given these
circumstances it has been concluded that funding sources with a maturity
of more than seven years are inappropriate at the present time.
The principal source of funds to the Group is committed bank debt. 
A mix of term loans and revolving credit facilities are used to obtain the
desired currency and maturity profile. During the year, the Group entered
into 14 new bilateral facilities, seven of the facilities were denominated in
Euros and six were denominated in US dollars. At the year-end exchange
rates, the sterling value of these facilities was £348 million. In addition,
SBS entered into a syndicated loan with four banks for US$400 million
(£220 million), the principal purpose of this facility is to finance that company’s
construction loan receivables. This approach has enabled the Group to
adjust its funding profile to match more precisely its investment profile
and strengthen its relationships with its core banks.
The year-end maturity profile of the Group’s centrally managed facilities 
was as follows:
Facility
£m
Less than one year 579
1-2 years 28
2-3 years 400
3-4 years 330
4-5 years 66
5-6 years 59
Total 1,462
As at the year-end, undrawn committed facilities are as follows:
Facility
£m
Less than one year 200
1-2 years nil
Over two years 58
Foreign currency risk
The Group has significant overseas businesses whose revenues are mainly
denominated in the currencies of the countries in which the operations are
located. Approximately 54 per cent of the Group’s sales are in US dollars.
The Group does not have significant foreign currency cash flows arising
from transactions. However, those that do arise are generally hedged with
either forward contracts or currency options. The Group does not normally
hedge profit translation exposure since such hedges have only temporary
effect. Most of the foreign currency earnings generated by the Group’s
overseas operations are reinvested in the business to fund growth in those
territories. The Group’s policy is to maintain the majority of its debt in the
currencies of its operating companies as this hedges both the net assets
and cash flows of the Group.
Details of average exchange rates used in the translation of overseas
earnings and of year-end exchange rates used in the translation of
overseas balance sheets, for the principal currencies used by the Group 
are shown in note 30 to the accounts. The net effect of currency translation
was to decrease turnover by £400.1 million (4.9 per cent) and to reduce
trading profit by £21.5 million (4.5 per cent).
These currency effects reflect a movement of the average sterling exchange
rate against each of the major currencies with which the Group is involved
as follows:
(Strengthening)/
weakening of sterling %
US dollar (9.0)%
Euro 2.8%
Fair value of financial instruments
As set out in note 32 to the accounts, there is no significant difference
between the book value and fair value of financial instruments as at
31 July 2004.
Market price risk
The Group regularly monitors its interest rate and currency risk by reviewing
the effect on profit before tax over various periods of a range of possible
changes in interest rates and exchange rates. On the basis of the Group’s
analysis it is estimated that the maximum effect of a rise of one percentage
point in the principal interest rates on the Group’s continuing businesses
would result in an increase in the interest charge of approximately £4.3 million.
Similarly, it is estimated that a strengthening of sterling by 10 per cent
against all the currencies in which the Group does business would reduce
profit before tax by approximately £44.1 million (7.9 per cent) due to
currency translation.

OTHER FINANCIAL MATTERS
Shareholder return
The Group monitors relative Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) for incentive
purposes (as set out within the remuneration report on pages 52 to 57) 
and for assessing relative financial performance. 
For the year ended 31 July 2004, Wolseley achieved an annualised 
TSR of 31.0 per cent based on the average closing price achieved during
July 2004, which put it in 19th position against the monitored peer Group 
of 70 companies drawn from the FTSE 100 and the building materials 
and construction sectors utilised for the latest award under the long-term
incentive plan (as set out within the remuneration report). The principal
exclusions from the FTSE 100 in deriving the peer group are financial
services, telecommunications, IT and utility companies. We continue to
monitor return on capital including goodwill, throughout the Group, as one
of the key measures of business performance. Return on gross capital
employed (as defined in the Five year summary on pages 88 to 89) was
18.4 per cent (2003: 16.7 per cent), well ahead of the Group’s weighted
average cost of capital, thereby generating additional shareholder value. 
At the close of business on the date of the Directors’ report, the value 
of an ordinary share as quoted in the Financial Times was 928.0 pence 
per share (2003: 716.3 pence), an increase of 29.55 per cent. The market
capitalisation of the Group at that date was £5,430 million (2003: £4,160
million). The total dividend of 23.8 pence per share in respect of the
financial year gives a yield of 2.6 per cent, based on the above market
value of the shares.
Financial reporting
The Group’s accounting policies fully reflect the requirements of the
Accounting Standards Board (“ASB”). There have been no new Financial
Reporting Standards issued during the year. 
Under the transitional arrangements contained within FRS 17, (Retirement
Benefits), the Group has continued to adopt the rules set out in SSAP 24
for pensions accounting during the financial year. Note 33 to the accounts
includes the additional disclosures required by FRS 17. Full adoption of
FRS 17 has now been superseded by the implementation of International
Accounting Standards.
The accounting policies set out on page 61 to 62 of the accounts have
been updated to include a policy in respect of computer systems. The
policy has been included in the accounts to reflect the greater level of
activity in this area. There has been no other amendment or change to 
the Group’s selected accounting policies.
International Accounting Standards
Under current European legislation, the Group will be required to adopt
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) and International
Accounting Standards (“IASs”) in the preparation of its financial statements
from 1 August 2005 onwards. The project to manage the transition 
of financial reporting from UK GAAP to international accounting has
completed an initial assessment of the impact on the accounts of the
Group and work is underway to ensure full compliance for the year ending
31 July 2006.
Based on the initial assessment, the areas of greatest impact for the Group
are the changes in respect of the accounting treatment for goodwill,
intangible assets, property leases, share based payments, pensions,
deferred tax and dividends. The presentation of the financial statements 
will also be affected.
Insurance
The insurance arrangements of the Group are reviewed annually. 
The Group has a captive insurance company which is registered and
operational in the Isle of Man. No policies are written for third parties. 
The administration is undertaken by a specialist management company.
Going concern
The Directors are confident, on the basis of current financial projections 
and facilities available, that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operation for the foreseeable future. Accordingly,
the Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing 
the accounts.
Cautionary statement
This operating and financial review and other sections of this report contain
forward looking statements that are subject to risk factors associated with 
the building materials and construction sectors. It is believed that the
expectations reflected in these statements are reasonable, but they may 
be affected by a wide range of variables which could cause actual results 
or trends to differ materially, including but not limited to, risks associated
with changes in economic conditions, the strength of the plumbing and
heating and building materials markets in North America and Europe, risks
associated with Wolseley’s growth strategy (including the ability to identify
suitably priced acquisitions), fluctuations in product pricing and changes 
in exchange and interest rates.

materials for a ‘Builders’ Blitz’, they turned to Stock Building Supply (“SBS”). Working
closely with 24 custom home builders, the SBS team provided supplies 24 hours a 
day for five days. Planning took a full year and more than 500 workers came together 
on the project. Thanks to these efforts, 51 children will now have the chance to live in

Corporate social responsibility report
Although the Board believes that the environmental impact of our
distribution activities is comparatively low, we are committed to sound
Corporate Social Responsibility (“CSR”) policies and practices for good
business reasons. Our commitment to CSR is not simply a response to
increased market pressures in this area, but such issues reinforce the 
way that our various businesses operate. We regard CSR as a sustainable
approach to business that seeks benefits for all of our stakeholders, be they
customers, employees, communities, the environment or the Company and
its shareholders. During the year we have begun to seek out and act upon
stakeholder opinion as to ways in which we might improve our performance
and reporting. We are committed to the highest standards of corporate
governance and environmental as well as other CSR issues form part 
of the overall internal control process.
The Board believes that the businesses are best served by creating a 
safe working environment, which encourages and supports high levels 
of business performance. We focus on issues such as safety, training,
behaviour based performance and the provision of opportunities for our
employees’ career growth and development. Local community initiatives
are considered to be investments providing support that will assist local
communities, complement the aspirations of our customers, give our
employees opportunities for professional development and help us to
achieve our business objectives. The Board believes that the progressive
integration of CSR throughout the business and the incorporation 
of broader social and environmental issues into day-to-day decision 
making will better enable us to achieve our goals.
Health, safety and environment
A key driver of the Group’s success has been the high degree of autonomy
which has been afforded to local managements, allowing them to serve
local markets in the most appropriate manner. Within this decentralised
structure, the Board has set down a number of health, safety and
environment principles with which all businesses are required to comply. 
The principles relating to environment cover: the integration of environmental
management into business operations; a commitment to the adoption and
achievement of best practice wherever this is practicable; a commitment 
to prevent pollution; compliance with local environmental legislation; the
adoption where practicable of local formal environmental management
systems; a commitment to strive for continual improvement; and a
commitment to ensure proper communication with employees on
environmental matters. 
Timber
PB & M (formerly Pinault Bois et Matériaux) (“PBM”), the French heavyside
business that was acquired in July 2003, purchased some 907,000m
3
of timber in the year ended 31 December 2003 and 856,000m
3
of timber 
in the year ended 31 July 2004. More than 85 per cent in the calendar 
year 2003 and 86 per cent in the financial year 2004 of such lumber was
softwood, mainly sourced from countries such as Finland, France and
Sweden. A small minority of the timber purchased was hardwood, sourced
from suppliers who have not been censured by the United Nations as part
of resolution number 2001/1343. PBM has been working with its suppliers
since 2000 with a view to ensuring that timber is sourced from forests
which have been certified by recognised forestry associations which promote
sustainable forestry management. Some 46 per cent of the timber purchased
in the year ended 31 July 2004 was sourced from sustainable sources, an
improvement of 1 per cent over the calendar year ended 31 December 2003.
PBM, like Build Center and Stock Building Supply, has engaged with the
suppliers of Indonesian plywood with a view to ensuring that any illegal
logging is excluded from the supply chain. Imports of Indonesian plywood
accounted for 2.4 per cent of all timber purchased by PBM in the year ended
31 December 2003 and 2 per cent in the financial year ended 31 July 2004.
Build Center’s purchases of Indonesian plywood amounted to less than 
1.5 per cent of its timber purchases in the year ended 31 July 2003 and
this reduced to 0.2 per cent in the year ended 31 July 2004 following Build
Center’s decision to cease sales of such plywood from September 2003.
Stock Building Supply’s purchases of Lauan plywood reduced from 
0.09 per cent of its timber purchases in the year ended 31 July 2003 
to 0.07 per cent in the year ended 31 July 2004. None of Build Center,
PBM or Stock Building Supply purchase without appropriate permits any
species of timber included in any of the Appendices to the Convention 
on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora,
which, inter alia, identify threatened species of trees.
PBM is a member of “Le Commerce du Bois”, the French timber trade
federation. PBM intends to become a signatory to a code of practice 
being drawn up by that federation which will set the standards for timber
sourcing, purchasing and distribution in France based on both domestic
French and internationally recognised standards. The federation, with the
support of PBM and its other members, is also engaging the French
Government with a view to securing the adoption of a code of practice
recognised across France.
Further progress has been made during the year at Build Center with
regard to the responsible sourcing of timber and the elimination of illegal
timber from the supply chain. Build Center purchased some 247,000m
3
of timber in the year ended 31 July 2003 and some 273,000m
3
of timber 
in the year ended 31 July 2004. More than 97 per cent in each of 2003 
and 2004 of such timber was sourced from Finland, Sweden, Germany,
Latvia, the UK and other European countries. Less than 1.5 per cent 
(in 2003) and less than 1.2 per cent (in 2004) of such purchases were 
of hardwood. Some 40 per cent of the raw material purchases made 
in 2003 was from certified sources.
Build Center has volunteered to test a responsible purchasing policy in
conjunction with the Timber Trade Federation (“TTF”). The policy has been
formulated by the TTF to meet the requirements of the UK Government’s
own timber procurement policy. The policy is being developed with 
the benefit of input from principal suppliers, with a view to ensuring that
increasing volumes of sustainable timber are progressively being made
available to the business.

Corporate social responsibility report continued
Stock Building Supply purchased some 3,750,000m
3
of lumber in the 
year ended 31 July 2003 and some 4,400,000m
3
of lumber in the year
ended 31 July 2004, of which some 1,400,000m
3
were of structural panels.
Almost all of such purchases in both the financial years 2003 and 2004
were sourced from the USA and Canada, with less than 100,000m
3
being
sourced from Europe. Some 90 per cent in the year ended 31 July 2004
(85 per cent in 2003) of such purchases were made from suppliers who
hold certifications from recognised forestry sustainability agencies, such 
as the American Forest Products Association and the Canadian Standards
Association. The American Forest Products Association’s Sustainable Forest
Initiative programme requires participants to meet an exacting standard 
of environmental principles, objectives and performance measures. The
standard integrates the perpetual growing and harvesting of trees with 
the protection of wildlife, plants, soil and water quality, together with a wide
range of conservation goals. While there remains a negligible amount of
product sourced from non-certified sources, Stock Building Supply constantly
reviews suppliers’ policies and encourages sustainable forestry management.
Suppliers are required to verify and certify their stated environmental
practices and a constant dialogue is maintained along the supply chain.
Stock Building Supply has continued to promote the development 
of innovative alternative building materials including substitutes for 
wide dimension solid-sawn lumber, sales of which increased by over 
35 per cent in the year ended 31 July 2004. Such substitutes improve
structural performance, thereby reducing the need to harvest as many
larger, older trees.
Chain of custody
It is well recognised that whilst sustainable sourcing is vital, it is also key
that illegal timber is eliminated from the supply chain, from the forest of
origin to the end user. Build Center began work last year on a chain of
custody project that has seen the implementation of new procedures in 
five branches with 16 products currently within scope, all of which have
been independently audited and approved by, or on behalf of, both the
Forest Stewardship Council and the Programme for the Endorsement 
of Forest Certification. The project has required Build Center to identify
certified sources for these 16 products, adapt management systems to
identify and capture relevant data, undertake on-site training, create a dialogue
with suppliers, and create new documentation to ensure that despatch
notes and invoices contain chain of custody certification numbers and
references to the certified status of the product. Internal and independent
third party audits have had to be conducted.
Although only 16 products comprising sheet materials such as MDF
(medium density fibreboard) are currently within the scheme, Build Center
sells many hundreds of products from sustainable sources. Build Center
intends to increase the number of products within the chain of custody
scheme to around 1,500 by the end of December 2004 and by the 
same date to increase by 300 per cent the number of branches that 
have secured accreditation.
PBM’s hardwood business achieved certification for its chain of custody
procedures in November 2003. Cerland, PBM’s garden products business,
also achieved certification for its chain of custody procedures during 2003.
Significant progress has been made during the year to achieve the same
recognition in PBM’s softwood import business, with the requisite pre-audit
report having been completed in March 2004. PBM is currently planning 
to have achieved certification for the import business by the end of 2005.
Stock Building Supply does not have a formal chain of custody procedure
for its lumber as it relies upon the chain of custody procedures in place within
its suppliers. As noted above, the vast majority of purchases made by
Stock Building Supply are from suppliers who hold recognised certifications
and the company maintains an extensive dialogue with them on sustainability
issues including chain of custody.
Waste management
All of the European companies comply with EU and domestic waste
management regulations. In Ireland, Heatmerchants has begun to look 
for ways of reducing compliance costs by back-loading secondary waste
paper, cardboard, wood pallets and plastic from branches to the main
distribution centre. Brossette in France has installed containers at each 
of its branches for the collection of plastic/paper, wood and metal for
recycling. ÖAG in Austria continues to operate its waste management
strategy that has been in place since 1994 and which streams waste for
collection and reprocessing by specialist contractors. Stock Building Supply
has optimised the use of off-cuts in its truss manufacturing facilities and,
where possible, off-cuts which cannot otherwise be used are recycled by
wood products manufacturers in order to minimise waste, reduce the 
need to use landfill sites and to reduce costs. Equipment has been installed 
at distribution warehouses in the UK to bale and recycle cardboard and
hard plastic. Recycling programmes now operate in all of the businesses’
corporate offices.

Environment
The US Virginia Marine Resources Commission continues to endeavour to
stimulate the oyster population by using porcelain pieces as a substitute for
oyster shell on a sanctuary reef in Chesapeake Bay, where it is hoped that
the oyster population will increase tenfold by 2010. Ferguson continues to
contribute damaged and broken toilets, which would otherwise have been
thrown away. Ferguson, for the third year in succession, also participated 
in ‘Clean the Bay’ day, the annual community effort to remove waste and
debris from Chesapeake Bay and its estuaries. Over 7,000 pounds of 
debris were collected from five miles of waterways and a number of
Ferguson employees and their families were involved in the clean-up.
Wolseley UK has formed an environmental steering group comprising
senior managers and local Board directors. The Group identifies ways 
in which environmental issues can be captured and improvements made.
Wolseley UK has agreed an environmental policy, which sets out the
Company’s position to customers, suppliers and other stakeholders.
Commitment has been made to continuous improvement in environmental
performance, the prevention of pollution and to improving efficiency in the
use of resources including energy, water, packaging and other raw materials.
An extensive internal communication exercise has been undertaken to
explain the objectives and the way in which each employee can contribute. 
Transport is another key area for Wolseley UK. Tight controls are enforced
to ensure that the minimum number of vehicles operate out of each site
and emphasis is placed upon route planning to minimise delivery journeys
and the number of miles travelled. Progress continues to be made across
the whole UK transport fleet to improve this utilisation. The introduction 
of further high capacity trailers has reduced the number of vehicles
operating between each of the UK distribution centres and there has been
a substantial increase in the volume of back hauling from suppliers, thereby
enhancing the efficient use of the fleet. Significant investment has been
made in distribution warehousing. Multiple stock replenishment deliveries 
to branches from suppliers have been reduced as loads are consolidated 
in Wolseley UK’s own distribution warehouses for onward delivery.
Consolidating loads reduces the number of supplier vehicles on the road
while minimising the local impact around branches. There is a continued
focus on pooling branch vehicles across each of the Wolseley UK brands,
which will ensure that the fleet eliminates wasteful multiple deliveries and
reduces the number of miles travelled. 
A major project is underway at Wolseley UK to improve fuel consumption
across its primary distribution fleet. This is being achieved through individual
vehicle monitoring, combined with driver training initiatives and the
replacement of older, less fuel efficient vehicles. Some 200 vehicles were
replaced over the last year. A number of fleet vehicles have also been trialed
with particulate filtration, allowing them to gain ‘reduced pollution’ certificates.
Wolseley UK’s transport group also pays continuous attention to servicing
programmes which include regular emissions checks to ensure vehicle
efficiency and has adopted a reduced emissions and tyre pressure
management system for optimal fleet use.
Ferguson in the USA has been using a transportation management system
for its 1,200 plus diesel powered delivery vehicles. The system optimises the
delivery of goods from distribution centres to branches as well as directly 
to customers, thereby reducing handling and transport costs together with
vehicle emissions. The new system has been implemented at a branch level
and significant savings are expected to be achieved. Ferguson has a policy
of sourcing vehicles from a supplier with a leading reputation in environmentally
friendly diesel technology. The engines for all replacement vehicles are
certified to meet the US Government’s 2007 standard for particulate
emissions and all 175 new vehicles acquired during the year were each
equipped with emissions technology that meet this standard. Ferguson is
also seeking to take full advantage of new digital valve technology to improve
air quality and fuel economy throughout its entire distribution network. 
As part of Stock Building Supply’s transport management programme,
many suppliers back-load their delivery vehicles to avoid wasteful return
journeys. This initiative is part of a programme that also includes investment
in a national fleet management and servicing system aimed at achieving
optimal fleet efficiency and curbing excessive emissions. An extensive
programme of education has ensured that an appropriate level of capital
expenditure is invested in new environmentally friendly vehicles. These
vehicles incorporate emission and fuel economy technologies which already
comply with, or exceed, forthcoming US Government standards. During
the year ended 31 July 2004, over 265 such vehicles were replaced. 
Such new vehicles are approximately 70 per cent more fuel efficient than
the ones they replaced. In common with other Wolseley companies, Stock
Building Supply’s maintenance programme seeks to improve both safety
and fuel efficiency by increasing reliability through the direct purchase of
spare parts and also by rigorous tyre management. Stock Building Supply
recently tested a GPS pilot programme, the results of which indicate that
further efficiencies could be achieved and would allow the company to 
plan more efficient delivery routes to enhance customer service and further
reduce the number of miles driven. The pilot demonstrated that safety
could also be improved as drivers’ speed can be monitored. Stock Building
Supply has already rolled out the GPS initiative in the local Raleigh market
and intends to extend this in the short term to those segments of its
distribution network where immediate benefits can be achieved.
Stock Building Supply’s regional distribution centres were designed to
facilitate product delivery by rail. More than 50 per cent of deliveries to the
distribution centres are made in this way, with over 14,000 wagon loads
(equivalent to some 56,000 lorry loads) received during the last year alone,
an increase over the 2003 financial year of more than 12 per cent. Delivery
by rail continues to be encouraged and is expected to continue to grow. 
Brossette in France has implemented a reorganisation programme to
reduce the number of warehouses and to regroup branches in order to
improve productivity and customer service while at the same time reducing
the number of delivery journeys and transport costs. Brossette has a
national fleet maintenance programme in place, which seeks to secure
optimal use of its delivery vehicles while minimising the impact on 
the environment. Brossette seeks to take advantage of technological
improvements when renewing its fleet to both reduce emissions and 
to optimise fuel consumption. All new vehicles are fitted with the latest
software technology to improve efficiency and to reduce the number of
miles driven. Some 31 vehicles were replaced during the year. PBM has
embarked upon a fleet renewal programme to increase fuel efficiency,
improve safety and reduce both emissions and transport costs. Fleet
efficiency is underpinned by a national fleet management programme,
which ensures uniform operating standards. PBM ensures that its drivers’
training is maintained and seeks ways of encouraging good driving.

Health and safety
The Company has developed a health and safety framework which 
requires local management to have suitable procedures in place to ensure
compliance with applicable laws and regulations and, wherever possible, 
to employ best practice. One of the key issues for the Group is the creation
of a work environment free from injury and illness and how we go about
improving our health and safety performance driven, not only by legal
responsibility, but also the ethical desire to protect our employees.
Wolseley UK has a health and safety committee, supported by the health
and safety department. This comprises senior managers and local Board
directors. The committee reviews the UK Group’s performance in health and
safety matters, promotes good practice and ensures appropriate consultation
on any intended changes to the health and safety management systems. 
All branch and area managers are trained in this area and all employees 
are trained to complete their daily tasks in a safe manner. 
Brossette has a central health and safety committee which oversees 
the work carried out by the health and safety committees in individual
branches. Representatives of the company and employees sit on each 
local committee, together with an occupational health doctor. All new
employees and managers receive appropriate induction and training 
which includes matters related to health and safety. PBM seeks to increase
awareness of the importance of health and safety matters throughout the
business using a programme which reinforces the fact that each person
throughout the company has both a responsibility and a part to play in
maintaining and improving health and safety standards. 
Stock Building Supply has a safety committee with responsibility for
developing, introducing and monitoring the effectiveness of the company’s
overall safety programme and objectives. The committee comprises
employees with different perspectives and from varied disciplines. Each
branch manager is responsible and accountable for health and safety at his
or her branch, including compliance with regulations, safety awareness and
accident prevention. All new employees are given induction training relating
to safe working practices and hazards present in the workplace. Training 
is also provided when an employee is requested to handle new processes,
procedures or equipment. Monthly mandatory safety meetings are held at
each branch during which, as a minimum, topics designated by the safety
committee must be discussed. Safety issues within each branch are dealt
with by a safety coordinator or local safety committee consisting of a
cross-section of employees. 
Stock Building Supply and Ferguson have been working together over 
the last 12 months to improve their performance in the areas of both health 
and safety and traffic accidents. The joint initiative has been driven not 
only by the costs to the business of soaring medical and other expenses
associated with claims for workers’ compensation but also the desire to
reduce the incidence of injury and to reduce the consequential effect that
such incidences have on other employees and the business. Each of the
businesses has set targets during the year to reduce the frequency and
cost of both workers’ compensation and traffic incidents, enhance their
programmes to encourage employees to return to work even if this is on
modified duty, improve the reporting of claims to ensure that prompt action
is taken and increase measures to ensure that employees are able to seek
any required medical attention. We will measure the extent to which the
targets have been met in late 2004 and will look to set further targets and
consider how best we might report our performance against the targets 
in the future.
Acquisitions
A great deal of importance is placed on environmental matters during the
due diligence process for acquisitions. External environmental consultants
review and assess environmental risks to which the Group could potentially
become exposed. Depending upon the type of proposed acquisition, this
assessment could include reviews of environmental management systems,
compliance with laws and regulations and the respect and care shown 
for the environment. Health and safety compliance and processes are 
also considered as part of the process. Appropriate dialogue with, and
indemnities from, the proposed vendors are sought where appropriate.
Code of ethics
A Group-wide Code of Ethics has been in place since 2003. This sets out a
number of fundamental principles which all companies and employees are
expected to follow. In keeping with our decentralised approach, businesses
were required to adopt their own codes which respected local cultures and
businesses but which also set standards that are still no less exacting than
those detailed in the Group-wide Code. To a large extent, these individual
codes simply underpinned and endorsed existing practices. The Group-wide
Code covers many areas including fair competition, compliance with laws,
including anti-trust laws, maintenance of the Group’s reputation for integrity
(including a prohibition on bribery and general principles for dealing with
suppliers and authorities) and can be viewed on the Company’s website 
at www.wolseley.com or a printed copy is available from the Group
Company Secretary.
Wolseley UK, for example, has incorporated the Code of Ethics into 
a wider document which sets out the principles on which business is
transacted. This includes principles related to diversity, safety, inducements,
communication, the environment and human rights. The human rights
policies and procedures are based on the principles set out in the 
United Nations Universal Declaration on Human Rights.
The workplace
One of the Board’s objectives is to ensure that we provide a workplace
environment that encourages and supports our employees in achieving
their best personal performance. Further work was undertaken during 
the year in this area coordinated by the recently established Group-wide
human resource function that now resides in Theale. The development 
of leadership skills of senior managers is also a key objective and further
progress has been made to enable more participants than ever before 
to attend programmes at Darden and IMD. Training and development
programmes for all employees are crucial to the ability of the business to
achieve its goals. The businesses continue to devote significant attention
and resource to this issue, recently aided by the recruitment of human
resource leaders in both the UK and Central European businesses. 
More than £11 million was spent on training of employees during the 
year, with over 64,500 days of training provided.
Whilst Wolseley is committed to promoting equal opportunities for all, 
it is believed that, overall, women and minorities are under represented. 
We believe that we have the right policies in place to meet or exceed 
legal requirements in this area but we also recognise the need to better
understand the factors that are critical to achieving greater diversity. 
Further work is being undertaken in this area.

Community relations
Notwithstanding the international nature of the business, the Group continues
to operate with a high degree of autonomy, working in and with our local
communities. We recognise our responsibility to invest in the communities
in which our businesses operate and to act as a good corporate citizen.
The Company is a member of Business in the Community in the UK and has
worked with that organisation to help develop our approach and practice. 
The Group’s businesses are involved in a wide range of initiatives for the
benefit of local communities, of which the following are representative: 
As part of its continuing commitment to Habitat for Humanity, the non-
profit organisation which seeks to eliminate substandard housing and
homelessness from the world, Stock Building Supply became an
Ambassador Level sponsor by contributing seven lorry loads of trim and
millwork together with a further 22 lorry loads of lumber and supplies, for
the construction of 24 homes in Raleigh, North Carolina. These 24 homes
were constructed in five days as part of the “2003 Builder Blitz” organised
by the Wake County division of Habitat for Humanity. Normally Habitat for
Humanity requires future homeowners to invest their own labour into building
their own house, which is then sold to them at no profit, with affordable low
interest loans. As some prospective homeowners did not participate in the
“2003 Builder Blitz” they will contribute a total of 400 hours of their ‘sweat
equity’ hours on other homes or in other ways. They will also be required 
to invest another 100 hours in practical training in areas such as budgeting,
balancing a cheque book, home and property care. In addition to the
commitment to Habitat for Humanity, Stock Building Supply has participated
in numerous fundraising events for other charities including community blood
drives, cancer research, and the MS Walk (for Multiple Sclerosis research)
and raised, with its employees, more money than any other non-sponsoring
company for the Ronald McDonald House Appeal in Chapel Hill, ensuring
food, shelter, comfort and support for more than 220 families during the
year. Over the last five years, Stock Building Supply has helped to raise
more than $1.6 million for cancer research at centres of excellence in
California and Virginia.
Wolseley UK operates a local community donation scheme in the UK for 
a wide range of good causes for sports, education and health schemes in
local communities. In the year to 31 July 2004, Wolseley UK also supported
diverse organisations including Macmillan Nurses and Diabetes UK. Plumb
Center also has a long-standing involvement with the National Children’s
Home, with employees taking part in different fundraising activities. Over
£100,000 was raised for the National Children’s Home this year with Plumb
Center’s assistance.
PBM works with a company dedicated to the employment of disabled people
throughout Western France. They are mainly involved in the assembly of
products sold by PBM under its garden products Cerland brand. Tobler, 
our new Swiss business, works with a similar company dedicated to the
employment of disabled people in Switzerland.
Ferguson has a community partnership with the Achievable Dream Academy,
a programme that targets at-risk children between the ages of 4 and 16.
Ferguson is an annual sponsor of the Academy’s major fundraising event,
which helps to raise funds for school uniforms, teacher assistants,
counsellors, supplemental instruction and other operating expenses. For
the past three years Ferguson associates have helped raise funds for the
St Jude Dream Home which is part of the St Jude Children’s Research
Hospital, a leading paediatric cancer research centre. Ferguson donated
toilets and other goods as well as encouraging suppliers to provide other
pieces of equipment for the home. Ferguson also donated $500,000 to the
Children’s Hospital of the King’s Daughters in Virginia, offering hope to local
children fighting cancer, heart and lung diseases, diabetes and AIDS by
bringing advancements in children’s medicine, research and technology to
the Virginia Peninsula, as well as $500,000 to the Boy Scouts organisation
to help build a year-round camp beside the Rappahannock River in Virginia.
Through the combination of a corporate gift and a company match for
donations made by individual employees, Ferguson has given $1 million 
to support the recent expansion of the Virginia Living Museum in Newport
News, Virginia. This museum is a combined native wildlife park, science
museum, aquarium, botanical preserve and planetarium, which provides 
a wide range of educational and environmental activities for local schools
and the community.
Donations
In addition to these initiatives, the Group supports charities relevant to 
the countries and to the locations in which businesses operate. These are
wide-ranging and cover health, welfare, education, civic and community
projects as well as culture and the arts. Each year, several hundred donations
are made. In the USA, many of our employees make regular contributions
to the United Way, an organisation which distributes funds to charities. 
In the UK, a Give as You Earn Scheme operates with the assistance of the
Charities Aid Foundation which distributes funds to UK charities. Further
details of the donations made during the year are set out on page 50.

Report of the Directors
Including the statement of remuneration policy for the year ended 31 July 2004
The Directors submit their annual report and the audited consolidated
accounts of the Company and its subsidiaries for the year ended 
31 July 2004.
Principal activities and business review
Wolseley plc is a holding company; its subsidiaries are organised 
into three divisions which are set out on pages 30 to 32. The principal
activities of the Group are the distribution of plumbing and bathroom
materials, central heating equipment and pipes, valves and fittings within
Europe, the USA and Canada. Additionally in the UK, Ireland and France, 
it distributes heavyside building materials, whilst in the USA, the Group
distributes timber and other building materials. In the UK, it also operates
tool hire centres. Details of the development of the Group’s businesses
during the year are given in the operating and financial review on 
pages 26 to 35 and in the Group Chief Executive’s review on pages 8 to 12.
Results and dividends
The Group’s consolidated profit and loss account, set out on page 58,
shows an increase of 31% in Group operating profit from £443.0 million 
to £580.2 million. An analysis of turnover and operating profit is given in note
1 to the accounts on page 63. There are no significant post balance sheet
events. Shareholders were paid the 2004 interim dividend of 7.8 pence
per share (2003: 5.6 pence) on 1 June 2004. The Directors recommend 
a final dividend of 16.0 pence per share (2003: 15.6 pence) making a total
dividend for the year of 23.8 pence per ordinary share, an increase of
12.3% on the 21.2 pence paid in respect of last year. Payment of the
recommended final dividend, if approved at the Annual General Meeting,
will be made on 30 November 2004 to shareholders registered at the
close of business on 8 October 2004. The Directors of Wolseley QUEST
Limited have waived their right to receive dividends on any shares held by
that company under the Wolseley Savings Related Share Option Scheme.
For the year ended 31 July 2004, Wolseley QUEST Limited held no shares
and no such dividend waiver was required (2003: £20).
The Company’s dividend reinvestment plan will continue to be available 
to shareholders. Shareholders who do not currently participate in the plan
and wish to do so can obtain an application form and explanatory booklet
from the Company’s registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars. Contact details 
for the registrars are shown on page 91. The latest date for receipt of 
new applications to participate in respect of the 2004 final dividend is 
10 November 2004.
Acquisitions and disposals
Details of acquisitions and disposals made during the year are contained 
in the operating and financial review on pages 28 and 29 and in note 23
on page 72.
Future development
It remains your Board’s intention to develop the Group through organic
growth and by selective acquisitions. 
Share capital
At the date of this report, 585,098,265 ordinary shares of 25 pence each
have been issued and are fully paid up and are quoted on the London
Stock Exchange. In addition, the Company has entered into a level II
American Depository Receipt programme with the Bank of New York,
under which the Company’s shares are traded in the form of American
Depository Shares on the New York Stock Exchange. During the year
ended 31 July 2004, options were exercised pursuant to the Company’s
share option schemes, resulting in the allotment of 4,411,342 new ordinary
shares. A further 16,400 new ordinary shares have been allotted under
these schemes since the end of the financial year to the date of this report.
Details of these issues including, where appropriate, the amounts subscribed
for new shares are set out in note 20 to the accounts on page 71 which
also contains details of options granted over unissued capital. 
The Directors propose (Resolution 11 in the Notice of Meeting) to renew
the authority granted to them at the Annual General Meeting held in 1999
to allot equity shares up to an aggregate nominal value of £50,000,000
(representing approximately one third of the ordinary shares issued at the
date of this report) (the “section 80 authority”). It is your Directors’ intention
that the section 80 authority will, henceforth, be renewed annually and, 
if approved at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, will expire no later
than 15 months from the date on which the resolution is passed, or at the
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2005, whichever is
the sooner. 
The limited power granted to the Directors at last year’s Annual General
Meeting to allot equity shares for cash other than pro rata to existing
shareholders expires no later than 21 February 2005. Subject to the terms
of the section 80 authority, your Directors recommend (Resolution 12 in
the Notice of Meeting which accompanies this report) that this authority
should be renewed so as to give them the ability (until the Annual General
Meeting to be held in 2005) to issue ordinary shares for cash, other than
pro rata to existing shareholders, in connection with a rights issue or up to
a limit of 5% of the ordinary share capital issued at the date of this report.
Your Directors have no present intention to issue ordinary shares (other
than pursuant to the Company’s employees’ share schemes and any
share dividend alternatives). The Directors recommend that you vote in
favour of Resolutions 11 and 12 to maintain the Company’s flexibility in
relation to future share issues, including any issues to finance business
opportunities should appropriate circumstances arise. 
A Special Resolution will also be proposed (Resolution 13 in the Notice 
of Meeting) to renew the Directors’ limited authority last granted in 2003 
to repurchase ordinary shares in the market. The authority will be limited 
to a maximum of 58,509,827 ordinary shares (10% of the Company’s
issued share capital at the date of this report) and it also sets the minimum 
and maximum prices which may be paid. This authority will enable your
Directors to continue to respond promptly should circumstances arise 
in which they consider such a purchase would result in an increase in
earnings per share and would be in the best interests of the Company.
The Companies (Acquisition of Own Shares) (Treasury Shares) Regulations
2003 came into force on 1 December 2003. These new regulations allow
shares repurchased by the Company to be held as treasury shares, which
may be cancelled, sold for cash or used for the purpose of employee
share schemes. The authorities to be sought by each of Resolutions 12
and 13 are intended to apply equally to shares to be held by the Company
as treasury shares and to the sale of treasury shares. The Directors
consider it desirable for these general authorisations to be available to
provide flexibility in the management of the Company’s capital resources.

Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are required by UK company law to prepare financial
statements for each financial period which give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit 
or loss for that period. 
The Directors consider that, in preparing the accounts, appropriate
accounting policies have been used and applied consistently, supported
by reasonable and prudent judgements and estimates and that applicable
UK accounting standards have also been applied.
The Directors are also responsible for maintaining adequate accounting
records which disclose with reasonable accuracy the financial position 
of the Company and the Group, which enable them to ensure that the
financial statements comply with the UK Companies Act 1985. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the
wolseley.com website. The work carried out by the auditors does not
involve consideration of these matters and, accordingly, the auditors
accept no responsibility for any changes that may have occurred to the
financial statements since they were initially presented on the website.
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
the financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The Directors have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the Company and the
Group and to prevent and detect fraud or other irregularities. The Directors,
having prepared the financial statements, have permitted the auditors to
take whatever steps and undertake whatever inspections they consider to
be appropriate for the purpose of enabling them to give their audit opinion.
  Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 46 Corporate governance
Corporate governance
Including the report of the audit committee
Compliance with the Combined Code
The Board is committed to high standards of corporate governance
throughout the Group. The Board is accountable to the Company’s
shareholders for good governance and this statement describes how the
Board applies the principles of good governance set out in the Combined
Code (as appended to the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority)
and the Revised Combined Code (“Revised Code”) that has applied to the
Company with effect from 1 August 2004. 
The Board
As at 31 July 2004, the Board of Directors was made up of 12 members
comprising the Chairman, six Executive Directors and five Non Executive
Directors. The Non Executive Directors are considered by the Board to 
be independent of management and free of any relationship which could
materially interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement. The
Board considers that each of the Non Executive Directors brings his own
senior level of experience, gained in their own fields of mainly international
operations. Nigel Stein was appointed as a Non Executive Director with
effect from 1 December 2003 and Andrew Duff was appointed as a Non
Executive Director with effect from 1 July 2004. John Allan left the Board
on 19 March 2004. At the date of this report there remain 12 members of
the Board and biographical details of the Directors are shown on pages 36
and 37* . The Company’s policy relating to the terms of appointment and
the remuneration of both the Executive and Non Executive Directors is
detailed in the remuneration report on pages 52 to 57.
The Board meets regularly during the year as well as on an ad hoc 
basis, as required by time critical business needs. The Board has a formal
schedule of matters reserved to it for its decision, although its primary role
is to review the overall strategic development of the Group as a whole.
Day-to-day operational decisions are delegated to the executive committee
referred to on page 48. The Board met eight times during the year and
Director attendance for each meeting is shown in the table on page 48.
The Board has established a procedure for Directors, if deemed necessary,
to take independent professional advice at the Company’s expense in the
furtherance of their duties and has secured appropriate insurance cover 
for the Directors. This is in addition to the access that every Director 
has to the Company Secretary, who is charged with ensuring that Board
procedures are followed and that good corporate governance and
compliance is implemented within the Group. The differing roles of
Chairman and Group Chief Executive are acknowledged and set out 
in writing. The Chairman has confirmed that he would not chair any 
other major company’s Board.
The Chairman has addressed the developmental needs of the Board as 
a whole, with a view to developing its effectiveness as a team and assists
in the development of individual skills, knowledge and expertise. During the
year, the Board again reviewed its effectiveness and that of its committees
and the quality of Board processes utilising both a questionnaire and
discussion with Board members. A number of actions were agreed as 
a result of the review. A further evaluation will be carried out during the
next year. 
Meetings between the Non Executive Directors, both with and without 
the presence of the Chairman and Mr Banks, are now scheduled in the
Board’s annual timetable. The Board has also arranged to hold two Board
meetings each year at divisional locations to help all Board members gain
a deeper understanding of the business.
Performance evaluations have been carried out for each member of
the Board. Executive Directors’ performance has been assessed by 
the Chairman and Mr Banks, Mr Banks’ performance by the Chairman
and the Non Executive Directors, the Chairman’s performance by the 
Non Executive Directors and Mr Banks and the Non Executive Directors’
performance by Mr Banks and the Chairman. In line with the Revised
Code, the Executive Directors are now encouraged to take on not more
than one non executive position on a non-competitor board, for which
they may retain payments received in respect of the appointment. In order
to avoid any conflict of interest, all appointments are subject to the Board’s
approval. Succession planning is considered to be a matter for the whole
Board rather than for a committee.
The Company’s articles of association provide that one third of the
Directors retire by rotation each year and that each Director will seek
re-election at the Annual General Meeting every three years. Additionally,
new Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first opportunity
after their appointment. It is Board policy that Non Executive Directors are
normally appointed for an initial term of three years, which is then reviewed
and extended for a further three-year period. It is also Board policy that
Non Executive Directors should not generally serve on the Board for 
more than nine years and that, in cases where it is proposed to exceed
this period, the Director concerned will retire annually and offer himself 
for re-election. Following their appointment, formal comprehensive and
tailored induction is offered to all Non Executive Directors, supplemented
by visits to key locations within the Group and meetings with members 
of the executive committee and other key senior executives. Board papers
and other information are delivered at times to allow Directors to be
properly briefed in advance of meetings.
Although the Non Executive Directors are not asked, at present, to meet
the shareholders of the Company, their attendance at presentations of 
the annual results is encouraged. The Chairman ensures that the Board
maintains an appropriate dialogue with shareholders.
Following the appointment of Nigel Stein on 1 December 2003 and
Andrew Duff on 1 July 2004, the Board comprises five independent 
Non Executive Directors, excluding the Chairman, within the definition 
set out in the Revised Code. The Board recognises that, whilst the number
of such Directors remains less than half the members of the Board, 
the overall balance of Directors remains under review* . Gareth Davis was
appointed as the Company’s senior independent Non Executive Director
with effect from 1 July 2004. 
The formal terms of reference for the main Board committees, approved
by the Board and complying with the Revised Code to assist in the
discharge of its duties, are available from the Company Secretary and 
can also be found on the Company’s website at www.wolseley.com.
Membership of the various committees is shown on page 91. Mr Whybrow
ceased to be a member of both the audit and remuneration committees
with effect from 1 July 2004. The Company Secretary acts as secretary 
to all Board committees.
* *Jacques Descours left the Board on 7 October 2004. At such date there
were 11 members of the Board comprising five Executive Directors and 
five Non Executive Directors in addition to the Chairman. Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 47 Corporate governance
Nominations committee
The nominations committee meets on an as needed basis and is
comprised of Mr Whybrow (Chairman), Mr Banks, Mr Davis, Mr Duff and
Mr Walker. Mr Whybrow would not chair the committee when it considers
the appointment of a successor chairman. The committee reviews the
structure, size and composition of the Board and its committees and 
makes recommendations with regard to any changes that are considered
necessary, both in the identification and nomination of new Directors and
the continuation of existing Directors in office. The committee retains external
search consultants as appropriate. The committee also advises the Board
on succession planning for executive board appointments although the
Board itself is responsible for succession generally. The committee met
once during the year and all members of the committee in office at that
time attended the meeting.
Audit committee
The audit committee comprises Messrs Davis, Stein and Murray (who chairs
the committee). Mr Whybrow ceased to be a member of the committee
from 1 July 2004. The committee’s membership is reviewed by the
nominations committee and by Mr Murray at regular intervals. Members of
the committee are appointed by the Board following recommendations by
the nominations committee. The committee is normally comprised of three
independent Non Executive Directors. Two members constitute a quorum. 
Each member of the committee brings relevant financial experience from
senior executive levels. The expertise and experience of the members of the
committee are summarised on pages 36 and 37. The Board considers that
each member of the committee is independent within the definition set out
in the Revised Code. Mr Stein is considered to have significant, recent and
relevant financial experience, as he is currently Finance Director of GKN plc. 
All members of the committee receive appropriate induction, which is in
addition to the induction which all new Directors receive and includes an
overview of the business, its financial dynamics and risks. Audit committee
members are expected to have an understanding of the following areas –
the principles of, contents of, and developments in, financial reporting,
including the applicable accounting standards and statements of
recommended practice; key aspects of the Company’s approach,
including corporate policies; Company financing; systems of internal
control; matters that require the use of judgement in the presentation of
accounts and key figures as well as the role of internal and external auditors.
Members of the committee undertake ongoing training as required. 
The committee meets regularly throughout the year and its agenda is
linked to events in the Company’s financial calendar. The agenda is mostly
cyclical such that the committee Chairman approves the agenda on behalf
of all members of the committee; each member of the committee may
require reports on matters of interest in addition to the regular items.
Members’ attendance at the meetings held during the year is set out 
in the table on page 48.
The committee invites the Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the Group
Finance Director, Group Financial Controller and the Head of Internal Audit
together with senior representatives of the external auditors to attend each
meeting although it reserves part of each meeting for discussions without
the invitees being present. Other senior management are invited to present
such reports as are required for the committee to discharge its duties.
The Chairman of the audit committee attends the Annual General Meeting
to respond to any shareholder questions that might be raised on the
committee’s activities. The remuneration of the members of the committee
is set out on page 53 and the policy with regard to the remuneration of
Non Executive Directors is set out on page 57.
The committee is required to assist the Board to fulfill their responsibilities
related to external financial reporting and associated announcements.
During the year, the committee reviewed the interim and annual financial
statements, together with the associated interim and preliminary
announcements made to the London and New York Stock Exchanges
and the Form 20-F , which is filed with the Securities and Exchange
Commission in the USA, having received the appropriate information 
on the accounting principles, policies and practices adopted in the
preparation of the accounts; changes proposed to those principles;
policies and practices; significant accounting issues; litigation and
contingent liabilities and tax matters, including contingencies against 
tax liabilities together with compliance with statutory tax obligations.
The committee is also responsible for the development, implementation
and monitoring of the Company’s policy on external audit. The committee
reserves oversight responsibility for monitoring the independence,
objectivity and compliance with ethical and regulatory requirements. 
The committee recommends the appointment and reappointment of the
Company’s external auditors. The committee reviews the scope, results
(including schedules of unadjusted errors and representation letters) and
cost effectiveness of the audit as well as the auditors’ remuneration and
performance. The committee also ensures that key partners within the
external auditors are rotated from time to time in accordance with both 
UK and US rules. It also monitors the extent of non-audit work which the
external auditors can perform, to ensure that the provision of those non-
audit services that can be undertaken by the external auditors falls within
the agreed policy and does not impair their objectivity or independence.
The policy requires pre-confirmation by the committee of any non-audit
work subject to de minimis levels. The external auditors provide audit
related services such as regulatory and statutory reporting as well as
formalities relating to shareholder or other circulars. The external auditors
report to the committee any material departures from Group accounting
policies and procedures that they identify during the course of their audit
work. Within the constraints of applicable US and UK rules, the external
auditors undertake due diligence reviews and provide assistance on tax
matters given their in-depth knowledge of the Group’s business. The
provision of non-audit services within such constraints and the agreed
policy is assessed on a case-by-case basis so that the best-placed
adviser is retained. During the year the committee reviewed the
effectiveness of the external auditors and considered whether the agreed
plan had been fulfilled and the reasons for any variation from the plan. 
The committee also considered the external auditors’ robustness and the
degree to which the external auditors were able to assess key accounting
and audit judgements and the context of the management letter. The
committee also reviewed the terms, areas of responsibility and scope of
the audit as set out in the external auditors’ engagement letter; the overall
work plan for the forthcoming year, together with the associated fee
proposal; any major issues which arose during the course of the audit and
their resolution; key accounting and audit judgements; the level of errors
identified during the audit; the recommendations made to management 
by the auditors and management’s response.
  Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 48 Corporate governance
Corporate governance continued
The committee also reviews the Group’s internal audit function and its
relationship with the external auditors, including internal audit plans and
performance. The committee reviewed the internal audit function’s terms 
of reference, reporting lines and access to the committee, its plans 
and its achievements against plans. The committee plans to review the
effectiveness of the internal audit function before the end of 2004, by
which time it will have been operating for some 18 months. The committee
considered the results of the audits undertaken by the internal audit
function and considered the adequacy of management’s response to
matters raised, including the time taken to resolve any such matters. 
The committee oversaw the development of the internal audit function
during the year and the need to continue to outsource to KPMG LLP
some elements of internal audit’s work to assist during the initial phases 
of developing the function. The committee has also monitored the policy
which it approved on the recruitment of staff from both the external
auditors and from KPMG LLP . 
The committee also reviews, where practicable, all proposed
announcements to be made by the Company to the extent that they
contain material financial information. It also reviews disclosures made by
the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director during the certification
process for the Form 20-F concerning the design and operation of internal
controls or material weaknesses in the controls, including any fraud
involving management or other employees involved in the Group’s financial
controls. The committee monitors and reviews the effectiveness of the
Group’s internal control systems, accounting policies and practices, 
risk management procedures and compliance controls as well as the
Company’s statements on internal controls before they are agreed by the
Board for each year’s annual report. The Board retains overall responsibility
for internal control and the identification and management of business risk.
The Company’s whistleblowing policy (which is an extension of the Group-
wide Code of Ethics) sets out arrangements for the Company Secretary 
to receive, in confidence, complaints on accounting, risk issues, internal
controls, auditing issues and related matters which would, as appropriate,
be reported to the committee. A copy of the Code of Ethics is available 
on the Company’s website at www.wolseley.com.
During the year the committee reviewed its terms of reference and 
its effectiveness, which was achieved through the completion of a
questionnaire by its members and the external auditors, the results 
of which were discussed by members of the committee.
Remuneration committee
The committee comprises Messrs Davis, Duff and Walker (who chairs 
the committee), all of whom are independent within the definition set 
out in the Revised Code. Mr Whybrow ceased to be a member of 
the committee from 1 July 2004. The committee met five times during 
the year and Director attendance for each meeting is shown in the table
below. The committee is responsible for making recommendations 
on remuneration to the Board. The Board’s remuneration report is set 
out on pages 52 to 57. During the year, the committee reviewed its terms 
of reference and submitted modifications to the Board for its approval.
Copies of the revised terms of reference are available from the Company
Secretary or on the Company’s website at www.wolseley.com. The
Chairman of the remuneration committee attends the Annual General
Meeting to respond to any shareholder questions that might be raised 
on the committee’s activities.
Executive committee
The Executive Directors of the Company together with Mr Barden, who
has been responsible for Wolseley UK Limited since 1 August 2003, meet
at least eight times each year, often on the day before formal Board
meetings. The committee addresses operational business issues and
shares best practice, thereby allowing the Directors more time at Board
meetings to focus on strategy. 
Treasury committee
The committee comprises the Group Chief Executive, the Group Treasurer 
and the Group Finance Director, who acts as its Chairman. Its role is to
consider treasury policy, tax matters and certain transactions on behalf 
of the Group within a framework delegated by the Board.

Internal audit
The discrete internal audit function, which was established within the
Group during 2003, continued to expand its scope of work and to recruit
further members during the year. The Head of Internal Audit is based at
the Company’s head office in Theale. The internal audit function is involved
in the assessment of the quality of risk management and internal control
and helps to promote effective risk management within the businesses.
Certain internal audit assignments (such as those requiring specialist
expertise) continue to be outsourced by the Head of Internal Audit to
KPMG LLP as required. The audit committee reviews internal audit reports.
  Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 49 Corporate governance
Internal control
In a highly decentralised Group, where local management has
considerable autonomy to run and develop their businesses, a well
designed system of internal control is necessary to safeguard shareholders’
investment and the Company’s assets. The Directors acknowledge that
they have overall responsibility for the Group’s systems of internal control
and for reviewing their effectiveness. In accordance with the guidance 
set out in the Turnbull Report “Internal Control: Guidance for Directors 
on the Combined Code”, an ongoing process had been established for
identifying, managing and evaluating the risks faced by the Group. This
process has been in place for the full financial year and up to the date on
which the financial statements were approved. The systems are designed
to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s
objectives, safeguard the Group’s assets against material loss, fairly report
the Group’s performance and position and to ensure compliance with
relevant legislation, regulation and best practice including that related to
social, environmental and ethical matters. The systems provide reasonable,
not absolute, assurance against material misstatement or loss. Such
systems are regularly reviewed by the Board to deal with changing
circumstances. A summary of the key financial risks inherent in the Group’s
business is given on pages 33 and 34. Risk assessment and evaluation 
is an integral part of the annual planning cycle. Each business documents
the strategic objectives and the effectiveness of the Group’s systems of
internal control. As part of this review, each business area and function 
has been required to identify and document each significant risk, together
with the mitigating actions implemented to manage, monitor and report 
to management on the effectiveness of these controls. Senior managers 
are also required to sign bi-annual confirmations of compliance with 
key procedures and to report any breakdowns in, or exceptions to, 
these procedures. Summarised results have been presented to senior
management and to the audit committee. The Board has reviewed the
effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control for the year under
review. A summary of the principal control structures and processes in
place across the Group is set out below.
Control structures
Whilst the Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal
control and for reviewing its effectiveness, it has delegated responsibility 
for the internal control and risk management programme to the Group
Finance Director. The detailed review of internal control and risk
management has been delegated to the audit committee. The
management of each Group company is responsible for internal control
and risk management within its own business, and for ensuring
compliance with the Group’s policies and procedures. Each Group
company has appointed a risk Director whose primary role in such
capacity is to ensure compliance by local management with the Group’s
risk management and internal control programme. Both the internal and
external auditors have reviewed the overall approach adopted by the
Group towards its risk management activities so as to reinforce these
internal control requirements.
Control processes
The Board reviews its strategic plans and objectives on an annual basis,
and approves Group company budgets and strategies in light of these.
Control is exercised at both Group and subsidiary Board level through
monthly monitoring of performance by comparison to budgets, forecasts
and cash targets, and by regular visits to Group companies by the Group
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director. Group companies approve
and submit risk reports to the audit committee, summarising the key risks
facing their businesses and the controls in place to manage those risks.
These reports, together with reports on internal control and departures, 
if any, from established Group procedures prepared by the external
auditors, are reviewed by the Group Finance Director and the audit
committee. Group companies submit annual risk and internal control
representation letters to the Group Finance Director on internal control 
and risk management issues, with comments on the control environment
within their operations. The Group Finance Director summarises these
submissions for the audit committee and the Chairman of the audit
committee reports to the Board on any matters which have arisen from the
committee’s review of the way in which the risk management and internal
control processes have been applied. The Board has formal procedures in
place (which were reviewed during the year) for the approval of investment
and acquisition projects, with designated levels of authority, supported by
post investment review processes for selected acquisitions and major
capital expenditure. The Board considers social, environmental and ethical
matters in relation to the Group’s businesses and assesses these when
reviewing the risks faced by the Group. The Board is conscious of the
effect such matters may have on the short and long-term value of the
Company. The external auditors of the Company and the Head of Internal
Audit attend audit committee meetings and receive its papers. The report
of the audit committee is set out on page 47 and the audit committee
members regularly meet the external auditors without the presence of
executive management.
As noted on page 44, the Company has entered into a level II American
Depository Receipt programme with the Bank of New York and has
securities registered with the US Securities and Exchange Commission
(“the Commission”). The Company is required to comply with applicable
US regulations including the Sarbanes-Oxley Act, insofar as it applies 
to foreign private issuers. In accordance with the Commission’s
recommendations, the Company has established a disclosure committee
comprising the Group Chief Executive, Group Finance Director, Group
Financial Controller and the Group Company Secretary and Counsel. 
The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director have evaluated 
the effectiveness of the Group’s disclosure controls and procedures as of
31 July 2004 and have concluded that, at that date, the disclosure controls
and procedures were effective in ensuring that material information relating
to the Group was made known to them during the period in which this
report was being prepared. The Group Chief Executive and Group Finance
Director will also provide the certificates required by the Sarbanes-Oxley
Act when the Form 20-F for 2004 is filed. There were no significant
changes in the Group’s disclosure controls and procedures or in other
factors that could significantly affect those controls subsequent to the date
that the evaluation was completed. Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 50 Corporate governance
Corporate governance continued
Compliance statement
The Company applied the principles set out in section 1 of the Combined
Code for the period under review and has, throughout the year, complied
with the detailed provisions set out therein with the following exceptions: 
> Following the introduction of a new Directors’ bonus scheme in 2000,
the pensionable salary of one Executive Director includes his bonus
capped at a fixed amount.
> Mr Davis was appointed as the senior independent Non Executive
Director with effect from 1 July 2004.
The Company’s auditors, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP , are required to
review whether the above statement reflects the Company’s compliance
with the seven provisions of the Combined Code specified for its review 
by the Listing Rules and to report if it does not reflect such compliance.
No such report has been made. 
New York Stock Exchange
Corporate governance requirements
Whilst the Company is not required to comply with the measures set by
the board of the New York Stock Exchange, Inc. to strengthen corporate
accountability as it is a private foreign issuer, it does comply in all material
respects with those standards. Those standards state that companies
should have a nominating/corporate governance committee composed
entirely of independent Directors with written terms of reference, which
develops and recommends to the Board a set of corporate governance
principles for the Company. Details of the Company’s nominations
committee are set out on page 47. The nominations committee does 
not develop corporate governance principles for the Board to approve. 
The Board itself approves the Group’s overall system of internal controls,
governance and authority limits. A majority of the members of the
nominations committee are independent Non Executive Directors and all
such Directors sit on the Board. The Company’s practice, in accordance
with the UK Companies Act and Combined Code in relation to the
appointment and termination of the external auditors, is that a
recommendation is made by the audit committee to the Board, which 
will then make a recommendation to shareholders in general meeting. 
This differs from the procedure in the USA, where the external auditors are
accountable to the audit committee, which has the authority to appoint or
dismiss the external auditors without reference to shareholders.
Communications with shareholders
The Company places considerable importance on communication with 
its shareholders, including its employee shareholders. The Group Chief
Executive and Group Finance Director are closely involved in investor
relations and a senior executive has day-to-day responsibility for such
matters. The views of our major shareholders are reported to the Board 
by the Group Finance Director and by the Chairman and discussed 
at its meetings. The Annual Report and Accounts are available to all
shareholders either in paper form or electronically, and can be accessed
via the Company’s website or via Shareview, an Internet service offered 
by the Company’s registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars, detailed on page 92.
There is regular dialogue with institutional shareholders and this has been
extended to include private shareholders through the Annual General
Meeting and meetings with shareholder representatives. Contact is also
maintained, when appropriate, with shareholders to discuss overall
remuneration plans and policies. The Group’s preliminary and interim
results, as well as all announcements issued to the London and 
New York Stock Exchanges, are published on the Company’s website,
www.wolseley.com. The Company issues regular trading updates to the
market and these, together with copies of presentations to analysts and
interviews with the Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director, 
are also posted on the website. Notice of the Annual General Meeting 
is circulated to all shareholders at least 20 working days before such
meeting. It is Company policy not to combine resolutions to be proposed
at general meetings. All shareholders are invited to the Company’s Annual
General Meeting at which they have the opportunity to put questions to
the Board and it is standard practice to have the chairmen of the audit,
nominations and remuneration committees available to answer questions.
The proxy votes for and against each resolution, as well as abstentions,
are counted before the Annual General Meeting and the results will be
made available at the meeting after shareholders have voted on each
resolution on a show of hands. The results will also be announced to 
the London and New York Stock Exchanges and are published on the
Company’s website shortly after the meeting. 
Donations
The Company’s Corporate Social Responsibility Report is set out on pages
39 to 43. The Group’s charitable donations in 2004 totalled £3,839,000
(2003: £838,000). The Political Parties, Elections and Referendums Act
2000 defines EU political organisations widely, and whose activities may
form part of normal relationships between companies and the political
machinery, even though such activities are not designed to affect public
support for a particular party or influence support for any party. The Group
made no political donations in 2004 (2003: nil) and does not make what
are commonly regarded as political donations. The Group will continue this
policy. The Group may, however, need as part of its business to contact
politicians and political parties within the EU on a non-partisan basis in
order to make them aware of industry views, technology and trends. In the
UK, employees may serve as local councillors who are permitted time off
by their employer. The definitions of political donations and EU political
expenditure have been drafted so broadly that some such activities may
fall within the Act, even though they are not “donations” in the ordinary
sense of the word. The Act requires companies to obtain shareholder
approval before such expenditure or donations in excess of certain limits
may be made. The Directors, therefore, propose on a precautionary basis,
to once more seek authority for the Group to make donations and incur
expenditure, which they might otherwise be prohibited from making or
incurring under the terms of the Act. Among other things, the Act requires
that this authorising resolution should not purport to authorise particular
donations or expenditure and requires any donations to EU political
organisations or any EU political expenditure in excess of £200 to be
disclosed in the Annual Report and Accounts. The Directors consider 
that the authority sought under the resolution to allow the Company or its
subsidiaries to incur this type of expenditure of not more than £125,000 in
total until the Company’s next Annual General Meeting is necessary to
ensure that, because of the uncertainty over which bodies are covered,
the Company does not unintentionally breach the Act. The policy of not
giving any cash contribution to any political party will continue. The
authority sought by Resolution 15 will last until the Company’s next
Annual General Meeting.

the new Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 over 3,570,423 ordinary 
shares (2003: 173,016 and 2,786,484 under the Wolseley 1984 and 
1989 Executive Share Option Plans respectively) to senior employees 
of the Group at an option price of 743 pence per share. These schemes
are described in more detail on pages 55 and 56. Details of the total
options outstanding at 31 July 2004 are set out in note 20 to the financial
statements. Details of the cash awards under the 2001 Long Term
Performance Related Incentive Scheme for Mr Banks and the 
Wolseley plc 2002 Long Term Incentive Scheme are set out on page 53.
Employee policies and involvement
The Group places particular importance on the involvement of its
employees, keeping them regularly informed through informal bulletins,
such as ‘Directions’ and other in-house publications, meetings and the
Company’s internal website, on matters affecting them as employees 
and on the issues affecting their performance. A European Works Council
has been operating since 1996 to provide a forum for dialogue and
consultation with employees on significant developments in the Group’s
operations, management’s plans and expectations, organisational changes
within the Group and for employee representatives to consult management
about concerns over any aspect of the Group’s operations. At the date of
this report, there are 21 members comprising 15 employee representatives
nominated from among employees from each European company.
Permanent UK employees are usually invited to join the Company’s
pension arrangements including the defined benefit pension scheme,
which has one corporate and two individual trustees. The Chairman 
of the trustees is David Tucker and, save for an independent trustee, 
all of the other trustees are UK-based employees or former employees 
of the Group. Permanent employees outside the UK are usually offered
membership of their employing companies’ pension arrangements.
Employees are offered a range of benefits depending on the local
environment, such as private medical cover. Employees are encouraged 
to become shareholders in the Company, where possible, through
participation in the Company’s share schemes. Priority is given to the
training of employees, and the development of their skills is of prime
importance. Employment of disabled people is considered on merit with
regard only to the ability of any applicant to carry out the function required.
Arrangements to enable disabled people to carry out the function required
will be made if it is reasonable to do so. An employee becoming disabled
would, where appropriate, be offered retraining. The Group continues to
operate on a highly decentralised basis. This provides the maximum
encouragement for the development of entrepreneurial flair, balanced 
by a rigorous control framework exercised by a small head office team.
Local managements are responsible for maintaining high standards of
health and safety and for ensuring that there is appropriate employee
involvement in decision-making.
Creditor payment policy
All Group companies are responsible for establishing terms and conditions
of trading with their suppliers. It is the Group’s policy that payments to
suppliers are made within agreed terms and, where applicable, consistent
with the UK CBI Prompt Payers Code. Copies of this Code can be
obtained from the Group Company Secretary at the Company’s registered
office. At 31 July 2004 the Company had no trade creditors (2003: nil).
The amount of trade creditors for the Group as at 31 July 2004 was
equivalent to 52 days (2003: 57 days) of trade purchases.
Shareholder services
Shareview is a service offered by our registrars, Lloyds TSB Registrars,
which allows shareholders on-line access to a range of shareholder
information. Shareview provides access to details of shareholdings in the
Company and practical help on transferring shares or updating personal
details. It also allows shareholders to choose to receive shareholder
communications electronically, rather than by post. To register,
shareholders simply need to log on to www.shareview.co.uk with their
shareholder reference number, which is shown on the form of proxy sent
to all shareholders. First time users will need to enter certain information
and choose a PIN number before they are able to access their
shareholding details. 
Shareview dealing is also available to UK-based shareholders. This is a
simple and convenient telephone and Internet share purchase and sale
service offered by the registrars. For telephone purchases and sales call
0870 850 0852 between 8.30am and 4.30pm, Monday to Friday. For
Internet purchases and sales, log on to www.shareview.co.uk/dealing. 
A postal dealing service is also available from Lloyds TSB Registrars 
and a form, together with terms and conditions, can be obtained by 
calling 0870 242 4244.
CREST
The Company’s ordinary shares are in CREST, the settlement system 
for stocks and shares.
Auditors
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are willing to continue as auditors of 
the Company and Resolution 9 concerning their re-appointment and
Resolution 10 concerning the determination of their remuneration are 
to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting.
Annual General Meeting resolutions
The resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held
on 18 November 2004, together with explanatory notes, appear in the
separate Notice of Annual General Meeting, which has been sent to all
registered shareholders and which is also available on our website at

Remuneration report
Including the statement of remuneration policy for the year ended 31 July 2004
The Board presents the remuneration report for the year ended 
31 July 2004.
The Board sets the Company’s remuneration policy. The remuneration
committee (“the Committee”) makes recommendations to the Board,
within its agreed terms of reference, on the Company’s framework of
executive remuneration and its cost. It also determines, on behalf of the
Board, specific remuneration packages for each of the Executive Directors
and for the Chairman. The Committee administers the Company’s share
incentive schemes for employees and recommends and monitors the level
and structure of remuneration for senior management who report to the
Group Chief Executive. The Board itself determines the remuneration of
the Non Executive Directors. The current members of the Committee, 
all of whom are independent Non Executive Directors within the definition
set out in the Revised Code, are set out on page 48 and the Company
Secretary acts as its secretary. The Committee has access to detailed
external research on market data and trends from independent and
experienced consultants. The Committee has, since March 2003, sought
external advice from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP , who also provide
certain pensions advice to the Company. From March 2003 until February
2004, the Committee also sought advice from Deloitte & Touche who 
also provide certain taxation advice to the Company. The Group Chief
Executive, the Chairman and Peter Buckingham, the Director of Human
Resources, are normally invited to attend the meetings of the Committee
to respond to specific questions raised by members of the Committee.
This specifically excludes such matters concerning the details of their 
own personal remuneration.
The Company has followed the provisions of Schedules A and B of the
Combined Code and has complied with the relevant provisions of the
Companies Act 1985 as amended by the Directors’ remuneration report
Regulations 2002.
The Directors’ report on remuneration was approved by shareholders at
the Annual General Meeting in 2003 and shareholders will be invited once
again to approve this report at the Annual General Meeting to be held on
18 November 2004.
With the exception of the service agreement details, performance graph
and external directorships, the information set out in this report on pages
53 to 57 represents the auditable disclosures referred to in the Auditors’
report on page 84 as specified by the UK Listing Authority and under
Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
Policy on remuneration of Executive Directors
The Company’s policy now, and for the future, is to provide remuneration
packages that fairly reward executives for the contribution they make to
the business, having regard to the size and complexity of the Group’s
operations and the need to attract, retain and motivate executives of the
highest quality. Remuneration packages comprise salary, performance
bonuses, share options, long-term incentives, benefits-in-kind and
pensions. The Company takes a total approach to remuneration, which
includes all these elements. The packages are designed to be broadly
comparable with those offered by other similar international businesses
and reflect competitive practices in the countries and markets in which
the Executive Directors operate. The policy is designed to incentivise the
Directors to meet the Company’s financial and strategic objectives such
that a significant proportion of remuneration is performance related. The
Committee considers that the targets set for the different elements of
performance related remuneration are appropriate and demanding in 
the context of the Company’s trading environment and the business
challenges it faces.
Salaries
Basic salaries are determined having regard to competitive market data,
the degree of individual responsibility and individual performance. Due
consideration is also given to the wider economic and employment
backdrop, including general pay and employment conditions elsewhere 
in the Group. The target salary is at the median with the opportunity to 
go above this level, subject to sustained individual performance. The
Committee reviewed the salaries of the Executive Directors with effect 
from 1 August 2003, having sought the views of both the Chairman and 
Mr Banks. Forty per cent of Mr Banks’ salary is currency protected, based
on an exchange rate of £1: $1.50.
Benefits-in-kind
These principally comprise car benefits, life assurance, healthcare
insurance and, in the case of Messrs Banks, Legtmann and Webster,
relocation and housing allowances following their relocations from the USA
to the UK (Messrs Banks and Legtmann) and from Droitwich to Theale
(Mr Webster), where the Company’s head office is located.
Performance bonuses
Performance bonus arrangements are designed to encourage individual
performance, corporate operating efficiencies and profitable growth. The
annual bonus awards depend on performance against annual targets of
return on capital employed, working capital, Group profit before tax and,
where relevant, profit before tax for the appropriate division (which, in
aggregate, accounted for 70% of the bonus, the majority of which related
to the profit before tax targets). The balance of 30% of the bonus depends
on specific personal objectives set for each Executive Director. No
payments are made under the scheme where actual performance falls short
of 85% of the targets for the US Directors and 90% for the other Directors
and payments are capped if performance exceeds 110% of target. 
The following percentages of base salary will be paid in bonus for the 
year ended 31 July 2004, subject to the achievement of the minimum, 
on-target and maximum levels of performance (with the percentages
increasing on a linear basis for achievement between each level): 
Percentage of base salary payable on achievement of:
Name Minimum target On-target Maximum target
C A Banks 60 80 110
J R Descours 30 40 60
F N Hord 77 117 155
C A S Hornsby 80 120 160
G Legtmann 30 40 60
S P Webster 30 40 60
Stretching targets are set for each element of the bonus, determined by
the Committee each year, which also considers the levels of performance
targets to be achieved for bonus payments to be made in the succeeding
year. For the year ending 31 July 2005, the Committee has determined
that the maximum target will be 150% of base salary for Mr Banks, 160%
for the US-based Executive Directors, 100% for Mr Webster, 75% for
Mr Legtmann and 60% for Mr Descours.

Service agreements
All service agreements with Executive Directors are subject to a maximum
of 12 months’ notice of termination if given by the Company and six months’
notice of termination if given by the Executive Director, such notice periods
reflecting current market practice and the balance that should be struck
between providing contractual protection to the Directors that is fair and the
interests of our shareholders. The date of each service agreement is noted
in the table below. There are no provisions in any service agreement for early
termination payments and, in the event of early termination of any service
agreement, the Committee will take a robust view of the mitigation, which
should be taken into account when computing any compensation payable.

Long-term cash incentive plans
The object of the Company’s two long-term cash incentive plans is to
provide a cash bonus conditional upon the Company’s total shareholder
return (“TSR”) over single three year periods. Both long-term cash incentive
plans are discretionary plans and the Committee’s policy has been to make
an annual award to the Group Chief Executive under the 2001 plan that was
specifically introduced to facilitate his recruitment as Group Chief Executive
in 2001 and to the Executive Directors and other senior executives under
the 2002 plan that was approved by shareholders in November 2002
(together the “Cash Plans”). No award under the Cash Plans, as currently
approved, may exceed 100% of salary and, to date, no award has exceeded
50% of salary at the time the award was granted. All awards are made
subject to the achievement of stretching performance conditions. TSR 
has been selected as the performance measure to more closely align the
interests of the Executive Directors and senior executives with those of
shareholders over the long term. It rewards the relative out performance of
the Company against a defined list of comparator companies. Calculations
are performed independently and are approved by the Committee. 
The lists of comparator companies for the awards made in each of 2001,
2002 and 2003 under the plan for Mr Banks and for the awards made 
to the other Executive Directors and senior employees in 2002 and 2003 
are based upon the constituent members of the FTSE 100 as at the
respective dates of grant, excluding bank, telecommunications, IT and
utility companies but together with CRH plc, RMC Group plc and Travis
Perkins plc, which compete in the same sector.
The maximum awards under these Cash Plans will only be payable if 
the Company’s TSR over the relevant performance period is in the top
decile of the comparator group. No amount is payable if the Company’s
comparative TSR performance is ranked at, or below, the median and the
vesting percentage will be determined on a linear basis for intermediate
rankings. Extant awards remain subject to the achievement of performance
conditions following a participant’s retirement and vesting is determined at
the end of the performance period.
Details of the awards conditionally made to the Executive Directors in office
during the year under the Cash Plans and outstanding at 31 July 2004, 
as well as at the date of this report, are shown in the table below:

Remuneration report continued
The Company’s commitment to Mr Banks under the 2001 Cash Plan
introduced in 2001 to facilitate his recruitment as Group Chief Executive
concluded when the third award was granted to him in August 2003. 
The Committee has reviewed the provision of the long-term incentives
within the total package for the Executive Directors and concluded that
changes should be made to the 2002 Cash Plan.
The Committee has consulted with the Company’s principal shareholders
and, taking into account their views, proposes to make the following
changes.
The 2001 Cash Plan will cease to operate and the 2002 Cash Plan will 
be amended. Subject to shareholders’ approval, it is the Committee’s
intention that awards under the 2002 Cash Plan will, in future, be made 
in shares, subject to the achievement of TSR performance targets, rather
than in cash (save where there are material securities or tax law constraints
in overseas jurisdictions where the scheme is to be operated, in which
case conditional awards in cash would continue to be made). The maximum
amount which could be granted for each award is proposed to increase 
to 200% of base salary per annum. The anticipated level of award will be
100% (or 125% in the case of the Group Chief Executive) of base salary.
Each year the Committee will assess the proportion of awards that should
be made up of both share options and long-term incentive awards. 
It is proposed that the vesting level for a maximum award under the 
plan, as amended, would remain the same as the existing plan requiring
performance within the upper decile, although to better reflect current
market practice, 25% of awards are proposed to vest for achievement 
of performance at the median (with a straight line percentage to vest
between median and upper decile). Further details of the proposed
amendments to the 2002 Cash Plan are set out in the separate Notice 
of Annual General Meeting which accompanies this report.

Pensions
UK Executive Directors participate in the Wolseley Group Retirement
Benefits Plan (“the Plan”). The Plan is a defined benefit scheme and provides
benefits based on final pensionable salaries. Group companies make
contributions to the Plan based on the recommendation of the Plan actuary.
UK Executive Directors contribute 5% per annum of pensionable salary to
the Plan. Bonuses payable to UK Executive Directors are not pensionable.
The Finance Act 1989 introduced an earnings cap (“the Cap”) for
employees joining the Plan after 31 May 1989. This has the effect of
limiting the amount of an employee’s salary that can be pensioned through
an approved pension scheme. The limit is currently £102,000 per annum.
Mr Webster and Mr Legtmann are the only UK Directors subject to the
Cap. The Company has agreed to provide Mr Webster with benefits which
are broadly comparable with those that would have applied under the 
Plan had the Cap not been introduced. This is currently provided for by
payments into a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme. The
Company has agreed to provide Mr Legtmann with an additional payment
calculated at 25% of his base salary in excess of the Cap in lieu of any
further pension benefit that would have accrued under the Plan had the
Cap not been introduced. Additionally, the Finance Act 1989 capped life
assurance payable through an approved pension scheme in respect of
such executives. The Company has taken out an insurance policy to cover
that part of the life assurance for Messrs Legtmann and Webster which is
in excess of the Cap. The amount charged to the profit and loss account
during the year in respect of Mr Webster’s future obligation was £35,712
(including £2,496 in respect of life insurance) (2003: £33,061) and the
pension related payment paid to Mr Legtmann during the year was
£59,934 (2003: nil) with an additional £1,480 payable in respect of life
assurance (2003: nil).
Messrs Banks and Hornsby, who are US citizens, participate in the defined
contribution pension arrangements of Ferguson Enterprises, Inc. In line with
current US practice, Messrs Banks and Hornsby receive contributions at
the level of 15% of their earnings (for this purpose $420,000 and $400,000
of bonus respectively is included with base salary). Mr Hord, also a US
citizen, participates in the defined benefit and defined contribution plans 
of Stock Building Supply, Inc. Mr Hord’s pensionable earnings include his
bonus up to a maximum of $742,400 as agreed when the bonus scheme
was introduced in order to preserve his pension entitlement at that time.
Mr Hord is also a member of a US non-qualified plan, which will provide 
a benefit for 20 years after retirement at age 60 of 40% of final pensionable
salary. At Mr Hord’s choice, and with Company consent, the benefit can
be paid over a period of 1, 5, 10 or 15 years with the total amount of 
the benefit, in cash terms, being the same. Mr Descours, a French citizen,
participates in the defined benefit pension arrangements of Brossette.
A US subsidiary undertaking has a commitment to a former Director, 
who is a US citizen, to pay a joint survivor pension of $300,000 per annum 
for 15 years from 1 August 1993. The net present value of the future
obligation at 31 July 2004 was £570,000 (2003: £778,000), which has 
been charged in prior years’ accounts.
Additionally, Brossette, a French subsidiary undertaking, has a commitment
to a former Director, who is a French citizen, to pay an annual pension 
of m211,212 (2003: m206,165), with a widow’s entitlement of 60%, subject 
to an annual increase based on the agreed French pension index. The full
actuarial cost of this arrangement was provided in previous years as part
of Brossette’s ongoing pension obligations. The Company is guarantor of
this future pension commitment which at 31 July 2004 was approximately
£2.1 million (2003: £2.4 million).

obligation on the pension fund or the Company – they are not sums 
due or paid to the Director. The Listing Rules require additional disclosure
of the change in accrued benefit net of inflation and the transfer value 
of this change. These pension liabilities are calculated using the cash
equivalent transfer value method prescribed in the Listing Rules of the 
UK Listing Authority.

Share options
The Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 (“2003 Plan”) received shareholder
approval at the Annual General Meeting held in November 2003.
Consequently, no further options will be granted under the Executive 
Share Option Scheme 1984 (“1984 Scheme”) nor under the Executive
Share Option Scheme 1989 (“1989 Scheme”) which are now closed. 
No options under any such scheme have or will be granted at a discount
to the relevant middle market price at the time of grant and no option
under any such scheme can be exercised unless a performance test 
has been satisfied.
All employees and Executive Directors of the Company, its subsidiaries
and joint ventures, save for those within six months of their anticipated
retirement (other than US executives), are eligible to participate in the 2003
Plan. Participants will be selected by the Committee at its discretion. 
The Committee considers annually the levels of grants, which are phased
over time and they determine the size of each award at the time of grant
based on individual performance and market levels of remuneration.
Awards may not exceed an amount equal to three times base salary 
for UK and other European-based executives and five times salary for
US-based executives. The Committee may also use the higher limit 
in exceptional circumstances as it determines.
No options may be granted more than 10 years after the date on 
which the Plan was approved by the Company’s shareholders and the
Committee will formally review the Plan by no later than November 2008.
Options are granted over new issue shares or shares purchased in the
market (including treasury shares). The number of new shares that may be
issued to satisfy options granted under the Plan or any other employee
share scheme will be restricted to 10% of the issued ordinary share capital
of the Company over any rolling 10 financial years. Further, the number of
new shares that may be issued to satisfy options granted under the Plan
or any other executive-only share scheme will be restricted to 5% of the
ordinary issued share capital of the Company over any rolling 10 years. 
In addition, for US-based participants, the Plan will be restricted such that
the aggregate number of shares for which options may be granted to such
participants during the life of the Plan shall not exceed 5% of the issued
ordinary share capital as at the date the Plan was approved by shareholders.
By 31 July 2004, awards had been granted resulting in shares being
issued or capable of being issued during the preceding 10 financial years
under all of the Company’s employee share plans representing some 
6.2% of the issued ordinary share capital at that date (2.6% of the issued
ordinary share capital under the Company’s executive share plans). 
The extent to which the options will be capable of exercise depends on
the satisfaction of a performance condition. The performance condition 
is based on the growth above UK inflation of the Company’s earnings 
per share (“EPS”), before goodwill amortisation and exceptional items
measured from the year ended immediately prior to grant.
The performance conditions for options granted under the 2003 Plan
operate on the following sliding scale:
Total margin over UK inflation after
Multiple of salary worth of shares under option 3 years 4 years
First 100% of salary 9% 12%
Second 100% of salary 12% 16%
Next 50% of salary 15% 20%
Greater than 250% of salary 15% to 21% 20% to 28%
The performance of the Company is initially measured over three financial
years, starting with the financial year in which the option grant takes place.

  Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 56 Remuneration report
Remuneration report continued
To the extent that the performance target is not fully met at the end of the
initial three-year period, a subsequent retest on the fourth anniversary of
grant can be undertaken, but from the same performance related base
prevailing at the time the awards were made. Should the performance
target not be met on this subsequent date, the option will lapse. Provided
the performance test has been satisfied, an option may be exercised at
any time until it lapses, 10 years from the date of grant. No amount is
payable on the award of an option. 
The Committee has decided that the retesting provision will be removed
from future grants made under the 2003 Plan so that such grants will not
benefit from a subsequent retest in the event that the performance criteria
are not fully met on the third anniversary of the date of grant. 
The Committee can set different EPS targets from those described above
for future options, provided that the new conditions are no less challenging
in the circumstances than the initial ones. Similarly, the Committee can
vary the terms of existing options to take account of technical changes, 
for example, changes in accounting standards. The amended target will
be materially no less challenging as a result of the change. The Committee
believes that the EPS condition is appropriate for share options as it
requires substantial improvement in underlying financial performance and
complements the inherent requirement to grow the share price for an
option to have value.

Notes:
(a) The following exercises of options took place during the year:
(i) by Fenton Hord of executive share options on 2 October 2003 in respect of 13,000 ordinary shares at 
an option price of 440.00 pence and 13,000 ordinary shares at an option price of 388.75 pence (closing
middle market price 693.00 pence);
(ii) by Jacques Descours of executive share options on 24 October 2003 in respect of 7,200 ordinary shares
at an option price of 350.25 pence (closing middle market price 723.25 pence);
(iii) by Claude Hornsby of executive share options on 23 December 2003 in respect of 8,000 ordinary shares
at an option price of 456.50 pence, 8,000 ordinary shares at an option price of 440.00 pence and 8,000
ordinary shares at an option price of 388.75 pence (closing middle market price 769.00 pence);
(iv) by Stephen Webster of executive share options on 30 March 2004 in respect of 4,529 ordinary shares 
at an option price of 483.50 pence (closing middle market price 857.00 pence); and
(v) by Charles Banks of executive share options on 28 July 2004 in respect of 14,500 ordinary shares at 
an option price of 440.00 pence and 16,800 ordinary shares at an option price of 388.75 pence (closing
middle market price 858.00 pence).
(b) The highest mid-market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year was 875.00 pence and the
lowest was 649.00 pence. The year-end price was 855.00 pence; and
(c) The performance conditions for options granted under the 1984 and 1989 Schemes between May 1994
and December 1996 are that they may not be exercised unless the growth in earnings per share over a
period of three consecutive financial years exceeds the growth in the UK retail price index over the same
period by at least 6%. Options granted in, and subsequent to, December 1997 may not be exercised unless
growth in earnings per share over a period of three consecutive financial years exceeds growth in the UK
retail price index over the same period by at least 9%.
The number of options exercisable for Executive Directors under the 1984 and 1989 Schemes are, in
addition, determined by the return on capital employed achieved over the same rolling three-year period.
For options granted in 1997 and 1998, achieving a return on capital employed of 15% per annum will enable
50% of options granted to become exercisable, rising on a sliding scale to 100% for achieving a return on
capital employed of 20% or more. With effect from October 1999 the return on capital employed required 
to permit exercise of 100% of options granted was reduced from 20% to 17.5% and the sliding scale was
adjusted accordingly.
The UK- and US-based Executive Directors may also participate in the 
UK Savings Related Share Option Scheme (“SRSOS”) and the Employee
Share Purchase Plan (“ESPP”) respectively. Under the SRSOS, participants
who enter into a savings contract, to a maximum level of £250 per month,
are granted options to subscribe for shares in the Company. Under the
ESPP , a US Code 423 Plan, US participants may enter into a savings
contract to a maximum level of $400 per month. The Board may
determine that the options granted under either scheme may be granted
at a discount. The maximum discount is 20% for the SRSOS and 15% for
the ESPP of the average market prices used to determine the price of the
award. The following table sets out the number of share options held
under the SRSOS and ESPP by the Executive Directors.

Messrs Banks, Hord and Hornsby each exercised 607 options (a reduction
of 93 options (which lapsed) from the total of 700 options listed at 
1 August 2003 due to exchange rate fluctuations) under the Group’s ESPP
on 17 April 2004. The closing middle market price on 17 April 2004 was
813.5 pence.
External directorships
Executive Directors are now encouraged to take on not more than one
external non-executive directorship on a non-competitor board, as the
Committee believes there are significant benefits to be achieved to both
the Company and the individual. In order to avoid any conflict of interest,
all appointments are subject to the Board’s approval. Directors may retain
payments received in respect of these appointments. Mr Banks is a Non
Executive Director of Bunzl plc and of TowneBank/Peninsula (formerly
Harbor Bank), for which the annual rate of his fees is £38,000 and $3,000
respectively. Mr Hord is a Non Executive Director of Reeds Jewelers, Inc,
for which the annual rate of his fees is $16,250. Mr Webster is a Non
Executive Director of Bradford and Bingley plc, for which the annual rate 
of his fees is £60,000.
Executive share ownership
A share ownership programme was introduced with effect from 1 August
2004. It is designed to encourage all Directors and members of the
Executive Committee to build up a shareholding with a value of 1.5 times
annual base salary for the Group Chief Executive; 1 times annual base
salary for all Executive Directors; 1 times annual fees for all Non Executive
Directors, including the Chairman; and 0.5 times annual base salary for 
all Executive Committee members. For Executive Directors and members
of the Executive Committee this may be achieved by retaining shares
received as a result of participating in a Wolseley plc employee share 
plan (other than the shares sold to pay a National Insurance or income 
tax liability or overseas equivalent). The programme specifically excludes
the need to make a personal investment should awards not vest. 
Normally these levels of shareholding should be expected to be 
achieved within three to five years from the time the individual is 
included in the programme.
Policy on remuneration of Non Executive Directors
The remuneration of Non Executive Directors during the year under review
was made up of a basic fee and an additional fee where a Non Executive
Director acts as Chairman of either the audit or remuneration committees.
Fees are reviewed from time to time by the Board. The Non Executive
Directors have letters of engagement rather than service contracts and do
not participate in any incentive plan, nor is any pension payable in respect
of their services as Non Executive Directors. The Board’s policy is that

Accounting policies
Year ended 31 July 2004
Basis of accounting
These consolidated financial statements are prepared under the historical
cost convention and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts include the results of the parent Company and its
subsidiary undertakings drawn up to 31 July 2004.
The trading results of businesses acquired, sold or discontinued during 
the year are included in profit on ordinary activities from the date of effective
acquisition or up to the date of sale or discontinuance, unless provision
therefor has been made in earlier years.
Foreign currencies
The trading results of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated 
into sterling using average rates of exchange ruling during the relevant
financial period.
The balance sheets of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated 
into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at 31 July. Exchange differences
arising between the translation into sterling of the net assets of these
subsidiary undertakings at rates ruling at the beginning and end of the 
year are dealt with through reserves as are exchange differences on
foreign currency borrowings raised to finance overseas assets.
Exchange differences on financial instruments entered into for foreign
currency net assets hedging purposes are dealt with through reserves.
The cost of the Company’s investments in overseas subsidiary undertakings
is translated into sterling at the rate ruling at the date of investment.
All other foreign currency assets and liabilities of the Company and its
United Kingdom subsidiary undertakings are translated into sterling at 
the rate ruling at 31 July except in those instances where forward cover
has been arranged, in which case this forward rate is used.
Foreign currency transactions during the year are translated into sterling 
at the rate of exchange ruling on the date of the transaction except when
forward exchange contracts are in place, when the forward contract rate 
is used. Any exchange differences are dealt with through the profit and
loss account.
Goodwill
Goodwill arises when the cost of acquiring subsidiary undertakings and
businesses exceeds the fair value attributed to the net assets acquired.
Prior to 1 August 1998, goodwill arising on consolidation and purchased
goodwill was written off to reserves. Following publication of FRS 10, a
revised policy for accounting for goodwill was adopted with effect from 
1 August 1998. Goodwill arising from acquisitions completed on or after
that date is capitalised and amortised on a straight line basis over a 
period of not more than 20 years. Goodwill arising on acquisitions 
prior to 1 August 1998 has not been reinstated on the balance sheet.
The net assets of businesses acquired are incorporated in the consolidated
accounts at their fair value to the Group. Fair value adjustments principally
relate to adjustments necessary to bring the accounting policies of acquired
businesses into line with those of the Wolseley Group but may also include
other adjustments necessary to restate assets and liabilities at their fair
values at the date of acquisition. All businesses acquired are consolidated
using the acquisition method of accounting.
Turnover
Turnover is the amount receivable for the provision of goods and services
falling within the Group’s ordinary activities, excluding intra-Group sales,
trade discounts, value added tax and similar sales taxes.
Leased assets
Where fixed assets are financed by leasing agreements which give rights
approximating to ownership, the assets are treated as if they had been
purchased and the capital element of the leasing commitments is included
in borrowings. The rentals payable are apportioned between interest,
which is charged to the profit and loss account, and capital, which reduces
the outstanding obligation. The cost of operating leases is charged on 
a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Costs in respect of computer systems
Costs in respect of developing and implementing significant computer
systems are capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful lives 
of typically 3 to 5 years. Costs include: computer and network hardware;
software licences; consulting costs attributable to the development, design
and implementation of the system and internal costs directly attributable 
to the development, design and implementation of the system. Costs in
respect of training and data conversion are expensed as incurred.
  Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 62 Accounting policies
Accounting policies continued
Year ended 31 July 2004
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets (except freehold land)
mainly on a straight line basis to write off the cost of those assets over
their estimated useful lives. The principal rates of depreciation are: freehold
buildings and long leaseholds, 2-3%; short leaseholds, over the period 
of the lease; plant and machinery, 10-15%; fixtures and fittings, 15%;
computers, 20-100% and motor vehicles, 25%.
Real property awaiting disposal
Real property awaiting disposal is transferred to current assets at the lower
of book written down value and estimated net realisable value. Depreciation
is not applied to real property awaiting disposal, but the carrying value is
reviewed annually and written down through the profit and loss account 
to current estimated net realisable value if lower.
Stocks
Stocks are valued at the lower of Group cost and net realisable value, due
allowance being made for obsolete or slow moving items. Raw materials,
bought out components and goods purchased for resale are stated at cost
on a first in, first out basis.
Taxation
Provision is made for deferred taxation in so far as a liability or asset has
arisen as a result of transactions that had occurred by the balance sheet
date and have given rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, 
or the right to pay less tax in the future. An asset has not been recognised 
to the extent that the transfer of economic benefits in the future is uncertain.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised have not been discounted.
Provision is made for UK or foreign taxation arising on the distribution 
to the UK of retained profits of overseas subsidiary undertakings where
dividends have been recognised as receivable.
Derivatives and financial instruments
Financial instruments, in particular, interest rate swaps and currency
swaps, are used to manage the financial risks arising from the business
activities of the Group and the financing of those activities. There is no
trading activity in financial instruments. A discussion of how the financial
risks are managed is included in the operating and financial review 
on pages 33 and 34. Financial instruments are accounted for as follows:
> Interest rate swaps are used to hedge the Group’s exposure to
movements in interest rates. The interest payable or receivable on 
such swaps is accrued in the same way as interest arising on deposits
or borrowings. Interest rate swaps are not revalued to fair value prior 
to maturity.
> Cross currency interest rate swaps (currency swaps) are used to hedge
foreign currency assets and borrowings. The future currency exchange
within such contracts is revalued to the rate of exchange at the balance
sheet date and any unrealised gain or loss is matched with that on the
underlying asset or liability in reserves. The interest coupon on such
swaps is accrued in the same way as that on borrowings and deposits.
Pensions and post retirement benefits
The expected costs of providing retirement pensions under defined benefit
plans and other post retirement benefits are charged to the profit and loss
account over the periods benefiting from the employees’ services in
accordance with the recommendations of independent qualified actuaries.
Variations from expected cost are normally spread over the average
remaining service lives of current employees.
Contributions to defined contribution pension plans and other post
retirement benefits are charged to the profit and loss account as incurred.

There are other deferred tax assets in relation to tax losses totalling £31.4 million (2003: £0.1 million) that have not been recognised on the basis that their
future economic benefit is uncertain.
No provision has been made for deferred tax on gains recognised on revaluing property to its market value or on the sale of properties where potentially
taxable gains have been rolled over into replacement assets. Such tax would become payable only if the property were sold without it being possible to
claim rollover relief. The total amount unprovided for is £16.8 million (2003: £20.7 million). At present, it is not anticipated that any tax will become payable 
in the foreseeable future.

capital and on a weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year of 582.6 million (2003: 579.1 million). The impact of all potentially
dilutive share options on earnings per share would be to increase the weighted average number of shares in issue to 589.4 million and to reduce basic
earnings per share to 67.36 pence. The earnings per share before goodwill amortisation of 74.84 pence (2003: 56.69 pence) is calculated on the profit 
of £436.0 million (2003: £328.3 million) accruing to ordinary share capital.

9. Intangible fixed assets (continued)
PBM was acquired in July 2003, and the accounts for the year ended 31 July 2003 included a provisional estimate of £132.1 million for the goodwill 
arising on this transaction. During the current year the review of the fair values of assets and liabilities acquired has been completed, and the estimated 
fair value of assets acquired of £51.8 million has been revised upwards by £6.6 million, principally in respect of the value of leasehold properties. 
Final adjustments gave rise to additional consideration of £0.7 million. Goodwill arising in respect of this acquisition has accordingly been reduced 
by £5.9 million to £126.2 million.
Bathstore.com Limited was acquired in June 2003. The ultimate consideration payable in respect of this acquisition is dependent in part on the 
subsequent profitability of the business. As a result of its performance in the current year, the estimated consideration payable, and consequently 
goodwill arising, in respect of this acquisition has been increased by £8.8 million, of which £8.5 million is included in deferred consideration.
In respect of other prior year acquisitions, final adjustments have given rise to an additional £0.6 million of consideration, and the estimated fair value 
of assets and liabilities acquired has reduced by £0.7 million. Goodwill in respect of these acquisitions has accordingly been increased by £1.3 million.

Wolseley Insurance provisions represent an estimate, based on historical experience, of the ultimate cost of settling outstanding and potential claims. 
Environmental and legal liabilities include known legal claims and environmental liabilities where the costs and timing of any payment is inherently uncertain.
Included in this provision is an amount of £27.9 million (2003: £26.2 million) related to asbestos litigation involving certain Group companies. This liability 
is fully covered by insurance and accordingly an equivalent insurance receivable has been recorded in ‘Other debtors’ (note 13) in line with FRS 12
‘Provisions, contingencies and contingent assets’. The liability has been actuarially determined as at 31 July 2004 based on advice from independent
professional advisors. The provision and the related receivable have been stated on a discounted basis using a long-term US treasury rate of 5%. 
The level of insurance cover available significantly exceeds the expected level of future claims and no profit or cash flow impact is therefore expected 
to arise in the foreseeable future.
At 31 July 2004 the Company had provisions of £ nil (2003: £ nil). Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 71 Notes to the accounts

approximate book value due to their short maturities. The loans and other borrowings payable after one year generally attract variable interest rates based
on 6 month LIBOR. Thus the fair value of these instruments as at 31 July 2004 also approximates to their book value. The fair value of construction loans
receivable approximates to book value as the interest rates attaching to these loans reflect a market risk premium. Sterling cash and deposits are utilised 
to reduce currency borrowings through the use of short-term currency swaps.
  Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 77 Notes to the accounts
32. Financial instruments (continued)
To determine the fair value of currency and interest rate swaps for inclusion in the above table, a calculation was made of the net gain or loss which would
have arisen if these contracts had been terminated on 31 July 2004.
At 31 July 2004, unrecognised gains and losses on forward exchange contracts taken out as hedges of sales and purchase transactions were not significant.
The Group’s policies in respect of foreign currency and interest risk management and the related use of financial instruments are set out in the treasury
section of the operating and financial review on pages 33 and 34 and form part of these financial statements.
Short-term debtors and creditors arising directly from the Group’s operations are excluded from the above disclosures other than those relating to assets
and liabilities by currency.
33. Pensions and other post retirement benefits
United Kingdom
The principal plan operated for UK employees is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan which provides benefits based on final pensionable salaries.
The assets are held in separate trustee administered funds. The plan’s retirement benefits are funded by a contribution from employees of 5% of earnings
with the balance being paid by Group companies. The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit Method and agreed with an independent
consulting actuary.
An independent actuarial valuation was last carried out on 1 May 2001. On that date the market value of the plan’s assets was £350.5 million. The market
value of the assets was 105% of accrued benefits, after allowing for increases in earnings and pensions in payment. The normal cost to the Company 
was 14.4% of pensionable earnings. The financial assumptions used were based on gilt and bond yields as at the valuation date. The principal actuarial
assumptions used were an investment return of 6.5% per annum before retirement and an investment return of 5.5% per annum after retirement, future
salary increases of 5% or 6% per annum and increases to pensions in payment of 2.5% per annum. The total charge to the profit and loss account for 
UK companies was £13.5 million (2003: £12.3 million).
The Group is in the process of finalising the triennial actuarial valuation as at 1 May 2004 of the UK scheme. It is expected that it will give rise to an
incremental profit and loss charge under SSAP 24 of approximately £6 million in the year to 31 July 2005.
North America
The principal plans operated for US employees are defined contribution schemes, details of which are set out below. In addition, the Group operates 
three defined benefit schemes in the United States. In Canada a defined benefit scheme and a defined contribution scheme are operated. The majority 
of assets are held in trustee administered funds independent of the assets of the companies.
Defined contribution plans
Defined contribution plans are established in accordance with US 401k rules. Companies contribute to both employee compensation deferral and profit
sharing plans. Contributions are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they fall due. In the year to 31 July 2004 the cost of defined
contribution plans charged to the profit and loss account was £14.3 million (2003: £10.7 million).
Defined benefit plans
Defined benefit plans are operated by three US subsidiary undertakings and Wolseley Canada. Two of the US plans and the Canadian plan are funded; 
two plans are closed to new entrants. The closed plans now provide a minimum pension guarantee in conjunction with a defined contribution plan. The
remaining plans provide benefits based on final pensionable salaries. The contribution rate is calculated on the Projected Unit (credit) Method as agreed 
with independent consulting actuaries. The independent actuaries have reported on the assets and liabilities of the plans at 31 July 2002. The principal
actuarial assumptions were based upon investment returns of 7%–7.5% and future salary increases of 4%. The obligations are discounted at 7%. The 
fair value of the assets of the funded plans amounted to £44.0 million. The market value of the assets was 81.3% of the accrued benefits. Surpluses and
deficits revealed by the valuation are being amortised over the expected remaining service lives of members. The total profit and loss account charge for
North American schemes was £3.1 million (2003: £2.7 million).
Other territories
Both defined contribution and defined benefit schemes are operated. Liabilities arising under defined benefit schemes are calculated in accordance with
actuarial advice. Full provision is made for such liabilities in these accounts. Contributions to defined contribution schemes are accounted for in the period 
in which they fall due.
The cost of other defined contribution and defined benefit schemes charged to the profit and loss account was £4.5 million (2003: £2.7 million).
Post retirement health care
There are no material obligations to provide post retirement health care benefits.

FRS 17 retirement benefits
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures with respect to the UK scheme has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at 1 May 2001 
and updated by the scheme actuary to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 31 July 2004. 
Scheme assets are stated at their market value at 31 July 2004. Non-UK schemes have been aggregated and weighted averages applied.

Bank plc to secure letters of credit provided by that bank.
The Company acts as guarantor or surety for various subsidiary undertakings in leasing and other agreements entered into by them in the normal course 
of business and has given indemnities and warranties to the purchasers of businesses from the Company and certain Group companies in respect 
of which no material liabilities are expected to arise. Additionally, the Company has guaranteed the pension payable by Brossette BTI to Mr. G. Pinault, 
a former director.

  Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 81 Notes to the accounts
38. Summary of significant differences between accounting
principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom and the
United States
The accompanying financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with accounting principles generally accepted in the United Kingdom 
(“UK GAAP”), which differ in certain significant respects from generally
accepted accounting principles in the United States (“US GAAP”). Such
differences involve methods for measuring the amounts shown in the
financial statements, as well as additional disclosures required by US GAAP .
A summary of the principal differences applicable to the Group are set 
out below:
(i) Purchase accounting adjustments
Under UK GAAP the purchase price of a business is assigned first to the
separable tangible assets acquired and liabilities assumed on the basis 
of their fair values at the date of acquisition. Any excess of cost over the
fair value of net tangible assets is then allocated to identifiable intangible
assets to the extent that their value can be measured reliably on initial
recognition, the asset can be separately disposed of and the asset is
controlled through custody or legal right. Any remaining excess should
then be recorded as goodwill. Under US GAAP , the purchase cost of an
investment is assigned to the tangible and intangible assets acquired and
liabilities assumed on the basis of their fair values at the date of acquisition.
Any excess of cost over fair value of net assets acquired is recorded 
as goodwill.
The purchase accounting differences specifically related to the Group are
as follows:
Goodwill
Prior to 1 August 1998, purchased goodwill was written off to reserves in
the year of acquisition as permitted under UK GAAP . Since 1 August 1998,
all acquired goodwill has been capitalised and amortised over a period 
not exceeding 20 years. If a subsidiary or a business is subsequently sold
or closed, previously written off goodwill which was the result of the initial
acquisition is taken into account in determining the profit or loss on sale 
or closure.
Under US GAAP prior to 1 January 2002, goodwill arising on acquisitions
prior to 1 July 2001 was capitalised and amortised over its estimated
useful life, not exceeding 40 years. Under the transition provisions of 
SFAS 142 “Goodwill and other intangible assets”, goodwill which arose
during the period subsequent to 1 July 2001 has not been amortised.
From 1 August 2002, goodwill is no longer amortised, but is reviewed
annually for impairment. The Group completed the required impairment
tests during 2004 which indicated no impairment charge was required.
Intangible assets
Under UK GAAP specific criteria apply in recognising intangible assets.
None of the Group’s intangible assets meet these criteria and accordingly
intangible assets have not been separately recorded. Under US GAAP ,
intangible assets acquired are recorded at their fair value. Intangible assets
are comprised of covenants not to compete, trademarks, customer contracts
and supply and distribution agreements. Intangible assets are being
amortised over their useful lives which range from one to twenty five years.
Inventory
Under UK GAAP , the fair value of inventories acquired is generally taken 
to be the cost of the inventory to the acquired company. Under US GAAP
the fair value of purchased work in process and finished goods is based
on estimated selling prices less costs to complete and sell the inventory,
less a reasonable profit allowance for the completing and selling effort.
Contingent purchase consideration
Under UK GAAP contingent purchase consideration is generally included
as part of the purchase cost at the date of acquisition. Under US GAAP
this cost is not recognised until the contingency is resolved and the
amount determinable.
(ii) Pensions
The Group operates defined benefit pension plans in the UK, USA,
Canada, France, Austria, the Netherlands, Luxembourg and Switzerland.
The most significant plan is the Wolseley Group Retirement Benefits Plan
in the UK, which after recent stock market falls is in a deficit position.
Under UK GAAP , the cost of providing pension benefits is expensed over 
the average expected service lives of eligible employees in accordance
with the provisions of Statement of Standard Accounting Practice (“SSAP”)
24, Accounting for Pension Costs. SSAP 24 aims to produce an estimate
of cost based on long-term actuarial assumptions. Variations from the
regular pension cost arising from, for example, experience deficiencies or
surpluses, are charged or credited to the profit and loss account over the
expected average remaining service lives of current employees in the
schemes.
Under US GAAP , the annual pension cost comprises the estimated cost 
of benefits accruing in the period as determined in accordance with SFAS
87, “Employers Accounting for Pensions”. SFAS 87 requires the use of 
the projected unit credit actuarial method for determining defined benefit
pension costs and provides for the deferral of actuarial gains and losses 
(in excess of a specified corridor) that result from changes in assumptions
or actual experience. SFAS 132, “Employers Disclosure about Pensions
and Other Post-Retirement Benefits”, requires disclosure of the components
of net periodic pension cost and the funded status of the pension plans.
(iii) Deferred taxation
Under UK GAAP , provision is made for deferred tax in so far as a liability 
or asset arose as a result of transactions that had occurred by the balance
sheet date and gave rise to an obligation to pay more tax in the future, 
or a right to pay less tax in the future. An asset has not been recognised
to the extent that the transfer of economic benefits in the future is uncertain.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities recognised have not been discounted.
Provision is made for UK or foreign taxation arising on the distribution 
to the UK of retained profits of overseas subsidiary undertakings where
dividends have been recognised as receivable.
Under US GAAP , deferred taxation is provided for on a full liability basis.
Under the full liability method, deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised
for differences between the accounting and taxation basis of assets and
liabilities and for tax loss carry forwards at the statutory rate at each reporting
date. A valuation allowance is established when it is more likely than not
that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will not be realised.
  Wolseley plc Annual Report and Accounts 2004 82 Notes to the accounts
Notes to the accounts continued
Year ended 31 July 2004
The recognised deferred tax asset is based upon the expected future
utilisation of tax loss carry forwards and the reversal of other temporary
differences. The tax loss carry forwards do not expire and there are no
current restrictions on their utilisation. For financial reporting purposes, 
the Group has recognised a valuation allowance for those benefits for 
which realisation does not meet the more likely than not criteria. No
provision has been made in respect of unremitted foreign earnings
because they are intended to be permanently reinvested. It is not
practicable to estimate the amount of additional tax that might be 
payable on these other foreign earnings.
(iv) Share compensation
The Company operates seven share option plans: the 1984 Executive
Share Option Scheme and the 1989 Executive Share Option Scheme 
and the Wolseley Share Option Plan 2003 (collectively, the “Executive
Option Schemes”); the Wolseley Employees Savings Related Share Option
Scheme 1981 and Wolseley Irish Sharesave Scheme 2001 (collectively, 
the “Employees Savings Option Schemes”); the Wolseley Employee Share
Purchase Plan 2001 (the “Employee Share Purchase Plan”); and the
Wolseley Employees International Stock Appreciation Plan (the “SAP”).
Under UK GAAP , no compensation expense is required to be recognised
for any of these option plans. Under US GAAP , stock based compensation
for the Executive Option Schemes, the Employees Savings Option Schemes
and the Employee Share Purchase Plan can be accounted for based 
on either (i) the intrinsic value of the stock award on the date of the grant,
following Accounting Principles Board Opinion (“APB”) 25, Accounting for
Stock Issued to Employees; or (ii) the fair value of the award on the date 
of grant following SFAS 123, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation.
Prior to 2003, the Group elected to use the intrinsic value method of
accounting in accordance with APB 25. Under APB 25, compensation
expense is measured as the difference between the exercise price and 
the quoted market price of the stock at the measurement date (the date
when both the exercise price and the number of shares of stock are
known). From 1 August 2002, the Group elected to change its method 
of accounting to the fair value method, where compensation expense is
measured as the fair value of the option at the date of grant. The Group
has taken advantage of the “modified prospective” transition provisions of
SFAS 148, Accounting for Stock-Based Compensation – Transition and
Disclosure – an Amendment of SFAS 123. Under this modified prospective
methodology, all unvested share options at 1 August 2002 have been
accounted for under the fair value method. Awards granted under the
Executive Option Schemes vest over a period of three years. Awards
granted under the Employee Savings Option Schemes vest over periods
ranging from three to seven years. Awards granted under the Employee
Share Purchase Plan vest over a one-year period.
The SAP is treated as a variable plan since the award to be received by 
the employees is indeterminate at the date of grant. As a variable plan, 
the compensation cost is determined each year with reference to the
period-end quoted market price of the stock, and the charge is only
actually fixed once the award to the employee is known. Awards granted
under the SAP vest over a period of five years.
(v) Capitalised interest
Under UK GAAP , the Group does not capitalise interest on specific or
general borrowings to finance the construction of certain tangible fixed
assets. Under US GAAP , this interest is capitalised. The amount of interest
capitalised is based on a weighted average method considering the
general borrowings outstanding during the period. Capitalised interest 
is then depreciated as a component of the underlying asset.
(vi) Ordinary dividend
Under UK GAAP , ordinary dividends proposed are provided for in the 
year in respect of which they are recommended by the Board of Directors
although approval of the final dividend will not take place until the Company’s
Annual General Meeting subsequent to the year-end. Under US GAAP ,
such dividends are provided for in the year in which they are declared 
and approved by the Board of Directors.
(vii) Derivative instruments and hedging activities
Under UK GAAP , derivative financial instruments that reduce exposures 
on anticipated future transactions may be accounted for using hedge
accounting. Under US GAAP all derivatives are recorded at fair value. 
If certain conditions and criteria set out in FAS 133 “Accounting for
Derivative Instruments and Hedging Activities” are met, hedge accounting
would apply. Wolseley has designated the majority of its derivative financial
instruments as qualifying hedge instruments under US GAAP and as such,
these instruments are carried at fair value with valuation adjustments
recorded through other comprehensive income.
(viii) Presentation of earnings per share
Basic net income per share is computed by dividing net income by the
weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding. Diluted net
income per share is computed by dividing net income by the weighted
average number of ordinary shares and potentially dilutive ordinary shares,
which includes the dilutive effect of stock options. Dilutive potential
ordinary shares for all periods presented are computed utilising the
treasury stock method. 
(ix) Restructuring costs
Under UK GAAP , a provision for restructuring costs is recognised only
when a present obligation (legal or constructive) exists as a result of a past
event; it is probable that a transfer of economic benefits will be required 
to settle the obligation; and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount
of the obligation.
Under US GAAP , for restructuring plans initiated after 1 January 2003, 
a liability for a cost associated with an exit or disposal activity can only 
be recognised when the liability is incurred. An entity’s commitment 
to a plan, by itself, does not create a present obligation to others that 
meets the definition of a liability. The timing of recognition and related
measurement of a liability for one-time termination benefits in relation 
to employees who are to be involuntarily terminated depends on whether
the employees are required to render service until they are terminated in
order to receive the termination benefits and, if so, whether employees 
will be retained to render service beyond the minimum retention period.

to the members of Wolseley plc
We have audited the financial statements which comprise the profit and
loss account, the balance sheet, the cash flow statement, the statement 
of total recognised gains and losses and the related notes which have
been prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting
policies set out in the statement of accounting policies. We have also audited
the disclosures required by Part 3 of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act
1985 contained in the Directors’ remuneration report (“the auditable part”).
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and
Accounts and the financial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and accounting standards are set out in the
statement of Directors’ responsibilities. The Directors are also responsible
for preparing the Directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the auditable part
of the Directors’ remuneration report in accordance with relevant legal and
regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by
the Auditing Practices Board. This report, including the opinion, has been
prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose.
We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or 
into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our prior
consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give 
a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the auditable
part of the Directors’ remuneration report have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Directors’ report is not consistent with the financial statements,
if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, 
or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and
transactions is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and
Accounts and consider the implications for our report if we become 
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with 
the financial statements. The other information comprises only the
Directors’ report, the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration 
report, the Chairman’s statement, the Group Chief Executive’s review, 
the operating and financial review and the corporate governance statement. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined Code
issued in June 1998 specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required
to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all
risks and controls, or to form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with auditing standards issued 
by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test
basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report. 
It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements
made by the directors in the preparation of the financial statements, 
and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information
and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements and the auditable part of the Directors’ remuneration report 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
> the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs 
of the Company and the Group at 31 July 2004 and of the profit and
cash flows of the Group for the year then ended;
> the financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance
with the Companies Act 1985; and
> those parts of the Directors’ remuneration report required by Part 3 
of Schedule 7A to the Companies Act 1985 have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

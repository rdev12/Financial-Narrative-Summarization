Outperformance 155.3 187.1 Results
In a difficult year for markets, it is not surprising to report that our 
fifth year as an investment trust has resulted in a decline of 4.6% in 
our net asset value per share, although this should be taken in the
context of an 10.9% decline in the FTSE All-Share index. Given that 
the share prices of our second and fourth largest holdings, being
Close Brothers and Quintain Estates, fell by 39% and 50% respectively,
this outperformance reflects the sound quality of our overall portfolio.
It also reinforces the validity of our long standing investment
approach, which is to take significant stakes for the longer term 
in promising quoted and unquoted companies with management
teams whom we have got to know and trust. This is similarly 
reflected in our continued longer term outperformance against 
our benchmark FTSE All-Share T otal Return index over five and 
ten years of 155% and 187% respectively.
Share price and discount
Our share price fell by 0.8% over the year from 2066 pence to 
2050 pence and, against the 5% decline in net asset value per share
already mentioned, this reflected a narrowing of the share price
discount from 8.5% to 4.9%. Our share price total return over one
year , which assumes reinvestment of dividends, was positive at 0.8%.
Dividend
We are pleased to propose a 4.6% increase of 1.0 pence in the final
dividend to 22.6 pence per share payable on 14 August 2008. This will
bring the total dividend for the year to 32.5 pence, representing an
increase of 4.5% over the previous year and costing £18.7m. We shall
have increased our annual dividend to shareholders for forty-one
consecutive years.
Portfolio and liquidity
The Chief Executive reviews the detailed changes to our portfolio 
in his report. In overall terms we have adopted a more cautious
approach to the market over the past year with investments made in
five new situations totalling £48m compared with 14 new situations
in the previous year costing £128m. Follow-on investments totalled
£156m compared with £162m last year . T ogether investments 
made exceeded realisations during the year by £89m, which,
adjusted for movements in working capital, reduced our net liquidity
from £109m to £24m. Whilst we remain cautious about markets, 
we would wish to be in a position to take advantage of the potentially
interesting opportunities which are likely to arise from these difficult
times and we are looking at arranging appropriate borrowing facilities.

Staff
We are fortunate to have a close knit and dedicated team at
Caledonia and it has been a busy year for them. Regulations, which
often emanate from an unaccountable bureaucracy in Brussels or are
imposed on industry in a manner which the UK Government opts out
of for its own account as in the public sector pensions arena, continue
to grow alarmingly and impose an unwelcome additional burden on
the workload of our team and, worse, for the competitiveness of our
economy in global markets. I would like to thank the Caledonia team
on behalf of shareholders for their unstinting and diligent efforts.
Outlook
The financial markets have suffered unprecedented difficulties and
the impact of all this is only now filtering through to the wider
economy. This undoubtedly has further to go and inflation is likely 
to be the next issue to consider . So there is no easy road ahead 
but opportunities are bound to present themselves which we 
shall address with our traditional approach ever mindful of the
difficult environment.
Peter Buckley
Chairman
Economic and political background
I have customarily made reference to the economic and political
background and the impact it has on our business and for some years
I have been strongly critical of the present Government. In the past
year many of their chickens have come home to roost and what a
shabby lot they look. Shorn of integrity and economic competence,
Rooster Brown has even less feathers than Rooster Blair and lacks 
the latter’s knack of preening himself. It is heartening that the recent
local elections, exemplified by the change of the Mayor in London 
and the Crewe by-election, would both suggest that the electorate 
is seeking change.
Fuelled by the greed of the US investment banks, the principal
culprits in the sub-prime crisis, many other banks had lowered their
standards to an alarming degree which the Government, through 
its Brown-imposed three way regulatory framework of T reasury, 
Bank of England and Financial Services Authority, utterly failed to
spot. Over the past period of relative plenty, Brown has consistently
and stealthily raised taxes and public expenditure in a way which has
failed to deliver proper value. He blusters about prudent economic
management when Britain is now at the lower end of a number 
of European economic league tables. Blair and Brown both promised
a referendum on the new constitutional reforms in Europe and 
then reneged. What is particularly distressing in all this, is a growing
politicisation of the civil service and the lack of example being set 
by those at the top in both politics and banking, with self interest
dominating the willingness to take responsibility, which is hardly the
right ethic to instil in future generations. All of this impinges on the
prospects for growth in our economy.
Last year some of these factors led us to ask our shareholders 
for the authority to make contributions of up to £60,000 to the
Conservative Party so that it can be equipped better to form an
alternative government. I am pleased to report that we had a ringing
endorsement in favour of this from the overwhelming majority 
of our shareholders. The year just past has strengthened our belief 
in this initiative although the Conservatives will have to be careful 
and consistent with their policy pronouncements. We shall ask our
shareholders for permission to donate again to the Conservative
Party with an increase in the contribution to £75,000 in case the next
twelve months turns out to be an election year . The focus of giving
will remain on building resource in the marginal seats where the 
past year’s contributions were also targeted.
“Continuing outperformance
against our benchmark
again validates our
investment approach.”
Peter Buckley
Chairman 04 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Directors’ report
This time last year we expressed a cautious stance to investment, 
and the last 12 months have shown this to be right. We have seen
considerable turbulence in the markets and major falls in many 
asset values. Over the 12 months ended 31 March 2008, the FTSE 
All-Share index fell by 10.9%. Against this backdrop the much smaller
fall in our own diluted net asset value (‘NAV’) per share of 4.6%,
although disappointing in absolute terms, nonetheless represented
outperformance of 6.3% against the FTSE All-Share index and has
demonstrated the resilience of our business model in these conditions.
Our aim is to ensure that over rolling five year periods our total
shareholder return consistently outperforms the FTSE All-Share 
T otal Return index, as well as producing positive absolute returns. 
T o achieve that aim, we put our efforts into ensuring that our NAV 
per share consistently outperforms the FTSE All-Share index over 
the medium term. Although we cannot always expect in the shorter 
term period of one year to meet this objective, nonetheless it should
be noted that for each of the last five years – since we converted 
to investment trust status and have been measuring NAV on a
consistent basis – our NAV per share has outperformed the FTSE 
All-Share index as demonstrated in the charts below. These indicate
that our long term approach to investment is working to produce 
for our shareholders the results to which we aspire, and has been
delivering in both upturns and downturns in the market. 
Significant changes in value
The falls in market prices of equities in the financial and property
sectors have been particularly severe and, over the 12 months, 
the FTSE Financial sector as a whole fell by 23.6%, while the Real
Estate sector fell by 35.3%. Not surprisingly, the values of a number 
of our investments in these sectors also fell.
Our investment in Close Brothers fell in value by over £70m. In
the short term its business was adversely affected by the unwelcome
threat of a hostile bid (which never materialised) by the much smaller
Cenkos Securities. Nonetheless, we believe Close Brothers is now
particularly well positioned for present market conditions and we
have in fact taken advantage of the low share price to invest a further
£7.3m during March 2008 as we believe there should be significant
potential for value creation over the medium term.
Our investment in Quintain Estates produced the other
substantial fall in value with a diminution of £53.4m. Its share price
fall over the year was also accentuated by the confirmation from an
unwelcome bidder that its potential offer would not proceed.
Notwithstanding the malaise in the property sector , we consider
Quintain Estates, with its relatively low level of debt and special
development situations in Wembley and Greenwich, also to be well
positioned for value creation over the longer term.
Other significant falls in value within these sectors included
Polar Capital (down £16.9m), T errace Hill (down £12.6m) and
Rathbone Brothers (down £12.0m). In all cases we believe these 
to be well run, strong companies, and are confident that they will
show good gains in value over the medium term.
Substantially offsetting the various falls in value have been 
a number of notable gains in value including:
• Oval (£27.2m gain), our unquoted UK insurance broking
investment, which has been successfully acquiring and
consolidating smaller broking businesses and thereby 
significantly increasing profitability.

Invested in the year , including

£204m
Our business philosophy, which centres around being 
a long term supportive and constructively involved shareholder , 
does mean that we do not normally liquidate our shareholdings 
in good companies just because of anticipated downturns in the
market as a whole. Instead, during the last financial year and in order
to provide some downside protection of the value of our portfolio 
in a falling market, we invested, through a subsidiary, a total of £12m
in FTSE 250 put options. The value of these put options had of course
substantially grown by the end of the period as a result of both 
falls in the index and increased volatility and this increase (of £7.6m
pre-tax) has helped in part to offset the falls in value of some of 
our investments.

Costs
We continued to keep a tight rein on costs, believing that every
pound spent is a pound less of our shareholders’ net assets. Although
our investment style is considerably more hands-on than most
investment trusts, it is our continuing aim to contain our pre-tax total
expense ratio (‘TER’) around the 1% level, and to keep it significantly
below the average for the investment trust industry as a whole. 
Our pre-tax TER for the year was 1.0%, which is significantly
below the pre-tax weighted investment trust industry average of
1.4%. Moreover , given that our expenses contain all performance
payments to executives, including bonus and share-based payments,
this compares very favourably indeed with the private equity
industry, which also involves a ‘hands-on’ investment style, but 
which industry is much shorter term than Caledonia and one where
investors typically have to pay fees of both 2% per annum of assets
managed and 20% of the gains made.
Outlook
The immediate economic outlook is not encouraging. In the US,
consumer debt, including mortgages, has increased over the last
seven years from around 65% of annual GDP to 94% – it is a similar
picture in the UK with the ratio increasing from 70% to just over 100%.
The UK economy is now starting to feel the adverse effects of this
excessive binge-borrowing. Recession is a real possibility. However ,
we believe we are well positioned through being invested and
involved in sound businesses that we understand well and where
usually we have board participation.
As the economic situation further unfolds, we expect a number
of particularly good investment opportunities to arise and may well
put in place term bank facilities for up to £100m.
Tim Ingram
Chief Executive
• TGE Marine (£15.5m gain), our formerly unquoted marine gas
engineering investment headquartered in Bonn, which is enjoying
strong revenue and profitability growth. Since our financial year
end, this business has listed on the AIM market leading to further
substantial value gains.
• Bristow Group (£16.2m gain), the US quoted helicopter operating
company, which is benefiting from the buoyant conditions in the 
oil and gas industry.
• Cobepa (£12.1m gain), the unquoted Brussels based private equity
investment company.
• Marketform (£10.5m gain), where we realised our investment 
in this UK unquoted insurance company through a trade sale.
Investment activity
The year was another one of busy activity. Our Investment
Committee analysed 104 new investment opportunities (which
compares with 130 the previous year) but, as a result of our cautious
stance, only made five new investments totalling £48m (versus 14
totalling £128m in the previous year). We were however more active
in follow-on situations where we have been able to benefit from falls
in market prices providing good buying opportunities in businesses
we know well. We thus invested a further £144m in follow-on
business investments and, as mentioned above, £12m in FTSE 250
put options, making a total investment of £204m – considerably
lower than the £290m we had invested in the previous year . 
More information on investments is given in the business 
review on page 13. It is worth noting that as at 31 March 2008 the
total value of our Indian investments (including two UK quoted
entities that focus exclusively on India) was £88m, representing 7.0%
of shareholders’ funds – up from 5.4% at the previous year end, and
reflecting both further investment and growth in value.
Much effort is spent on being actively and constructively
involved with the managements of our investee companies to 
help create long term value. It is our normal policy for Caledonia
executives to join the board of an investee company where we have 
a significant stake and at the year end we had our executives on the
boards of 26 of our top 30 investments. 
Realisations totalled £114m, substantially down on the £317m
realised during the previous year . The largest was the sale for £21m 
of our 27% stake in Marketform, an unquoted insurance company,
which represented a 100% uplift in the value of this investment as 
at 31 March 2007. More information on realisations is given on 
page 13 in the business review. 
During the year , we purchased into treasury 277,229 of our
shares at a total cost of £5.6m. 
We started the year with around £109m of liquidity. 
Essentially as a result of the above activity this reduced to about
£24m at 31 March 2008.
“Another year of busy activity ,
particularly in our active and
constructive involvement 
with investee companies.”

Objectives and strategy
08 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Directors’ report
Objectives
Caledonia aims to achieve a long term total shareholder return in
excess of the FTSE All-Share T otal Return index, whilst maintaining 
a progressive annual dividend, through a focused portfolio of
significant stakes in companies where we believe there to be good
opportunities for building value. 
Caledonia measures its performance over the long term by
comparing its total shareholder return against the FTSE All-Share
T otal Return index over five and ten year periods. 
In addition, Caledonia aims to achieve a positive total return
over rolling five year periods.
Strategy
Caledonia’s strategy is to invest in and actively manage significant
stakes in 30 to 40 companies and situations where we believe there 
to be good opportunities for building value. Active management will
usually be achieved by working closely and constructively with the
investee managements, and usually with board representation, as 
a long term supportive shareholder . We self-manage our portfolio,
using in-house expertise, as well as using third party managers who
specialise in particular asset classes or geographical areas. 
Caledonia seeks new investments with a typical size of £10m 
to £25m, although we may invest up to £100m in exceptional
circumstances. Although Caledonia usually aims to have an influential
minority stake, we will, on occasion, be prepared to take a controlling
interest where we believe that this will maximise shareholder value.
When considering an investment opportunity, we take particular
care in appraising the capabilities and commitment of the
management team of the prospective investee company. The
anticipated total return from the investment, the strategy in relation
to it, and the overall risks, are carefully analysed as part of the
investment process. 
Caledonia will invest part of its portfolio in third party managed
funds. Again, a core skill is our ability to assess the capabilities and
commitment of the fund management team and we will often seek
to obtain a significant stake in the management company, thereby
potentially enhancing returns to shareholders. 
Caledonia seeks to work closely and constructively with the
managements of companies that it has backed and to make available
the considerable experience of our own team to help the investee
companies’ managements to address their business issues. The
strategy for each investment, including the returns and the timing 
of eventual disposal, is reviewed regularly. Investments are realised
when we believe that the funds released can provide better long term
returns, but in a manner consistent with Caledonia’s reputation 
as a supportive, long term investor . 
Whilst the source of funding for new investments generally
comes from its own resources, Caledonia may at times seek to
enhance returns by taking on moderate levels of gearing. 
Tight control is exercised over costs, notwithstanding
Caledonia’s active and participative management style. Cost
containment is significantly aided by managing the large majority 
of investments through our in-house management team. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 09 Directors’ report
The financial review discusses the results of the company for the
financial year and refers to the company’s income statement and
balance sheet. In addition to holding minority stakes in investee
businesses, the company holds majority stakes in a number of
companies. The results of these companies are included in the
consolidated financial statements. However , management views
these majority stakes as part of the company’s investment portfolio
and they are included in the discussion below in this context. Where
appropriate, the financial review refers to aspects of the consolidated
financial statements.
Key performance indicators
Our key performance indicators are as follows:
• Diluted net asset value per share growth against the movement 
in the FTSE All-Share index over one year
• Share price total return performance against the FTSE All-Share
index over five and ten years
• Absolute share price total return over five years
• T otal expenses ratio
• Deal flow.
Diluted net asset value per share
Net asset value (‘NAV’) per share, on a diluted basis, was 2155p 
at 31 March 2008, compared with 2258p at the same date in 2007
and 2044p in 2006. The decrease over the year of 103p (-4.6%)
resulted principally from the movement in portfolio value (-11.8%)
and annual dividends paid (-1.5%).

(2007 – £1,311.0m) due to the inclusion of investments in
subsidiaries at fair value in the company balance sheet as opposed to
the underlying share of net assets in the consolidated balance sheet.
T otal return
Caledonia incurred a negative total return for the year ended 
31 March 2008 of £43.3m, which equates to -3.3% on opening
equity, compared with +10.5% in 2007. The key components were
net losses on investments, partially offset by investment income
recognised over the year . The loss for the year and net income
recognised directly in equity together comprise the company’s

Gross portfolio return
Gross portfolio return comprises gains and losses on investments,
investment income and other items. The chart below illustrates the
gross portfolio return for the past three financial years. The reduced
performance in 2008, compared with 2007, reflected the downturn
in equity markets. The FTSE All-Share index fell by 10.9% in 2008,
compared with an increase of 7.7% in 2007.
Net gains and losses on investments for the year amounted to a
£70.2m loss compared with a gain of £96.5m for the previous year .
An analysis of this return is given in table 3.

Unquoted investments 91.2 54.4 
Quoted investments (161.4) 42.1

Gains on unquoted investments included £27.2m for Oval, the UK
regional insurance broker , £15.5m for TGE Marine, the German gas
transport and storage engineering business, £12.1m for Cobepa, 
the Belgian investment company, and £10.5m for Marketform, the
non-US medical insurance services business, the value of which was
realised near the year end. Losses on unquoted investments included
£17.7m relating to Incisive Media, the UK business to business
publisher and £9.7m for Ermitage, the Jersey-based funds of hedge
funds manager . Losses on quoted investments included £70.7m 
for Close Brothers, £53.4m for Quintain Estates, £16.9m for Polar
Capital, £12.6m for T errace Hill and £12.0m for Rathbone Brothers,
partially offset by gains including £16.2m for Bristow Group. 
Net gains on derivatives of £0.3m comprised gains on a forward
currency purchase contract, compared with £5.6m in 2007, of which
£6.0m related to gains on forward currency sale contracts, to hedge
our US dollar exposure, and £0.4m related to a loss on a basket of
options to hedge against fluctuations in deferred proceeds on the
sale of an investment. 
Investment income of £39.5m was 1.5% lower than the £40.1m
booked in 2007. This decrease resulted principally from the receipt 
in 2007 of dividends from Sterling Industries, the Sloane Club and
Buckingham Gate, which were not repeated in 2008. The investment
income impairment in 2008 comprised an impairment of interest
accrued from high-yielding loan notes.

Oval’s return of £28.3m reflected improved trading and a recent
arm’s length market transaction. TGE Marine’s increase of £18.2m
reflected a substantial improvement in the offshore business. Bristow
Group benefited from high levels of activity in the oil and gas industry ,
with firm oil prices and strong demand. Cobepa’s investment
portfolio showed strong gains. Marketform’s uplift resulted from 
the sale of our stake during the year . A decline in the equity markets
over the year was reflected in the reduced market prices of Rathbone
Brothers, T errace Hill, Polar Capital, Quintain Estates and Close
Brothers. ‘Other investments’ comprised a number of investments
with gross returns of less than £7.0m of gain or loss each.

Expenses
Management expenses comprised the costs incurred in managing
the operations of the company and totalled £11.2m for the year ,
compared with £11.0m in 2007. 
Other expenses of £1.7m (2007 – £1.1m) comprised
transaction costs of potential and completed investments of £0.3m
(2007 – £0.5m), £0.6m of performance fees to third party managers
and £0.8m of other costs. In 2007, £0.6m of expenses related to the
elective special dividend.
T reasury income and expenses
T reasury income and expenses, totalling £3.9m (2007 – £3.5m),
reflected the net returns on treasury assets during the year . The
company held net liquidity in term deposits, averaging £58.6m over
the year . Also included were exchange losses of £0.2m (2007 –
£0.7m), which arose from holding foreign currency balances.
Dividends
During the year , we paid dividends of 31.5p per share (2007 – 30.0p),
amounting to £18.2m (2007 – £18.5m), representing the final
dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March 2007 of 21.6p per
share and the interim dividend in respect of the year ended 31 March
2008 of 9.9p per share. Caledonia maintains a progressive dividend
policy and has an unbroken record of annual dividend increases over
the last 41 consecutive years.
In July 2006, we paid £102.9m in the form of an elective special
dividend of 1902.17p for each share elected subsequent to an
offering to shareholders to participate in a return of funds. The
elected shares were subsequently cancelled for £nil consideration.
T reasury and employee trust shares
Shares held in treasury and held by the employee share trust are
excluded from the NAV per share calculations. 
At 31 March 2008, 661,131 shares were accounted as held in
treasury, of which 277,229 shares were bought during the year 
at a cost of £5.6m and 243,902 shares were subject to a buy-back
arrangement whereby, for the duration of the close period from 
1 April 2008 to the announcement of our preliminary results on 
29 May 2008, we had given an irrevocable undertaking to our 
broker , JPMorgan Cazenove, to purchase the company’s shares on
our behalf, within certain parameters. This instruction was subject 
to a maximum of £5.0m or 250,000 shares. At 31 March 2008, 
£5.0m represented the equivalent value of 243,902 shares at the
mid-market price on that day.
Caledonia operates an employee share trust to hold shares pending
transfer to employees as a result of the exercise of share options or
calling of deferred bonus awards. At 31 March 2008, 700,079 shares
were held by the trust, decreased from 703,284 shares held at the
end of the previous year . During the year , the trust transferred 68,781
shares to staff on exercise of share options and bought 65,576 shares.
These transactions resulted in a net payment by the trust of £0.8m.
NA V per share dilution
The NAV per share dilution adjustment measures the effect of re-
issuing treasury shares at a discount to NAV per share and from the
exercise of executive share options and the calling of deferred bonus
shares by assuming that these events take place at the year end. 
The adjustment is expressed as a free shares equivalent. 
At 31 March 2008, re-issuing the 661,131 shares (2007 – 140,000
shares) accounted as held in treasury at the closing mid-market price
would have yielded proceeds of £13.6m (2007 – £2.9m). In addition,
the exercise of the 1,205,896 in-the-money executive share options
and calling of deferred bonus shares (2007 – 1,217,383) would have
yielded proceeds of £12.3m (2007 – £12.9m). 
The NAV dilution adjustment of 671,000 (2007 – 646,000)
represents the issue of an equivalent number of shares for £nil
consideration to achieve the same dilution effect.
Share price total return
We measure our longer term performance by comparing our share
price total return against the FTSE All-Share T otal Return index over
five and ten year periods and also by our absolute share price total
return over rolling five year periods. The total return measure
assumes the re-investment of dividends on the ex-dividend date 
at the closing share price on that date.
Whilst the share price total return provides an accurate 
measure of investors’ returns, it should be noted that it is based 
on the company’s share price, which is not within the company’s
direct control. 
The chart below shows that shares in Caledonia have produced
a total return to investors of 254% over five years and 228% over 
ten years, compared with total returns of 99% and 41% respectively
from the FTSE All-Share index – outperformance of 155% and 187%.

12 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Directors’ report
As well as seeking to outperform the FTSE All-Share T otal Return
index over five and ten year periods, the company also aims to 
deliver positive total return on a rolling five year basis. This measure 
is illustrated in the following chart:
Over the last ten years, we have made a positive total return over
rolling five year periods, except for a short period in late March and
early April 2003.
T otal expenses ratio
The calculation of our pre-tax total expenses ratio (‘TER’) is based 
on our adjusted annualised management expenses, divided by
closing net assets. Management expenses reflect the cost of managing
the investment portfolio and exclude third party performance fees,
investment transaction costs and restructuring costs. 
For the purposes of calculating the TER, management expenses
reported in the income statement are adjusted to expense the fair
value of equity rights granted under our deferred bonus plan in the
year to which the awards relate. This differs from the accounting
treatment, which expenses some of the entitlements over the 
three year vesting period. The effect of this adjustment is to increase
reported management expenses by £1.7m to £12.9m in 2008, 
by £0.1m to £11.1m in 2007 and by £1.4m to £12.2m in 2006.
Deal flow
Our ability to access attractive investment opportunities, through
our extensive network, is crucial to our strategy of being a long term,
supportive investor . We measure our deal flow according to the
number of opportunities that have passed our initial screening
process and warrant further investigation as opportunities in which
we might be interested in investing. During the year , we actively
considered 104 new investment opportunities, compared with 
130 in 2007.
Cash flows
The key cash flows during the year comprised an aggregate inflow 
of £115.0m (2007 – £309.5m) from the realisation of investments
and outflow of £199.7m (2007 – £290.4m) for the purchase 
of investments. In addition, in 2007, there was a cash outflow of
£102.9m in respect of the elective special dividend paid in July 2006.
At the year end, we held cash equivalents totalling £23.5m 
(2007 – £108.6m).
Gearing
Caledonia had no debt at 31 March 2008 (2007 – £nil). During 2007,
borrowings rose to £43.0m for a short period to finance in part the
elective special dividend. Those borrowings were repaid between July
and September 2006 from the proceeds of investment realisations. 
Subsidiary companies of Caledonia had borrowings totalling
£67.8m at 31 March 2008 (2007 – £66.0m) to finance operations.
Caledonia provided bank guarantees in respect of £63.7m of these
borrowings (2007 – £51.5m).

Business review
16 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Directors’ report
Caledonia’s reputation and successful
long term record has been built upon two
principles that we believe set us apart.
We have a long term investment horizon,
underpinned by a strong balance sheet
and stable ownership structure. 
This enables the management teams 
we back to pursue their strategies,
confident that we are able to resist 
short term market pressures.
We seek a close involvement with
management through board
representation and strong and
supportive working relationships. 
This leads to a clear understanding 
of the objectives and motivations of 
our management partners and enables 
us to help them realise their goals.
TGE Marine
TGE Marine (formerly TGE Gas Engineering) is a gas engineering
business based in Germany. We facilitated the management buyout
from Suez Group in early 2006, supporting the original founder of 
the business and his management team. We were attracted to this
investment by the quality of the management team, who have spent
twenty years together building the business, and by the growth
prospects in the oil and gas support services sector . One of TGE
Marine’s areas of expertise is with liquefied natural gas (‘LNG’), a fast
growing sector of the industry. During the year , TGE Marine took 
its first order for a small scale LNG carrier and has high hopes for 
the future. This will complement its strong position in the ethylene
carrier market. 
As at 31 March 2008, Caledonia had invested £19.2m in TGE
Marine. After selling its onshore business, TGE Marine completed 
a successful IPO on AIM in mid-May 2008. We have retained a 35%
stake in the business, in line with our long term investment philosophy .

Oval
Oval is one of the UK’s leading commercial insurance brokers
specialising in providing risk management and financial services
advice to corporate and owner managed businesses. Oval’s strategy
is to grow its business substantially through the acquisition of quality
regional broking businesses and developing strong and profitable
relationships with leading insurance providers to Oval’s market. 
Since we invested in 2003, we have worked very closely with
management at Oval to implement this strategy both through
providing further capital and working at board level to strengthen
and develop the team as the business grows. 
Over the last year especially, we have seen this effort bear fruit.
Oval made a number of acquisitions and had positioned itself by the
end of the year for continued strong growth through a healthy
pipeline of further acquisitions, with additional funding from
Caledonia, through a £15m convertible loan stock facility, and from
an insurance investor . 
The UK commercial insurance broking sector has recently seen a
lot of takeover and investment activity and Oval is well placed as the
leading independently owned broking business in the sector .
Avanti Communications
Avanti is in the process of designing and building an £80m satellite
(its first) in conjunction with Astrium and the European Space
Agency. The Hylas I is scheduled for launch in the first quarter of 2009
and will deliver broadband and corporate data network services using
Ka-band across Europe. 
The long term nature of Avanti’s satellite project, with the
prospect of substantial returns and further projects, ideally suits
Caledonia’s investment style. We invested £10.0m in equity in 2005
and a further £5.6m to date, increasing our holding to 24.4%. In
addition, in July 2007, we provided £7.0m as part of Avanti’s £35m
debt-raising, to complete funding of the satellite development. 
Avanti also has an established satellite-based broadband
business, renting space and selling and managing corporate data
networks and wholesale broadband services to retailers, as well as 
a consultancy business advising companies and governments 
on the design and commercialisation of space technology. Avanti 
has recently been chosen to lead the UK Government’s project to
demonstrate the role of satellite communications in road user charging.
Caledonia’s involvement and supportive
stance as a long term investor is ideally
suited to companies with ambitious,
longer term growth plans. Business review

London & Stamford Property
London & Stamford Property is a recently launched, Guernsey-based
and AIM listed property investment company that aims to benefit
from the currently depressed property markets. It plans to invest 
in commercial property, including office, retail and distribution 
real estate assets, principally in the UK, but also overseas, where 
it believes opportunities exist to extract above-average returns.
London & Stamford Property will be an active investor and intends 
to implement strategies to enhance the quality and value of acquired
assets and improve annual rental values. The management team has
a strong track record, previously building and selling Arlington
Securities and Pillar Property. 
In November 2007, Caledonia invested £19.5m for a 6.8% stake
in London & Stamford Property and we hope to see this company
build its portfolio over the next two to three years.
Retif

Sea, Norway, Ireland, Spain, Indonesia and Vietnam and has built a

success is less certain but the potential rewards are more significant.

Business highlights
20 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Directors’ report
Polar Capital
Caledonia has enjoyed a long and profitable relationship with Polar
Capital, the successful fund manager , and we continue our support
by seeding new fund launches. During the year , Polar Capital
launched its long-only Healthcare Opportunities fund, in which we
invested £5.0m. 
We originally helped the management team establish Polar
Capital in 2001 and have worked closely with them ever since to
facilitate an ownership structure and entrepreneurial culture which
enables them to attract top quality fund managers to expand their
business, which now manages some $3.2bn of assets. 
The culmination of this stage in Polar Capital’s development
was its successful flotation on AIM in February 2007. Our current
holding is valued at £8.7m, compared with our equity investment
cost of £0.7m.
Eddington Capital
Caledonia has built a close relationship with the successful
management team at Eddington Capital. We helped establish the
business in 2003 and provided £15.0m of seed capital for their
flagship product, the Eddington T riple Alpha Fund (‘ET AF’). The ET AF
is a fund of hedge funds, offering a diversified multi-strategy product,
which aims to outperform the mainstream competition without
using portfolio-level leverage. The ET AF has been highly successful
and has returned 82.8% since its launch in August 2003. 
In June 2007, Eddington Capital launched, and Caledonia
seeded, the Eddington Macro Opportunities Fund (‘EMOF’), a fund 
of macro-based or macro-related hedge funds with a variety of styles
and strategies, which has returned 22.8%. More recently, Eddington
has launched the Eddington Equity Opportunities Fund (‘EEOF’), a
fund of hedge funds looking to maximise returns from opportunities
in the global equity markets. 
Eddington has adopted some imaginative marketing initiatives,
with the issue of the Nomura Eddington Notes – performance linked
notes issued by Nomura and giving indirect exposure to the ET AF ,
EMOF and EEOF . The notes are listed on the London Stock Exchange
and were designed to be eligible for Capital Gains T ax treatment in
the UK.
We work closely with management
teams to understand and help them
achieve their business objectives. This
approach is ideally suited to backing
growing asset management businesses. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 21 Directors’ report
Vietnam
We have extended the range of our activities in Asia through
selectively building a portfolio of £9.7m in four companies in
Vietnam, two quoted and two traded over the counter (‘OTC’). 
In each case, we co-invested alongside our local partner and 
adviser , Dragon Capital, which is one of Vietnam’s leading 
investment management groups.
Our quoted investments were in Sacombank, Vietnam’s 
second largest and fastest growing non-state banking group, 
and SaigonT el, an information technology group providing a range 
of telecommunications products and building hi-tech business parks.
Our OTC investments comprised Hoang Anh Gia Lai, a diversified
manufacturer and one of the largest residential property
development businesses in Vietnam, and An Phu Binh Duong, 
a food irradiation business treating seafood for export.
India and China
Our Indian portfolio is now well established and we continue to 
build relationships with the managements of the Indian companies 
in which we invest. We now have direct and indirect Indian
investments totalling £87.5m. 
Our established Indian quoted investments included Alok
Industries, a textile manufacturer , Varun Shipping, a shipping
company transporting gas and oil products, and Dewan Housing
Finance, a provider of housing finance. During the year , we invested 
in Arihant, a developer of commercial and residential buildings. 
We also hold interests in two AIM listed funds investing in 
India. The India Capital Growth Fund is a strategic investor in small 
to mid-cap Indian companies and Eredene Capital is a specialist 
Indian property and infrastructure fund. 
We have been more cautious about the pace at which we
develop our investment activities in China. We have developed our
relationship with the team of Capital T oday, which manages a $280m
growth fund in which we are a cornerstone investor , and retain our
investment in Kingdom Holdings, a manufacturer of linen yarns.
Our strategy in Asia has been to work
alongside local partners who have 
a profound knowledge of the
marketplace, to seek opportunities
that would benefit from our long
term investing model. Business review
Risks and uncertainties
22 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Directors’ report
T reasury and funding risk
T reasury risks principally comprise counterparty risk, uncertainty in
market prices and rates and the requirement to access adequate
funds to meet investment needs or other obligations as they fall due. 
The main funding risks faced by Caledonia are interest rate risk
and exchange rate risk. The level of these risks is addressed by the
overall funding objective and the board regularly reviews and
approves policies on the approach to each of these risks. 
Caledonia’s foreign exchange risk management policy allows
for exposure to structural and transactional currency movements. 
In the event that there is an exit plan for a foreign currency
denominated investment, a view will be taken of likely currency
movements over the period to expected realisation and part or all 
of the exposure may be hedged using foreign currency contracts or
currency derivatives. 
The exposure to interest rate movements on treasury assets 
is managed through the use of term deposits and money market
funds. Where there are group borrowings, exposure to interest rate
movements is managed through the use of derivatives, such as caps
and collars, where appropriate. 
Counterparty risk is managed through an approved list 
of counterparties with maximum aggregate exposures agreed 
by the board. 
Day-to-day management of treasury activities is delegated to
executive directors and to the Group T reasurer . A detailed report on
liquid assets and cash flow projections is submitted to the Executive
Committee on a weekly basis. Monthly reports on Caledonia’s
funding position and cash flow forecasts are considered by the board.
Operational risk
Operational risk arises from potentially inadequate or failed processes,
people and systems or from external factors. 
Inadequate or failed processes could result in the
misappropriation of assets, loss of income and debtor receipts and
misreporting of NA V per share. The board regularly reviews statements
on internal controls and risk management procedures and subjects
the books and records of the company to an annual audit. 
The ability to recruit, develop and retain capable people is 
of fundamental importance to Caledonia’s strategy and the loss of
key staff could adversely affect investment returns. The company
operates in a competitive industry and aims to remunerate staff in
line with market practice, to provide development opportunities 
and to encourage staff motivation and retention. 
A business continuity strategy is in place to ensure that
operations can continue in the event of disruption. This strategy has
been assessed against a detailed business impact analysis and is
regularly tested.
Caledonia has a risk management framework that provides 
a structured process for identifying, assessing and managing risks
associated with the company’s business objectives and strategy.
External risk
External risks arise from political, legal, regulatory and economic
changes. Failure to comply with regulations could result in the
company losing its listing and/or being subjected to UK corporation
tax on its capital gains. 
The company seeks to operate within applicable legal and
regulatory frameworks. A Compliance Committee meets weekly 
and reviews Caledonia’s current business for regulatory compliance, 
as well as considering investment proposals from a compliance
perspective. The board receives and reviews regular reports on the
controls in place to prevent non-compliance by the company with
rules and regulations.
Strategic risk
Strategic risks arise from the conception, design and implementation
of the company’s business model and key decisions on investment
levels and capital allocations. An inappropriate investment strategy
could result in poor returns for shareholders. The board reviews
strategy periodically.
Investment risk
Investment risk occurs in respect of specific investment decisions,
subsequent performance of an investment or concentration of
exposure to an economic sector or geographical region. 
In addition to financial, legal and market due diligence,
Caledonia’s investment appraisal includes a rigorous assessment 
of investee management’s track record of success and commitment
to growing their business. All potential investments are presented 
to Caledonia’s Executive Committee, which comprises executive
directors and other senior managers, and meets weekly. Any
individual investment of £20m or more requires board approval. 
Having made the investment decision, a process is put in place
for managing the relationship with the investee company for the
period through to realisation. This will usually include board
representation by a Caledonia investment executive. The executive
will make regular reports to the Executive Committee on issues
relevant to the investments for which he or she is responsible and
there is a process of cyclical reporting to the board. 
Caledonia invests in a range of economic sectors and
geographical regions. The portfolio is monitored monthly against
board approved guidelines to ensure that there is no undue exposure. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 23 Directors’ report

Details of the directors’ options to acquire ordinary shares in the
company and awards over ordinary shares under the company’s deferred
bonus plan as at 31 March 2008 are set out in the directors’ remuneration
report on pages 53 to 59.
Directors’ indemnity
Each of the directors has the benefit, under the company’s articles of
association, of an indemnity, to the extent permitted by the Companies
Act 2006, against all costs, charges, losses and expenses and liabilities
incurred by him in the execution or discharge of his duties or the exercise
of his powers as a director or otherwise in relation thereto.
Share capital structure
The company has two classes of share capital – ordinary shares of 5p each
and deferred ordinary shares of 5p each. 
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends
as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share 
at meetings of the company. All voting rights are however suspended 
in respect of the company’s shares that are held in treasury or by 
group companies. 
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and are not
redeemable. They carry the right to a fixed cumulative preference
dividend of 1% per annum (exclusive of any associated tax credit) of the
nominal value of such deferred ordinary shares, being 0.05p per share, or
£4,000 in aggregate, for all such shares currently in issue. The company is
required to pay the dividend to the extent that it has distributable profits.
On a winding-up or other return of capital, the deferred ordinary shares
carry the right to the payment of the amount paid up on such shares only
after holders of the ordinary shares have received the sum of £100,000 in
respect of each such ordinary share. All of the deferred ordinary shares are
held by Sterling Industries PLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Caledonia. 
At 31 March 2008, 58,794,781 ordinary shares and 8,000,000
deferred ordinary shares were in issue. The ordinary shares therefore
represented approximately 88%, and the deferred ordinary shares
approximately 12%, of the total issued share capital. Of the ordinary
shares in issue at 31 March 2008, 417,229 shares were held in treasury
and 3,000 shares held by group companies. As stated above, all voting
rights are suspended on these shares.
Restrictions on the transfer of shares
There are no specific restrictions on the transfer of the company’s shares,
although the articles of association contain provisions whereby the
directors may refuse to register a transfer of a certificated share which is
not fully paid, provided that such refusal does not prevent dealings in the
share from taking place on an open and proper basis. The directors may
also refuse to register the transfer of a certificated share unless it is (i)
lodged, duly stamped, at the registered office or at such other place as
the directors may appoint, accompanied by the certificate for the shares
to which it relates and such other evidence as the directors may
reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the
transfer; (ii) in respect of only one class of shares; and (iii) in favour of not
more than four transferees. 
The directors may suspend the registration of transfers of shares or
of transfers of any class of shares at such times and for such periods (not
exceeding thirty days in any year) as the board may determine, except
that they may not suspend the registration of transfers of any
uncertificated shares without the consent of CREST . 
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of shares if 
a shareholder has not supplied information to the company in default 
of a request duly served under section 793 of the Companies Act 2006
and such shares represent at least 0.25% of the class of shares concerned. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 27 Directors’ report

which is false or inadequate in a material particular .
Agreements which may restrict the transfer of shares or exercise 
of voting rights
The company is aware of arrangements entered into in March 2004
between Cayzer T rust and a group of its former shareholders which give
Cayzer T rust pre-emption and voting rights over any shares in Caledonia
held by those former shareholders.
Appointment and replacement of directors and articles of association
The appointment and replacement of directors is governed by the
company’s articles of association and prevailing company law. 
The articles of association provide that at every annual general
meeting one-third of the directors, or if not a multiple of three, the
number nearest one-third, shall retire by rotation and therefore be
required to seek re-election by shareholders. In addition, in accordance
with the recommendations of the Combined Code, the company
requires that any non-executive director who has served on the board for
over nine years retires and seeks re-election annually. New directors may
be appointed by the board, but are subject to election by shareholders at
the next general meeting of the company following their appointment.
Shareholders may also appoint new directors by ordinary resolution. The
articles of association limit the number of directors to not less than two
and not more than twelve, unless the shareholders resolve otherwise. 
A director may be removed from office if requested to resign by not
less than four-fifths of the other directors or by an ordinary resolution of
the shareholders. 
Any amendment of the articles of association requires the approval
of shareholders by a special resolution.
Authority to allot and purchase shares
At the annual general meeting of the company held on 19 July 2007,
shareholders granted to the directors authority to allot ordinary shares up
to a nominal amount of £977,080, representing approximately 33.33% of
the ordinary share capital then in issue, excluding shares held in treasury.
The directors were further authorised to issue ordinary shares up to a
nominal amount of £146,562 for cash in connection with a rights issue or
other than pro rata to existing ordinary shareholders. These authorities
last until the next annual general meeting. 
At the annual general meeting held on 19 July 2007, shareholders
also granted authority for the company to make market purchases of up
to 5,862,500 of its own ordinary shares, being approximately 10% of the
ordinary share capital then in issue, excluding shares held in treasury, at a
price not more than the higher of: (a) 5% greater than the average of the
middle market quotations for such ordinary shares during the five
business days preceding any such purchase; and (b) the higher of: (i) the
price of the last independent trade in such ordinary shares; and (ii) the
highest current independent bid relating thereto on the trading venue
where the purchase is carried out, nor at a price less than 5 pence, being
the nominal value of an ordinary share. This authority lasts until 1 January
2009 or , if earlier , the conclusion of the next annual general meeting. At
the same time, shareholders who were not members of the Cayzer family
concert party (‘Cayzer Concert Party’) gave their approval for a waiver by
the Panel on T akeovers and Mergers of the obligation that could arise on
the Cayzer Concert Party under Rule 9 of the City Code on T akeovers and
Mergers to make a general offer for Caledonia on the implementation by
the company of the above authority to purchase its own shares. The
approval was subject to the maximum percentage of voting rights in
which the Cayzer Concert Party is interested not exceeding 49.9% as a
result of purchases by the company. This waiver expires on 19 July 2008.
Change of control agreements
There are no special control rights in relation to the company’s shares. 
Options granted under the company’s executive share option
schemes and awards made under the company’s deferred bonus plan
may become exercisable or vest as a result of a change of control,
although the number of shares comprised in those options or awards may
be reduced. The service contracts of directors and associate directors also
contain provisions whereby a liquidated sum is payable by the company in
the event of termination within one year following a change of control.
Any such liquidated sum would be equivalent to no more than one year’s
total emoluments. 
Employees
Group companies are encouraged to develop their own consultative
policies. These include regular meetings held between local
management and employees to allow a free flow of information 
and ideas. 
The group gives full and fair consideration to applications for
employment from disabled persons, having regard to their aptitudes and
abilities, and group companies make every effort to treat disabled
persons equally with others. Where existing employees become disabled,
it is the group’s policy to provide continuing employment under normal
terms and conditions and to provide training and career development
and promotion to disabled employees wherever appropriate. Directors’ report: statutory information
28 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Directors’ report
Customers and suppliers
The group’s policy in relation to all of its suppliers is to settle the terms 
of payment when agreeing the terms of the transaction. The group will
abide by those terms on condition that it is satisfied that the supplier has
provided the goods or services in accordance with the agreed terms and
conditions. The group does not follow any code or statement on payment
practice and Caledonia itself does not have any trade payables.
Charitable donations
Group companies support chosen community and charitable causes 
local to their areas of operation. Overall, the group made charitable
donations during the year amounting to £110,000. During the year ,
Caledonia Group Services Ltd, a wholly owned subsidiary of the company,
made political donations amounting in total to £45,000 to the
Conservative Party.
Statement of directors’ responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the
financial statements. The directors are required to prepare financial
statements for the group in accordance with International Financial
Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) and have also elected to prepare financial
statements for the company in accordance with IFRS. Company law
requires the directors to prepare such financial statements in accordance
with IFRS, the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial
statements present fairly for each financial year the company’s financial
position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful
representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions
in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets,
liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting
Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the Preparation and Presentation of
Financial Statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation 
will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRS. Directors will 
also be required to:
• properly select and apply accounting policies
• present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that
provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific
requirements of IFRS are insufficient to enable users to understand the
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the
entity’s financial position and financial performance.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
company, for safeguarding the assets, for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the
preparation of the directors’ report: statutory information and directors’
remuneration report in compliance with the requirements of the
Companies Act 1985.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of
the company website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the
preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from
legislation in other jurisdictions.
Going concern
The directors are satisfied that the company and the group have
adequate resources to continue to operate for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason, they continue to adopt the ‘going concern’ basis for
preparing the financial statements.
Auditors
Resolutions will be proposed at the annual general meeting to re-appoint
Deloitte & T ouche LLP as auditors of the company and to authorise the
directors to agree their remuneration. A description of how the Audit
Committee ensures the objectivity and independence of the auditors 
is set out on page 62 within the corporate governance report. 
The directors who held office at the date of approval of this
directors’ report confirm that, so far as each is aware, there is no relevant
audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware and each
director has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a director 
to make himself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish
that the company’s auditors are aware of that information. 
By order of the board
G P Denison
Company Secretary
29 May 2008
We confirm that, to the best of our knowledge:
1. the financial statements, prepared in accordance with IFRS, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position 
and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included 
in the consolidation taken as a whole
2. the management report, which is incorporated into the 
directors’ report, includes a fair review of the development and
performance of the business and the position of the company and the
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together
with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties they face.
Signed on behalf of the board:
Tim Ingram Jonathan Cartwright
Chief Executive Finance Director 
Responsibility statement by the directors Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 29 Financial statements
Independent Auditors’ report 
to the members of Caledonia Investments plc
We have audited the group and parent company financial statements
(the ‘financial statements’) of Caledonia Investments plc for the year
ended 31 March 2008 which comprise the group and parent company
income statements, the group and parent company balance sheets, the
group and parent company cash flow statements, the group and parent
company statements of recognised income and expense, and the related
notes 1 to 34. These financial statements have been prepared under the
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information
in the directors’ remuneration report that is described as having 
been audited. 
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in
accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and
for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not
accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and
the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, 
or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the annual report, the
directors’ remuneration report and the financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards
(‘IFRS’) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the statement 
of directors’ responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the parts 
of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
parts of the directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, as
regards the group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given
in the directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. 
The information given in the directors’ report includes that specific
information presented in the business review that is cross referenced
from the principal activities and results section of the directors’ report. 
In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, the company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions
is not disclosed. 
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006
Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not
required to consider whether the board’s statements on internal control
cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read the other information contained in the annual report as
described in the contents section and consider whether it is consistent
with the audited financial statements. We consider the implications for
our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our
responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on
Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the financial statements and the parts of the directors’
remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgments made by the directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the group’s and company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the
information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the
financial statements and the parts of the directors’ remuneration report
to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error . In forming our opinion, we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
financial statements and the parts of the directors’ remuneration report
to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with
IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state of the group’s and
the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2008 and of the group’s
and the parent company’s loss for the year then ended;
• the financial statements and the parts of the directors’ remuneration
report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985 and, as regards the group financial
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and
• the information given in the directors’ report is consistent with the
financial statements.

Accounting policies
General information
Caledonia Investments plc is an investment trust company domiciled 
in the United Kingdom and incorporated in England, under the
Companies Acts 1908 to 1917. The address of its registered office is
Cayzer House, 30 Buckingham Gate, London SW1E 6NN. The ordinary
shares of the company are listed on the London Stock Exchange and the
New Zealand Exchange. 
These financial statements are presented in pounds sterling
because that is the currency of the primary economic environment in
which Caledonia operates. 
These financial statements were authorised for issue by the
directors on 29 May 2008. In the current year , the group has adopted 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, which is effective for annual
reporting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related
amendment to IAS 1 ‘Presentation of Financial Statements’. The impact
of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 has been to expand the
disclosures provided in these financial statements regarding the group’s
financial instruments and management of capital (note 22). At the date 
of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards
and Interpretations, which have not been applied in these financial
statements, were in issue but not yet effective:
• IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’
• IFRIC 12 ‘Service Concession Agreements’
• IFRIC 13 ‘Customer Loyalty Programmes’
• IFRIC 14 ‘The limit of a defined benefit asset, minimum funding
requirements and their interaction’.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and
Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the
financial statements of the group except for additional segment
disclosures when IFRS 8 comes into effect on 1 January 2009 and the
possible restriction of defined benefit pension assets when IFRIC 14
comes into effect on 1 January 2008.
Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as adopted for use in
the EU and therefore the group financial statements comply with Article 4
of the EU IAS Regulation. IFRS comprise accounting standards issued by
the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) and its predecessor
body as well as interpretations issued by the International Financial
Reporting Interpretations Committee (‘IFRIC’) and its predecessor body. 
Caledonia is an investment trust company. However , because it
holds majority stakes and therefore has the power to control, it is required
to prepare group accounts that consolidate the results of such
investments. In order to present information that is comparable with
other investment trust companies, Caledonia also publishes financial
statements of the company, which include investments in subsidiaries
regarded as part of the company’s investing business at fair value. 
The financial statements have been prepared on an historical cost
basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and
properties. The principal accounting policies are set out below.
Foreign currency translation
T ransactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are
translated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange rate ruling
at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange differences arising on
translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary
assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in a
foreign currency are translated to the functional currency using the
exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value
are translated to the functional currency at foreign exchange rates ruling
at the dates the fair value was determined. 
Assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas operations are
measured using their functional currency, being the currency of the
primary economic environment in which they operate. 
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the group’s overseas
operations are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance
sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average
exchange rates for the period unless exchange rates fluctuate
significantly. Exchange differences arising, if any, are classified as equity
and transferred to the group’s foreign exchange translation reserve. Such
exchange differences are recognised in the income statement in the
period in which the operation is sold. 
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of 
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity 
and translated at the closing rate at the balance sheet date.
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade date where 
a purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms
require delivery of the investment within the timeframe established by
the market concerned, and are initially measured at cost, excluding
transaction costs. 
Investments held as part of the group’s business of investing in
financial assets are designated as measured at fair value through profit 
or loss in both the consolidated financial statements and the company
financial statements. Other investments held by subsidiaries are
designated as available for sale in the consolidated financial statements.
Other investments in subsidiaries held by the company are accounted for
at cost in the financial statements of the company. 
Investments designated as held at fair value through profit or loss 
or as available for sale are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair
value. Gains and losses arising from changes in the value of investments
designated as held at fair value through profit or loss, including foreign
exchange movements, are included in net profit or loss for the period. For
available for sale investments, gains and losses arising from changes in fair
value are recognised directly in equity until the investment is disposed of
or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss
previously recognised in equity is included in the net profit or loss for the
period. If, in the subsequent period, the fair value of the available for sale
investments, for which impairment was previously recognised, increases
in value, the impairment loss is reversed through the income statement. 
Quoted investments are valued at bid price or the last traded price
when a bid price is not available. Unquoted investments are valued using
recognised valuation methodologies, based on the International Private
Equity and Venture Capital Guidelines, which reflect the amount for
which an asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing
parties on an arm’s length basis. The portfolio valuation methodology 
is detailed on page 64. 
Distributions from investment limited partnerships are treated 
as disposal proceeds or income in accordance with the nature of the
distribution. Any surplus capital distributions after repaying any partner’s
loans and capital are treated as realised gains. Accounting policies
34 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements
Income
Dividends receivable on equity shares are recognised as revenue when
the shareholders’ right to receive payment has been established,
normally the ex-dividend date. Where no ex-dividend date is available,
dividends receivable on or before the period end are treated as revenue
for the period. Provision is made for any dividends not expected to 
be received. 
The fixed returns on debt securities, loans and non-equity shares
are recognised on an effective interest rate basis, which is the rate that
exactly discounts estimated future cash receipts through the expected
life of the financial asset to that asset’s net carrying amount. 
For trading subsidiaries, revenue comprises the fair value of the sale
of goods and services, net of value-added tax, rebates and discounts and
after eliminating sales within the group. Sales of goods are recognised
when goods are delivered and title has passed. Sales of services are
recognised in the accounting period in which the services are rendered,
by reference to completion of the specific transaction, assessed on the
basis of the actual service provided as a proportion of the total services 
to be provided. 
The company’s share of net income from investment limited
partnerships is recognised as revenue when received. 
Where uncertainty arises over the collectability of an amount
already included in income, the uncollectible amount or the amount in
respect of which the recovery has ceased to be probable, is recognised 
as an expense. When the uncertainty over collectability is removed,
normally on receipt, the income is recognised in the income statement.
Expenses
All expenses are accounted for on an accrual basis. Expenses of
acquisition of an investment designated as held at fair value through
profit or loss or expenses of an aborted acquisition or disposal of an
investment are presented as transaction costs and expenses of disposal 
of an investment are deducted from the disposal proceeds.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and
deferred tax. 
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the
period. T axable profit differs from net profit as reported in the income
statement because it excludes items of income or expense that are
taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that
are never taxable or deductible. The group’s liability for current tax is
calculated using tax rates that were applicable at the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the
computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable
temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against
which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Investment trust
companies that have approval as such under section 842 of the Income
and Corporation T axes Act 1988 are not liable for taxation on capital gains. 
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each
balance sheet date and adjusted to the extent that it is probable that
sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset 
to be recovered.
Dividend distribution
Dividends are recognised in the period in which they are appropriately
authorised and no longer at the discretion of the entity. For interim
dividends, this will normally mean the date on which they are paid and,
for final dividends, the date on which they are approved in general meeting.
Employee benefits
Pension schemes
Payments to defined contribution schemes are charged as an expense as
they fall due. 
For defined benefit schemes, the cost of providing benefits is
determined using the projected unit credit method, with actuarial
valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date. Actuarial gains
and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur . They
are recognised outside of the income statement and are presented in the
statement of recognised income and expense. 
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the
benefits are already vested and otherwise is amortised on a straight-line
basis over the average period until the benefits become vested. 
The retirement benefit obligation recognised in the balance sheet
represents the present value of the defined benefit obligation as adjusted
for unrecognised past service cost and as reduced by the fair value of
scheme assets. Any asset resulting from this calculation is limited to past
service cost, plus the present value of available refunds and reductions in
future contributions to the plan.
Profit-sharing and bonus plans
The group recognises a liability and an expense for bonuses and profit-
sharing, based on a formula that takes into consideration the profit
attributable to the company’s shareholders after certain adjustments.
The group recognises a provision where contractually obliged or where
there is a past practice that has created a constructive obligation.
Share-based payments
The group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair
value at the date of grant and the fair value is expensed on a straight-line
basis over the vesting period, based on the group’s estimate of shares
that will eventually vest. 
Where employees of a subsidiary are granted rights to the equity
instruments of its parent as consideration for the services provided to the
subsidiary, the subsidiary recognises an equity settled share-based
payment transaction expense with a corresponding increase recognised
in equity representing a contribution from the parent. 
An employee share trust is used for distributing option shares and
deferred bonus awards to employees under Caledonia’s share
remuneration schemes. The trustee purchases shares with money lent
interest free by Caledonia and transfers shares to participating employees
on receipt of the requisite consideration or calling of awards. 
The transactions the employee share trust undertakes are
considered to be performed by the trust as an agent for Caledonia. The
transactions of the employee share trust are included in the separate
financial statements of the parent company and, following the
requirements of SIC 12, in the consolidated financial statements as if they
arose in that company. Own shares held by the employee share trust as at
the balance sheet date are accounted for as if they were treasury shares.
National Insurance on share option scheme gains and 
deferred bonus awards
National Insurance contributions payable on the exercise of certain
employee share options at the date of exercise and deferred bonus
awards at the date of call have been charged as an expense spread over
the respective vesting periods. The charge is based on the difference
between the market value of the underlying shares at the balance sheet
date and the exercise price for share options or £nil for deferred bonus
awards and calculated at the latest enacted National Insurance
contributions rate. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 35 Financial statements
Capital reserve
The company maintains a capital reserve, which it is prohibited from
distributing by virtue of its articles of association. The following items are
transferred into the capital reserve from profit or loss:
• Gains and losses on investments held at fair value through profit or loss
• Gains and losses on derivatives used to hedge the fair value 
of investments
• Expenses and finance costs incurred directly in relation to the 
capital transactions
• T axation on items recognised in the capital reserve.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated
depreciation and any recognised impairment loss. 
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of assets, other
than land or properties under construction, over their estimated useful
lives, using the straight-line method, on the following bases:
Property 25-40 years
Plant 10-15 years
Equipment 3-8 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected
useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or , where shorter , over the
term of the relevant lease. 
The gain or loss on the disposal or retirement of an asset is
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds and the
carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in the income statement.
Investment property
Investment property, which is property held to earn rentals and/or for
capital appreciation, is stated at its fair value at the balance sheet date.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of investment
property are included in the income statement for the period in which
they arise.
Intangible assets
Brands, trademarks, computer software and customer relationships
Brands, trademarks, computer software and customer relationships
acquired by the group are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation
and impairment losses. Where such items are not deemed to have an
indefinite life, amortisation is expensed on a straight-line basis over their
estimated useful lives.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of
acquisition over the group’s interest in the fair value of the identifiable
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or
jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. 
Goodwill is recognised as an asset and reviewed for impairment at
least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in profit or loss
and is not subsequently reversed. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity, the
attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the
profit or loss on disposal.
Impairment of assets
At each balance sheet date, the group reviews the carrying amounts of 
its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such
indication exists, an impairment loss is recognised for the amount by
which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount, if any.
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to
sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing impairment, intangible
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately
identifiable cash flows (cash-generating units).
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost
comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and
those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to
their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the first-in,
first-out method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling
price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be incurred in
marketing, selling and distribution. 
Properties that are held for sale in the ordinary course of business 
or are being developed for future sale are classified as inventories.
Receivables
Receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their 
nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated
irrecoverable amounts.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash on hand and demand deposits. Cash equivalents 
are short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible to
known amounts of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of
changes in value.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are
accounted for on an accrual basis to the income statement using the
effective interest method and are added to the carrying amount of the
instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which
they arise. The effective interest method allocates the interest expense
over the life of the instrument so as to reflect a constant return on the
carrying amount of the liability. 
Borrowings include a component of the company’s deferred
ordinary shares and preference shares in subsidiaries held by third parties
that fall under the definition of financial liabilities under IAS 32.
Provisions
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the company has 
a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle
the obligation. Provisions are measured at the directors’ best estimate 
of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet
date and are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the lessee.
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
Lessor
Rental income from operating leases is recognised on a straight-line basis
over the term of the relevant lease. Initial direct costs incurred in
negotiating and arranging an operating lease are added to the carrying
amount of the leased asset and recognised on a straight-line basis.
Lessee
Assets held under finance leases are recognised as assets of the group 
at their fair value or , if lower , at the present value of the minimum lease
payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The
corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as 
a finance lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between
finance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Finance charges are charged directly against income. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on 
a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease. 
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into an
operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Accounting policies
36 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements
Share capital
Equity instruments issued by the company are recorded as the proceeds
received, net of direct issue costs. 
Where any group company and the Caledonia Investments plc
Employee Share T rust purchases the company’s equity share capital or the
company buys shares into treasury , the consideration paid, including any
directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted
from equity attributable to the company’s equity holders until the shares
are cancelled or transferred. Where such shares are subsequently
transferred, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable
incremental transaction costs and the related income tax effects, is
included in equity attributable to the company’s equity holders.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
Derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered
into and are subsequently re-measured at their fair value. 
Hedge accounting is not applied. Changes in the fair value of
derivative financial instruments are recognised in the income statement
as they arise.
Segment reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the group that is engaged
either in providing products or services (business segment), or in
providing products or services within a particular economic environment
(geographical segment), which is subject to risks and rewards that are
different from those of other segments.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements 
of the company and entities controlled by the company (its subsidiaries)
made up to the balance sheet date. Control is achieved where the
company has the power to govern the financial and operating policies 
of the investee entity so as to obtain economic benefits from its activities. 
On acquisition, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at fair values at the date of
acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair values of the
identifiable net assets acquired is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency
in the cost of acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets
acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the income
statement in the period of acquisition. The interest of minority
shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of the
assets and liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable to
the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated
against the interests of the parent except to the extent that the minority
has a binding obligation and is able to make an additional investment to
cover the losses. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period
are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used in line
with those used by the group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are
eliminated on consolidation.
Associates
An associate is an entity over which the group is in a position to exercise
significant influence, but not control or joint control, through the financial
and operating policy decisions of the investee entity. 
As Caledonia is an investment trust company, and its investments
held in associates are designated as held at fair value through profit or
loss, the provisions of IAS 28 ‘Investments in Associates’ do not apply.
Such investments are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value
recognised in profit or loss in the period in which they occur . 
No other group company held investments in associates.
Joint ventures
A joint venture is a contractual arrangement whereby two or more parties
undertake an economic activity that is the subject of joint control. 
As Caledonia is an investment trust company, and its interests in
joint ventures are designated as held at fair value through profit or loss,
the provisions of IAS 31 ‘Interests in Joint Ventures’ do not apply. Such
interests are measured at fair value, with changes in fair value recognised
in profit or loss in the period in which they occur . However , the provisions
of IAS 31 do apply to interests in joint ventures held by other companies 
in the group, as set out below. 
The results and assets and liabilities of joint ventures held by
subsidiaries are incorporated in these financial statements using the
equity method of accounting, except when classified as held for sale.
Interests in joint ventures are carried in the balance sheet at cost as
adjusted by post-acquisition changes in the group’s share of net assets 
of the joint ventures, less any impairment in the value of individual
investments. Losses of the joint ventures in excess of the group’s interest
in those joint ventures are not recognised. 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the group’s share of the
fair values of the identifiable net assets of the joint ventures at the date 
of acquisition is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency in the cost of
acquisition below the group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable
net assets at the date of acquisition is credited in profit or loss in the
period of acquisition. 
Where a group company transacts with joint ventures of the group,
profits and losses are eliminated to the extent of the group’s interest in
the relevant joint ventures. Losses may provide evidence of an
impairment of the asset transferred, in which case appropriate provision
is made for impairment. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 37 Financial statements

Customer relationships related to identifiable customer related intangible
assets acquired on the purchase of the Ermitage group in 2007. During
the year , the useful economic life of client relationships was revised from
indefinite to ten years. The revised useful life expectancy has given rise to
an amortisation charge for the year of £1.2m (2007 – £nil). 
Other intangible assets included brands and trademarks, recipes
and formulas and computer software.
Impairment charge
The impairment charge for the year of £0.6m (2007 – £0.6m) was
recognised in operating expenses of trading operations in the income
statement.
Impairment tests for goodwill
The carrying amount of goodwill was predominantly attributable to a
single cash generating unit, Ermitage group. The recoverable amount of
the unit has been determined on the basis of the fair value less costs to sell
based on recent forecasts from the unit management’s business plan and
comparable market transactions.

Share-based payments
The company currently has two executive share option schemes, a 1998
scheme and a 2005 scheme. These schemes entitle senior employees to
purchase shares in the company at the market price of the shares at the
date of grant and on similar terms, subject to service and company
performance criteria. Under the terms of the schemes, options may be
exercised between three and ten years after the date of grant, although
only one-third of the options may be exercised after three years from 
grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming exercisable six years after
grant. A number of grants have been made under these schemes. 
In addition, the company has special option arrangements for
Messrs Ingram and May. The terms of grants under these arrangements
are similar to those for options granted under the 1998 scheme other
than in respect of the performance testing criteria. Details of these
options are set out in the directors’ remuneration report on page 59. 
The company also has a deferred bonus plan under which senior
employees compulsorily defer part of their annual bonus, being any
bonus in excess of 50% of their basic salary for the bonus year , into shares
and may voluntarily defer up to 50% of their remaining cash bonus into
shares. The company will match the number of shares comprised in the
voluntary deferral, subject to service and company performance criteria. 
The terms and conditions of the grants outstanding as at 
31 March 2008 were as follows, whereby all grants are settled by physical
delivery of shares:

The options outstanding at 31 March 2008 have an exercise price in the
range of 722.5p to 2158p and a weighted average contractual life of 
10 years. 
The fair value of services received in return for share options
granted are measured indirectly, by reference to the fair value of share
options granted. The estimate of the fair value of the services received 
is measured based on the Hull-White Employee Stock Option Valuation
lattice model. This takes account of the impact of future events, such as
early exercise by employees and employee exit rates after vesting. Also,
the Hull-White model defines the conditions under which employees are
expected to exercise their options after vesting in terms of the share price
reaching a certain multiple of the exercise price.  Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 45 Financial statements
The weighted average fair value at the measurement date of share
options granted during the year and parameters used to derive the fair
value, were as follows:
Senior Senior 
employees employees 
2008 2007 
Fair value at measurement date 588p 496p

Exercise multiple 2.0 2.0 
Expected dividends 1.8% 1.9%
Risk-free interest rate (based on  UK Government bonds) 5.2% 4.6%
The expected volatility is based on the historic volatility, calculated 
as the average volatility over a period equal to the expected life of the
share options. 
Share options are granted under a service condition and non-
market performance conditions. Such conditions are not taken into
account in the grant date fair value measurement of the services received.
There are no market conditions associated with the share option grants. 
The fair value of services received in return for deferred share 
awards were measured directly, by reference to the fair value of services
received during the period. This was based on the amount of annual
bonus that was compulsorily and voluntarily deferred in accordance with
the rules of the company’s deferred bonus plan.

Provisions relate to the disposal of investments and warranty claims and 
are based on an estimate of the expenditure to be incurred as a result of
past events. The matters giving rise to the provisions are expected to be
resolved over the next year .
22. Financial instruments
Financial instruments comprise securities and other investments, cash
balances, borrowings and receivables and payables that arise from
operations. The investment portfolio includes quoted and unquoted
equity investments, debt instruments and investments in other funds
that are intended to be held for the long term.
Risk analysis
The main types of financial risk to which the group is exposed are market
risk and credit risk. 
The nature and extent of the financial instruments outstanding at
the balance sheet date and the risk management policies employed are
discussed below.
Market risk
Market risk embodies the potential for both losses and gains and includes
currency risk, fair value interest rate risk and price risk. 
The strategy for managing market risk is driven by the investment
objective, which is to outperform the FTSE All-Share T otal Return index
over five and ten years and to achieve a positive total return over rolling
five year periods. Investments are made in a range of instruments,
including quoted and unquoted equities, debt and non-equity
investment funds, in a range of sectors and regions.
The board monitors the investment exposure against guidelines 
set from time to time by the board, specifying the maximum proportion
of total assets that may be invested in sectors, regions and currencies. 
The board also reviews the position, prospects and exit strategy for all
substantial investments at least once a year .
Details of the investment portfolio at the balance sheet date are
shown in the table of the twenty largest investments set out on pages 
65 to 67.
Currency risk
Investments in financial instruments and other transactions may 
be denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
Consequently, there is exposure to the risk that the exchange rate of the
functional currency may change relative to other currencies in a manner
that has an adverse effect on the value of that portion of assets and
liabilities denominated in currencies other than the functional currency.
The policy is not to enter into any structural currency hedging
transactions. However , when a decision is taken to realise a currency
denominated investment, derivatives may be used to hedge against
currency fluctuations to the expected date of realisation, depending on
the directors’ view of the likely movement in the exchange rate to
anticipated disposal. At 31 March 2008 and 2007, the company and
group had no currency hedging positions.
The company and group are mainly exposed to debt investments
denominated in euros (2007 – euros). The fair values of the monetary
items that have foreign currency exposure were as follows:
Company Group

The following table details the sensitivity to a 10% variation in exchange
rates. This level of change is considered to be reasonable, based on
observation of market conditions and historic trends. The sensitivity
analysis includes all foreign currency denominated debt investments.

£m £m £m £m 
Sterling depreciates 2.4 1.4 2.7 1.7 
Sterling appreciates (2.0) (1.1) (2.2) (1.4)
The exposure to foreign currency has increased during the year due to
increased investment in euro denominated debt instruments.
Interest rate risk
Interest rate movements may affect the fair value of investments in fixed
interest securities and the level of income receivable from floating
income securities and cash at bank and on deposit.
The company and group hold fixed rate, interest-bearing financial
assets, with maturity of up to five years, cash at bank and on term
deposits, with the term to maturity of up to three months, and floating
rate, interest-bearing financial assets. The group also has floating rate, 
interest-bearing borrowings.
Interest rate risk is managed through the use of interest rate caps,
collars or floors from time to time. At 31 March 2008 and 2007, the group
had collars limiting interest rates to between 4.5% and 6.5% on £20.5m 
of borrowings.
The exposure to interest rate risk on financial assets and liabilities
was as follows:
Company Group
2008 2007 2008 2007 
£m £m £m £m 
Fixed rate
Investments in debt instruments 59.2 58.0 48.6 38.9

Cash and cash equivalents 23.5 108.6 42.7 123.2 
Interest bearing loans and borrowings – – (65.6) (64.0)
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the
exposure to interest rates at the reporting date for a 50 basis point
change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held
constant throughout the period. This level of change is considered to be
reasonable, based on observation of market conditions and historic trends. 
Company Group
2008 2007 2008 2007 
£m £m £m £m 
Decrease in interest rates 1.2 0.9 1.0 0.6 
Increase in interest rates (1.2) (0.9) (1.0) (0.6)
The sensitivity to interest rates has increased in the year due to 
increased investment in fixed interest debt instruments, partially 
offset by a reduction in cash and cash equivalents.
Price risk
Price risk may affect the value of quoted and unquoted investments 
as a result of changes in market prices (other than arising from interest
rate risk or currency risk), whether caused by factors specific to an
individual investment, its issuer or factors affecting all instruments 
traded in the market.
As the majority of financial instruments are carried at fair value, 
with fair value changes recognised in the income statement, all changes
in market conditions will directly affect reported portfolio returns.
Price risk is mitigated by constructing a diversified portfolio of
instruments traded on various markets and through direct involvement
with the management of the investment portfolio. During the year , 
FTSE 250 put options were acquired, at a cost of £12.0m, to protect 
the gains on equity investments against potential market falls.
The exposures of quoted and unquoted equity investments, 
funds and options on indices to price risk were as follows:
Company Group
2008 2007 2008 2007
£m £m £m £m
Investments held at fair value 
through profit or loss 1,117.3 1,120.5 1,033.1 1,045.7 
The following table details the sensitivity to a 10% variation in equity
prices. The sensitivity analysis includes all equity and fund investments
held at fair value through profit or loss and adjusts their valuation at the
period end for a 10% change in value. The valuation movement is
aggregated with the expected movement in the valuation of the FTSE
250 put options to provide a net increase or decrease in profit or loss.
Company Group
2008 2007 2008 2007
£m £m £m £m
Increase in prices 104.9 107.5 96.5 100.0
Decrease in prices (103.6) (107.5) (95.2) (100.0)
The sensitivity to equity and fund investments has decreased during the
year due to the investment in FTSE 250 put options. 
In management’s opinion, the sensitivity analysis is
unrepresentative of the inherent price risk as the year end exposure does
not reflect the exposure throughout the year as a whole.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that the counterparty to a financial instrument will
fail to discharge an obligation or commitment. A credit policy is in place
and exposure to credit risk is regularly monitored.
At 31 March 2008, the financial assets exposed to credit risk were 
as follows: 
Company Group
2008 2007 2008 2007 
£m £m £m £m 
Investments in debt instruments 129.5 92.8 96.9 63.0 
T rade and other receivables 4.2 6.5 30.0 28.8 
Money market funds – – – 0.3 
Cash and cash equivalents 23.5 108.6 42.7 123.2
157.2 207.9 169.6 215.3
Prior to making investments in debt instruments, management has 
in place a process of review that includes an evaluation of a potential
investee’s ability to service and repay its debt. Management reviews the
financial position of investee companies, including their continuing ability
to service and repay debt, on a regular basis.
The exposure to credit risk on operating and other receivables is
mitigated by performing credit evaluations on investee companies as
part of the due diligence process.  Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 47 Financial statements
Credit risk arising on money market funds and cash and cash equivalents
is mitigated by spreading investments and deposits across a number of
investment grade banks with a credit rating of ‘ AA3’ or ‘ AA-’ or better as
determined by the ratings agencies, Moody’s and Fitch. The company
receives a monthly rating update, and relevant credit risks are 
reviewed accordingly. 
All transactions in quoted securities are settled on contract terms
using approved brokers. The risk of default is considered minimal, as
delivery of securities sold is only made once the broker has received
payment. Payment is made on a purchase once the securities have been
received by the broker . The trade will fail if either party fails to meet 
its obligations. 
There were no significant concentrations of credit risk to
counterparties at 31 March 2008. 
Fair value
Most of the financial instruments are carried at fair value on the balance
sheet. Usually, the fair value of the financial instruments can be reliably
determined within a reasonable range of estimates. For certain other
financial instruments, specifically operating and other receivables and
payables, the carrying amounts approximate fair value due to the
immediate or short term nature of these financial instruments. 
The principal methods and assumptions used in estimating the 
fair value of investments are disclosed on page 64.
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk arises as a result of the possibility that liabilities may be
required to be paid earlier than expected. 
The corporate treasury function provides services to the company
and group, coordinating access to domestic financial markets for both
borrowing and depositing. Group companies access local financial
markets when this is more favourable in liaison with the corporate
treasury function. Executive management monitors the group’s 
liquidity on a weekly basis.
The following table shows the group’s exposure to gross 
liquidity risks, based on the undiscounted contractual maturities 
of the financial liabilities:

Capital management policies and procedures
The company’s capital management objectives are:
• to ensure that it will be able to continue as a going concern
• to maximise the income and capital return to its equity shareholders
through an appropriate balance of equity capital and debt. 
The company’s policy is to limit debt to 25% of net assets.
The company’s total capital at 31 March 2008 was £1,251.9m 
(2007 – £1,323.2m) comprising equity share capital and reserves. 
The company was ungeared at the year end (2007 – ungeared).
The board monitors and reviews the broad structure of the company’s
capital on an ongoing basis. This review includes:
• the planned level of gearing, which takes into account planned
investment activity
• the possible buy back of equity shares for holding in treasury or
cancellation, which takes account of the discount of the share price 
to net asset value per share
• the annual dividend policy.
The company’s objectives, policies and processes for managing 
capital are unchanged from the preceding accounting period.
The company is subject to the following externally imposed 
capital requirements:
• as a public company, the company is required to have a minimum
issued share capital of £50,000
• to maintain its approval as an investment trust company, the company
is required to comply with the regulations of section 842 of the Income
and Corporation T axes Act 1988.
The company has complied with these requirements, which are
unchanged since the previous year end.

The company has also issued share options and made deferred bonus
awards (note 20).
As at 31 March 2008, the authorised share capital of the company
comprised 107,181,309 ordinary shares (2007 – 107,181,309) and
8,000,000 deferred ordinary shares (2007 – 8,000,000). The ordinary
and deferred ordinary shares have a par value of 5p. 
The holders of the ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends
as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at
meetings of the company. In respect of the company’s shares that are
held by the group, all voting rights are suspended. 
The deferred ordinary shares carry no voting rights and are not
redeemable. They carry the right to a fixed cumulative preference
dividend of 1% per annum (exclusive of any associated tax credit) of the
nominal value of such deferred ordinary shares, being 0.05p per share, or
£4,000 in aggregate, for all such shares currently in issue. The company is
required to pay the dividend to the extent that it has distributable profits.
On a winding-up or other return of capital, the deferred ordinary shares
carry the right to the payment of the amount paid up on such shares only
after holders of the ordinary shares have received the sum of £100,000 in
respect of each such ordinary share. All of the deferred ordinary shares are
held by Sterling Industries PLC, a wholly owned subsidiary of Caledonia. Notes to the financial statements
48 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Financial statements
These shares are considered compound financial instruments under 
IAS 32 and are required to be separated into a debt and an equity
component. The debt component, a perpetual debt, represents the
present value of the fixed cumulative dividend of 1% per annum
calculated on the date the deferred shares were issued. This component
of the deferred ordinary shares has been classified as non-current
liabilities in the financial statements of the company. The fixed cumulative
dividend has been reclassified from dividend to interest expense in the
income statement of the financial statements of the company.
Capital redemption reserve
The capital redemption reserve comprises the nominal value of those
shares purchased by the company out of its own profits and cancelled. 
At 31 March 2008, the capital redemption reserve was £1.2m (2007 
and 2006 – £1.2m). There was no movement in the capital redemption
reserve in the current or prior years.

34. Accounting estimates and judgments
Key sources of estimation uncertainty 
Fair values of financial instruments
Many of the group’s financial instruments are measured at fair value on
the balance sheet and it is usually possible to determine their fair values
within a reasonable range of estimates. 
For the majority of the group’s financial instruments, quoted
market prices are readily available. However , certain financial
instruments, such as unquoted securities, are fair valued using valuation
techniques, including reference to the current fair values of instruments
that are substantially the same (subject to the appropriate adjustments). 
Fair value estimates are made at a specific point in time, based on
market conditions and information about the financial instrument. These
estimates are subjective in nature and involve uncertainties and matters
of significant judgement (e.g. interest rates, volatility, estimated cash
flows, etc) and therefore cannot be determined with precision. 
Notes to the financial statements Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 53 Directors’ report
Directors’ remuneration report
This report has been prepared to comply with the Directors’
Remuneration Report Regulations 2002 (the ‘Regulations’). The tables
included in the statements below on directors’ remuneration, pensions,
share options and deferred share awards have been audited.
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is a standing committee of the board
whose members throughout the year were Mr Davies (chairman), 
Mr Allen-Jones and Mr Loudon.
The Committee, whose written terms of reference are published on the
company’s website, has been established for the following purposes:
• T o determine and agree with the board the framework and broad
policy for the remuneration of the executive directors and such other
members of the executive management as it is requested by the board
to consider and to review the on-going appropriateness and relevance
of the remuneration policy.
• T o approve the design of, and determine targets for , any performance
related pay schemes operated by the company and to approve the total
annual payments made under such schemes.
• T o review the design of all share incentive plans for approval by the
board and shareholders and, for any such plans, to determine each year
whether awards will be made and, if so, the overall amount of such
awards, the individual awards to executive directors and other senior
executives and the performance targets to be used.
• Within the terms of the agreed policy, to determine the total individual
remuneration packages of each executive director (and, if requested by
the board, other senior executives) including, where appropriate,
bonuses, incentive payments, share options and other awards.
• T o determine the policy for , and scope of, pension arrangements,
service agreements, termination payments and compensation
commitments for executive directors and, if requested by the board,
other senior executives.
• T o review and assess annually the remuneration trends across the
company.
References to executive directors also include the Chairman.
During the year , the Remuneration Committee received advice
from T owers Perrin, independent remuneration consultants appointed 
by the Committee, who assessed the comparability of senior executive
remuneration packages with the market place for the purpose of setting
executive directors’ salaries for the year commencing 1 April 2008. In
addition, the Remuneration Committee received advice from Freshfields
Bruckhaus Deringer LLP in relation to the company’s executive share
option schemes and deferred bonus plan. T owers Perrin only advised in
relation to the remuneration of executive directors and senior
management and Freshfields Bruckhaus Deringer LLP are the company’s
main legal advisers. The Remuneration Committee also consulted with
the Chairman, Mr Buckley, and the Chief Executive, Mr Ingram, in relation
to the remuneration of all of the executive directors, other than their own.
Internal support was provided to the Remuneration Committee by the
Company Secretary.
Remuneration policy for executive directors
The Remuneration Committee has adopted a remuneration policy with
the following objectives:
• Performance related remuneration should seek to align the interests of
the executive directors with those of the shareholders.
• A significant portion of the executive directors’ remuneration packages
should be linked to the performance of the company.
• Remuneration packages for the executive directors should be
competitive, but not excessive, in terms of market practice, in order to
attract, retain and motivate executive directors of the quality needed
to manage and grow the company successfully.
In order further to align the interests of the executive directors with those
of shareholders, the Remuneration Committee has adopted guidelines
for minimum shareholdings which executive directors will be expected to
attain over a reasonable period of time. For these purposes, shareholdings
include the value to executive directors, net of associated income tax and
National Insurance, of options granted under the company’s executive
share option schemes, for which the performance targets have been 
met, and bonuses deferred into shares, both compulsorily and voluntarily,
under the company’s deferred bonus plan. For the Chief Executive, the
minimum guideline shareholding has been set at 200% of basic salary 
and for all other executive directors 150% of basic salary. The current
shareholdings of all of the executive directors meet these guidelines.
In determining executive directors’ remuneration, consideration is
given to matters specific to the company, such as the performance of its
undiluted net asset value (‘NAV’) per share, both in absolute terms and 
as measured against the FTSE All-Share index, to the experience and
performance of individual directors and their areas of responsibility, 
to comparable external market remuneration data and to levels of
remuneration elsewhere in the company . 
It is currently intended that the policy statement set out in this
report will apply for the year to 31 March 2009 and for subsequent years.
However , the Remuneration Committee considers that an effective
remuneration policy needs to be sufficiently flexible and kept under
review in order to take account of future changes in the company’s
business environment and in remuneration practice. Accordingly, the
policy may be further amended in future years. Any changes in policy 
for financial years after 31 March 2009 will be described in future
directors’ remuneration reports, which will continue to be subject to 
an advisory vote of shareholders. All statements in this report in relation
to remuneration policy for years after 31 March 2009 should be read in 
this light.
Policy on individual components of executive directors’ remuneration
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salary is determined by the Remuneration Committee by reference
to the experience and responsibilities of the director concerned and
taking into account external market research. The company’s policy is to
pay salaries and other benefits which are competitive, but not excessive,
in relation to the marketplace. The company provides a range of benefits,
such as cash allowances in lieu of company cars, life insurance, permanent
health insurance and private medical cover .
Bonus
The company operates a discretionary annual bonus scheme for
executive directors, which takes into account both the performance of
individual directors and the performance of the company over the short
and medium term. At the determination of the Remuneration
Committee, and subject to the compulsory deferral provisions of the
company’s deferred bonus plan, bonuses may either be paid in cash or as
an employer contribution to registered pension schemes. 
The maximum potential bonus that may currently be awarded is 100%
of basic salary , of which a maximum of 50% of basic salary is determined by
reference to the company’s performance and 50% by reference to individual
performance. The company performance related element of bonus is
determined by reference to the performance of the company’s undiluted
NA V per share compared with that of the FTSE All-Share index over the
financial year . Bonus payments commence if the performance of the
company’s NA V per share matches that of the FTSE All-Share index,
increasing incrementally to the maximum entitlement payable if NA V per
share outperforms the FTSE All-Share index by 6% or more. The individual
performance element is measured by reference to performance objectives
set at the start of the financial year . The Remuneration Committee however
retains the discretion to reduce the amount of bonus payable if NA V 
per share growth in the financial year is negative and/or NA V per share
outperformance over the relevant financial year is greater than that of the
previous three financial years and, therefore, represents recovery from
previous underperformance. The payment of any such bonus is subject 
to the overriding discretion of the Remuneration Committee.  Directors’ remuneration report
54 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Directors’ report
The Remuneration Committee may also award bonuses outside the
terms of the company’s annual bonus scheme. No bonus payments 
are pensionable.
Deferred bonus plan
The company’s bonus arrangements are also designed to align the
interests of directors with those of shareholders and to encourage
retention by requiring, in the Remuneration Committee’s absolute
discretion, that a proportion of any bonus paid to a director is
compulsorily invested in shares under the company’s deferred bonus
plan. The Remuneration Committee’s current policy is that any annual
bonus paid, the amount of which is above 50% of a director’s basic 
salary for the financial year to which the bonus relates, must be so
compulsorily invested. 
In addition, the deferred bonus plan entitles directors to convert
voluntarily a proportion of any remaining cash bonus to an entitlement 
to shares. The Remuneration Committee’s current policy is that up to 
half of any bonus not subject to compulsory deferral may be voluntarily
converted into shares. The shares so invested are eligible for matching, 
on a one for one basis, subject to the satisfaction of performance
conditions over a period of three years. 
For bonuses payable in respect of the year ended 31 March 2008
and subsequent years, the Remuneration Committee proposes that
shares derived from the compulsory deferral of bonus should also be
eligible for matching. Again, matching would be on a one for one 
basis, and vesting would be subject to the satisfaction of performance
conditions over a period of three years. The implementation of this
proposal is subject to shareholder approval of an amendment to the 
rules of the deferred bonus plan, which will be considered at the annual
general meeting to be held on 29 July 2008. If the resolution to amend
the deferred bonus plan is duly passed, the Remuneration Committee
intends to make a grant of matching shares after the annual general
meeting over a number of shares equal to that awarded in respect of 
the compulsory deferral of bonus for the year ended 31 March 2008. 
Awards under the deferred bonus plan are not pensionable.
Pensions
The company’s policy on pension provision is to provide a means
whereby executive directors either receive a pension at retirement age
from the company, or are funded to operate their own money purchase
pension plans or other arrangements. Messrs Buckley and Cartwright and
The Hon C W Cayzer are members of the Caledonia Pension Scheme,
which is a defined benefits scheme and is contributory for employees
who joined the company after 1 April 1988, but which is now closed to
new members. The scheme provides a pension of up to two-thirds of final
pensionable salary on retirement dependent on length of service and age
and also provides for dependants’ pensions. All of the executive directors
participating in the scheme, other than Mr Cartwright, transferred into
the scheme from The Union-Castle Line Superannuation Scheme which
was non-contributory, and this status has been preserved. None of Messrs
Ingram, May or Wyatt participate in a company pension scheme but
instead a fixed percentage of basic salary is paid into personal pension
arrangements or , in the case of Messrs Ingram and May, may be paid as a
cash supplement, which is reduced by such amount as is necessary to
cover the company’s National Insurance costs. The percentage of basic
salary for the year ended 31 March 2008 was 25% for Mr Ingram and
12.5% for Messrs May and Wyatt. Mr Cayzer-Colvin participates in the
Caledonia Group Personal Pension Plan (‘GPPP’), a defined contribution
scheme into which employer contributions of 12.5% of basic salary were
made on his behalf. It is the company’s policy that any future executive
directors recruited from outside the company will be funded to operate
their own pension arrangements or offered participation in a company
sponsored defined contribution scheme and that the company will not
offer participation in any defined benefits arrangements.
Share options
A key objective of the company’s remuneration policy is to motivate
executive directors to deliver long term shareholder value. The
Remuneration Committee believes that this is best achieved through the
grant of share options, exercisable only if demanding performance
conditions are met. The grant of options is considered to be a key element
of the remuneration package, alongside annual salary, annual bonus and
the deferred bonus plan. 
The maximum value of options that may be granted in any year 
to a director is 150% of basic salary. The Remuneration Committee may
exceed this limit for individual directors where it considers it necessary 
to do so to secure their appointment, provided that the maximum value
that may be granted in such circumstances shall not exceed 250% of 
basic salary. 
No options are granted at a discount.
Policy on executive directors’ service contracts
It is the policy of the company that no executive director should be
offered a service contract that cannot be terminated within one year or
which contains provision for predetermined compensation in excess of
one year’s total emoluments. All existing directors’ service contracts
comply with this policy. The Remuneration Committee has regard to
compensation commitments and believes that these are best addressed
by restricting the term of the contract. In the event of a termination, the
Remuneration Committee would consider all the relevant factors and
circumstances and seek a just solution.
Policy on external non-executive directorships held 
by executive directors
It is the company’s policy to allow executive directors to hold external
non-executive directorships unrelated to the company’s business,
provided that the time commitment required is not material. Normally
the company will retain any fees arising from such non-executive
directorships, but may permit the executive director to retain fees in
certain circumstances. Details of any such fees retained by executive
directors are disclosed in the statement on directors’ emoluments below.
Policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration 
and terms of appointment
It is the company’s policy that non-executive directors should be
appointed for fixed periods of no more than three years (from the next
general meeting following their initial appointment in the case of new
non-executive directors) and that re-appointment at the end of such
periods should not be automatic. Non-executive directors are paid an
annual fee determined by the board within the overall limit contained in
the articles of association, but do not receive any other benefits from the
company for their services as non-executive directors. For the year ended
31 March 2008, the basic fee for non-executive directors was £31,000
(2007 – £29,000). Additionally, fees of £3,500 (2007 – £3,000) were 
paid to the chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees and
£1,500 and £1,000 respectively (2007 – £nil) to the other members 
of those Committees. A further £3,500 (2007 – £3,000) was paid to 
Mr Allen-Jones for his role as Senior Independent Non-Executive Director
and chairman of the Governance Committee. Non-executive directors
may also be paid additional fees agreed by the board where they have
performed services that, in the opinion of the board, are over and above
their normal duties. 
The company is entitled to terminate a non-executive director’s
appointment at any time without compensation. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 55 Directors’ report
Performance graph
The graph below shows the company’s total shareholder return (‘TSR’)
against that of the FTSE All-Share T otal Return index for the five financial
periods ending on 31 March 2008 and has been prepared in accordance
with the Regulations. TSR has been calculated assuming that all dividends
are reinvested on their ex-dividend date. The FTSE All-Share T otal Return
index has been chosen as it is the benchmark by which the company
measures its delivery of shareholder value over the longer term.

1. Benefits mainly comprised cash alternatives in lieu of company cars and private medical insurance.
2. Deferred bonus comprised the amounts compulsorily and voluntarily deferred under the company’s
deferred bonus plan and will be satisfied by conditional share awards shortly after the announcement 
of the company’s preliminary results for the year , as described below.
Notwithstanding that the company’s NAV per share outperformed the
FTSE All-Share index by more than 6% over the year , thereby triggering
the maximum entitlement of 50% of basic salary for the bonus year under
the company performance related element of the annual bonus scheme,
the Remuneration Committee decided to exercise its discretion to reduce
the amount of this payment – to 45% of basic salary – in view of the fact
that NAV per share declined over the year .
In addition to the amounts shown in the table above, Messrs Ingram and
May respectively were paid amounts of £106,383 and £35,460 before tax
(2007 – £nil and £25,931 respectively) in lieu of contributions to their
personal money purchase pension arrangements as described in the
statement on directors’ pensions below. 
Certain executive directors held external non-executive
directorships during the year unrelated to the company’s business, 
where it had been agreed that they may retain the fees arising therefrom.
Mr Ingram was a non-executive director of Sage Group, for which he
received fees of £60,742 (2007 – £48,000). Mr Ingram was appointed to
the board of Sage Group before he joined Caledonia. Until his resignation
as a director on 31 March 2008, Mr May received a fee from Catapult
Venture Managers amounting to £18,309 (2007 – £18,125). This fee 
was paid to a private company owned by Mr May and his wife and the
directorship was held prior to his joining Caledonia.
Directors’ deferred share awards
The deferred bonus column in the table above shows the amount of
bonus to be compulsorily and voluntarily deferred into shares under the
company’s deferred bonus plan. The number of shares awarded for both
the compulsory and voluntary deferral of bonus is determined by
reference to the market value of a share at the time the award is made,
which occurs shortly after the announcement of the company’s results
for the financial year to which the bonus relates (or following the
occurrence of exceptional circumstances justifying the making of
awards). In both cases, the number of shares is set on a pre-tax basis (as
the shares will be subject to income tax and National Insurance on
release). The number of matching shares is equal to the number of shares
awarded in respect of the voluntary deferral of bonus. 
If the resolution to amend the deferred bonus plan is duly passed at
the 2008 annual general meeting, the Remuneration Committee will be
authorised to make grants of matching shares in respect of compulsory
deferrals of bonus for the year ended 31 March 2008 and future years,
over a number of shares equal to that awarded in respect of the
compulsory deferral of bonus for the relevant year .
Compulsory deferred share awards
The shares comprised in a compulsory deferral will normally only vest
(together with an amount equal to the dividends that would have
accrued on those shares) if the director remains an employee of the
Caledonia group for a three year period commencing on the first day of
the financial year in which the award is made. The vesting of these shares
is not subject to a further performance condition.
Voluntary deferred share awards
The shares comprised in a voluntary deferral are not subject to a
performance condition and will vest (together with an amount equal to
the dividends that would have accrued on those shares) at the earlier of
three years from the first day of the financial year in which the award is
made or the date the director ceases to be an employee of the Caledonia
group for any reason.
Matching share awards
The vesting of the matching shares is dependent on the company’s
performance over a three year period, by reference to two separate
performance conditions. Both performance conditions relate to the
performance of Caledonia’s NAV per share over the three financial years
starting with the year in which the award is made (the ‘Prescribed
Period’). This performance of NAV per share will be compared against
different indices as follows:
• 50% of the matching shares will only vest if NAV per share over the
Prescribed Period outperforms the Retail Prices Index by at least 9%.
• The remaining 50% of the matching shares will only vest if NAV per
share over the Prescribed Period outperforms the FTSE All-Share index
by at least 3%.
There will be no retesting of either performance condition.

The Remuneration Committee may amend the performance target if
events occur that would make the amended target a fairer measure of
performance and provided that any amended target is no more difficult
to satisfy. The Remuneration Committee will also have the ability to
impose different performance targets in the future, provided that any
targets that are imposed are no less demanding than those described
above. Any such amended or different performance targets will be
described in the directors’ remuneration report for the relevant year .

Change in transfer value over the 
year , net of director contributions g 509,872 (84,071) (84,799)
1. Except for Mr Buckley, the accrued pensions are the amounts which would be paid at normal retirement
age, ignoring any revaluation, if the director had left service at 31 March 2008. Mr Buckley reached
normal retirement age on 23 September 2004 but has continued in employment. The amount shown 
in row (a) for Mr Buckley represents the accrued pension that would have been paid at 31 March 2008.
2. The increase in accrued pension, net of inflation, in row (c) is calculated by subtracting the pension
accrued to 31 March 2007 multiplied by the increase in the Retail Prices Index for the year to 
31 March 2008, from the accrued pension to 31 March 2008. In the case of Mr Buckley, who has not 
yet drawn any retirement benefits and remains a deferred pensioner within the scheme, the increase in
accrued pension over the year is made up entirely of increases due to the late payment of his pension.
3. The transfer value shown in row (d) represents the value of the increase in accrued pension during the
year , as set out in row (c), minus director contributions.
4. In previous years, parts of Mr Buckley’s bonus awards have been paid by the company as a contribution
into the scheme in order to enhance his cash lump sum benefit on retirement. The total value of such
contributions, with interest, was £281,550 at 31 March 2008 and £265,670 at 31 March 2007. The
amounts in rows (a) to (d) do not include allowance for these contributions. The transfer values set 
out in rows (e) and (f) do, however , include the respective values of these contributions.
5. The change in transfer value over the year shown in row (g) (calculated as row (e) less row (f) and any
director contributions) reflects the impact on transfer values of factors beyond the control of the
company and the directors, such as movements in stock markets. These can cause transfer values 
at different points in time to fluctuate significantly. Disclosed changes in value may therefore be subject
to a large degree of volatility and may even be negative.
6. The transfer values have been calculated in accordance with the guidance note ‘GN11’ published 
by the Institute of Actuaries and Faculty of Actuaries.
During the year , as described above and in accordance with their service
contracts, Messrs Ingram and May elected to receive their pension
entitlements by way of cash payments in lieu of pension contributions 
of £106,383 and £35,460 before tax respectively (2007 – Mr Ingram:
pension contributions of £105,000 and Mr May: cash payment in lieu of
pension of £25,931). Mr Cayzer-Colvin is a member of the GPPP , a defined
contribution scheme into which employer contributions of £27,504
(2007 – £17,000) were paid during the year on his behalf. Mr Wyatt 
has established his own money purchase pension arrangements, 
into which the company made employer contributions of £27,504 
(2007 – £17,000).

There have been no changes in directors’ options to acquire ordinary
shares up to the date of this report. 
The company currently has two executive share option schemes – 
a 1998 scheme under which option grants were made from September
1998 to May 2004, and a 2005 scheme under which option grants
commenced in August 2005. 
Under the terms of both schemes, options may be exercised
between three and ten years after the date of grant, although only one-
third of the shares comprised in an option may be exercised after three
years from grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming exercisable 
six years after grant. Options may only be exercised if performance
targets are met. 
For options granted from 1998 to 2001 under the 1998 scheme,
the target requires the company’s adjusted NAV per share to outperform
either the Retail Prices Index by 3% per annum, or the average of the
increases in the FTSE 250 and the FT Investment Companies indices, over
any consecutive three financial years prior to expiry. For options granted
in 2002 and 2003, the performance target requires the company’s
adjusted NAV per share to outperform either the Retail Prices Index by 3%
per annum, or the FTSE All-Share index, over any consecutive three
financial years prior to expiry. 
For options granted in 2004, the performance target is such that
50% of the shares comprised in an option will vest if the company’s NAV
per share outperforms the Retail Prices Index by at least 9% over the
relevant measurement period, with the other 50% vesting if the
company’s NAV per share outperforms the FTSE All-Share index over the
relevant measurement period. The performance measure has to be
achieved either over the first three years, or over the first four years, after
the date of grant. If the performance measure is not achieved four years
after the date of grant, the options will lapse. 
The performance target for the 2005 scheme requires that 50% of
the shares comprised in an option will vest if Caledonia’s NAV per share
outperforms the Retail Prices Index by at least 9% over the measurement
period. The other 50% of the shares comprised in the option will vest if Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 59 Directors’ report
NAV per share outperforms the FTSE All-Share index by at least 3% over
the measurement period. The measurement period for these purposes
will be the period of three financial years measured at the end of the third
financial year following the date of grant of the options. There is no
retesting of the performance targets. T o the extent that the performance
targets are not met over this three year period, the options will lapse. 
The performance targets have been met for all options granted up
to 2005. The Remuneration Committee selected the targets referred to
above because it believed they provided an appropriate benchmark of the
company’s longer term performance. 
The special options shown in the table above for Mr Ingram relate to
options over 83,000 shares originally granted to Mr Ingram on 5 July 2002
outside the 1998 scheme and subject to special performance-related
terms. As in the case of options granted under the 1998 scheme, only
one-third of the shares under these special options were exercisable 
three years after grant, with the remaining two-thirds becoming
exercisable six years after grant. The special options are subject to 
a stretching performance condition requiring the company’s total
shareholder return (‘TSR’) to outperform the FTSE All-Share T otal Return
index (‘Index’) over the measurement period, which commenced on the
date of grant. T ranches vest in full if TSR exceeds that of the Index by an
average of at least 2% per annum over the relevant measurement period.
If TSR equals that of the Index, none of that tranche will be exercisable and
there will be proportionate vesting of a tranche if TSR exceeds that of the
Index by an average of between zero and 2% per annum. For the one-third
tranche, the performance measure was to be first applied three years
after grant, with two re-test opportunities four and five years after grant.
The performance target for the one-third tranche was tested on 5 July
2005 and met in full, since when Mr Ingram has exercised all of the 
one-third tranche (27,666 shares) in full. For the remaining two-thirds
tranche, being the options over 55,334 shares shown in the table above,
the performance measure was to be first applied five years after grant, 
with two re-test opportunities six and seven years after grant. The
performance target for the two-thirds tranche was tested on 5 July 2007
and met in full. If Mr Ingram remains in service until his retirement age 
of 62, the options will remain exercisable until ten years from grant.
Otherwise, Mr Ingram must normally be in employment to be able to
exercise the options. The shares required to satisfy Mr Ingram’s special
options either have been or will be transferred from the Caledonia
Investments plc Employee Share T rust. The remaining terms of the 
special options are based on the rules of the 1998 scheme, and include
provisions that any benefits obtained from the special options will not be
pensionable and that the terms of the special options will not normally 
be capable of amendment to the advantage of the option holder without
the prior approval of shareholders in general meeting. 
Included in Mr May’s options granted on 20 November 2003 are
options over 28,000 shares also granted outside the 1998 scheme. The
performance conditions and other terms of these options are the same as
those set out above for Mr Ingram and the performance target in respect
of the one-third tranche (9,333 shares) has now been met. 
As at 31 March 2008, the market price of the company’s shares was
2050p (2007 – 2066p) and the range during the year was 1893p to 2189p.

Chairman of the Remuneration Committee Corporate governance report
60 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Directors’ report
Statement of compliance
The board recognises the importance of good corporate governance and
this report describes how the company has applied the principles of good
corporate governance as set out in section one of the Combined Code
issued in June 2006 (the ‘Combined Code’). Shareholders registered on
the company’s New Zealand branch register should note that the
principles of good corporate governance set out in the Combined Code
may materially differ from the New Zealand Exchange’s corporate
governance rules and the principles of its Corporate Governance Best
Practice Code. A copy of the Combined Code is available on the website 
of the Financial Reporting Council at http://www.frc.org.uk/corporate/
combinedcode.cfm
The board
Overall responsibility and operation
The board as a whole is responsible for the group’s objectives and policies
and the management of its resources. It usually has eleven scheduled
meetings a year , but also convenes at additional times when required.
The board has adopted a Schedule of Authorities which sets out matters
specifically reserved to it for decision. Such matters include the approval
of strategy, the annual budget, material capital and revenue transactions
and changes in business activities, treasury policies, risk management
and internal policy limits relating to the company’s investment activities.
The Schedule of Authorities also sets out the authorities that are
delegated to board committees and to executive management. The
Schedule of Authorities is reviewed annually by the board. 
All directors receive appropriate and timely information to ensure
that they are properly briefed in advance of board meetings and have
unlimited access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary 
and other senior management should further information be required.
Non-executive directors have access to independent professional advice
at the company’s expense where they judge it necessary to discharge
their responsibilities as directors.
Appointment, induction and training
All new directors appointed by the board are required to seek election 
by shareholders at the next general meeting of the company following
their appointment and subsequently all directors are required to retire 
by rotation at least every three years. Any non-executive director who has
served on the board for over nine years is subject to annual re-election.
On appointment, new directors are offered induction and training
considered appropriate by the board and subsequently as necessary. 
The Company Secretary provides details of, and where requested
arranges attendance at, external courses to assist in directors’
professional development.
Board composition
The directors, all of whom served throughout the year , are shown 
on pages 24 and 25. 
The board currently comprises twelve directors. Excluding the
Chairman, six of the directors are executive and five non-executive. The
non-executive directors considered to be independent are Messrs Allen-
Jones, Davies, Goblet d’ Alviella and Thompson. In assessing Mr Goblet
d’ Alviella’s independence, the board took account of his position as chief
executive officer of Sofina sa, which has a 4.7% shareholding in Caledonia,
but did not consider this shareholding to be significant in the context of
independence, particularly given the size of the Cayzer Concert Party’s
total interest in the company. Moreover , in the context of Caledonia, the
board regards as key in assessing independence Mr Goblet d’ Alviella’s
ability, given the shareholding of Sofina sa and his past investment
banking experience, to look at the interests of the general body of
shareholders, independent of the Cayzer Concert Party and of
Caledonia’s executive management. Collectively, the directors
throughout the year brought a wide range of experience, skills and
expertise to the stewardship of the company. The individual biographies
of the directors appear on pages 24 and 25. 
The board is led by the Chairman, Mr Buckley, whose responsibilities have
been agreed and set out in writing in the Schedule of Authorities adopted
by the board. The Chairman’s primary role is to ensure that the board and
individual directors are able to operate efficiently by setting the agenda,
style and tone of board discussions to promote constructive debate and
effective decision making. He has overall responsibility for monitoring the
development needs of the board as a whole and of individual directors
and for ensuring that the performance of the board, its committees and
individual directors are evaluated at least once a year . In conjunction with
the Chief Executive, the Chairman is responsible for ensuring effective
communication with shareholders and that all board members develop
an understanding of the views of investors. This is primarily achieved by
board briefings following meetings with significant shareholders, analysts
and private client stockbrokers, some of which are also attended by the
Senior Independent Non-Executive Director . 
The Chief Executive, Mr Ingram, heads the executive management
team and is primarily responsible for the implementation of the board’s
policies and strategy and for managing the activities of the company
other than in relation to those matters specifically reserved to the board
or delegated to its committees. His responsibilities have also been agreed
and set out in writing in the Schedule of Authorities adopted by the
board. Except where the board gives specific direction otherwise, the
Chief Executive may delegate any of those matters to other members 
of the executive management team or to executive committees, but
ultimately he is accountable to the board for the overall performance 
of the company. 
A strong independent non-executive representation on the board 
is headed by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director , 
Mr Allen-Jones. The role of the non-executive directors, as set out in their
letters of appointment, is to challenge constructively, and contribute 
to, the development of strategy; to scrutinise the performance of
management in meeting agreed goals and objectives and monitor their
performance; to satisfy themselves that financial information is accurate
and that financial controls and systems of risk management are robust
and defensible; to determine appropriate levels of remuneration for
executive directors; and to have a prime role in senior management
appointments and succession planning. 
The composition of the board is such that, throughout the year , 
the company did not comply with provision A.3.2 of the Combined Code.
The board however believes that the main objectives of board balance
and independence set out in the Combined Code – that the board should
include a balance of executive and non-executive directors, and in
particular independent non-executive directors, such that no individual
or small group of individuals can dominate the board’s decision taking –
are met. 
The board is currently broadly comprised of three categories of
directors – the four independent non-executive directors; four directors
(the Chairman and three executive directors – The Hon C W Cayzer and
Messrs Cayzer-Colvin and Wyatt) who are involved in the affairs of Cayzer
T rust, Caledonia’s largest shareholder; and three other executive
directors (Messrs Ingram, Cartwright and May). Mr Loudon does not fall
into any of these categories as his thirteen year tenure as a non-executive
director exceeds the nine year limit specified in the Combined Code
criteria for independence (although absent the Combined Code’s nine
year limit the board would have regarded him as independent) and,
although a member of the wider Cayzer family, he is not involved in the
affairs of Cayzer T rust.  Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 61 Directors’ report
In addition to the balance on the board brought by these categories, the
Governance Committee, comprising solely independent non-executive
directors, keeps under review corporate governance and conflict 
of interest issues relating to the company and the board and may
recommend that any director abstains from participating in any decision
of the board, or any board committee, where it believes that a conflict of
interest could, or could be perceived to, arise. The board believes that this
structure ensures the necessary level of board balance demanded by the
Combined Code and safeguards against any individual or small group of
individuals being able to dominate the board’s decision taking. Whilst 
not in strict compliance with provision A.3.2 of the Combined Code, the
board believes this structure is appropriate in the context of a company
with a large controlling shareholder whose stability and support is
fundamental to Caledonia’s business model as a long term, supportive
investor , and is therefore in the best interests of all shareholders. 
The Combined Code also requires that the members of the
Remuneration and Audit Committees should all be independent non-
executive directors. However , Mr Loudon’s membership of these
Committees, given the nine year limit on length of service as a non-
executive director included in the Combined Code’s criterion for
independence, means that provisions B.2.1 and C.3.1 of the Combined
Code are not met. However , the board otherwise regards Mr Loudon as
independent and considers his length of experience with the company, 
as well as his business career , to be significant assets. Accordingly, the
board believes his membership of these Committees to be in the best
interests of shareholders.
Board committees
The board has delegated certain specific areas of responsibility to the
following standing committees, the terms of reference of which are
reviewed annually and are available on the company’s website. The
current membership of these committees is noted on page 69.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee, chaired by Mr Buckley, is responsible for the
regular review of the structure, size and composition (including the skills,
knowledge and experience) of the board and for giving consideration 
to succession planning for executive directors and, if requested by the
board, for other senior executives. It is responsible for identifying, using
external search consultants where necessary, candidates to fill board
vacancies as and when they arise and for making recommendations to
the board in relation thereto and for keeping under review the leadership
needs of the company, both executive and non-executive. It reviews the
time required of non-executive directors and ensures that they receive
formal letters of appointment setting out clearly what is expected of
them in terms of time commitment, committee service and involvement
outside board meetings. 
The Nomination Committee met once during the year in order to
undertake a formal review of the size and composition of the board
following the 2007 annual board performance evaluation and to consider
the contribution and commitment of the non-executive directors retiring
at the 2007 annual general meeting, prior to giving recommendations 
for their re-elections.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, chaired by Mr Davies, is responsible for
the review of executive remuneration policy. Within that policy, the
Remuneration Committee determines the remuneration packages of
executive directors and reviews those of other senior executive
management. It is also responsible for the design of, and grant of awards
under , the company’s share incentive schemes and for the determination
of the policy for and scope of pension arrangements, service agreements,
termination payments and compensation commitments for executive
directors and, if requested by the board, for other senior executives. 
The Remuneration Committee met three times during the year .
The matters considered by the Remuneration Committee included:
• The determination of bonuses for executive directors and review of
bonuses for other senior executives for the year ended 31 March 2007.
• The grant of options and deferred bonus awards under the company’s
executive share option scheme and deferred bonus plan.
• The determination of basic salaries for executive directors and review 
of salaries for other senior executives for the year commencing 
1 April 2008.
• A review of the design of the company’s deferred bonus plan in the
context of the company’s policies on executive remuneration and
current market practice, and the consequent proposal to seek
shareholder approval for an amendment to the plan rules to provide 
for conditional matching share awards for compulsory bonus deferral.
Further information on the company’s executive remuneration policy 
and the work of the Remuneration Committee is included in the
directors’ remuneration report set out on pages 53 to 59.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, chaired by Mr Allen-Jones, is responsible for the
monitoring of the integrity of the financial statements of the company
and any announcements relating to the company’s financial performance
and for reviewing any significant financial reporting judgements
contained therein. It also reviews the company’s systems of internal
control and risk management procedures and considers annually
whether an internal audit function is required. The Audit Committee
believes that, in the context of the company’s business as an investment
trust company, the key issues on which it has to satisfy itself are the
integrity of the application of the company’s policy for the valuation of its
investments, particularly those which are unquoted, and the robustness
of the group’s internal controls. The valuations of the company’s
unquoted investments are subject to formal six monthly reviews by an
internal Challenge Committee, independent of the relevant investment
executives, whose meetings are also attended by the auditors, and key
valuations are then reviewed by the Audit Committee. A formal report on
the effectiveness of the group’s internal controls and risk management
procedures is prepared annually for the board by the company’s Risk
Manager . It is the Audit Committee’s current opinion that, in view of
these control processes, the size of the entities controlled by Caledonia
and the relatively straightforward control considerations in relation to
other investments, a separate internal audit function is not necessary.  Corporate governance report
62 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Directors’ report
It is also the Audit Committee’s responsibility to review and monitor 
the independence and objectivity of the external auditors and the
effectiveness of the audit process and to develop and implement policy
on the engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit services.
In this regard, the Audit Committee has approved a schedule of specific
non-audit activities which may not be undertaken by the external
auditors, within the broad principles that the external auditors should 
not audit their own work, should not make management decisions on
behalf of the company, should not be put into the role of advocate for the
company and that no mutuality of interest should be created between
the company and the external auditors. The Audit Committee believes
that, by applying these principles, the objectivity and independence of
the auditors is maintained, notwithstanding that non-audit work may 
be undertaken. On an annual basis, the Audit Committee considers 
and makes a recommendation to the board as to the appointment, re-
appointment or removal of the external auditors. The Audit Committee is
also responsible for the company’s formal whistleblowing arrangements,
whereby members of staff may raise any issues of concern regarding
possible impropriety in the conduct of the company’s business and
whereby any such concerns are properly investigated and appropriate
action taken. 
The Combined Code recommends that at least one member of the
Audit Committee should have recent and relevant financial experience.
The Audit Committee considers that Mr Loudon, who was formerly group
finance director of Blue Circle Industries, has such financial experience. 
In addition, the chairman of the Audit Committee, Mr Allen-Jones, 
is a member of the Financial Reporting Review Panel. 
The Audit Committee met three times during the year , and each
meeting included a discussion with the auditors without any of the
executive directors present. During the year , the business undertaken 
by the Audit Committee included:
• A review of the performance of the external auditors, Deloitte & T ouche
LLP , and the level of fees charged for its services.
• Consideration of the scope of the 2008 annual audit and agreement
with the external auditors of the key areas of focus.
• A review of the company’s internal valuation guidelines and scrutiny 
of valuations of unquoted investments selected by the Committee in
accordance with its adopted criteria.
• Consideration of the reports from the external auditors concerning
their audit of the 2007 annual financial statements of the company 
and their review of the 2007 half-year report.
• Consideration of the financial disclosures contained in the 2007 
annual and half-year reports.
• The review of reports from the company’s Risk Manager on the
effectiveness of the group’s internal controls and risk management
procedures for the year ended 31 March 2008 and on the company’s
head office internal controls.
• Consideration of the need or otherwise for an internal audit function.
• A review of the independence and objectivity of the external auditors,
including their system of quality controls and the level and nature of
non-audit services provided by them.
• An evaluation of the performance of the Audit Committee itself for 
the year ended 31 March 2007.
• Assurance of the company’s compliance with the requirements for
approval as an investment trust company.
Governance Committee
The Governance Committee, chaired by Mr Allen-Jones, keeps under
review corporate governance issues relating to the company and is
responsible for the monitoring and review of the ability of each director 
to act in the interests of shareholders as a whole and to exercise
independence of judgement free from relationships or circumstances
which are likely to, or could appear to, affect his judgement. Where it
concludes that such criteria are not satisfied with regard to any director , 
it may make such recommendations to the board as it may think fit,
including that the director abstains from participating in any decision 
of the board or any of its committees on the matter concerned. The
Governance Committee met once during the year , principally to review
and approve the corporate governance report for the year ended 
31 March 2007.

Board performance evaluation
The board conducts an annual formal evaluation of its own performance
and that of its committees and individual directors. For the year ended 
31 March 2008, the evaluation of the board as a whole and of its
committees was led by the Chairman and was conducted by inviting
individual board members to complete a questionnaire regarding the
operation and effectiveness of the board as a whole and of its
committees, the responses to which were collated by the Company
Secretary and discussed. The evaluation of the performance of the
Chairman was led by the Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
and involved private discussion with other members of the board of their
views on his performance, the results of which were then considered at
meetings of the non-executive directors, without the Chairman present,
and of the Governance Committee. The evaluation of the performance 
of the Chief Executive was undertaken by the Chairman and the non-
executive directors. The performance of the non-executive directors 
was reviewed by the Chairman, the Chief Executive and the Senior
Independent Non-Executive Director , with the Senior Independent 
Non-Executive Director absent in respect of his own performance
appraisal. As part of this review, non-executive directors were invited
to complete self-assessment questionnaires in relation to their own
effectiveness. The performance of the executive directors, which
included further consideration of that of the Chief Executive and
Chairman, was undertaken by the Remuneration Committee as part 
of the annual executive salary review process.  Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 63 Directors’ report
The results of the evaluation of the board as a whole and of its
committees for the year ended 31 March 2008 were presented in a report
to the board. The Nomination Committee reviewed the size, structure
and composition of the board in the light of this report.
Internal control
The board has overall responsibility for the group’s systems of risk
management and internal control, although the review of risk
management procedures and internal controls is delegated to the Audit
Committee. The group’s system of internal control is designed to
manage, rather than eliminate, risk of failure to achieve business
objectives. It is recognised that such a system can only provide
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material misstatement 
or loss. The board confirms that the system of internal control operated
by the group accords with the T urnbull guidance 2005 and has been in
place throughout the year and up to the date of approval of these
financial statements. 
Major business risks facing group companies and key investments
are identified and assessed by local management and procedures are
agreed to address these as appropriate. The boards of these companies
review business risk and controls regularly to ensure the system of risk
management operates effectively. Caledonia’s investment executives
then confirm, through Caledonia’s Risk Manager , to the Audit Committee
that the system of risk management is operating effectively for these
group companies and key investments. 
Key risks identified are regularly monitored at company level by
members of the Executive Committee, who have clear mandates to
assess and report on risk in their particular areas of responsibility. From
these assessments, an ongoing risk profile of the company’s activities is
updated half-yearly and reviewed by the board. The board is also provided
quarterly with a list of the key risk issues identified by executive
management at that particular time. All of the company’s larger
investments are reviewed at least annually by the board and the smaller
portfolio holdings reviewed at least annually by the Executive Committee. 
Specific control procedures are in place to ensure that the company
continually monitors and complies with the requirements for investment
trust status. The board receives monthly compliance reports evidencing
that the company is meeting the various tests for investment trust 
status and also confirming that the investment activities undertaken 
by executive management are within the overall policy limits set by the
board. A Compliance Committee, comprising the Company Secretary
(chairman), the Finance Director , three associate directors and the Group
Financial Controller/Risk Manager has been established, which meets
weekly to review the company’s ongoing compliance with its investment
trust status and to monitor and approve all investment activity from 
an investment trust compliance perspective. 
Financial performance is continuously measured by comparing
total shareholder returns and net asset value per share movements
against the FTSE All-Share index. Performance statistics are reported
monthly to the board. Income and expenses are monitored by the board
against an approved annual budget and regularly updated forecasts.
Valuations of unquoted investments are subject to a rigorous six monthly
review process undertaken by a Challenge Committee independent 
of the relevant investment executives, whose meetings are also 
attended by the auditors, and key valuations are then reviewed by 
the Audit Committee. 
Since the year end, the directors have concluded their annual
review of the operation and effectiveness of the group’s system of
internal control.
Relations with shareholders
The company welcomes dialogue with institutional shareholders in order
to achieve a mutual understanding of objectives. The Chief Executive 
and the Finance Director seek meetings with larger institutional
shareholders and private client stockbrokers after the announcement 
of year end and half-year results. The Senior Independent Non-Executive
Director attends some of these meetings. The annual general meeting
also provides a forum for shareholders to meet the directors, both
formally and informally. 
The chairmen of all of the board’s committees will be available 
to answer questions at the annual general meeting of the company. 64 Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008 Other information
Portfolio valuation methodology
Investments are measured at the directors’ estimate of fair value at the
reporting date, in accordance with IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments:
Recognition and Measurement’. Fair value is the amount for which an
asset could be exchanged between knowledgeable, willing parties in 
an arm’s length transaction.
Quoted investments
Investments quoted in an active market are valued at their bid price on
the reporting date. When a bid price is unavailable, the price of the most
recent transaction will normally be used.
Unquoted investments
Unquoted investments are valued by applying an appropriate valuation
technique, which makes maximum use of market-based information, 
is consistent with models generally used by market participants and is
applied consistently from period to period, except where a change would
result in a better estimation of fair value. Unquoted investments are
grouped into direct and fund investments.
Unquoted direct investments
Unquoted direct investments have characteristics similar to private
equity investments, in that the value is generally crystallised through the
sale or flotation of the entire business, rather than the sale of an individual
instrument. Valuations of such investments are based upon the
‘International Private Equity and Venture Capital Valuation Guidelines’,
using the following model:
• Determine the enterprise value using an appropriate valuation
methodology and adjust for surplus assets, excess or unrecorded
liabilities and other relevant factors.
• Deduct any financial instruments ranking ahead of the highest ranking
instrument held by the company.
• Apply a marketability discount where appropriate to give the net
attributable enterprise value. Such a marketability discount relates 
to the investment rather than the underlying business and reflects the
compensation that willing buyers will demand for the risk arising from
the lack of marketability. Factors that will be considered in determining
the marketability discount are the closeness to a realisation event, the
investors’ influence over the timing of realisation and the difficulty and
risk of actions required to put the business into a saleable condition. It is
a rebuttable presumption that a 30% discount is to be applicable to all
unquoted direct investments. This presumption may be rebutted if the
available evidence and consideration of the foregoing factors indicate
that a different marketability discount would be appropriate or that no
marketability discount should be applied. Where a discount is applied,
it will normally fall in the range of 10% to 30%.
• Apportion the net attributable enterprise value between the relevant
financial instruments according to their rankings and allocate to the
company’s holding in each of these financial instruments.
Given the uncertainties inherent in estimating the fair value of unquoted
direct investments, a degree of caution is applied in exercising judgments
and making the necessary estimates. 
Enterprise value is normally determined using one of the following
valuation methodologies:
Price of recent investment
Where the investment being valued was made recently, its cost will
generally provide a good indication of fair value. Where there has been
any recent investment in the investee company, the price of that
investment will provide a basis of the valuation. Where the price at which
a third party has invested is being considered as the basis of valuation, 
the background to the transaction will be taken into account to indicate
whether or not the price was representative of the fair value at the time.
This methodology is likely to be appropriate only for a limited period after
the date of the relevant transaction. The period will depend on the
specific circumstances of each investment, but one year is usually applied.
Earnings multiple
This methodology involves the application of an earnings multiple to the
maintainable earnings of the business being valued. This methodology is
likely to be appropriate for an investment in an established business with
an identifiable stream of continuing earnings that can be considered 
to be maintainable. 
Maintainable earnings are taxed at the standard tax rate. Generally,
the latest historical accounts are used unless reliable forecast results for
the current year are available. The earnings multiple used is determined
by reference to market-based multiples appropriate for the business and
correlate to the period and calculation of earnings of the company being
valued. In determining an appropriate earnings multiple, reference may
be made to a single comparator company, or a number of companies, 
or the earnings multiple of a quoted stock market sector or sub-sector
where there are similar business activities, markets served, size,
geography and applicable tax rate.
Net assets
The net assets methodology involves deriving the value of a business by
reference to the fair value of its net assets. This is likely to be appropriate
for a business whose value derives mainly from the underlying value of its
assets rather than its earnings, such as property holding companies and
investment businesses. It may also be appropriate for a business that is
not making an adequate return on assets and for which a greater value
can be realised by liquidating the business and selling its assets. Third
party valuations may be used to give the fair value of a certain asset or
group of assets. 
Unquoted fund investments
Unquoted funds investments refer to participations in collective
investment vehicles. 
Where the valuation reported by the fund’s manager represents the
amount at which the interest in the fund could be exchanged in an arm’s
length transaction at the reporting date, this value is used in estimating
the fair value of the investment. If the valuation reported by the fund’s
manager is not available at the reporting date, the latest valuation is used
and may be adjusted to reflect changes or events subsequent to the
publication date. 
If the fund’s manager does not report a value at which an arms
length transaction could occur , then the value of the investment in the
fund is determined by applying valuation techniques to the fund’s
underlying investments. Caledonia Investments plc Annual report 2008

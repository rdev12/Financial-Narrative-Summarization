Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements The Group has made further good
progress during 2013, delivering results
in line with the Board’s expectations
for the year.
This performance reflects the benefits
of our strategic decisions to deploy
capital in those markets that offer
superior growth opportunities,
amplifying our geographic diversity,
and to implement a three year plan
to improve operational efficiency.
As a result we have mitigated both the
impact of the continued economic
headwinds in Europe during the year
and the unusual severity of the winter
months at the start of 2013. With
revenues marginally ahead over the
year, our margins were stable and our
interest charge reduced, improving our
profitability and driving strong growth
in earnings.
As planned, a substantial investment
programme was undertaken during the
year, predominantly directed at expanding
our businesses in France and the Middle
East to meet growing demand and at the
continued refreshment of our European
rental fleet to support our strong market
positions. This investment was fully funded
from our annual cash flows and illustrates
the strong cash generation capabilities
and robust capital structure that the
Group has developed.
As previously reported, our return on
capital employed (“ROCE”) showed a
marginal 10bps decline in the year,
principally due to a weaker than expected
trading performance from our UK
business. We have taken steps to address
this within the UK, strengthening the
organisational structure and management
team, and we are pleased to see these
measures starting to deliver the required
performance improvement. We remain
confident that the Group’s ROCE can be
further improved, in order to meet our
strategic target of being above its pre-tax
weighted average cost of capital of 11%
across the business cycle.
Over the past three years, the Group’s
capabilities have been significantly
enhanced through successfully

2     Lavendon Group plc 2013 implementing our operational and
capital efficiency programmes. Whilst we
will continue to seek greater efficiency
within our business and are targeting
further operational improvements, our
strategic focus is now on the delivery of
revenue growth in our key markets. We are
confident that growth in revenues derived
from our strong market positions and
differentiated services, when combined
with our improved operational leverage
and self-funded investment, will deliver
substantial shareholder value over the
medium term.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s ROCE was 10.6% for the year
(2012: 10.7%). The calculation of ROCE is
based on the Group’s operating profit
before exceptional items for 2013 and the
average of the opening and closing capital
employed for the year of £300.8 million
(2012: £292.5 million).
Dividend
Given the continued improvement in the
Group’s financial performance and strong
cash flows, the Board is proposing a final
dividend of 2.40 pence per share, making
a total dividend for the year of 3.55 pence;
an increase of 29% over the previous
year (2012: total dividend of 2.75 pence).
The final dividend, if approved, will be
paid on 30 April 2014 to shareholders
on the register at the close of business
on 7 March 2014.
The proposed increase in the dividend for
the year again reflects the Board’s
confidence in the Group’s future and the
continued recognition that dividends are an
important means of delivering shareholder
value. Dividend cover, based on the
proposed total dividend for 2013 and
underlying earnings per share, has been
reduced to 4.0 times (2012: 4.7 times) in
line with our previously stated intention to
increase dividend distributions to a level
that is covered by three to four times by
earnings. Our dividend cover will be
balanced against the Group’s investment
needs and funding requirements as we
move through the business cycle.

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements Operational and capital
efficiency programmes
Our three year programme to improve the
Group’s operational and capital efficiency
has been successfully concluded, delivering
an annualised benefit ahead of our
expectations of £5.2 million by the end of
2013. These gains were secured through
the combination of better asset utilisation
and pricing, more efficient transport, sales
resource realignment and improved
procurement of goods and services.
An additional phase of operational
improvements has been scoped and a
target of an annualised £1.5 million has
been set to be delivered by the end of
2016. It is expected that these savings will
be primarily derived through further
efficiency from within our transport network
and procurement activity. The delivery of
these benefits will be managed through
our cycle of continuous improvement,
as we seek greater operational leverage
within our business model.
The effective deployment of capital remains
central to the Group’s strategy to improve
ROCE, strengthening market positions and
supporting growth opportunities where
incremental returns are attractive. During
the year additional capital was deployed in
France and the Middle East, as fleets were
expanded to meet growing demand, and we
expect to invest further in these businesses
in 2014. Utilisation of the Group’s existing
fleet capacity was again improved during the
year, reflecting better process management
and increased availability through more
efficient maintenance programmes. The
Group’s new IT platform now covers almost
85% of the Group’s revenues and, with the
initial teething issues in Germany now fully
resolved, is providing an enhanced capability
to drive asset utilisation and returns through
improved visibility and functionality.
The ability to improve returns from our
existing fleet, before allocating additional
capital, is an important factor that can
augment our financial returns as market
conditions improve.
Financial results
The Group’s total revenue for the year
increased by 1% to £237.5 million (2012:
£234.6 million), with rental revenues
increasing by 2% to £225.3 million (2012:
£220.7 million) and revenues from the sale
of new and ex-rental fleet equipment
declining by £1.7 million.
Underlying operating profits increased by
1% to £35.3 million (2012: £35.0 million),
while operating margins were stable at
14.9%. With underlying net interest costs
reducing to £5.3 million during the year
(2012: £7.4 million), the Group’s
underlying profit before tax increased by
9% to £30.0 million (2012: £27.6 million).
This increase in profitability, combined
with a reduced effective tax rate of 20%
(2012: 23%), generated an underlying
profit after tax of £24.1 million (2012:
£21.2 million) and a 12% increase in
underlying earnings per share to
14.42 pence (2012: 12.83 pence).
Amortisation charges in the year reduced
to £3.3 million (2012: £3.8 million), and an
exceptional charge of £3.3 million was
incurred (2012: £3.6 million) relating
principally to the completion of the
restructuring exercise within our German
business. After amortisation charges and
exceptional items, the Group’s operating
profit was £28.7 million (2012: £29.7
million). The Group’s profit before tax was
£23.4 million (2012: £20.8 million) and the
Group’s profit after tax was £19.1 million
(2012: £16.2 million), with earnings per
share of 11.41 pence (2012: 9.80 pence).
Using exchange rates consistent with
2012, the Group’s total revenues for the
year declined by 1% to £233.2 million
(2012: £234.6 million), with underlying
operating profits at £34.7 million (2012:
£35.0 million). Underlying profit before tax
increased to £29.4 million (2012: £27.6
million), while underlying profit after tax
increased to £23.7 million (2012: £21.2
million), with underlying earnings per
share increasing to 14.16 pence
(2012: 12.83 pence).
Cash flow
Underlying earnings before interest, tax,
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
increased to £76.2 million (2012: £75.6
million), with margins stable at 32.1%
(2012: 32.2%). Although the Group’s fleet
investment programme in the year
increased the net cash outflow relating to
the purchase and sale of rental fleet assets
to £39.9 million (2012: £25.4 million), the
Group still generated a healthy £25.5 million
from operations (2012: £39.7 million). Net
cash generated from operating activities,
after payment of interest and tax, was
£12.3 million (2012: £21.2 million).
Investment
As planned, the Group increased its level of
capital expenditure for 2013 with a total of
£55.1 million invested in the Group’s rental
fleet and operational infrastructure (2012:
£47.9 million). This was partly funded by
the disposal of surplus or retired assets
which generated £10.5 million (2012:
£11.1 million). After reflecting movements
in amounts owing to equipment suppliers
at the beginning and end of the year, this
activity resulted in a net cash outflow
relating to capital expenditure of £44.9
million (2012: £29.8 million), which was fully
funded from annual operating cash flows.
In 2014, it is planned to undertake an
investment programme of similar size to
2013, again funded through annual
operating cash flows.
The investment programme undertaken in
the year has replaced approximately 7%
of the Group’s rental fleet, expanded the
French and Middle East fleets to meet
growing demand, increased the availability
of our BlueSky range of machine
attachments and improved our operational
infrastructure. The overall impact of our
fleet investment and disposal programme
has been a net increase in the Group’s total
fleet size of around 700 units to 20,600
machines by the year end, and a reduction
in the average age of our fleet to 7.1 years
(2012: 7.3 years).
Net debt
The strength of the Group’s operating cash
flows absorbed the planned increase in the
capital expenditure programme for 2013,
and consequently, despite an adverse
foreign exchange movement of £1.6 million,
the Group’s net debt at the year end of
£97.7 million remained broadly in line with
the £97.3 million at the end of 2012.

Private Placement, the Group’s reported
net debt at 31 December 2013 was
£97.0 million (2012: £96.5 million).
The corresponding debt to equity ratio
improved to 46% (2012: 49%), and the net
debt to pre-exceptional EBITDA ratio
(calculated on a rolling 12 month basis)
reduced marginally to 1.27 times (2012:
1.28 times). The Group is operating well
within its banking covenants and has
significant liquidity available from its
combined financing facilities.
Board changes
As the Group moves into the next stage of
its development, the Board have recognised
the need to refresh its composition and add
a wider breadth of skills and experience.
Consequently with effect from 1 March 2014,
we have appointed John Coghlan and
John Wyatt as Non Executive Directors. 
Jan Åstrand, who has been a Non-Executive
Director of the Group since 2010, has
resigned from the Board with effect of
26 February 2014. I would like to take this
opportunity to thank Jan for his advice and
contribution to the Board over the past
three years. Andrew Wood will replace Jan
as the Group’s Senior Independent Director
and John Coghlan will become Chairman of
the Group’s Remuneration Committee.
Summary and outlook
During 2013, the Group’s profitability
continued to improve as strong revenue
growth from our French and Middle East
businesses was combined with the
successful completion of our three year
efficiency improvement programme. The
restructuring exercise in our German
business has been completed, and action
has been taken to address a relatively
disappointing performance from our UK
business in the year; the benefits of these
measures are beginning to be seen.
The strength of the Group’s cash flows
fully funded a substantial investment
programme in the year, supporting the
expansion of our French and Middle East
businesses while at the same time enabling
our extensive refreshment plans for our
European fleet to continue apace.
This ability to internally fund our annual
fleet replacement requirements while
supporting growth opportunities with
investment, is a key attribute of the Group
going forward as we seek ever greater
returns from our deployed capital base.
The Board believes that the necessary
measures are in place to enable ROCE, our
key performance metric, to be increased
above the Group’s weighted average cost
of capital over the business cycle. The
efficiency gains secured over the past three
years are embedded within our business
model, and the improved operating
leverage that these provide will be further
enhanced by the additional operational
improvements now being targeted. The
momentum that has been created within
the business to date, through our efficiency
and selective expansion programmes, is yet
to benefit appreciably from any cyclical
recovery in our European markets. As we
move into 2014, with the first signs of
improving market conditions emerging in
the UK and a more efficient business model
established, we are well positioned to drive
revenue growth within our business and
deliver increased profitability.
Trading since the year end is in line with our
expectations and has not been disrupted by
a prolonged period of adverse weather to
date. The Board believes the Group is well
positioned to deliver continued financial
progress this year and substantial
shareholder value over the medium term.

Introduction
Summary
Lavendon seeks to become the market
leading powered access rental business 
in each of its chosen geographic markets.
Our primary strategic objective is to deliver
a Return on Capital Employed that is in
excess of our Weighted Average Cost of
Capital over our business cycle, thereby
generating sustainable long term growth
in shareholder value.
Our ambition
Lavendon seeks to become the market
leading powered access company in each 
of its chosen geographic markets.
Our strategy is to develop and grow as a
specialist power access rental equipment
business, providing safe access solutions 
to customers. With our focus on specialist
expertise and high customer service levels,
Lavendon provides a differentiated value
proposition that positions it as a ‘best in
class’ business allowing it to outperform its
markets and thereby generate sustainable
long term growth in shareholder value.
Our primary strategic objective is to deliver
a Return on Capital Employed (“ROCE”) that
is in excess of our Weighted Average Cost 
of Capital (“WACC”) over our business cycle,
thereby generating sustainable long term
growth in shareholder value.
This is delivered through deploying capital
into markets that offer attractive margins
and/or growth potential, and ensuring our
businesses operate with sufficient scale
and efficiency that strong market positions
are secured to support the future growth
of the Group.
What is powered access?
Powered access (also known as aerial 
work platforms (AWP’s) or mobile elevating 
work platforms (MEWP’s)) refers to a range 
of equipment designed to enable people 
to work safely, productively and efficiently 
at height. It provides an alternative to
traditional access methods such as ladders,
mobile access towers and scaffolding.
There are four broad categories of
powered access equipment:
• Low level access or ‘Personnel Lifts’.
• Scissor lifts.
• Boom lifts.
• Truck or van-mounted platforms.
The equipment is available to facilitate 
safe working at a range of heights from
1.5 metres to over 100 metres. Our fleet
includes scissor lifts, boom lifts, low level
access units, van-mounted platforms
and larger truck-mounted platforms
reaching up to 85 metres.
6     Lavendon Group plc 2013 Scissor and boom lifts are typically powered
by diesel engines or electric batteries. The
diesel units are used externally and include
four wheel drive units which are suitable for
use over rough terrain. The zero emissions
from electric machines allow them to be
used indoors for a variety of applications
from construction to maintenance.
Low level access units are generally for
indoor use and are either battery powered
or manually powered by the operator
themselves.
Most of our machines are operated by
our customers, who need to be
appropriately trained and hold valid
operator licences. The larger truck-mount
platforms however, are usually supplied
with a specialist operator, who is
responsible for elevating the customer
to the required location; for example
a television cameraman filming at a
major sporting event.
Drivers of the use of
powered access equipment
In addition to general economic conditions,
demand for the equipment is driven by the
following factors:
• Commercial pressure to reduce project
timescales, where speed, convenience,
efficiency and safety are prime concerns.
• Increased focus on safety in the
workplace, supported by ever more
stringent Health and Safety legislation,
accelerating the substitution of more
traditional methods of access, such as
ladders, scaffolding and mobile towers
by powered access.
• The increasing modularisation of
construction processes, which tends to
produce a greater demand for access
equipment on construction sites.
• Escalating costs and shortage of skilled
labour in the construction and
refurbishment sectors, leading to a need
to ensure those available are equipped
with the necessary tools to be as
productive as possible.
Why is powered access
equipment rented?
Powered access equipment tends to be
rented rather than owned for the following
main reasons:
• The equipment has a relatively high
capital cost and stringent transport and
maintenance requirements.
• A range of equipment would be required
to satisfy all applications.
• The need for the equipment tends to be
infrequent and inconsistent due to varying
work schedules and applications.
The combination of the drivers of demand
and the efficiencies gained from the rental
of the equipment, should, we believe,
continue to enable the market to grow in
the coming years, subject to prevailing
economic conditions.
The competitive environments that we
experience vary from country to country.
However, a consistent feature is that the
markets are highly competitive, serviced 
by operations ranging from divisions of
public companies, through private equity
backed ventures, to privately owned family
businesses, with the construction sector
an important market and particularly
sensitive to pricing levels.
Our business model
Our business model is designed to
efficiently manage the Group through
the economic cycles that it experiences.
Through using its scale, geographic
diversity and effective fleet management,
the Group seeks to maximise its return
on investment and deliver sustainable
growth in shareholder value.
There are four key components within
our business model:
Our customers
We have a diverse customer base
ranging from multinational businesses 
to sole traders, operating in a variety of
market sectors across the geographies
we serve. In all cases they are looking for 
a powered access solution to allow their
employees to work safely, comfortably
and effectively at height.
Our people
Our employees provide the vital link to
satisfying our customer requirements.
Over 80% of our workforce perform roles
that directly interface with customers.
Our rental fleet
Lavendon operates a large and diverse fleet
of over 20,000 powered access units across
its operations in Europe and the Middle East.
Our service
Our service is how we seek to differentiate
ourselves from our competitors. It is all
about how we combine the expertise of all
our people in delivering reliable fleet in a
timely, professional and seamless fashion
to meet our customer’s requirements.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Lavendon Group plc 2013     7

Our customers
Our customers are primarily based in Europe and the Middle East. In Europe we operate
rental businesses in the United Kingdom, Germany, France and Belgium. In the Middle East
region we operate businesses in Bahrain, India, Kuwait, Oman, Qatar, Saudi Arabia and the
United Arab Emirates.
The construction industry is the largest market segment that we serve, in particular
industrial, commercial and infrastructure sectors within ‘construction’. However, because of
its inherent cyclical nature, Lavendon has sought to diversify its customer base over time,
so that this segment now comprises only 49% of the total end user customer base.
Other large market segments include facilities management, infrastructure and utilities,
industrial, oil and gas and finishing trades. In addition there are many smaller customer
segments varying from tree surgery and sign erection to film production and the media.
Strategic report
Business model – understanding our approach to business
Our service
Our customers value equipment reliability above all other factors. Our
Engineering function delivers ‘world class’ fleet maintenance across the business
with a professional culture reinforced by our Technical Excellence (“Tech-X”)
programme. All our European and Middle Eastern depots have now achieved
Tech-X Silver accreditation, with a further 29 depots already going on to achieve
the Gold standard. As a result, the reliability of the fleet has consistently improved
over the years.
Our specialist BlueSky Solutions business provides highly regarded safety and
efficiency improving solutions which further enhance the customer’s experience
when using our equipment. Products such as SkySiren help safeguard against operator
entrapment, while the SkySentry product restricts access to the machines by unqualified
operators and allows the machine’s location and usage to be tracked.

Our people
Our employees are engaged to deliver high levels of customer service, with a professionalism
that differentiates Lavendon from its competitors.
There are three primary roles, Hire Desk, Engineering and Logistics which are in turn
supported by the Sales & Marketing and Administration functions.
Hire Desk Controllers record customer order requirements, advise on appropriate machine
specifications, arrange surveys or specialist attachments and then allocate suitable machines
from the fleet.
The Engineering team inspect, service, repair, test, and certify each machine within the fleet
prior to its delivery to a customer. Reliability is the top customer priority, so delivering high
quality engineering services is vital in preventing breakdowns. In the event that a customer
experiences a breakdown or a machine is damaged in use, our mobile engineers can be
dispatched to carry out evaluation and necessary repairs on site.
The Logistics team is responsible for coordinating the delivery and collection of
machines to customer sites and arranging the provision of operators for the larger
truck-mounted platforms.
Our fleet
Lavendon operates a large fleet of over 20,000 powered access units across its operations
in Europe and the Middle East.
Our fleet is stored, serviced and despatched from our international network of depots,
strategically placed to deliver to our chosen markets.
The fleet is mobile and is routinely relocated within the depot network or across countries,
in order to maximise returns and ensure each market has the equipment that is being
demanded by the customer.
Typically the equipment will have a useful life of 7 to 13 years before it is replaced.
We continually seek to optimise our fleet mix through our capital replacement and capital
expansion programmes. In 2013 we invested £50 million in new fleet.

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements Vision for the future
Our long term vision is for Lavendon Group
to become the market leading powered
access rental business and ‘Safe Access
Solutions” provider in its chosen markets. 
We will demonstrate operational excellence,
achieving ‘best in class’ levels of customer
service, operational capability, fleet reliability
and punctuality, while remaining efficient
and flexible to be resilient to market forces.
We aim to be an employer of choice for our
workforce, offering them a rewarding and
challenging career, engaging them to deliver
high levels of service to our customers.
Road map
To achieve this vision we planned three
phases of development, which are set out
on the opposite page.
For 2011 to 2013 we have focused on
improving, standardising and optimising
the Group’s operations to ready it for the
transition into a ‘best in class’ business.
We have called this phase “Fit for the
Future”, and through the rigorous
implementation of a plan to improve both
operational and capital efficiency we have
secured significant financial benefits.
The second phase, titled “Best in Class”
seeks to drive the business onward to
achieve operational excellence.
In the final phase “Safe Access Solutions
Provider” we are looking to leverage our
position to be the de facto market leading
brand and partner of choice for the
customer.
Strategic objectives for 2013
The primary strategic objectives for the year
and their relationship with our business
model are set out on pages 6 to 27. We also
detail our performance against these
objectives and make note of some of the
challenges we have faced in the year.
• During the year we launched the Safe
Access Solutions value proposition.
This document clearly articulates that we
consider safety as the primary focus for
every part of our business, offering the
Strategic report
Chief Executive’s review
Maintaining a clear strategic direction
On joining the Group in October 2011, I set
out a vision for the future of Lavendon and a
roadmap to achieve our primary strategic aim: 
‘deliver a ROCE greater than our WACC over
the business cycle’.
This strategic report provides the opportunity
to communicate that vision, our strategy to
achieve it and the progress made to date.
Don Kenny Group Chief Executive

customer an insight into how we’ve
designed our world to put their safety
first in everything we do. We believe this
focus will increasingly differentiate our
offering from that of our competitors
and build increasing customer loyalty
to Lavendon Group.
• All Lavendon business units now have a
full time dedicated health and safety
professional in post. We have expanded
our KPI’s to include an accident frequency
rate (“AFR"). The AFR is used to monitor
our performance with regard to “lost time”
accidents requiring an employee or
contractors to three or more days off
from work as a result. In a year where
the number of accidents reported has
increased due to an improved reporting
culture in our business we are pleased
to announce that we beat our target of
0.7 accidents per 100,000 hours worked,
achieving 0.69.
• We have continued to expand the
Engineering Tech-X programme, with 87%
of depot locations now achieving the silver
standard accreditation, with 29 of our
depots moving on to obtaining the
highest gold standard.
• Our BlueSky Solutions business has
continued to grow. The market leading
SkySiren secondary guarding solution is
now mandated by 14 tier 1 contractors in
the UK. We have recently signed a supply
agreement with Genie, one of the world’s
largest powered access equipment
manufacturers, for the supply of
SkySirens. The global availability 
of this secondary guarding technology
should aid the working at height
experience of end users worldwide.
• We have invested nearly £50m in the
rental fleet during the year, expanding the
French and Middle East businesses, and
refreshing a significant part of our
European rental fleet.
Financial performance
The Board monitors progress against its
strategic goal by reference to key
performance indicators. The key
performance indicators for the period 2009
to 2013 are shown on pages 14 and 15.
The Group’s revenues and underlying
operating profits marginally improved
during the year and margins were stable.
In 2013, with strong performances from
our French and Middle East businesses
offsetting the weaker results from the UK
and Germany – demonstrating the benefit
of the Group’s geographic diversity.
Our strong cash flows fully funded our
investment programme in the year and also
enabled the Group’s interest charges to
reduce. The combination of increased
operating profits and a reduced interest
charge enabled the Group’s profitability to
further improve in the year.
Our return on capital employed marginally
declined during the year to 10.6% (2012:
10.7%), primarily due to a weaker than
expected trading performance from our UK
business. Towards the end of the year we
addressed the underlying issues within the
UK, and are starting to see the required
performance improvement being delivered.
As anticipated, despite funding the Group’s
increased investment programme during the
year, the Group’s net debt levels and debt
to underlying EBITDA ratio has remained
broadly stable over the prior year. Our
capital expenditure plans for 2014 will be
similar to that undertaken in 2013, a gross
capex of around £55million, and this will
again be funded through annual cash flows.
Employee turnover has decreased to 18%
from 19% in the prior year, with ‘normalised’
employee turnover, after removing the
impact of restructuring, decreasing to 10%
from 11% in 2012. This reduction follows
increased focus on employee retention.
We will continue to look at the underlying
causes behind voluntary turnover, so that
further appropriate measures can be taken
to improve retention in the coming year.
We remain convinced that having a stable
and well motivated employee base is an
important factor in improving the overall
performance of the Group.

Performance
An external market research specialist
undertakes regular customer satisfaction
surveys across the Group, resulting in a
Customer Net Promoter Score being
calculated. This score measures how many
of our customers would make a positive
recommendation about us. Our score has risen
consistently from 32 in 2010, to 52 in 2013.
During 2013 we launched Project X-Sell. This
will be the umbrella project under which we
drive though our new sales initiatives:
• A new Customer Relationship Management
(“CRM”) platform has been developed and is
currently being piloted in our German
operation
• Web channel and social media capability is
to be established in all business units
2014 will see the roll-out of our Customer
Experience (“CX”) strategy. The strategy
involves establishing best practices when
dealing with customers and making them
a routine part of doing business.
The safety value proposition “Your safety,
our priority” was successfully launched in all
our territories during 2013. Its message
helps to position Lavendon as THE safe
access solutions provider.
Challenges
All our markets continue to be
competitive, with many competitors
focusing on price alone. We
consistently win quality customers
through our differentiated and
more complete service offering,
rather than through price alone.
Regular communication with both
current and prospective customers
is essential. We will standardise and
reinforce our existing communication
mediums as well as introducing new
media such as social networking, digital
marketing and upgraded websites.
Customer focus 
Strategic priorities
• Our customers consistently rank reliability and punctuality as their first and
second most important buying factors. We have set targets for all business units
for annual improvements in these measures.
• Adopting a sales-led culture placing customers at the heart of our business.
• Driving the Safe Access Solutions value proposition, “Your safety, our priority”.
Differentiating through our service offering
Strategic priorities
• Become THE Safety Solution provider for our customers working 
at height requirements.
• Promote the BlueSky Solutions safety enhancing and efficiency product
ranges across the Group.
• Achieve higher levels of machine reliability through the Tech-X and
Preventative Part Maintenance (“PPM”) programmes.
• Expand in markets that offer attractive margins and/or growth potential.
Performance
We have a fleet of over 2,000 safety
enhancing attachments available for fitting
to our equipment to meet increasingly
safety focused customer needs.
Further leading blue chip construction
businesses, including leading European
construction groups, have now mandated
the use of certain BlueSky type safety
devices on their sites. 
As an example, at the St Bartholomew’s
Hospital redevelopment site in the UK, over
140 SkySentry units were fitted to our powered
access platforms. The system facilitates physical
tracking of a machine location, its usage and
limits access to authorised users only.
The SkySiren product continues to lead
the market in the provision of a robust
anti-entrapment attachments that
can easily be fitted to many types of
equipment. The SkySiren product
achieved over 100,000 hire days
during 2013.
The Tech-X programme, started in 2008,
continues to give the Group a clear
differentiation in the quality of servicing
and maintenance. By the end of 2015 we
aim to have 75% of out depots at the
Tech-X Gold standard. 
Challenges
The cultural demand for safe working
practices still needs to mature in some of our
areas of operation and potential new markets.
Although the need for more efficient methods
of working still created a level demand for
powered access in these territories.

Performance
A total of 2,440 machines were added to the
Group’s rental fleet during 2013, at a cost of
£50m. The majority of the units were for
fleet renewal but some 500 were to facilitate
the expansion of the Group’s French and
Middle Eastern businesses. 
A total of 2,050 ex-rental fleet assets were
disposed of during the year, raising sale
proceeds of £10.2m. Where possible, our
practice continues to be to dispose of these
units into markets outside of the markets in
which we operate.
The Group continues to move machines
between business units in order to optimise
fleet mix and maximise revenue generation
across the Group.
During 2013, the average age of the fleet
across the Group reduced from 7.3 years
to 7.1 years.
Challenges
Growth in the Middle East absorbs working
capital at rates above the Group’s average
trend levels, due to payment practices within
the region.
Lead time on new fleet is extending as
global demand increases.
Capital efficiency programme
Strategic priorities
• Minimise working capital.
• Optimise utilisation and hire rates across business operating units.
• Expand fleet in growing markets where attractive returns are available.
• Achieve optimal disposal proceeds for life-expired fleet assets.
Performance
Each business now has a dedicated
health and safety (“H&S”) representative
responsible for local H&S matters.
The representatives meet collectively to
form our H&S Centre of Excellence.
This centre is responsible for monitoring
H&S performance, ensuring best practices
are adopted across the Group, and to
provide guidance to manufacturers on
equipment improvements that would
further increase safe product usage.
Our Lavendon Academy training team
delivered over 5,500 delegate training
sessions during 2013, helping in the
development of our workforce across
the Group. Voluntary labour turnover
for the year fell to 10%. 
The operational efficiency programme
has delivered a total of £5.2m over the last
three years, ahead of the target of £5.0m.
A new target of £1.5m has been agreed for
delivery over the next three years.
A Performance Improvement team will work
with management across the Group from
2014 onwards to transform and then
standardise good business practice,
particularly around customer order taking,
engineering and logistics. 
The new IT platform is being implemented
across the Group, and by the end of 2013
covered almost 85% of the Group’s revenues
and rental fleet holding. The French business
will go live in 2014.
Challenges
Employment restrictions in some Middle
Eastern territories have presented
increasing challenges to our Human
Resources team in 2013. These have been
closely managed during the year, and will
continue to be during 2014.
Initial teething issues with the new IT platform
in Germany impacted revenues in the
second half of the year. The issues were
resolved towards the end of 2013.
A safety first culture, that is also efficient
Strategic priorities
• Embed a “Safety First” culture among the workforce.
• Deliver operational efficiency programme.
• Roll out the new IT platform, standardising ‘best in class’ business processes
throughout the Group.

Review of performance
by country
A summary of the revenues and underlying
operating profit by each business unit is
given opposite.
We have structured the Group so that
each region is viewed as a separate
reporting profit centre, supported by
central Group service functions. Each
operation has its own management
team responsible for delivering agreed
performance targets.
The performance of each operation is
summarised below, with all financial figures
being underlying numbers stated before
amortisation charges, exceptional items
and movements in the fair value of financial
derivatives. Where revenues and revenue
growth percentages are given, they relate to
rental revenues only and exclude revenues
derived from the sale of new and ex-rental
fleet equipment. The split of revenues by
country between rental revenues and
revenues from the sale of new and ex-
rental fleet equipment is given in Note 2
‘Segmental Analysis’ on page 75.
UK
The UK’s rental revenue declined by 4% in
the year to £103.4 million (2012: £107.7
million). This revenue decline was weighted
towards the first half of the year, reflecting
the adverse weather at the start of 2013,
with the trend progressively improving
through the year. Volumes were consistently
ahead of those in 2012, and pricing, which
had shown some weakness in the first six
months, strengthened over the second half,
following targeted management actions, to
show year on year improvement as the
business moved into 2014.
During the year, we saw our mix of fleet
on hire shift towards smaller units with a
consequential impact on the rate of
revenue per hire. This was a reflection of
the stage of the construction cycle of a
number of major projects during the year;
an influence that is now diminishing.
We continue to develop our BlueSky
products and services, improving efficiency
and safety for customers, and believe that

Financial review
The Group is proposing a final dividend
of 2.40 pence per share, making a total
dividend for the year of 3.55 pence an
increase of 29% over the previous year
(2012: 2.75 pence). The Group’s dividend
cover, based on the proposed total
dividend for 2013 and underlying
earnings per share, has been reduced
to 4.0 times (2012: 4.7 times), in line
with our previously stated intention to
increase dividend distributions to a level
that is covered 3 to 4 times by earnings.

adding services and not just a supplier of
rental equipment gives us an important
point of differentiation in the market-place.
A further 10% of our rental fleet was
replaced with new equipment during the
year, improving the fleet mix and capacity to
generate increased revenues. In the second
half of the year, the UK management team
was strengthened and the business was
restructured to better align its sales process
with our customers and make it more
locally accountable.
It is encouraging to note that the impact of
the £4.3 million decline in the UK’s revenues
was mitigated in part by the improved
operational efficiencies delivered over the
past three years, such that underlying
operating profits only reduced by £2.6 million
to £16.5 million (2012: £19.1 million) with
margins declining to 15.0% (2012: 16.6%).
The combination of a differentiated service
offering, a well invested fleet and a more
effective organisational structure, positions
the UK business well in a market which is
starting to demonstrate cyclical recovery.
Germany
German Euro rental revenues declined by
7% over 2012, which once converted to
sterling, showed a decline of 2% to
£42.5 million (2012: £43.5 million).
Overall trading conditions are yet to show
any sustainable recovery in demand,
particularly from the industrial and
commercial construction sectors. Our
volumes in the year reflected this market
environment, and were broadly flat against
2012, with a pricing strategy to ensure
volumes quickly recovered following the
weather affected start to 2013 and that our
market share position was maintained
throughout the year.
The German business completed its
restructuring plan during the year,
concluding with the implementation of the
Group’s new IT platform. The ability to drive
revenues has been disrupted while the
restructuring exercise was completed,
and initial teething issues with the new IT
platform resolved. Disappointingly
this disruption has partially reversed the
progress being made in improving the
business’s ROCE. However, a firm
foundation has now been established,
with a more efficient cost structure and a
better capability to drive fleet utilisation
and yields. This will support our clear
focus on driving revenue growth as the
business moves through 2014.
Underlying operating profits declined to
£3.8 million (2012: £5.0 million) with
margins at 8.5% from 10.5% in 2012.
France
Our French business again grew strongly in
2013, with Euro rental revenues increasing
by 7%, which once converted to sterling,
showed an increase of 12% to £21.5 million
(2012: £19.2 million).
This revenue performance has been driven
by increased utilisation of an expanded fleet
and reduced pricing pressure towards the
end of the year. Our growth is in contrast
to relatively weak market conditions
throughout the year, underpinning our
belief that we continue to increase our
market share.
During the year, we invested additional
resources within the business to support
the expected growth in revenues over 2013,
which in the first half constrained the
reported level of improvement in our
margins. However, as the business moved
through the second half of the year, the
revenue growth absorbed the cost of these
additional resources and underlying
operating profits increased to £3.2 million
(2012: £2.7 million), with margins improving
to 14.5% (2012: 13.7%).
Additional capital will be allocated to our
French business in 2014 to continue
supporting our growth ambitions in
this market.
Belgium
Belgian Euro rental revenues declined by
6% in the year, which once converted to
sterling, showed a decline of 1% to
£13.8 million (2012: £14.0 million). This
revenue decline was heavily weighted
towards the first half of the year, with the
second half performance steadily reversing
the trend through significantly increased
utilisation levels.
Trading conditions remain difficult in the
market, with pricing pressures continuing
to influence competitive behaviour. Our
business has concentrated its efforts on
maintaining customer service to secure
attractive contracts, while at the same time
actively managing its fleet size to be more
in line with market demand (through
transfer to other Group operations or by
the disposal of surplus units) and reducing
its overhead cost base.
As a result of the actions taken by
management, the revenue decline has been
fully absorbed and underlying operating
profits were increased to £3.0 million
(2012: £2.8 million), with margins improving
to 19.7% (2012: 18.0%).
Middle East
Revenues from our Middle East business
once again grew strongly in the year, with

Financial review
Continued
rental revenues (in both local currencies
and sterling) increasing by 21% to
£44.1 million (2012: £36.3 million).
This performance continues to be driven
by a combination of volume growth and
pricing improvement, particularly in Saudi
Arabia where we have seen a 12%
improvement in pricing over the year.
We have supported this growth with
investment in the fleet, adding c.300
machines over the year, further
strengthening our market position
in the region.
The outlook for the region continues to
be very encouraging, with current and
planned infrastructure and construction
projects valued in excess of US$ 2.0 trillion.
In the short term, progress on projects
in our key market of Saudi Arabia has
slowed, as the market adjusts to a more
onerous regulatory environment which
is having a consequential impact on
the availability of construction labour.
We anticipate that these labour capacity
issues will ease during 2014 thereby
removing the constraints on project
development going forward.
We believe that current activity levels are
likely to improve as we move through
2014, and we are committing additional
capital to the region in the coming year,
to ensure we are well placed to benefit
from the growth opportunities that are
available across the region. As we have
stated previously, the scale of the
potential in the region could be significant
over the medium term and that this will
warrant a further shift of our available
capital into the region over time.
As noted in our Interim Results, we
established a small operation in India
during the first half comprising one depot
and a fleet of 120 machines. The business
made a marginal profit for the year, and we
will continue to develop the operation in
response to growth in demand.
The strong revenue growth across the
region has increased underlying operating
profits for the year to £14.0 million (2012:
£10.5 million), with margins improving to
30.7% (2012: 28.3%).
Financial review of 2013
The review of the Group’s financial
performance is based principally on what
we term the ‘underlying’ business
performance. This measure excludes
amortisation charges, exceptional items
and movements in the fair value of financial
derivatives. We believe that the use of
underlying figures aids the comparison
with prior periods and the understanding
of the Group’s financial performance.
The impact of the year on year movement
in average exchange rates for the Group’s
main trading currencies (principally sterling,
euros and a number of Middle Eastern
currencies), was to increase revenues,
profits and earnings in 2013 by up to 2%.
The figures discussed in this ‘Financial
review of 2013’ are at actual exchange rates
for both 2013 and 2012.
Underlying trading performance
A summary of the Group’s financial
performance for 2013, with a comparison
against 2012, is set out in the table below:
Group revenue  2012 Group revenue  2013
UK £109.8m
Germany £44.9m

Group revenues for the year increased by
1% to £237.5 million (2012: £234.6 million).
The split of these revenues between the
various business units, compared to 2012,
is shown above (all figures in £’millions).
The Group’s revenues are principally
derived from the rental of its equipment
fleet, but also include revenues from the
sale of new equipment and from the
disposal of ex-rental fleet units. The split of
revenues between each of these channels
is shown in the table above.
Rental revenue is shown net of discounts
and value added tax, but includes income
generated from the transportation of
equipment, provision of fuel, charging of
damage waiver fees and the sale of spare
parts. The income derived from the rental
of machines is determined by the interplay
of several factors: size of rental fleet, mix of
machine types within the fleet, utilisation of
the fleet, length of hire and rental rates
achieved. The importance, or weighting, of
each of these factors can change by week
or by month as the year progresses, due to
normal seasonal patterns of demand, or to
changing customer workloads.
As the above table shows, rental revenues
for the year increased by 2% to £225.3
million (2012: £220.7 million), while revenues
derived from the sale of new equipment
and ex-rental fleet units decreased by
£1.1 million and £0.6 million respectively.
The revenues from the sale of ex-rental fleet
units remained broadly flat year on year,
as the Group continued an investment
programme which replaced a substantial
part of its European fleet in the year and
released over 2,000 machines for disposal
in 2013. The decreased level of sales of
new equipment reflects the unpredictable
nature of this revenue stream.
The Group’s costs are largely fixed in nature
within the short to medium term, with
significant movements in the cost base,
outside of acquisitions, mainly being
determined by either depot openings and
closures, or fleet expansion or contraction.
This feature of our business amplifies the
effect of any small movements in revenue
on the profitability of the Group, as there is
little associated increase or decrease in our
cost base in the short term. This impact is
often referred to as “operational leverage”.
The two main cost areas of the business
are employee costs and depreciation.
During 2013, employee costs, excluding
redundancy costs, increased to £62.0 million
(2012: £61.3 million), but as a percentage
of rental revenues, these costs reduced
marginally to 27.5% (2012: 27.7%).
Depreciation costs increased to £40.9
million in the year (2012: £40.7 million), and
as a percentage of rental revenues also
reduced marginally to 18.2% (2012: 18.4%).
The Group’s underlying EBITDA for the year
increased to £76.2 million (2012: £75.6
million), with margins broadly stable at 32.1%
from 32.2% in 2012. Underlying operating
profits increased by 1% to £35.3 million
(2012: £35.0 million), with margins stable at
14.9% (2012: 14.9%). The stability seen in
both underlying EBITDA and operating profit
margins reflect the geographic diversity of
the Group’s operations, where strong
performances in France and the Middle East
were able to compensate for the weaker
performances seen in the UK and Germany.
Net interest charges for the year reduced to
£5.3 million (2012: £7.4 million), reflecting
the reduction in net debt levels of the
Group across both 2012 and 2013, and
the benefit of lower interest rates being
charged on those borrowings. After interest
charges, the Group’s underlying profit
before tax increased by 9% to £30.0 million
(2012: £27.6 million). With an effective tax
rate of 20% (2012: 23%), the Group’s
underlying profit after tax was £24.1 million
(2012: £21.2 million).
The Group’s underlying earnings per share
increased by 12% to 14.42 pence per
share (2012: 12.83 pence).
Statutory trading performance
Amortisation charges were £3.3 million
for the year (2012: £3.8 million). The
Group incurred exceptional items of
£3.3 million (2012: £3.6 million) during
the year, relating principally to the
completion of the restructuring exercise
within our German business. In the
previous year the Group also benefited
from a credit on the movement in the
fair value of the Group’s financial
derivatives of £0.7 million, but as the
underlying derivative instrument
terminated in 2012, there is no
corresponding credit or charge in 2013.
After amortisation charges and exceptional
items, the Group produced an operating
profit of £28.7 million (2012: £29.7 million),

Dividends
The Group is proposing a final dividend
of 2.40 pence per share, making a total
dividend for the year of 3.55 pence an
increase of 29% over the previous year
(2012: 2.75 pence). The final dividend, if
approved, will be paid on 30 April 2014 to
shareholders on the register at the close
of business of 7 March 2014. The Group’s
dividend cover, based on the proposed
total dividend for 2013 and underlying
earnings per share, has been reduced
to 4.0 times (2012: 4.7 times).
Cash flow, investment and acquisitions
A summary of the Group’s cash flows for
the year is shown in the chart opposite.
During the year, the Group generated
£65.4 million of cash from operations, after
movements in working capital and payment
of exceptional items but prior to the
purchase and sale of rental assets
(2012: £65.3 million).
A total of £55.1 million was invested in
the maintenance and expansion of
the Group’s fixed asset base (2012:
£47.9 million). This investment was
partly funded by the sale of surplus
and retired assets, which generated
£10.5 million in cash (2012: £11.1 million).
After movements in amounts owed to
equipment suppliers at the beginning
and end of the year of £0.3 million,
the net capital expenditure for the year
was £44.9 million as shown in the
chart opposite. The amount owed to
equipment suppliers at the end of
the year was £10.1 million (2012:
£10.4 million).
During 2013, the final payment of deferred
consideration of £1.0 million was made
relating to the acquisition of Blue Sky Access
Limited completed in October 2011.

The Group’s net assets increased by 7% to
£211.2 million (2012: £196.8 million), with
net assets per share increasing to £1.26
(2012: £1.19). The main movements in the
balance sheet were:
• Amortisation of intangible assets
partially offset by investments made 
in computer systems.
• Investments in property, plant and
equipment, partly offset by depreciation.
• An increase in current assets (principally
trade receivables) mainly due to the
revenue growth in the Middle East region
during the year.
• A move towards longer term debt
facilities as borrowings due within one
year were repaid.
Although, as planned, the level of capital
expenditure increased during the year, the
Group’s strong cash flows were sufficient
to fund this investment and, despite an
adverse foreign exchange movement of
£1.6 million, enable net debt levels to be
held broadly in line with the prior year at
£97.7 million (2012: £97.3 million).
Adjusting for the un-amortised costs of
£0.7 million relating to the Group’s US
Private Placement, the Group’s reported net
debt position at 31 December 2013 was
£97.0 million (2012: £96.5 million). The
corresponding net debt to underlying
EBITDA ratio is 1.27 times, in line with the
previous year’s level of 1.28 times, and the
net debt to equity ratio reduced to 46%
(2012: 49%). This level of debt is well
supported by operational cash flows and
significant headroom is available against
all bank covenants.
The Group’s debt facilities comprise a £100
million revolving bank facility expiring in July
2016 and a €60 million US Private
Placement expiring in July 2019. The bank
facility has an interest rate margin of
between 225 basis points and 325 basis
points above LIBOR or EURIBOR depending
on the currency drawn, and the US Private
Placement has a fixed coupon of 4.89%.
These facilities provide the Group with a
robust medium to long term diversified
financing package, with significant liquidity,
which will support the development of the
Group in the coming years.

Financial review
Continued
The Group has exposure to movements
in interest rates on its borrowings. This
exposure is managed by maintaining a
mix of fixed and floating interest rate
borrowings. This allows the Group to
mitigate the impact of interest rate
fluctuations by allowing some benefit from
rate reductions, while offering some
protection against rate rises. At the year
end, the fixed rate element of borrowings
was 46%, a reduced level when compared
with the previous year end fixed rate
element of 56%. This reduction reflects
the decline in the Group’s use of hire
purchase facilities to fund the acquisition of
assets, and the desire to move towards a
more even split between fixed and variable
interest rate borrowings. Based on the year
end mix and quantum of borrowings, a
movement in Euro interest base rates of
0.25% would increase or decrease the
Group’s annual interest cost by
approximately £69,000, while a similar
movement in Sterling base rates would
also increase or decrease annual costs
by £93,000.
Return on capital employed
The Group’s return on capital employed
(ROCE) declined marginally by 10bps in the
year to 10.6% (2012: 10.7%), based on an
average capital employed during the year
of £300.8 million (2012: £292.5 million).
Improvement in this key performance
metric remains the fundamental objective
of the Group for the coming years.
Going concern
After making appropriate enquiries, the
directors have formed a judgement, at the
time of approving the accounts, that the
Group can have a reasonable expectation
that adequate resources will be available
for it to continue its operations for the
foreseeable future, and consequently it is
appropriate to adopt the going concern

Germany: In January 2013 the Deutschland Red
Cross association celebrated its 150th anniversary.
Part of the celebrations involved the formation of
a giant red cross in front of the Brandenburg gate,
the cross being formed by some 1,800 dedicated
helpers wearing identical red jackets.
To help choreograph the event and to then capture
the strong visual image arising, the organisers
needed a bird’s eye perspective of the square.
To achieve this, our German operation, Gardemann,
supplied a large truck-mounted platform to the
organisers. The platform can carry a working load
of up to 600kg and so was able to elevate three
photographers and two cameramen to a height
of 25 metres in order to photograph and film
the spectacle.                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2013   23
UK: A more unusual powered access application is
depicted in the image above, which was taken at
the Urban Gardening event in Manchester in the
summer of 2013.
To help create a dramatic centrepiece for the event,
local artists hired three 52 foot boom lifts to which
they attached large flower-like sculptures in the
shape of tropical plants. These unique creations
helped the event gain significant media coverage.
This unusual request was handled by the Manchester
Customer Service Centre of our UK business,
Nationwide Platforms. As well as providing guidance
on the appropriate access model to use, they also
supplied a fully trained operator to help the artists
to safely cordon, move and control the boom lifts
in this public city centre location.

Financial review
Risk management
Managing risk in our
business
The Board, which has overall responsibility
for risk management and internal control,
believes that there should be a regular and
systematic approach to the management of
risks in order to provide assurance that
strategic and operational goals can be met
and the Group’s reputation is protected.
In order to identify and manage risks
effectively, a risk management framework
has been developed; to identify the risks
facing the Group; to evaluate the potential
impact of risks; implement appropriate
controls and strategies to mitigate the risks;
and specify roles and responsibilities
relating to the management of risk. The
Group’s management team utilise 
the risk management framework when
assessing risks and implementing 
suitable controls.
Risk identification
Risks are identified through the
membership of industry and trade bodies,
monitoring changes to legislation, risk
management best practices, strategic
planning exercises, ongoing operational
reviews by management, project
governance processes and internal audits.
Each year a detailed review is undertaken
of the Group’s risk universe to ensure all
key risks have been identified. 
Effective management of
risks and opportunities is
essential to deliver the
strategic and operational
goals, protect our reputation
and ultimately enhance
shareholder value
This organisation-wide review is facilitated
by the internal audit team and includes
senior management participation from
across the business both functionally and
geographically. It considers the Group’s
strategic objectives and the risks to their
achievement, together with existing and
new controls required to mitigate these
risks. The outputs from this process are
collated into the Group’s risk register and
are taken into consideration when setting
the annual internal audit plan. 
Risk evaluation
In order to understand the impact specific
risks would have on the Group, each risk is
evaluated based on the likelihood of
occurrence and its severity.
The risk ranking matrix (below) has been
developed to ensure that a consistent
approach is taken when assessing the
overall impact to the Group. Likelihood is
based on the frequency of occurrence
across rolling time periods and severity is
determined by the degree of change across
key performance indicators.
Once risks have been identified, and
ranked, as to their likelihood and potential
severity, the level of treatment to mitigate
the risks can be determined.

Rare Death or serious injury to staff
member or subcontractor
when operating powered
access equipment
The Group operates in an environment
where people are in constant contact
with powered access equipment and
other heavy machinery. A serious
injury or death resulting from misuse,
poor maintenance, equipment failure
or poor practices could result, with
consequential reputational damage,
regulatory action and financial loss
There is a Group-wide health and safety
policy and initiatives embedding a safety
culture. Health and Safety officers are in
each business segment. The Group
operates mandatory training and robust
accident reporting systems, with a
whistleblowing process available in all
locations worldwide. There is regular
statutory inspection of all equipment by
independent third parties
Excessive competitor fleet
expansion driven by new entrants
or by aggressive fleet acquisition
by existing players
Surplus fleet capacity to market
requirements will place pressure on
hire rates and utilisation and could
erode market share
Continue to build differentiation of
Lavendon brands through initiatives
like the continued development and
delivery of BlueSky Solutions
safety enhancing and efficiency
boosting attachments. We continually
manage the size of the Group’s fleet
through the fleet replacement
programme to avoid surplus capacity
Head office, call centre, customer
service centre or depot forced to
close for extended period due to
fire or other catastrophic incident
A serious uncured failure would have
an immediate impact on revenues and
asset tracking
A business continuity plan is in place
and tested for the UK and Group Head
Office. A plan to extend business
continuity planning to all international
locations is underway and expected to
be completed during 2014
Economic cycle puts stress on
business performance 
The market for rental equipment is
largely cyclical in nature due to
exposure to the cyclical industrial,
commercial and infrastructure
construction sectors. such changes in
market demand will directly impact
revenues. Due to the Group's high
proportion of fixed costs this has a
greater impact on margins
The Group exercises prudent
management through the various
phases of the economic cycle. Plans to
mitigate a downturn are regularly
reviewed and updated and include
fleet redeployment and disposal,
headcount flexing and capital
expenditure freezes
The increased geographical
diversity of the Group also mitigates
our exposure to the effects of
individual market fluctuations
Political situation in existing markets
leads to business loss
The Group operates in certain higher
risk regions, such as the Middle East,
where there is a risk of governmental
decisions impacting on the Group's
operations. Similarly other political
tensions could lead to civil unrest,
which could seriously disrupt
business operations
The Group has developed long
established relationships with its
partners in these regions. It selects
the most appropriate legal structure
available to mitigate asset
ownership risk, and closely manages
cash balances and the respective
capital bases
Failure to react to governmental,
regulatory and political change,
particularly in regions undergoing
significant growth in regulation, can
impact business operations
Failure to comply with new regulations
may limit our ability to trade. It may also
result in the imposition of fines and the
freezing of company assets
Visa restrictions may lead to the
deportation of key staff or the inability
to recruit certain staff for particular
roles or countries of operation
The Group retains and engages with
appropriate knowledgeable advisors
in each country
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Lavendon Group plc 2013   25

Financial review
Risk management continued
Failure to adequately recruit,
develop and retain a skilled and
motivated workforce
The Group’s business depends on
a high degree of industry related
knowledge for its success. Failure to
recruit develop and retain skilled staff
could result in a poorer customer
experience and impact revenues
The Group follows a detailed resourcing
strategy covering recruitment, induction,
career and skills development,
management training and succession
planning. The Group provides staff with
industry leading training programmes,
a safe and structured working
environment and excellent employee
benefits. There is regular communication
with staff through a number of
different channels
Fluctuation in international currency
rates relative to UK Pounds Sterling
The Group reports its business
performance in UK Pounds Sterling,
however overseas businesses
generate revenues, profits and losses
and cash flows in a number of different
currencies. Currency fluctuations can
materially affect the level of revenues,
profits and cash flows that the Group
can generate in Sterling
The Group has adopted a formal
hedging policy to mitigate against
structural and transactional foreign
exchange exposure. It seeks to match
the assets and liabilities denominated
in a particular currency to provide
formal and natural hedges. Where
possible cash flows arising in a given
currency are utilised to service
borrowings and capital investment in
the same currency
Increased cost of debt funding The Group carries a substantial amount
of debt, in the form of bank loans and
hire purchase agreements, on its
balance sheet in order to fund its capital
investment activities. 
Adverse movements in interest rates
would lead to an increased interest
cost, reducing profits and cash flow
The Group currently holds about
46% of its debt at fixed interest rates,
a significant proportion of which is
fixed until 2019.
The Group currently generates
sufficient operational cash flows to
fund planned capital expenditure
needs without the requirement for
additional borrowing
Major IT systems failure in the
Group’s ERP system
The Group's operations are supported
by common ERP system. A major IT
systems failure would significantly
impact Group operations and customer
relationships.
A disaster recovery programme is in
place which includes systems replication,
resilient network infrastructure and
remote access via VPN. The IT
environment is appropriately firewalled
and subject to regular updates and
penetration testing

Access to external capital The Group requires capital for, amongst
other things, capex funding to replace
existing fleet and for growth through
increasing the size of the rental fleet and
establishing new depots, or for
completing acquisitions. 
If the cash that the Group generates,
together with cash that it may borrow
under its credit facilities, is not sufficient
to meet these requirements, then
additional debt and/or equity financing
will be required. If such additional
financing were not available, then the
Group’s revenue and cash flow could
be adversely impacted
The Group aims to ensure that it has
the necessary equity base and
sufficient banking and other credit
facilities available to support its
development plans. We believe that
the combination of the Group’s equity
base and the strong cash flows
generated by the business, together
with the credit lines available from
banks and other institutions, will
provide adequate funding for our
foreseeable needs

Risk treatment
Consideration is given to the treatment of
each risk that has been identified on the
risk register.
The four methods used to treat risk are:
• Tolerate (accept risk and take no 
further action).
• Treat (reduce risk by defining and
completing appropriate actions to
improve or implement controls).
• Transfer (share a risk via insurance 
policies).
• Terminate (avoid risk quickly and decisively
by eliminating or re-engineering the
activities that lead to the risk occurring).
Mitigating actions
Where it is recommended that a risk
should be treated, then an appropriate
risk mitigation strategy is developed.
Each strategy must detail the
management actions to be taken,
the control measures and the reporting
that will allow the effectiveness of the
treatment to be evaluated.
In each case a senior manager will be
appointed to oversee the deployment of
each risk mitigation plan
Committee and
Board approval

approval by the Audit Committee and
subsequently by the Board.

products and services. The Group
operates both in the UK and overseas.
Results for the year
The financial results for the year are set
out in the Group income statement on
page 64. The Group profit for the year of
£19,051,000 (2012: £16,166,000) will be

per share was paid on 18 October 2013.
The directors recommend the payment
of a final dividend of 2.40p per share
(2012: 2.00p), to be paid on 30 April 2014
making a total dividend for the year of
3.55p (2012: 2.75p) per share.
Employees
The Group pursues a policy of employee
communication through regular team
briefings and newsletters. Personal
employee development is encouraged
through the provision of relevant training
towards industry accredited certification
and licences. Employee involvement in the
financial performance of the Group is
encouraged through a comprehensive
range of well-established profit share
programmes. The Group consults with
employees on a regular basis so their
views can be taken into account in making
decisions that might effect their interests.
It is the policy of the Group that disabled
people, whether registered or not, should
receive full and fair consideration for all job
vacancies for which they are suitable
applicants. Employees who become
disabled during employment will be
retained wherever possible and retrained
if necessary. The Group is prepared to
modify procedures or equipment wherever
this is practicable, to allow full use to be
made of an individual’s abilities.
The Board has issued a statement of business
operations and culture detailing the Group’s
commitment to ensuring that all employees
comply with all applicable laws and
regulations, support a culture of honesty and
integrity, conduct operations in an ethical and
professional manner, and act at all times to
prevent impropriety, discrimination, bribery
and corruption. The Board also operates an
independent whistle-blowing system across
the Group’s operations to allow employees
to raise matters that they feel should be
addressed by the Group.

Share capital
By resolutions passed at the Annual General
Meeting on 18 April 2013 the directors were
generally and unconditionally authorised
for the purposes of Section 551 of the
Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”), to exercise
all the powers of the Company to allot
shares and grant rights to subscribe for,
or convert any security into, shares:
a) up to an aggregate nominal amount
(within the meaning of Section 551(3) and
(6) of the Act) of £550,322 (such amount
to be reduced by the nominal amount
allotted or granted under (b) below in
excess of such sum); and
b) comprising equity securities (as defined
in Section 560 of the Act) up to an aggregate
nominal amount (within the meaning of
Section 551(3) and (6) of the Act) of
£1,100,643 (such amount to be reduced by
any allotments or grants made under (a)
above) in connection with or pursuant to an
offer by way of a rights issue in favour of
holders of ordinary shares in proportion (as
nearly as practicable) to the respective
number of ordinary shares held by them on
the record date for such allotment (and
holders of any other class of equity securities
entitled to participate therein or if the
directors consider it necessary, as permitted
by the rights of those securities), but subject
to such exclusions or other arrangements as
the directors may consider necessary or
appropriate to deal with fractional
entitlements, treasury shares, record dates
or legal, regulatory or practical difficulties
which may arise under the laws of, or the
requirements of any regulatory body or
stock exchange in any territory or any
other matter whatsoever.
These authorisations expire at the
conclusion of the next Annual General
Meeting of the Company to be held on
17 April 2014, and the directors are re-
proposing that renewal should be sought.
Details of movements in share capital
during the year are set out in note 24
to the Group’s financial statements.
In addition, the directors have been given
power pursuant to Sections 570(1) and 573
of the Companies Act 2006 (the “Act”) to:
a) allot equity securities (as defined in
Section 560 of the Act) of the Company
for cash pursuant to the authorisation
conferred by that resolution; and
b) sell ordinary shares (as defined in
Section 560(1) of the Act) held by the
Company as treasury shares for cash, as if
Section 561 of the Act did not apply to any
such allotment or sale, provided that this
power shall be limited to the allotment of
equity securities for cash and the sale of
treasury shares:
i. in connection with or pursuant to an
offer of or invitation to acquire equity
securities (but in the case of the
authorisation granted under (b) above,
by way of a rights issue only) in favour of
holders of ordinary shares in proportion
(as nearly as practicable) to the respective
number of ordinary shares held by
them on the record date for such
allotment or sale (and holders of any

ii. in the case of the authorisation granted
under (a) above (or in the case of any
transfer of treasury shares), and otherwise
than pursuant to paragraph (i), up to an
aggregate nominal amount of £82,548.
These authorities expire (unless renewed,
varied or revoked) at the conclusion of
the Annual General Meeting to be held
on 17 April 2014.
Issue of share capital
During the year, the Company issued an
aggregate of 2,966,733 (2012: 198,731)
ordinary shares of one pence each:
• 2,812,871 shares were issued following
the exercise of awards under the
Lavendon 2006 Long Term Incentive Plan.
• 26,893 shares were issued following the
exercise of options under the Lavendon
1996 Approved Share Option Scheme.
• 126,969 shares were issued under the
Share Incentive Plan.
Share Option Schemes
The Company established two share
option schemes on admission of its
ordinary shares to the Official List of the
London Stock Exchange on 10 October
1996, namely:
i. the Lavendon Group 1996 Company
Share Option Plan (the ‘Employee Scheme’);
and
ii. the Lavendon Group 1996 Unapproved
Executive Share Option Scheme (the
‘Executive Scheme’).
Options were granted under the terms of
the schemes on the day following the
announcement of the Group’s interim
and annual financial results each year at
an option price equal to the mid-market
quoted share price derived from the
London Stock Exchange Daily Official List at
the close of trading on the preceding day.
The schemes were closed on reaching
their tenth anniversary on 10 October
2006, and no further share options have
been issued under these schemes.
The value of options granted to any
individual was subject to an individual limit
such that the aggregate exercise price of all
options granted during a year could not
exceed 200 per cent of base annual salary
in the case of a director, or 100 per cent
in the case of any other employee.
Options were granted subject to the
following performance targets:
The Employee Scheme
An option would be exercisable in full if
growth in pre-exceptional earnings per
share (“EPS”) exceeded growth in the Retail
Price Index (“RPI”) over the performance
period by an average of at least 3 per cent
per annum.
The Executive Scheme
An option would not be exercisable unless
growth in pre-exceptional EPS exceeded
growth in the RPI over the performance
period by an average of at least 3 per cent
per annum. The option would be
exercisable in full if growth in EPS exceeded
growth in the RPI by an average of at least
6 per cent per annum. The option would
be exercisable on a straight line basis
between these two percentage levels.
All performance targets were measured
over an initial three year period and to the
extent that they are were met, they could
be retested. In the case of an option
granted in the period to 31 August 2003,
the target may be achieved on a three-
year rolling basis up to the tenth
anniversary of grant in the case of the
Employee Scheme, and the seventh
anniversary in the case of the Executive
Scheme. Any options granted after this
date are capable of being retested
annually over 0-4 years and 0-5 years,
provided that the target is always
measured from the fixed base of the
financial year immediately prior to grant.
The option will lapse to the extent that
the target has not been achieved by the
end of the fifth year. There is a two year
period over which options can be
exercised. The options remain
exercisable until the seventh anniversary
of their date of grant.
Details of all share options granted under
the terms of the schemes that still have
options exercisable at 31 December 2013
are shown below:

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements 30   Lavendon Group plc 2013
The Lavendon Group plc
2006 Long Term Incentive
Plan (the “Plan”)
The Plan was approved by shareholders
at the Annual General Meeting held on
28 April 2006. The Remuneration Committee
of the Company (the “Committee”)
supervise the operation of the Plan.
Eligibility
Any employee (including an executive
director) of the Company and any of its
subsidiaries will be eligible to participate
in the Plan at the discretion of the
Committee.
Grant of awards
The Committee may grant an award
under the Plan either as a conditional
allocation of ordinary shares in the
Company (“Shares”) or a nil cost option
with a short exercise window. The
Committee may also decide to grant cash-
based awards of an equivalent value to
share-based awards or to satisfy share-
based awards in cash, should there be
a compelling reason to do so.
The Committee may grant awards within
six weeks of the approval of the Plan by
shareholders and then within six weeks
following the Company’s announcement of
its results for any period. The Committee
may also grant awards at any other time
when there are exceptional circumstances
which the Committee considers justifies
the granting of awards.
An award may not be granted more
than 10 years after the approval of the
Plan by shareholders.
The Committee will review the operation of
the Plan each year prior to making a grant.
Awards are not transferable, except on
death. Awards are not pensionable.
Individual limit
The maximum market value of Shares over
which awards may be granted to any
individual in any financial year in normal
circumstances will not exceed 150% of that
individual’s base salary.
Overall Plan limits
The Plan may use new issue Shares, treasury
Shares or Shares purchased in the market.
In any ten calendar year period not more
than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital
of the Company may be issued or issuable
under the Plan and any other employee
share plan adopted by the Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue
Shares for the purposes of these limits
unless institutional investor bodies
decide otherwise.
Vesting of awards
Awards will normally vest on or following
the third anniversary of grant once the
Committee has determined the extent to
which the applicable performance
conditions (see below) have been satisfied
and provided the participant is still
employed in the Company’s group.
Leaving employment
As a general rule, an award will lapse upon
a participant ceasing to hold an office or
employment within the Company’s group.
However, if a participant ceases to hold
an office or employment in the group
because of death, ill health, disability, injury,
redundancy, the sale or transfer of his
employing company or business out of the
Company’s group or in other circumstances
at the discretion of the Committee, then an
award will vest when the participant ceases
to hold an office or employment with the
Company’s group. The extent to which an
award will vest will depend upon the extent
to which the performance conditions have,
in the opinion of the Committee, been
satisfied at the original date of vesting. The
award will then be pro-rated to reflect the
period of time between its grant and the
time of leaving employment, although the
Committee can decide not to pro-rate an
award if it regards it as inappropriate to do
so in the particular circumstances.
In the event that a participant retires, an
award will normally continue to the time
when vesting would have occurred if the
participant had remained an office holder
or employee with the Company’s group.
The award will vest to the extent that the
performance conditions have been satisfied
over the three year performance period,
and may then be pro-rated to reflect the
reduced period of time between its grant
and the cessation of employment.
Alternatively, the Committee may decide,
in exceptional circumstances, that the
award will vest on cessation of
employment. The award will then be
pro-rated (as described above).
Corporate events
In the event of a takeover, scheme of
arrangement or winding up of the Company
(not being an internal corporate
reorganisation) all awards will vest early to
the extent that the performance conditions
have, in the opinion of the Committee, been
satisfied up to the date of the relevant
event. The awards will then be pro-rated to
reflect the reduced period of time between
their grant and the time of vesting, although
the Committee can decide not to pro-rate
awards if it regards it as inappropriate to do
so in the particular circumstances.
In the event of an internal corporate
reorganisation, awards will be replaced by
equivalent new awards over shares in a new
holding company unless the Committee
decides that awards should vest on the basis
which would apply in the case of a takeover.
Performance conditions
All awards will be subject to performance
conditions set by the Committee.
Details of LTIP awards granted to executive
directors are disclosed separately in the
Annual Report on Remuneration on pages
49 to 53.
Details of all other LTIP awards
granted under the terms of the Plan at
31 December 2013 are shown opposite:
Share incentive plan
During 2007 the Company established a
Share Incentive Plan (‘the SIP’).
The SIP is a UK HM Revenue & Customs
(“HMRC”) approved plan under which
the Company can provide share benefits
in a tax advantaged way to all its UK
employees on the same terms. Details of
the shares issued under the SIP are
detailed in note 25.
Director’s report
Continued                                                                                                                                                                                                                       Lavendon Group plc 2013   31
The SIP allows the Company to either give
“free shares” to employees or provide a
facility for employees to purchase shares
from their pre-tax salary. Shares purchased
by employees may be supplemented by
the Company with additional free
“matching shares”.
Operation
The board of directors of the Company (the
“Board”) supervises the operation of the SIP .
The SIP comprises the following three
elements and the Board may decide which
element to offer to eligible employees:
a) “Free Shares” are ordinary shares in the
Company (“Shares”) which may be allocated
to an employee.
The market value of Free Shares allocated
to any employee in any tax year may not
exceed £3,000 or such other limit as may
be permitted by the relevant legislation.
Free Shares may be allocated to employees
equally, on the basis of salary, length of
service or hours worked, or on the basis of
performance, as permitted by legislation.
b) “Partnership Shares” are Shares an
employee may purchase out of their
pre-tax earnings.
The market value of Partnership Shares
which an employee can purchase in any tax
year may not exceed £1,500 (or 10% of the
employee’s salary, if lower), or such other
limit as may be permitted by the relevant
legislation. The funds used to purchase
Partnership Shares will be deducted from
the employee’s pre-tax salary.
c) “Matching Shares” are free Shares which
may be allocated to an employee who
purchases Partnership Shares.
The Board may allocate Matching Shares to
an employee who purchases Partnership
Shares up to a maximum of two Matching
Shares for every one Partnership Share
purchased (or such other maximum ratio
as may be permitted by the relevant
legislation). The same Matching Share ratio
will apply to all employees who purchase
Partnership Shares under the SIP on the
same occasion.
An award of Shares may not be made
under the SIP later than ten years after
shareholder approval of the SIP .
Eligibility
Employees of the Company and any
designated participating subsidiary who
are UK resident taxpayers are eligible
to participate.
The Board may allow non-UK tax resident
taxpayers to participate. The Board may
require employees to have completed a
qualifying period of employment of up to
18 months in order to be eligible to
participate. All eligible employees must
be invited to participate.
Retention of shares
The trustee of the SIP trust will award Free
Shares and Matching Shares to employees
and hold those Shares on behalf of the
participants. Free Shares and Matching
Shares must usually be retained by the
trustee of the SIP trust for a period of
between three and five years after award.
The trustee will acquire Partnership Shares
on behalf of participants and hold those
Shares on behalf of the participants.
Employees can withdraw Partnership
Shares from the SIP trust at any time.
The Board may decide that awards of Free
Shares and/or Matching Shares will be
forfeited if participants cease to be
employed by a company in the Company’s
Group within three years from the grant of
those awards unless they leave by reason
of death, injury, disability, redundancy,
retirement on or after reaching age 50, or
the business or company for which they
work ceases to be part of the Company’s
Group. In any of those cases, the
participants will be required to withdraw
their Shares from the SIP .
If an employee ceases to be employed by
the Company’s Group at any time after
acquiring Partnership Shares, he will be
required to withdraw the Shares from the
SIP trust.
Corporate events
In the event of a general offer being made
to shareholders, participants will be able to
direct the trustees how to act in relation to
their Shares. In the event of a corporate
reorganisation any Shares held by
participants may be replaced by equivalent
shares in a new holding company.
Dividends on shares held by the trustee
of the SIP .
Any dividends paid on Shares held by the
trustee of the SIP on behalf of participants
may be either used to acquire additional
Shares for employees (“Dividend Shares”)
or distributed to participants.

Rights attaching to shares
An employee will be treated as the
beneficial owner of Shares held on his
behalf by the trustee of the SIP .
Any Shares allotted under the SIP will rank
equally with Shares then in issue except for
rights attaching to such Shares by reference
to a record date prior to their allotment.
Overall SIP limits
The SIP may operate over new issue
Shares, treasury Shares or Shares
purchased in the market.
In any ten calendar year period, the
Company may not issue (or grant rights to
issue) more than 10 per cent of the issued
ordinary share capital of the Company
under the SIP and any other employee
share plan adopted by the Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue
Shares for the purpose of this limit unless
institutional investor bodies decide that
they need not count.
Variation of capital
In the case of a variation in the share capital
of the Company, Shares held in the SIP will
be treated in the same way as other shares.
Alterations to the SIP
The Board may, at any time, amend the SIP
in any respect, provided that the prior
approval of shareholders is obtained for
any amendments that are to the advantage
of participants in respect of the rules
governing eligibility, limits on participation,
the overall limits on the issue of Shares or
the transfer of treasury Shares, the basis for
determining a participant’s entitlement to,
and the terms of, Shares to be acquired
and the adjustment of awards.
The requirement to obtain prior
shareholder approval will not, however,
apply to any minor alteration to benefit the
administration of the SIP , to take account
of a change in legislation or to obtain or
maintain favourable tax, exchange control,
or regulatory treatment for any participant
or any company in the Company’s Group.
General
Awards made under the SIP are not
transferable other than to the participant’s
personal representatives in the event of
their death. No benefits received under
the SIP will be pensionable.
Directors’ interests in
significant contracts
No directors were materially interested
in any contract of significance.
Statement of directors’
responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing
the Annual Report, the Remuneration
Committee Report and the financial
statements in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to
prepare financial statements for each
financial year. Under that law the directors
have prepared the Group financial
statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as
adopted by the European Union, and the
parent company financial statements in
accordance with United Kingdom Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice (United
Kingdom Accounting Standards and
applicable law). Under company law the
directors must not approve the financial
statements unless they are satisfied that
they give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Group and the Company and
of the profit or loss of the Group for that
period. In preparing these financial
statements, the directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and
then apply them consistently.
• Make judgements and accounting estimates
that are reasonable and prudent.
• State whether IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union and applicable UK
Accounting Standards have been followed,
subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the group
and parent company financial
statements respectively.
The directors are responsible for keeping
adequate accounting records that are
sufficient to show and explain the
company’s transactions and disclose with
reasonable accuracy at any time the
financial position of the Company and the
Group and enable them to ensure that the
financial statements and the Remuneration
Committee Report comply with the
Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the
Group financial statements, Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the Company
and the Group and hence for taking
reasonable steps for the prevention and
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the
maintenance and integrity of the Company’s
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom
governing the preparation and
dissemination of financial statements may
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
The directors consider that the Annual
Report and Accounts, taken as a whole, is
fair, balanced and understandable and
provides the information necessary for
shareholders to assess a Company’s
performance, business model and strategy.
Each of the directors, whose names and
functions are listed in the Governance
section on pages 34 and 35 confirm that,
to the best of their knowledge:
• The Group financial statements, which
have been prepared in accordance with
IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial
position and profit of the Group.
• The strategic report contained in the
Strategic Report section on pages 6 to 27
includes a fair review of the development
and performance of the business and the
position of the Group, together with a
description of the principal risks and
uncertainties that it faces.
In accordance with Section 418, in the case
of each director in office at the date the
directors’ report is approved:
(a) So far as the director is aware, there is
no relevant audit information of which
the Company’s auditors are unaware.
(b) He has taken all the steps that he ought
to have taken as a director in order to
make himself aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that
the Company’s auditors are aware of
that information.

Insurance of directors
The Company has put in place insurance to
cover its directors and officers against the
costs of defending themselves in civil legal
proceedings taken against them in that
capacity and in respect of damages
awarded in such proceedings.
Following shareholder approval, the Group
maintains insurance for Lavendon Group plc’s
directors in respect of their duties as director,
which is a qualifying third party indemnity
provision for the purposes of the Companies
Act 2006. This cover was in place during the
financial year and at the date of approval of
these financial statements.
Financial risk management
Details are included in note 22 to the
financial statements.
Independent auditors
and disclosure of
information to auditors
As far as each director is aware, there is
no relevant audit information of which the
Company’s auditors are unaware.
Each director has taken steps that they
ought to have taken as directors in order to
make themselves aware of any relevant
audit information and to establish that the
Company’s auditors are aware of that
information. PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP
have expressed their willingness to
continue in office as auditors to the
Company and Group. A resolution to
reappoint them as auditors to the Company
and Group will be proposed at the next
Annual General Meeting.
Takeover Directive disclosure
Following the implementation of the EU
Takeover Directive by certain provisions of
the 2006 Act, we are required to make
additional disclosures. A number of these
disclosures can be found elsewhere in this
Report as set out below:
• Structure of Lavendon Group’s share
capital (see page 92).
• Employee share schemes (see pages
29 to 32).
• Significant direct or indirect shareholdings
(see page 38).
• Appointment and replacement of
directors (see page 36).
• The powers of directors (see pages 28
and 29).
The disclosures which are not covered
elsewhere in this Report include the
following:
Agreements which may result in
restrictions on share transfers
The Company is not aware of any
agreements between shareholders which
may result in restrictions on the transfer
of securities and/or on voting rights.
Change of control
There are no significant agreements to
which the Company is a party that may take
effect, alter or terminate upon a change of
control following a takeover bid, other than
that in relation to Company’s borrowings,
which could become repayable on a
takeover being completed.
Shares with special rights
There are no special rights or obligations
attaching to the ordinary shares and
there are no shares in the Company with
special rights with regard to control of
the Company.
Restrictions on transfer of
Lavendon Group shares
The Company’s Articles of Association
provide that the Company may refuse to
transfer shares in the following customary
circumstances:
• Where the share is not a fully paid share.
• Where the share transfer is in favour of
more than four joint transferees.
• Where the share is a certificated share
and is not accompanied by the relevant
share certificate(s) and such other
evidence as the board may reasonably
require to prove the title of the transferor.
These restrictions are in addition to any
which are applicable to all UK listed
companies imposed by law or regulation.
Articles of association
The Company’s Articles of Association may
be amended by special resolution of the
Company’s shareholders.
Compensation for loss of office
There are no agreements between the
Company and its directors or employees
providing for compensation for loss of
office or employment (whether through
resignation, purported redundancy or
otherwise) that occurs because of a
takeover bid.

Compliance with 
the UK Corporate
Governance Code
The governance rules applicable to all UK
companies admitted to the Official List of
the UK Listing Authority are set out in the
UK Corporate Governance Code (the
‘Code’), published by the Financial Reporting
Council. The Board fully supports the
principles set out in the Code and confirms
that it has complied with all of the
provisions of the Code throughout the
financial year ended 31 December 2013.
This report sets out Lavendon’s governance
policies and practices, including details 
of how the Company applies the principles
and complies with the provisions of 
the Code.
The Board
In the year, the Board comprised a non-
executive chairman (John Standen), a chief
executive officer (Don Kenny), a group
finance director (Alan Merrell), a senior
independent director (Jan Åstrand) and a
non-executive director (Andrew Wood). 
Jan Åstrand resigned from the Board with
effect from 26 February 2014. Following
Jan’s resignation, Andrew Wood became the
Company’s Senior Independent Director.
With effect from 1 March 2014, John
Coghlan and John Wyatt will join the Board
as non-executive directors, with John
Coghlan becoming Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee of the Company. 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive
Officer are separated, with John Standen
holding the office of Chairman and Don
Kenny the position of Chief Executive Officer. 
The Board directors provide the Company
with experience and knowledge from a
range of industry, financial and commercial
backgrounds. This combination of skills
and experience assists the Board in any
decision making process and in the
development of business strategy.
Biographical details of each director,
including current directorships held in other
companies, are detailed on pages 34 and
35 of the financial statements.
Board balance, independence
and commitment
The two non-executive directors constitute,
excluding the Chairman, one half of the
Board. The non-executive directors provide
a strong and independent monitor on the
performance of both the Company and its
executive management. 
The Board believes that the non-executive
directors are independent within the
guidance of the Code as they have not
been previously employed by the Company,
have not and do not currently have a
material business relationship with the
Company, are remunerated on a fixed fee
basis, do not have close family ties with the
Company's advisers, directors or senior
employees, do not hold cross directorships
with the other directors nor have other
significant links with other directors, do not
represent significant shareholders and have
not served on the Board for more than nine
years. Their backgrounds in industry and
finance make them suitably qualified to
perform their duties as members of the
Board and as members of the Audit,
Remuneration and Nomination
Committees.
The executive directors, Don Kenny and
Alan Merrell, do not hold non-executive
directorships outside of the Company.
Neither the Chairman nor non-executive
directors currently hold other roles that are
considered to impair or conflict with their
abilities to fulfil their duties to the Company.
Effectiveness
Meetings
The Company holds regular Board
meetings during the year, with minutes
being recorded and agreed by all directors
ensuring an accurate record is made of all
relevant matters. 
During 2013, the Board held ten formal
meetings. The attendance of each director
at these meetings is shown in the 
table below:
Attendance table
Meetings Apologies
attended given
John Standen 10 –
Don Kenny 10 –
Alan Merrell 10 –
Jan Åstrand 10 –
Andrew Wood 10 –
The Company maintains a schedule of
matters reserved for decision by the Board,
including the release of a number of
financial, corporate and statutory
disclosures, approval of business strategy
and acquisitions, composition of relevant
committees and management structures,
and matters relating to ethical, health and
safety concerns. At each Board Meeting the
Chief Executive and Group Finance Director
provide a review of business performance
and give details of any strategic issues
arising. 
The Chairman holds separate meetings, at
least annually, with the non-executive
directors in order to review the
contributions and performance of all
individuals comprising the Board. 
The Company reviews conduct and liability
issues as part of its annual risk review and
mitigates these exposures through
Directors and Officer’s insurance cover
where appropriate.
Board committees
The Board has established three Board
committees to which it has delegated
certain responsibilities, namely the Audit
Committee, the Remuneration Committee
and the Nominations Committee. The
relationship and intra-action between the
Board, the Committees and the executive
management team is illustrated in the
diagram opposite.
The membership, responsibilities and
activities of the Committees are set out
in the Audit, Nominations and
Remuneration Committee Reports on
pages 39 to 48.
Information and professional
development
Board papers are circulated to all members
of the Board in advance of each meeting,
and the quantity and focus of such
36   Lavendon Group plc 2013 information is reviewed on an ongoing
basis. Directors provide feedback to
management to enable the reporting
formats and content of Board papers to be
enhanced, and make individual enquiries of
management for clarification on issues
whenever necessary.
The Company allows directors to take
professional and independent advice as
may be necessary in carrying out their
duties. Directors also attend training
courses, when appropriate, to ensure they
remain up to date with the latest
developments and legal requirements that
impact their individual responsibilities.
The joint role of Finance Director and
Company Secretary, held by Alan Merrell,
ensures that the directors have ready
access to the Company Secretary in all
relevant matters and that compliance with
Board procedures is maintained.
Performance evaluation
An external review of the performance of
the Board and its Committees was
commissioned in December 2013 and
completed in January 2014. The review was
conducted by MWM Consulting, an
independent organisation with no
connection to the Company. The review
comprised detailed interviews with each
Board member and a review of Board and
Committee papers. The report from MWM
Consulting was presented to the Board, and
its overall conclusion was that the Board
operated in an efficient and effective
manner. Recommendations were made to
enhance the Board’s performance going
forward, and following discussion action
points were agreed. It is the Board’s
intention to have an external review of its
effectiveness performed at least every three
years, in line with best practice.
Re-election
In accordance with the Articles of
Association of the Company, all directors
are subject to election at the Company’s
first Annual General Meeting following their
appointment, and all are required to seek
re-election at intervals of no more than
three years. In accordance with best
practice, all of the Company’s directors 
seek re-election on an annual basis. In
accordance with the Articles of Association
of the Company, all directors are subject 
to election at the Company’s first 
Annual General Meeting following their
appointment, and all are required to seek
re-election at intervals of no more than
three years. In accordance with best
practice, all of the Company’s directors seek
re-election on an annual basis.
Accountability
Financial and business reporting
The directors and auditors set out their
respective responsibilities for preparing and
reviewing the financial statements in the
Statement of directors’ responsibilities on
page 32 and in the Independent auditors’
report on pages 60 to 63 of the financial
statements. The Company’s strategy for
delivering sustained value over the longer
term is set out in the Strategic Report on
pages 6 to 27.
Risk management and internal control
The Board maintains a system of internal
controls within the Company to manage
risks and provide a reasonable, but not
absolute, degree of assurance on the
reliability of the financial and other
information used both within the business
and for external publication, as well as
safeguarding the assets of the Company
against unauthorised use or disposition.
The systems in place are designed to
identify to the Board, on a timely basis,
matters that require attention so that 
they may be considered and dealt with
appropriately. The Board has reviewed the
effectiveness of the systems of internal
control that were in operation during the
past financial year, and these are
summarised under the following headings:
Control environment
There is a clearly defined organisational
structure that allows the Company’s
objectives to be planned, communicated,
executed, controlled and monitored. The
Company employs suitably qualified staff 
so that the appropriate level of authority
can be delegated to ensure the efficient
management of the business. Delegated
authority is embedded throughout the
organisation, covering the preparation 
and review of financial and operational
information together with the procedures
for seeking and obtaining approval for
major transactions and organisational
changes. The level of delegated authority is
reviewed annually by the Audit Committee.
Identification and evaluation of
business risks and control objectives
The identification and evaluation of both
financial and non financial business risks
facing the Company is reviewed annually 
by the Board. During this process the
effectiveness of its internal controls 
in safeguarding against these risks is
considered, and where necessary additional
controls are introduced or existing controls
are enhanced.
Information systems
The management information systems
provide the Company with relevant and
timely reports from which both the Board
and senior management can monitor the
performance of the business. Budgets and
prior year data provide the Board and
senior management with comparative
information with which to assess and
monitor the performance of the various
activities of the Company. Operational

Continued
performance statistics are reviewed against
a range of measures including competitive
benchmarks and historical trends.
The Group has continued to invest in
developing and enhancing these
information systems during the year, to
ensure that the information is provided
in the most efficient manner.
Monitoring
The executive directors have significant
involvement in the day-to-day management
of the Company’s activities and are,
therefore, able to monitor the control
procedures at an operational and financial
level. A Group Executive Committee,
comprising the two executive directors
and direct reports from the operating
subsidiaries and business functional units,
meets regularly to discuss key operational
risks and issues, monitor business unit
performance and ensure efficient
communication. 
The Company maintains an internal audit
function, outsourced to Grant Thornton UK
LLP , which undertakes a programme of
audits across the Company. Each year, a
risk workshop is held to identify and
evaluate the key business risks, from which
a focused audit programme is developed
and agreed with the executive and the
Audit Committee. The internal audit reports
are addressed to, and reviewed by, the
Audit Committee, and appropriate actions,
if required, agreed.
Any reportable control weaknesses
identified by the Company’s external
auditors are discussed with the Audit
Committee, and reports circulated to the
relevant executive directors. 
Going concern
The Company closely monitors its future
anticipated cash flows and compliance 
with its banking covenants. Based on these
forecasts and the sensitivities which 
have been run on different scenarios the
directors have a reasonable expectation
that the Group and Company have
adequate resources to continue in
existence for the foreseeable future. 
For this reason they continue to adopt 
the going concern basis in preparing 
the accounts.
Relations with shareholders
Dialogue with institutional
shareholders
The directors hold a series of meetings with
institutional investors after the publication
of the Company’s annual and interim
financial results each year. Meetings are
also held during the year with both existing
and prospective shareholders, to provide
the opportunity to understand the
Company’s operations and strategy in
greater detail.
The Chairman maintains a regular dialogue
with major shareholders in relation to
strategy and corporate governance issues,
and non-executive directors are also
available to meet major shareholders as
required. In particular, the Senior
Independent Director, Jan Åstrand, is
available to meet major shareholders in 
the Company, to allow any concerns to be
raised independently from the Board. 
In addition, the non-executive directors 
are available for questions from individual
shareholders at the Company’s Annual
General Meeting each year.
The Board retains a Stockbroker to ensure
a regular flow of relevant information is
made available to both current and
prospective shareholders and to 
facilitate feedback to assist the Board 
in understanding the issues and concerns
of its shareholders.
The Annual General Meeting and
shareholder communications
The majority of the Company’s share

investors.

Whilst the Company does not include a
formal presentation at the Annual General
Meeting (“AGM”) for private shareholders,
the Company maintains a website:
www.lavendongroup.com, which publishes
financial results, presentations, formal
announcements, and a number of
corporate governance documents for
review by current and potential
shareholders. In addition, at the Company’s
AGM, the full Board, including the Chairmen
of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination
Committees, are available to answer
individual questions or concerns about the
Company’s performance and strategy.
The notice of the AGM and Annual Report
and Accounts are sent out at least 20
working days prior to the date of the AGM.
It is the Company’s policy to ensure that
resolutions proposed at the AGM remain
segregated on matters which are
substantially different. In particular, the
approval of the Company’s Remuneration
Committee Report is subject of a separate
resolution. Shareholders are able to lodge
their votes through the CREST system, and
a proxy count is given for each resolution
after the voting on a show of hands. The
overall voting for each resolution is publicly
announced following the completion of the
Annual General Meeting.

• The policy on procurement of non-audit
related services from the external
auditors and the approval of the register
of non-audit assignments undertaken by
the external auditors in the year ending
31 December 2013.
• The reports from internal audit covering
various aspects of the Group’s operations,
controls and processes.
• The Group’s whistleblowing policy and
procedures to ensure that these
remained appropriate for the Group.
• The levels of authority delegated to
subsidiary operations.
• The Audit Committee’s terms of reference.
The Audit Committee confirmed with the
auditors that they had received all
necessary information for completion of
their assignments. At each meeting, the
auditors were asked whether they wished
to bring any matters to the attention of the
Committee without the executive directors
being present.
The Chairman of the Committee regularly
meets with the external and internal
auditors outside the Committee meetings
without management being present.
Significant areas
The significant accounting and audit
matters considered by the Committee and
discussed with the external auditors during
the year and in respect of the preparation
of the 2013 Annual Report were:
Presumed risk of fraud in revenue
recognition and management 
override of controls
The committee considered the presumed
risks of fraud as defined by Auditing
Standards, and after discussion with 
the management team and external
auditors were content that there were 
no issues arising.
Recoverability of Middle East
trade receivables
During the course of 2013 and up until 
the date of publication of this report, 
the Committee has regularly reviewed
management information regarding the
trade receivable balances in the Group’s
Middle East business. 
Reports detailing: the amount and
stratification of overdue trade receivable
balances by territory and customer;
cash collection performance; post
balance sheet date receipts; litigation
updates and details of provisions
made; were reviewed and challenged
where appropriate.
The Committee were satisfied that the
carrying value of the Middle East trade
receivables was reasonable and sufficient
provisions had been made for amounts
considered uncollectable.
Classification of exceptional items
The Committee considered the
presentation of the financial statements,
and in particular, the classification of
certain items as exceptional rather than
underlying. Although this is an area
which is inherently judgemental, the
Committee were satisfied with
management’s presentation.
Carrying value of goodwill
The Committee reviewed the assumptions
and basis of calculation that management
used in the modelling of future discounted
cash flows that were prepared in support 
of the carrying value of goodwill and
intangible assets.
The Committee were satisfied that the
stated balances of goodwill and intangible
assets were reasonable and supported
by appropriate calculations using
acceptable assumptions.
Whistleblowing procedure
To enable employees to raise matters of
impropriety or concern relating to financial
or other issues, the Committee maintains
an independent reporting procedure that is
available to all employees, through which
these concerns can be raised. The service,
called “Speak Up”, is available to employees
in all territories. The procedure provides
feedback to the employee regarding the
matters raised and any subsequent 
actions taken. 
External audit
The Group’s external auditors are
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP . The Audit
Committee is responsible for reviewing the
independence and objectivity of the
external auditors, and ensuring this is
safeguarded notwithstanding any provision
of any other services to the Group.
The Board recognises the importance of
safeguarding auditor objectivity and has
taken the following steps to ensure that
auditor independence is not compromised:
• Each year the Audit Committee carries out
an evaluation of the external auditor as to
its independence from the Group and its
relevant officers in all material respects
and that it is adequately resourced and
technically capable to deliver an objective
audit to shareholders. Based on this
review the Committee recommends 
to the Board each year the continuation,
or removal and replacement, of the
external auditor.
• The Audit Committee has a formal policy
relating to the procurement of non-audit
related work from the Group’s external
auditors. This policy has been applied 
in the year and is reviewed annually. 
The policy permits the engagement of
external auditors, without the prior
approval of the Committee, for non-audit
services where the fees will not exceed
30% of the annual audit fee for the Group
(50% in the case of taxation services), and
where the services relate to advice on the
interpretation of accounting regulations,
taxation and treasury services and other
matters that have relevance to the
external audit function. The policy
specifically prohibits engaging external
auditors to make management decisions
or provide management services, acting
as an advocate in litigation, investment
banking services, internal audit services
of a recurring nature, the design and
implementation of financial and risk
management systems and executive
search services. 
• The Audit Committee reviews all fees paid
for audit, together with any non-audit
fees, to assess the likelihood of any
independence issues arising.
40   Lavendon Group plc 2013 • The external auditors’ report to the 
Board and the Audit Committee
confirming their independence in
accordance with Auditing Standards. 
In addition to the steps taken by the
Board to safeguard auditor objectivity,
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP operates 
a five-year rotation policy for 
audit partners.
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP have been in
place as external auditors of the Group for
22 years and the audit contract has not
been put out to tender in the last 10 years.
Their performance is reviewed annually by
the Committee. As part of this year’s review
the Committee considered the UK
Corporate Governance Code guidance in
relation to external audit contracts for
companies outside the FTSE 350 and
noted that the Group Audit Partner was
rotated during 2013. The tendering of the
audit contract will be kept under review by
the Committee and will be considered in
the light of any legislation which is
developing in this area.
The Committee has reviewed the
performance of the external auditors for
2013 and concluded that they remain
effective and independent. Consequently
the Committee is recommending to
shareholders that they are re-appointed
for 2014.

Chairman of the
Nominations Committee
42   Lavendon Group plc 2013 Annual Statement by 
the Chairman of the
Remuneration Committee
This is the first Remuneration Committee
Report (the “Report”) to be presented since
the introduction of the new voting and
disclosure requirements on directors’ pay.
The Report is divided into two sections –
the Directors Remuneration Policy (which
is subject to a binding shareholder vote at
the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)) and
the Annual Remuneration Report (which
together with this Annual Statement is
subject to an advisory shareholder
vote out the AGM).
In the policy report we have set out the
Company’s overall policy on director’s
remuneration and in the annual report we
have provided details of each director’s
pay during 2013 together with any agreed
amendments to pay for 2014. The incentive
arrangements that we have in place are
closely aligned to the business strategy,
requiring strong growth in earnings,
efficient use of capital employed (assessed
through the measurement of returns on
capital employed (“ROCE”)) and total
shareholder return out-performance.
A significant proportion of the total
remuneration opportunity is provided in
shares further aligning the interests of
management with those of shareholders.
We can confirm that the principles of our
remuneration policy were applied
consistently throughout the year, and no
significant amendments to this policy are
envisaged in 2014. We believe that the
policy provides a framework to fairly
reward the directors and fully align their
interests with shareholders.
As in previous years, the Committee set
stretching financial targets to be achieved
under the incentive plans. Despite building
on the good performance achieved in
the prior year, the minimum Earnings
before Interest, Tax and Amortisation
(“EBITA”) and ROCE targets for 2013 were
narrowly missed and therefore no bonuses
have been awarded for 2013. In addition,
under the malus provision, the deferred
share bonus awards granted as part of
last year’s bonus will lapse since there
has been a slight deterioration in ROCE
over the year.
However, reflecting our longer term
performance, the Group’s total shareholder
return performance has been strong over
the last three years, out-performing the FTSE
SmallCap Index by 61.5%. Consequently, the
2011 LTIP awards will vest in full.
There are no changes to the executive’s
salaries for 2014 and the grant level for the
LTIP awards is expected to remain at 100%
of salary. The executive directors have
agreed to retain any shares (net-of-tax)
received under future LTIP awards for a
six month period post vesting and the
Remuneration Committee will review this
holding requirement again in 2014.
Whilst the remuneration policy includes
the flexibility for matching awards to be
granted, since no bonus has been awarded
for 2013, there will be no matching shares
granted in 2014.
Resolutions to approve the Directors’
Remuneration Policy and Annual Report
on Remuneration will be proposed at the
forthcoming AGM of the Company on
17 April 2014.

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements • The Company complies with the UK
Corporate Governance Code.
The Committee believes that there should
be an appropriate balance in the executive
directors’ remuneration packages between
fixed and variable (performance related)
pay, that encourages the long-term success
of the Company. The chart below illustrates
the potential rewards available for the
executive directors in terms of fixed pay
only, for target performance (target
incentive payout) and out-performance
(maximum incentive payout):
The individual components of the
remuneration package for executive directors
are summarised on pages 45 and 46.
Further details on the
Deferred Share Bonus
Plan and Long-term
Incentive Plan
The awards under the DSBP and LTIP will be
granted in accordance with the rules of the
relevant plan and the discretions contained
therein. The DSBP was approved by
shareholders in 2012 and the LTIP in 2006.
A copy of the rules of each plan is available
from the Company Secretary on request.
Awards may be structured as a conditional
award or nil cost options. The rules also
provide the flexibility for awards to be settled
in cash although this is only expected to be
used in exceptional circumstances.
Unless the Committee determines otherwise,
participants will ordinarily receive dividend
equivalents on vested shares under the
DSBP and LTIP (based on dividends
declared between the date of grant and
the date of vesting). These may be paid in
cash or shares.
The performance measures for the DSBP
matching awards and LTIP awards will be
set using a sliding scale of targets and
no more than 25% of the award (under
each measure) will vest for achieving the
threshold performance hurdle. The
performance targets will be set prior to the
grant of each award and different targets
and/or weightings between measures
(from those set out in the table opposite)
may be set for future award cycles.
Under the rules of both plans, the
Committee has the discretion to amend
the targets applying to existing awards in
exceptional circumstances providing the new
targets are no less challenging than originally
envisaged. Furthermore, the payment of
any bonus is at the ultimate discretion of
the Committee. The Committee also has
the power to adjust the number of shares
subject to an award in the event of a
variation in the capital of the Company.
The Committee has the discretion to reclaim
some, or all, of a vested DSBP and/or LTIP
in exceptional circumstances, such as a
misstatement of financial results, an error
in assessment of performance, the use of
misleading information and/or gross
misconduct on the part of the individual.
The authority to use this discretion lasts for
two years following the vesting of any award.
Remuneration Committee report
Continued
Directors’
Remuneration Policy
This report sets out the Company’s overall
policy on directors’ pay for the current and
forthcoming financial year. It will take effect
as an approved policy under the Regulations
from the date it is approved by shareholders.
The remuneration of the Company’s
executive directors comprise a base salary,
an annual performance bonus, participation
in a long term incentive plans with returns
based on Group performance, together
with a defined contribution towards
pension arrangements and other benefits,
as detailed in this report.
In determining the remuneration packages
of the executive directors of the Group,
and advising, where appropriate, on the
remuneration policies relating to the
Group’s senior management below Board
level, the Committee aims to ensure that:
• Executives are appropriately rewarded
for their contributions to the Group,
and account is taken of their individual
responsibility and performance.
• Rewards are linked to the Group’s
performance so that the interests of the
executives are aligned with those of
the Company’s shareholders.
• Remuneration packages reflect current
market conditions in order to attract,
retain and motivate executives of a
high quality.
• Executive shareholding is encouraged to
ensure a longer term focus.

Assumptions: Salary levels (on which other elements of the package are calculated) are based on those applying on 1 January 2014. The value of taxable benefits is based on the cost
of supplying those benefits (as disclosed) for the year ending 31 December 2013. Target performance assumes a bonus of 45% of salary. 30% of the on-target bonus is deferred into
shares under the Deferred Share Bonus Plan (the”DSBP”) and a further 25% of the bonus is voluntary invested into the DSBP (with matching at 25% (threshold performance)). The target
scenario assumes 25% vesting under the Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”). Maximum performance assumes a bonus of 150% of salary, full investment of the bonus into the DSBP and
matching at 100%, along with 100% vesting of the LTIP awards. The LTIP grant level in both scenarios is 100% of salary each year. No share price growth has been assumed.

An appraisal of the performance of the
individual is taken in to account when
salary levels are reviewed each year.

Our policy is to pay salaries at market
rates for the role, taking into account the
skill level, experience and personal
circumstances of the individual and the
interests of shareholders. Salaries are
benchmarked against comparable roles
in companies of a similar size and in
companies within the industry sector.
In determining salary increases the
Committee takes into account individual
performance, market data, any changes in
role or responsibility and the policy being
adopted by the Company for pay reviews
elsewhere in the Company or Group.
The Committee also considers the impact
of any increase to salaries on the total
remuneration package.
Salaries are paid monthly and are normally
reviewed annually (with any changes usually
effective from 1 January each year). Details
of the current salaries of the executive
directors are set out in the Annual Report
on Remuneration.
Benefits currently comprise a company
car (or cash allowance in lieu), medical
insurance and disability cover. Additional
benefits may be provided, as appropriate.
There is no maximum prescribed value
but the Committee monitors the overall
cost of the benefit provision to ensure
that it remains appropriate.
Executive directors are also entitled to
membership of the all-employee
Lavendon Share Incentive Plan (‘SIP’) and
participate on the same terms as other
eligible employees.
The Company does not offer a defined
benefit pension scheme, instead it provides
an allowance of up to 25% of salary that
can be invested into a defined contribution
plan and/or taken as a cash allowance in
lieu of pension.

Annual 
bonus
Deferred 
Share Bonus 
Plan (DSBP) –

awards
Long Term
Incentive 
Plan (LTIP)
Bonuses are currently based on the
achievement of a combination of financial
objectives linked to profitability & return on
capital employed (“ROCE”) (up to 125% of
salary) and corporate/personal objectives
(up to 25% of salary). The Committee may
use different measures and/or weightings
for future bonus cycles to take into account
changes in the strategic needs of the
business. However, financial targets will
account for at least three-quarters of the
total bonus opportunity.
For each financial measure, normally a
sliding scale of stretching targets is set by the
Committee, which apply from the beginning
of each financial year. The minimum financial
performance targets have to be achieved
before any bonus relating to corporate or
personal objectives becomes payable.
The Committee also retains an absolute
discretion to reclaim some, or all, of the
annual bonus paid in exceptional
circumstances, such as misstatement of
results, an error in calculating performance
and/or misconduct by the individual.
In additional, the deferred shares awarded
under the bonus are subject to a malus
provision – the shares will lapse if there is
deterioration during the deferral period of
any the financial metrics that been used to
determine the original bonus.
The performance conditions for any
potential matching awards will be finalised
each year once bonus payments are
confirmed and if notification is received
that a director wishes to voluntarily invest
part, or all, of his remaining cash bonus.
Performance conditions will be based on
earnings per share and ROCE reflecting the
strategic priorities of the business to grow
earnings and improve returns on the
Company’s invested capital.
Awards under the LTIP , from 2013
onwards, are subject to a relative total
shareholder return performance condition
and a ROCE condition, each accounting
for 50% of the award and each measured
over three financial years.
The Committee has the discretion to
reduce the level of vesting of an LTIP award
if it considers that it is not reflective of the
underlying financial and/or corporate
performance of the Company.
The maximum annual bonus potential is
150% of salary. The level of bonus payable
for achieving the minimum financial targets
is determined each year taking into
account the circumstances at that time.
The ‘on-target’ performance bonus is set
at 30% of the maximum bonus achievable
(45% of salary).
If bonuses exceed £30,000 then 30% of
the total annual bonus will be deferred into
shares for one year under the Company’s
Deferred Share Bonus Plan.
At the discretion of the Remuneration
Committee, the executive directors may
voluntarily invest part or all of their
remaining after tax cash bonus in shares
and receive a potential matching award
subject to performance over a three year
period (up to a 1:1 match on the gross
bonus invested). The maximum grant limit
under the plan rules is 150% of salary, but
since the size of the award is linked to
voluntary investment of bonus the current
maximum is equal to the cash proportion of
an executive’s bonus (i.e. 105% of salary).
The LTIP permits an annual grant of shares
which vest subject to performance and
continued employment. The maximum
grant policy under the LTIP is 150% of
salary. However, awards for 2014 are
expected to be limited to 100% of salary.
The executive directors are subject to
shareholding guidelines requiring them to
build and maintain a shareholding in
Lavendon equivalent to 100% of gross
salary. In addition, the executive directors
have agreed to retain the shares received
(net of tax) from future LTIP awards for six
months post vesting. 
46   Lavendon Group plc 2013 Shareholding guidelines
The Committee believes that executives
should be encouraged to build significant
long-term share holdings and the
remuneration policy has been designed
with this key principle in mind. The
executive directors are expected to build a
shareholding in the Company, over time,
equal to 100% of annual salary to facilitate
the alignment of interests with those of
the Company’s shareholders. Furthermore,
the executive directors have agreed to
retain the shares received (net of tax)
from future LTIP awards for at least six
months post vesting.
Legacy share plans
The LTIP awards granted in 2011 and 2012
were subject to a relative total shareholder
return condition only. These awards, made
prior to the commencement of the current
policy, will be allowed to vest on the terms
on which they were granted. Full details of
these outstanding awards are set out in
the Annual Report on Remuneration on
pages 49 to 53.
Service contracts and policy
on termination payments
Under the executive directors’ service
contracts twelve months’ notice of
termination of employment is required by
either party. Should notice be served, the
executives can continue to receive basic
salary, benefits and pension for the
duration of their notice period. The
Company applies a general principle of
mitigation in relation to termination
payments and supports the use of phased
payments. Outplacement services may be
provided where appropriate and any
statutory entitlements or sums to settle or
compromise claims in connection with a
termination would be paid as necessary.
In the event of a cessation of employment,
the executives may still be eligible for a
bonus, payable in cash, on a pro-rata basis,
but only for the period of time served from
the start of the financial year to the date
of termination and not for any period in
lieu of notice.
The rules of the DSBP and LTIP set out what
happens to outstanding share awards if a
participant leaves employment before the
end of the vesting period. Generally, any
outstanding share awards will lapse when
an executive leaves employment except in
certain circumstances. If the executive
leaves employment as a result of death,
il-health, injury, disability, retirement, transfer
of employment or any other reason at the
discretion of the Committee, then they will
be treated as a ‘good leaver’ under the plan
rules. The share awards for a good leaver
will vest at the end of the original vesting
period, subject to an assessment of the
performance conditions and with a pro-rata
reduction to reflect the proportion of the
vesting period served. Under the terms of
both plans, the Committee may dis-apply
the time pro-rating requirement if it
considers it appropriate to do so. In
determining whether an executive should
be treated as a good leaver and the extent
to which their award may vest, the
Committee will take into account the
circumstances of an individual’s departure.
The treatment of share awards on a change
of control is the same as that set out above
in relation to a good leaver (albeit with the
vesting period automatically ending on the
date of the change in control).
Chairman and non-
executive director’s fees
and letters of appointment
The fees for the Chairman are determined
by the Remuneration Committee taking into
account views of the Chief Executive (the
Chairman excludes himself from such
discussions). Non-executive director fees
are reviewed annually by the Chairman and
Chief Executive. Fee levels are set to reflect
the responsibilities and time commitment
of the role, the experience of the individual
and their effectiveness in the role.
Benchmark research is also undertaken
against fees paid in companies of
comparable size and complexity. The fee
structure for the non-executive directors
comprises a basic Board fee, combined
with an additional fee where a Committee
Chairman role is also performed. In
exceptional circumstances, additional fees
may be payable to reflect a substantial
unplanned increase in time commitment
during a year. The fees are paid monthly
through the Company’s payroll.
The Chairman and non-executive directors
have letters of appointment, which are for
a period of three years. The current letters
of appointment have been extended to
30 April 2014, so that, going forward, re-
appointment dates are more in line with the
Company’s Annual General Meetings where
resolutions are proposed for the re-election
of directors by shareholders. The letters of
appointment may be terminated on giving
three months notice by either party.
Recruitment policy
Base salary levels will be set in accordance
with Lavendon’s remuneration policy, taking
into account of the executive’s expertise,
experience and their existing remuneration
package. Where it is appropriate to offer a
lower salary initially, a series of increases to
the desired salary positioning may be given
over subsequent years subject to individual
performance. Benefits will generally be
provided in accordance with the approved
policy, with relocation expenses/an
expatriate allowance paid if required.
The structure of the variable pay element
will be in accordance with Lavendon’s
approved policy detailed above. The
maximum possible variable pay opportunity
is 405% of salary; being a maximum bonus
of 150% of salary, a maximum long-term
incentive award of 150% of salary and a
1:1 match on voluntary investment into
shares of any cash bonus earned (which is
equivalent to 105% of salary). The structure
of variable pay would be granted on a
consistent basis to the other executive
directors. However, in the case of the
annual bonus, different performance
measures may be set for the first year,
taking into account the responsibilities
of the individual, and the point in the
financial year at which they joined.
If it is necessary to buy-out incentive
awards granted by a previous employer
(which would be forfeited on leaving the
previous employer), the value of the buy-
out will take into account the form of the
previous award (cash or shares), the
timing of the award and its expected value.
Replacement share awards, if used, may
be granted using Lavendon’s existing share
plans to the extent possible, although
awards may also be granted outside of
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Lavendon Group plc 2013   47

these schemes if necessary and as
permitted under the Listing Rules.
In the case of an internal promotion, any
outstanding variable pay awarded in
relation to the previous role will be allowed
to pay out according to its terms of grant.
Fees for a new Chairman or non-executive
director will be set in line with the
approved policy.
External non executive
director positions
Subject to Board approval, executive
directors are permitted to take on non
executive positions with other companies.
Executive directors are permitted to retain
their fees in respect of such positions.
Details of outside directorships held by
the executive directors and any fees that
they receive are provided in the Annual
Report on Remuneration.
Differences in
remuneration policy
for executive directors
compared to
other employees
The remuneration policy for the executive
directors is designed with regard to the
policy for employees across the Group as
a whole. There are differences in the
structure of the remuneration policy for
the executive directors, for example, a
higher emphasis on performance related
pay and increased use of shares,
reflecting the responsibilities of the
position. The Committee has not consulted
directly with employees on the executive
remuneration policy but takes into account
the pay and employment conditions of the
general workforce when considering any
changes to the quantum or structure of
the executive remuneration packages.
How the views of
shareholders are taken
into account
As part of the Committee’s annual review
of remuneration matters, consideration is
given to any feedback received from the
Company’s shareholders. The Committee
engages pro-actively with its shareholders,
particularly when any changes are made
to the remuneration policy whereby the
Committee Chairman will inform major
shareholders of these in advance.
Details of votes cast for and against
the resolution to approve last year’s
remuneration report are provided in the
Annual Report on Remuneration.

i) The figure in the 2013 column relates to the LTIP awards granted in 2011 (which was based on relative TSR performance over the three years to 31 December 2013). The performance
condition was met in full and therefore the award will vest at 100%. Since, the awards have not yet vested, in accordance with the regulations, the value of the shares shown in the
table above is based on the average share price over the period 1 October to 31 December 2013.
The figure in the 2012 column, relates to the vesting of the 2010 LTIP . Don Kenny did not join the Lavendon until 2011 and therefore did not receive an award in 2010.
ii) The 2012 bonus was party paid in the form of deferred shares. The deferred shares are subject to a malus clause which means that the shares lapse if there has been deterioration
in EBITA and/or ROCE over the deferral period. This minimum financial performance was not achieved, therefore the shares will lapse. The value of the shares is shown at the grant
date share price.

i) The 2010, 2011 and 2012 awards are subject to a performance condition requiring the Company’s ‘TSR’ performance to out-perform that of the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding
Investment Trusts (the “Index”). The Company’s TSR performance over the performance period must be at least equal to the performance of the Index for 15% of the awards to vest,
increasing on a straight line basis to 100% of the awards vesting if TSR performance is 60% or more above the performance of the index. Performance is measured over three financial
years, starting with the year in which the award is granted.
ii) Lavendon’s actual TSR performance for the 2010 awards was 82% above the index resulting in full vesting for these awards. In accordance with the rules of the Plan, additional awards
(a further 8,269 shares) representing the value of dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the period between the date of grant and the date of vesting of the
awards were also made. The total number of shares vesting to Alan Merrell was therefore 249,233. The shares vested on 1 May 2013 and were exercised on the same date. The share
price on that date was 167p.
iii) Lavendon’s actual TSR performance for the 2011 awards was 61.5% above the index. These awards will therefore vest in full on the relevant vesting date. In accordance with the rules
of the Plan, additional awards representing the value of dividends that would have been paid on the vested shares during the period between the date of grant and the date of vesting
of the awards will also made.
iv) The 2013 awards were granted on 11 April 2013 and are subject to a TSR and ROCE performance condition (each accounting for 50% of the award). TSR is measured relative to the
constituents of the FTSE SmallCap Index excluding Investment Trusts and Financial Services Companies (with 25% vesting at median increasing to full vesting for upper quartile
performance or above. For the ROCE condition, average ROCE over the three year performance period must be at least 11.25% for 25% vesting, increasing on a straight-line basis to
full vesting for average ROCE of 13.25% or above. The share price on the date of grant was 172.5p and the face values of the awards were £324,450 for Don Kenny and £237,000 for
Alan Merrell; equivalent to 100% of base salary.
v) The market price of the Company’s shares at 31 December 2013 was 173.0p; the range of market prices during the year was between 138.0p and 196.5p.
Long Term Incentive Plan
The awards granted and vesting under this Plan to the executive directors are detailed in the table below:
50   Lavendon Group plc 2013
Pension contributions
in 2013
In 2013, the total of contributions made
towards individual pension arrangements
for Don Kenny and Alan Merrell were
£81,112 and £59,250 respectively. Of Don
Kenny’s total contribution, £50,000 was
paid into his pension fund and a taxable
‘cash in lieu’ payment of £31,112 was
made. Of Alan Merrell’s total contribution,
£50,000 was paid into his pension fund and
a taxable ‘cash in lieu’ payment of £9,250
was made.
Annual bonus payments
in 2013
The annual bonus scheme for 2013 was
based on a combination of financial
performance (up to 125% of salary) and
personal performance metrics (up to 25%
of salary). However, the Group had to
deliver both an operating profit before
amortisation and exceptional items 
(EBITA) of £35.0 million and a return on
capital employed of 10.7% before any
bonus payments (either financial or
personal performance related) would 
start to accrue.
The financial performance metrics are
shown below.
The Group’s financial performance for the
year did not achieve the minimum
threshold performance, and consequently
no bonuses are payable for 2013. Directors’ interests

i) Under the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan (“DSBP”), introduced in 2012, 30% of any bonus awarded (providing the bonus is above £30,000) is deferred in shares for one year.
These awards relate to the deferral of the 2012 bonus into shares. The awards were granted on 11 April 2013. The share price on the date of grant was 171.5p and the face values of
the awards were £33,075 for Don Kenny and £24,151 for Alan Merrell, equivalent to 10.5% of base salary.
ii) The awards are subject to a malus provision which means that the awards will lapse if there is a deterioration in EBITA and/or ROCE over the deferral period. This minimum level of
financial performance was not achieved and consequently the awards will lapse on 11 April 2014.

Deferred Share Bonus Plan
The awards granted and vesting under this Plan to the executive directors are detailed in the table below.
Directors’ interests
The interests of the directors in the
ordinary share capital of the Company are
shown below.
On 4 March 2013, Jan Åstrand sold 56,983
ordinary shares in the Company at a price
of 174.5 pence per share. On 1 May 2013,
Alan Merrell increased his shareholding by
retaining 32,238 ordinary shares in the
Company following the vesting and exercise
of his 2010 LTIP awards.
It is the Company’s policy that executive
directors should build a shareholding in the
Company, over time, equal to 100% of
annual salary to facilitate the alignment of

Company performance
The chart opposite shows the Company’s
performance, measured by ‘Total
Shareholder Return’ (TSR), compared to
the FTSE Small Cap Index excluding
Investment Trusts (the ‘Index’) for the five
years ended 31 December 2013. The
Company considers the Index to be the
most meaningful comparison of historic
share price performance in assessing
the Company against an index of
similarly sized businesses.
Historic CEO pay
The table opposite shows the total
remuneration for the person holding the
role of Chief Executive over the same
five year period.
Percentage change in
remuneration of director
undertaking the role of
chief executive officer
The table opposite shows the movement
in the salary, benefits and annual bonus
for the Chief Executive between the
current and previous financial year
compared to that for the average UK
employee. The Committee feels that this
provides a more appropriate comparator
than movements in the wage bill for the
total workforce, which is distorted by
movements in the number of employees
and variations in wage practices in our
overseas markets.
i) Kevin Appleton left employment with effect from 30 June 2011, and under the terms of his contact, he was entitled to
receive a termination payment, after mitigation, of £312,000. In addition to Kevin Appleton’s termination payment of
£312,000, the Committee determined that awards over 136,500 shares in the Company, previously granted under
the Company’s 2006 Long-Term Incentive Plan in 2010, would vest on the date of cessation of his employment.
These awards were exercised on 9 August 2011 and had a value, on exercise, of £136,500. Both the termination
payment of £312,000 and the value of the LTIP award of £136,500 are included in the Total Remuneration figure of
£623,000 shown in the above table.
ii) Don Kenny was appointed on 1 October 2011.
iii) The performance period for the 2011 LTIP award ended in December 2013 and the award vested at 100%.
Note on issue of equity in 2009
The above graph has not been adjusted to eliminate the impact of the dilutive equity issue in December 2009.
i) Of the bonus of £110,000 awarded to Don Kenny in 2012, £33,000 was party paid in the form of deferred shares.
The deferred shares are subject to a malus clause which means that the shares lapse if there has been deterioration in
EBITA and/or ROCE over the deferral period. This minimum financial performance was not achieved, therefore the shares
will lapse. The value of the shares is shown at the grant date share price. Relative importance of
the spend on pay
A comparison of total employee pay
against the Group’s profit after tax and
distributions through dividends to
shareholders, for 2013 against 2012,
is set out in the graphs opposite.
Application of the
remuneration policy for 2014
Base salaries for the executive directors
were reviewed in January 2014 and it was
agreed that salaries for the year should
remain at £324,450 for Don Kenny and
£237,000 for Alan Merrell. It was also
agreed that fees for the Chairman and
Non-Executive Directors should remain
at £104,000 and £43,775 respectively.
The annual bonus scheme for executive
directors in 2014 will again be based on
a combination of financial targets and
corporate/personal objectives. The forward
looking targets are deemed to be
commercially sensitive but retrospective
disclosure will be given in 2014’s
Remuneration Committee Report.
The proposed performance conditions
for the 2014 LTIP award will be a
combination of a relative total shareholder
return measure and a return on capital
employed measure. The TSR targets will
be the same as those set for the 2013
award and the ROCE targets are yet to
be determined but will be disclosed at
the time of grant of the 2014 awards.
The intended grant level is 100% of salary.
The executive directors have agreed to
retain any shares (net-of-tax) received
under the 2014 LTIP award for a six
month period post vesting.

Corporate responsibility report
Our impact
During May 2014 our Belgium operation, dk rental, will relocate 
to a new purpose built head office which contains a number 
of energy efficient technologies, including extensive photovoltaic
roof panels, visible in the image above. Introduction
Lavendon Group is committed to growing 
a strong corporate responsibility (“CR”) 
ethic in its operations worldwide. 
The introduction of new Green House Gas
(“GHG”) reporting legislation has provided 
an opportunity to revisit some of our CR
programmes and redefine the goals and
objectives for the future. We have also
created a number of new Key Performance
Indicators (KPI’s) which will be used 
to monitor our performance against 
those objectives.
2013 also saw the launch of the Lavendon
strategy “Your safety our priority”. This
innovative customer focused initiative
outlined our commitment to ensuring that
safety is our number one priority and that
Lavendon will be at the forefront in the
provision of safe access solutions in the
markets we serve.
Leadership
To help focus the CR agenda across the
business units, the Group’s Health & Safety
Centre of Excellence team have been
appointed to develop and drive both local
and Group wide CR initiatives. The team
comprises of a qualified health and safety
representative from each of our major
regions of operation. The team and its 
CR activities are directly sponsored by a
member of the Group’s Executive Team. 
Mandatory GHG reporting
To facilitate and aide the data collection 
and consolidation to meet the new GHG
reporting requirements, Lavendon has
retained the services of a third party
supplier, Ecometrica. A web based facility
for recording GHG emission related data
using appropriate conversion tables 
and country specific emission ratios that 
have been independently audited by
PricewaterhouseCoopers. Ecometrica also
review and verify the input data against
supporting documentation.
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Lavendon Group plc 2013   55
We recognise that a successful Corporate
Responsibility strategy relies upon the
engagement of our workforce to
promote and develop the programme.
One of the principle methods for
engagement across Lavendon has been
“Team Talk” This regular briefing is
delivered through face to face meetings
with managers and employees on 
a monthly basis.

Methodology
We have reported on all of the emission
sources required under the Companies Act
2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’
Reports) Regulations 2013. 
The method we have used to calculate GHG
emissions is the GHG Protocol Corporate
Accounting and Reporting Standard (revised
edition), together with the latest emission
factors from recognised public sources
including, but not limited to, Defra, the
International Energy Agency, the US Energy
Information Administration, the US
Environmental Protection Agency and the
Intergovernmental panel on Climate Change.
Limitations to data collection
For several activities data was not
obtainable and therefore had to be
excluded from the assessment. 
United Kingdom 
For the sites Blackburn, Cardiff, Dundee,
Edinburgh, Kent, Leicester, London West,
and Southampton water consumption data
was unavailable and have therefore been
excluded as data was unavailable.
Germany
For the sites Braunschweig, BASF Implant,
and Bayer Implant natural gas, electricity
and water consumption data was
unavailable and have therefore been
excluded from the assessment.
For the Dortmund site natural gas and
water consumption data was unavailable
and have therefore been excluded from
the assessment. 
Middle East
Third-party road freight and oil disposal for
the Middle East has been excluded as data
was not available.
Battery recycling at Middle East sites, except
for Oman, has been excluded as data was
not available.
Scopes 
The GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting
and Reporting Standard (revised edition)
dictates to report the GHG emissions by
scopes 1, 2 and 3. The table below sets 
out scope of our reporting. 
Reporting of scope 3 activities is optional.
However, these activities can contribute 
a significant portion of overall emissions
and it is therefore decided to report these
where applicable.
56   Lavendon Group plc 2013

SCOPE 1: Direct emissions
SCOPE 2: Indirect emissions
SCOPE 3: Other emissions Environment
As a consequence of the GHG report
project, we now have detailed emissions
data for all regions and in some areas down
to depot level. The information gained 
from the project is already being used to
compare like for like locations across the
Group with regard to their energy efficiency.
We will also use the data obtained in setting
and measuring performance against
strategic reduction targets, to lower our
GHG emissions in the future. 
As part of our normal business operations
we may move our depot locations to better
serve our customers. This also presents 
the opportunity to improve the quality of
our facilities and at the same time to
upgrade lighting, heating, and cooling with
more energy efficient alternatives, saving
both energy related emissions and cost. 
As shown on page 54, our Belgium
operation is moving into a new purpose
built combined head office and depot.
These premises are leading the way with
energy generating solar panels combined
with a modern build thermally efficient
building. The panels can generate up to
9KwH at peak meeting a significant
proportion of the depots electricity needs.
Another use of technology that is being
actively used to help reduce our impact 
on the environment is video conferencing.
By eliminating the need to travel, video
conferencing is reducing our emissions and
at the same time reducing our costs. During
2013, the Group Executive Team have saved
an estimated 82,000 miles of business travel 
or circa 53 tonnes of CO
2
e through the use 
of video conferencing technology. We are
now looking to expand the use of video
conferencing more widely during 2014.
We recognise that a large proportion of the
emissions we produce is associated with
the transportation of our equipment to 
and from the customer sites. In order 
to ensure we remain at the forefront of
available technology we have recently
trialled in-cab telematics devices for our 
UK delivery fleet. This technology provides
detailed information to both the driver 
and the transport department on a range
of measures including fuel efficiency,
braking and acceleration habits, and routing
efficiency. During 2014 the telematics
system will be rolled out across all the
delivery fleet in the UK, which combined
with additional staff training on fuel efficient
driving should allow us to reduce related
fuel consumption by 5%-10%. 
Community
Across the Group our business units
continue to develop ties with their local
communities. In 2013 this led to work
experience schemes running in a number
of locations across the Group. 
A volunteering scheme in place in the UK
allows employees to take up to two days
paid leave per annum whilst volunteering
for a charity or good cause. A number of
staff from the UK could be found working 
in a soup kitchen close to our Lutterworth
headquarters during Health, Safety and
Sustainability week.
In addition to the above the Group made
charitable financial donations of £18,000
(2012: £28,000) during the year to a wide
range of deserving charities. 
One charitable initiative in support of the
British Heart Foundation, involved teams 
of employees volunteering to record the
number of steps taken via a pedometer
device over a one month period. As well 
as raising money for the foundation it also
raised awareness of the importance of
regular exercise, even if only walking, among
the workforce. This resulted in an incredible
total of over 33 million steps being
recorded by the 180 entrants. 
                                                                                                                                                                                                                      Lavendon Group plc 2013   57

Marketplace
Our customers are at the heart of everything
we do and we recognise our responsibilities
in working closely with them to develop 
and share best practice when using 
powered access equipment. As an example,
during 2013 the Group hosted over 100
complimentary powered access workshops
with customers to share best practice. 
During the Group’s Health, Safety and
Sustainability week, customer “Working 
at Height” events were held in both the 
UK and Germany. These events proved 
very successful and were attended by
representatives from over 100 different
customers. Their aim was to provide
customers with a forum to keep up to 
date with the latest innovations and safe 
working practices.
Lavendon also continues to support the
International Powered Access Federation
(IPAF). This body is the leading non-profit
organisation for the promotion, development
and safe use of powered access equipment
worldwide. A number of Lavendon Group
employees hold seats on its International
Council and the newly formed UK Council.
Lavendon is also represented on all the
IPAF UK committees and aims to play an
influential role in the industry. 
Recently Lavendon has lead the way in 
the development of the “Pal+” training
which has been specifically developed for
operators working with Powered Access 
in difficult and challenging conditions. 
2013 was a successful year for our BlueSky
Solutions business. This business develops
safety enhancing and efficiency improving
devices for our customers. The SkySiren
secondary guarding device which was
developed in response to a need from our
customers to prevent operator entrapment
when using powered access booms. 
We achieved over 100,000 hire days 
during 2013.
Another success was the SkySentry device.
The product is designed to remotely secure
machines from unauthorised use and 
at the same time monitor and display
information on machine use. For the first
time, this product enables a customer to
have full control over their hired in plant. The
full utilisation of this equipment means that
customers can realise benefits in health and
safety, cost efficiency, emissions reduction
and a reduction in community disruption as
the number of hires, delivery and collection
can be better controlled by the site. On the
London St Bartholomew’s Hospital we 
saw over 140 SkySentry units fitted to our
powered access platforms. The success 
of the SkySentry led to the Construction
Director commenting “The introduction 
of the SkySentry has been an outstanding
example of how new technology can be
quickly, conveniently and cost-effectively
used to maintain high safety standards
through innovation, whilst also tying into
our key aims surrounding sustainability.”
Workplace
Our employees are the key to the successful
delivery of our CR agenda. We recognise 
our responsibilities as an industry leader 
in providing safe access solutions to our
customers and have continued to invest 
in our rental fleet, premises and employees
to ensure that we are on course to meet 
our objectives. 
All Lavendon business units now have 
a full time dedicated health and safety
professional in post. Lavendon have
expanded our KPI’s to include an accident
frequency rate (AFR). The AFR is used to
monitor our performance with regard to
“lost time” accidents requiring an employee
or contractors to three or more days off
from work as a result. In a year where 
the number of accidents reported has
increased due to an improved reporting
culture in our business we are pleased 
to announce that we beat our target of 
0.70 accidents per 100,000 hours worked,
achieving 0.69.
The UK invested in upgrading the
transport fleet during the year. New tractor
units were fitted with the latest driver and
road user safety aids such as blind spot
and rear view cameras, improved lighting
for loading during poor lighting conditions
and fall protection walkways and edge
protection to prevent falls from the trailer
when working on the bed of the trailer.
The improvements have allowed it to
achieve the Transport for London Freight
Operator Recognition Scheme (FORS)
Bronze award. 
During 2013 the Group’s achievements
received industry recognition, when
Lavendon received a number of awards for
health & safety excellence and innovation. 
In the UK, Nationwide Platforms received 
the prestigious SHP IOSH award for Best
Achievement in Transport and Logistics. 
The award was attributed to the businesses
for establishing a best practice blueprint
which would significantly reduce lost time,
58   Lavendon Group plc 2013 near miss and first aid incidents both on the
road and at delivery and loading sites. At the
same event, Peter Douglas, UK Operations
Director also received the Achiever of the
Year award. The UK has maintained its
ROSPA Gold status for the 4th consecutive
year as well as achieving successes in the
International Awards for Powered Access
Awards (IAPA) among others. 
Gardemann our German operation, joined
the UK in achieving the international
standard for Health and Safety
Management Systems (OHSAS 18001) and
in Belgium dk Rental retained their VCA*, 
Q-for accreditation.
In the autumn, a Health and Safety Week
was held across all Lavendon territories. 
It was extended in the UK and Middle East
to include Sustainability. This was the second
year that the event was run aiming to build
on the awareness of health and safety
within our organisation. Across the Group
over 50 initiatives were held ranging from
seminars & workshops on Personal
Protective Equipment to Health & Safety
quiz’s, and healthy eating campaigns.
Through the Lavendon Tech-X scheme we
have seen facilities continue to improve
across the Group. This has helped provide
industry leading facilities and improve
quality and reliability of our machines. 
Our engineering apprenticeship scheme 
is now in its 15th year and continues our
commitment to develop young people. It also
provides the business with excellent young
engineers who hold nationally recognised
qualifications whilst also schooled in the
Lavendon way of working. One of our
engineering apprentices won the UK national
award for Access Plant Mechanic of the year,
and two further apprentices were short listed
for the award. The winning apprentice went
on to be short listed for the construction news
award for the National Apprentice of the Year.
Employee gender diversity
Our people are instrumental to our success;
we respect and value the individuality and
diversity that every employee brings to the
business. We seek to create a positive, open
and fair working environment wherever 
we operate.
As at 31 December 2013 our Group
workforce of 1,644 comprised of 319 female
and 1,325 male staff. Included in the above
are 44 senior management positions, which
were occupied by 8 female and 36 male staff. 
Key Performance 
Indicators (KPI’s)
The group monitors progress against its 
CR agenda by reference to a number of
KPI’s shown below.
The Group has set itself challenging
objectives to strive towards which will
provide a framework for continual
improvement across the CR spectrum.
Summary
With the integration of CR within the
established Health and Safety Centre of
Excellence the business believes it has
established the opportunity to develop 
a truly Group wide approach to CR, whilst
recognising cultural differences between
regions. The processes and initiatives
already implemented across the Group 
also promote best practice for our
employees and delivering an improved
customer experience.

In our opinion the Group financial statements, defined below:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2013 and of the Group’s profit and cash flows for the
year then ended;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say in the remainder of this report.
What we have audited
The Group financial statements, which are prepared by Lavendon Group Plc, comprise:
• the Group balance sheet as at 31 December 2013;
• the Group income statement and statement of comprehensive income for the year then ended;
• the Group statement of cash flows and the Group statement of changes in equity for the year then ended; and
• the notes to the Group financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the
European Union.
Certain disclosures required by the financial reporting framework have been presented elsewhere in the Annual Report, rather than in
the notes to the financial statements. These are cross-referenced from the financial statements and are identified as audited.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (ISAs (UK & Ireland)). An audit involves
obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the “Annual Report” to identify material inconsistencies with the
audited Group financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Overview of our audit approach
Materiality
We set certain thresholds for materiality. These helped us to determine the nature, timing and extent of our audit procedures and to
evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole.
Based on our professional judgment, we determined materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole to be £1.7 million.
This is based on 5% of underlying operating profit, being operating profit before amortisation on acquired intangibles and exceptional
items. We consider this to be the key financial benchmark of the business.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.1m as well
as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.
Overview of the scope of our audit
The Group has 6 operating segments, as shown in note 2 in the notes to the financial statements, being the geographical trading locations
of the UK, Germany, Belgium, France, the Middle East and the non trading Corporate head office. The Group financial statements are a
consolidation of a number of reporting units, that, together, account for the Group’s operating businesses, centralised functions and
other non-trading group entities.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we determined the type of work that needed to be performed at the reporting units
by us, as the Group engagement team, or component auditors from other PwC network firms operating under our instruction. Where the

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
work was performed by component auditors, we determined the level of involvement we needed to have in the audit work at those
reporting units to be able to conclude whether sufficient appropriate audit evidence had been obtained as a basis for our opinion on the
Group financial statements as a whole.
Accordingly, of the Group’s reporting units, we identified 5 (being Head Office, UK, Germany and the two financially largest reporting units
within the Middle East) that, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information, either due to their size or their risk
characteristics. These accounted for 82% of consolidated revenues and 92% of consolidated underlying operating profit. This, together
with additional procedures performed at the Group level, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the Group financial
statements as a whole.
Areas of particular audit focus
In preparing the financial statements, the directors made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant
accounting estimates that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. We primarily focused
our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own judgements, and evaluating
the disclosures in the financial statements.
In our audit, we tested and examined information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we considered necessary
to provide a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtained audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls,
substantive procedures or a combination of both.
We considered the following areas to be those that required particular focus in the current year. This is not a complete list of all risks or
areas of audit focus identified by our audit. We discussed these areas of focus with the Audit Committee. Their report on those matters
that they considered to be significant issues in relation to the financial statements is set out on pages 39 to 41 of the Annual Report.
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Recoverability of Middle East
accounts receivable
We focused on this area because the Middle East
accounts receivable balance includes a significant
amount of overdue debt. Accordingly management
have had to exercise a significant degree of
judgement regarding the recoverability of
accounts receivables.
• We tested the ageing of accounts receivable in the Middle East by agreeing
outstanding amounts to sales invoices and other supporting documentation.
• We assessed the Board approved provisioning policy specific for Middle East
receivables and challenged the assumptions therein by comparing the
directors’ judgements surrounding the recoverability of individual balances to
post year end cash collections, an assessment on the current status of key
accounts and historical cash recovery for customers in the Middle East.
Classification of expenditure as exceptional
We focused on this area because the decision to
classify items of expenditure as exceptional is
inherently judgemental and is considered
material in the context of the Group’s financial
statements due to the presentation of underlying
and non-underlying results on the face of the
Group income statement.
• We agreed items of expenditure to supporting documentation to confirm that
their classification (either as exceptional or non-exceptional) was consistent
with the accounting policy set out in note 1 to the financial statements.
• We challenged the judgements made by the directors, by forming our
own expectation of the appropriate classification and compared it to that
of the directors.
Goodwill impairment assessment
The Group hold a significant amount of
goodwill that is required to be tested for
impairment annually.
We focused on this area because the
determination of whether or not an impairment
charge for goodwill was necessary involved
significant judgements about the future results
of the business.
• We evaluated the directors’ future cash flow forecasts, and the process by
which they were drawn up, including comparing them to the latest Board
approved budgets and testing the integrity of the underlying calculations.
• We challenged the key assumptions being:
1. The long term growth rates and profit margins in the forecast by comparing
them to economic forecasts and historical results respectively; and
2. The discount rate by comparing the cost of capital for the company and
comparable organisations.
• We also performed sensitivity analysis on the key financial assumptions of the
cash flow forecasts. Having ascertained the extent of change in those
assumptions that either individually or collectively would be required for the
goodwill to be impaired, we considered the likelihood of such a movement in
those key assumptions arising.
• We considered the appropriateness of the disclosures made by management
in relation to the sensitivities on goodwill held in Germany and Belgium in the
context of the requirement of IAS 36. Going Concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 38, in relation to going concern. We have
nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the Group’s financial statements using
the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group has adequate resources to remain in operation,
and that the directors intend it to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were signed. As part of our audit we
have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to
continue as a going concern.
Opinions on matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group financial statements are
prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements; and
• the information given in the Corporate Governance Statement set out on pages 36 to 38 in the Annual Report with respect to internal
control and risk management systems and about share capital structures is consistent with the financial statements.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion we have not received all the information and
explanations we require for our audit. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified
by law have not been made, and under the Listing Rules we are required to review certain elements of the report to shareholders by the
Board on directors’ remuneration. We have no exceptions to report arising from these responsibilities.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Companies Act 2006, we are required to report to you if, in our opinion a corporate governance statement has not been
prepared by the Parent Company. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Parent Company’s
compliance with nine provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (‘the Code’). We have nothing to report having performed our review.

Continued
Area of focus How the scope of our audit addressed the area of focus
Fraud in revenue recognition 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) presume there is a risk of
fraud in revenue recognition because of the
pressure management may feel to achieve the
planned results.
• We tested the reconciliations between the revenue systems used by the Group
and its financial ledgers and journal entries posted to revenue accounts to
identify unusual or irregular items.
• We agreed revenue transactions to cash receipt or other supporting
documentation and assessed that revenue was recognised in line with the
revenue recognition policies detailed in note 1 of the financial statements.
• We evaluated the relevant IT systems and internal controls surrounding the
recognition of the revenue.
Risk of management override
of internal controls 
ISAs (UK & Ireland) require that we consider this.
• We assessed the overall control environment of the Group, including the
arrangements for staff to “whistle-blow” inappropriate actions, and interviewed
senior management and the Groups internal audit function regarding their
scope and findings.
• We examined the significant accounting estimates and judgements relevant to
the financial statements for evidence of bias by the directors that may
represent a risk of material misstatement or fraud. In addition, we tested
manual journal entries based on certain risk criteria, including size and nature.

1.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General information
Lavendon Group plc (‘the Company’ or with its subsidiaries ‘the Group’) is the European and Middle Eastern market leader in the rental of
powered access equipment operating a fleet of approximately 20,000 machines through a network of 76 active depots located in Belgium,
France, Germany, the UK and a number of countries in the Middle East.
The Company is a public limited company which is listed on the London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled in the UK.
The address of the registered office is 15 Midland Court, Central Park, Lutterworth, Leicestershire LE17 4PN.
Basis of preparation
The Group financial statements have been prepared in accordance with EU endorsed International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS’s”)
and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. The Group
financial statements have been prepared, on a going concern basis, on a consistent basis, under the historical cost convention as modified
by financial assets and liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value through the profit or loss. A summary of the more significant
Group accounting policies is set out below.
The Parent Company has not adopted International Financial Reporting Standards. Its results, reported under UK GAAP , are detailed on
pages 97 to 103.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with International Financial Reporting Standards requires the use of estimates and
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of the amount,
event or actions, actual results ultimately may differ from those estimates.
Consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. All material
intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. Consistent accounting policies have been
adopted across the Group.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is
measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange.
Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair
values at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded
as goodwill. Acquisition costs are expensed as incurred.
Subsidiary undertakings include all entities where a controlling interest is held by the Group or, in the case of the Middle East, where the Group
has the right to give directions with respect to the operating and financial policies and as a result is considered to have control of the entities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective
date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Details of the principal subsidiaries of the Group are given in note 4 of the Parent Company financial statements on pages 99 and 100.
Impact of new accounting standards
The following standards have been adopted by the Group for the first time for the financial year ending 31 December 2013 and have a
material impact on the Group:
• Amendment to IAS 1 ‘Financial statement presentation’
The main change resulting from this amendment is a requirement for entities to group items presented in ‘other comprehensive income’
on the basis of whether they are potentially reclassable to profit or loss subsequently (reclassification adjustments).
A number of new standards and amendments to standards and interpretations are effective for annual periods beginning on or after
1 January 2013 that would not be expected to have a material impact on the Group:
• IAS 12 ‘Income taxes’
• IAS 19 (Revised) ‘Employee benefits’
• IFRS 13, ‘Fair value measurement’
• Amendment to IFRS 1 on hyperinflation and fixed dates
• Amendment to IFRS 1, ’First time adoption’ on government grants
• Amendments to IFRS 7 on Financial instruments asset and liability offsetting
• Annual improvements 2011
• IFRIC 20 ‘Stripping costs in the production phase of a surface mine’

1.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
As of the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following standards were in issue but not yet endorsed by the EU.
These standards were available for early adoption but the Group has not applied these standards in the preparation of the financial
statements. Adoption of these standards is not expected to have a material impact on the Group:
• IFRS 10, ‘Consolidated financial statements’ (effective 1 January 2013) (endorsed by EU 1 January 2014)
• IFRS 11, ‘Joint arrangements’ (effective 1 January 2013) (endorsed by EU 1 January 2014)
• IFRS 12, ‘Disclosures of interests in other entities’ (effective 1 January 2013) (endorsed by EU 1 January 2014)
• IAS 27 (revised 2011) ‘Separate financial statements’ (effective 1 January 2013) (endorsed by EU 1 January 2014)
• IAS 28 (revised 2011) ‘Associates and joint ventures’ (effective 1 January 2013) (endorsed by EU 1 January 2014)
• Amendments to IFRS 10, 11 and 12 on transition guidance (effective 1 January 2013) (endorsed by EU 1 January 2014)
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and
services provided to customers outside of the Group, stated net of returns and value added and other sales taxes.
Revenue from rental fleet hire is recognised on a daily basis over the period of hire when the Group can reliably measure the likely flow
of economic benefits. Other revenue, including the sale of new and ex-rental fleet equipment, is recognised as at the point at which the
goods or services are delivered to and accepted by the customer.
The Group rents equipment under short term arrangements that are cancellable by the customer on demand. These are treated as
operating lease arrangements.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision-maker.
The chief operating decision-maker, who is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments,
has been identified as the Group Board.
The operating segments are the main geographic areas in which the Group operates together with one non operating corporate cost
centre. The Group’s main geographic areas are the United Kingdom, Belgium, France, Germany and the Middle East.
Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentational currency. Items
included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic environment
in which the entity operates (the functional currency).
Transactions and balances
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of the transaction. At each balance sheet date,
monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the exchange rate prevailing at the balance sheet date.
Translation differences on monetary items are taken to the income statement with the exception of differences on transactions that are
subject to effective cash flow or net investment hedges which are recorded in equity. Translation differences on non-monetary items are
reported as part of the fair value gain or loss and are included in either equity or the income statement as appropriate.
Group companies
The results and financial position of overseas Group entities are translated into Sterling as follows:
• assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the date of that balance sheet; and
• income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rate for the period.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, where effective, are taken to equity. Tax charges and credits attributable
to those exchange differences are also taken directly to equity. When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences are recognised
in the income statement as part of the gain or loss on sale. Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign
entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign entity and are translated at the closing rate.
Financial instruments
The Group classifies its financial instruments in the following categories: financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss,
loans and receivables and other liabilities at amortised cost. The classification depends on the purpose for which the financial instruments
were acquired. Management determines the classification of its financial instruments at initial recognition and re-evaluates this position
at each reporting date. 1.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss
Financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss include financial instruments held for trading and those assets designated
at fair value through profit or loss. A financial instrument is classified in this category if it is acquired principally for the purpose of selling
or repurchasing in the short term or if it is a financial instrument so designated by management on initial recognition. Derivative financial
instruments are included as held for trading unless they are designated as hedges. Items in this category are classified as current assets
or current liabilities if they are either held for trading or are expected to be realised within 12 months of the balance sheet date.
Loans and receivables and other liabilities at amortised cost
Loans and receivables and other liabilities at amortised costs are non-derivative financial instruments with fixed or determinable payments
that are not quoted in an active market. Loans and receivables arise when the Group provides money, goods or services directly to a
debtor with no intention of trading the receivable. They are initially measured at fair value. Other liabilities at amortised cost are initially
recognised at fair value. They are included in current liabilities, except for those with maturities greater than 12 months after the balance
sheet date, which are classified as non-current liabilities.
Gains and losses arising from changes in the fair value of financial assets and liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are included in
the income statement in the period in which they arise. Loans and receivables and other liabilities are carried at amortised cost using the
effective interest rate method.
The Group assesses at each balance sheet date whether there is objective evidence that a financial asset or a group of financial assets is
impaired. Impairments of such financial assets are recorded in the income statement.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are amounts due from customers for equipment rental or other products or services performed in the ordinary course
of business. If collection is expected in one year or less they are classified as current assets. If not, they are classified as non-current assets.
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate
method, less provision for impairment.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect
all amounts due according to the original terms of receivables. The amount of the provision is recognised in the income statement.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the
redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for issue costs. Issue costs arising from a modification of a
borrowing facility are amortised over the period of the borrowing or until the facility is considered to be “extinguished” at which point any
unamortised costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs associated with the re-negotiation of an existing facility,
that are not separately identifiable, are treated as an extinguishment and are recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivative financial instruments are recognised at fair value on the date a contract is entered into and are subsequently re-measured at
their fair value at each balance sheet date.
The method of recognising the resulting gain or loss depends on whether the derivative financial instrument is designated as a hedging
instrument, and if so, the nature of the item being hedged. The Group designates certain derivative financial instruments as:
• cash flow hedges – hedges of floating interest rate transactions; or
• net investment hedges – hedges of net investments in foreign operations.
The Group documents the relationship between hedging instruments and hedged items at the hedge inception, as well as its risk
management objective and strategy for undertaking various hedge transactions. The Group also documents its assessment, both at hedge
inception and on an ongoing basis, of whether the derivative financial instruments that are used in hedging transactions are highly effective
in offsetting changes in fair values or cash flows of hedged items. Movements on the hedging reserves in equity are shown in the Group
statement of changes in equity.
Cash flow hedges
The effective portion of changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and qualify as cash flow hedges
are recognised in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement.

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
1.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Accounting for derivative financial instruments and hedging activities continued
Amounts accumulated in equity are recycled in the income statement in the periods when the hedged item will affect profit or loss (for
instance when the forecast sale that is hedged takes place). However, when the forecast transaction that is hedged results in the
recognition of a non-financial asset or a liability, the gains and losses previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included
in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset or liability. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur,
the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Net investment hedges
Any gain or loss on the hedging instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge of a net investment in a foreign operation is
recognised in equity; the gain or loss relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. Gains and
losses accumulated in equity are included in the income statement when the foreign operation is disposed of.
Non-hedging derivatives
Changes in the fair value of any derivative financial instrument that does not qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in
the income statement.
Fair value estimation
The fair value of financial instruments traded in organised active financial markets is based on quoted market prices at the close of
business on the balance sheet date. Financial assets held by the Group are valued on a mark to market basis by financial institutions.
The fair value of financial instruments for which there is no quoted market price is determined by a variety of methods incorporating
assumptions that are based on market conditions existing at each balance sheet date. Quoted market prices or dealer quotes for similar
instruments are used for long-term debt. Other techniques, such as estimated discounted cash flows, are used to determine fair value for
the remaining financial instruments.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is calculated as the present value of the estimated future cash flows. The nominal value less estimated
credit adjustments of trade receivables and payables are assumed to approximate to their fair values. The fair value of financial liabilities is
estimated by discounting the future contractual cash flows at the current market interest rate that is available to the Group for similar
financial instruments.
Leases
Finance leases
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group has substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
leases. Finance leases are capitalised at the lease inception at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value of the
minimum lease payments. Each lease payment is allocated between the liability and finance charges so as to achieve a constant rate on the
finance balance outstanding. The corresponding rental obligations, net of finance charges, are included in financial liabilities – borrowings.
The interest element of the finance cost is charged to the income statement over the lease period so as to produce a constant periodic
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability for each period. Property, plant and equipment acquired under finance leases are
depreciated over the shorter of the useful life of the asset and its lease term.
Operating leases
Leases in which a significant portion of the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as operating leases.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the period of the lease.
Incentives from lessors are recognised as a systematic reduction of the charge over the periods benefiting from the incentives.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when:
• the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events; and
• it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation; and
• the amount has been reliably estimated.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. Where there are a number of similar obligations, the likelihood that an outflow
will be required in settlement is determined by considering the class of obligations as a whole. A provision is recognised even if the
likelihood of an outflow with respect to any one item included in the same class of obligations may be small. Provisions are recorded
separately in the financial statements where material. 1.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Provisions continued
If the effect of the time value of money is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax
rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Where discounting is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as a finance expense.
Where the Group expects amounts to be received in relation to a provision, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset when
its receipt is considered certain.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairments in value. Cost includes
the initial purchase price of the asset and any directly attributable costs of bringing it into its intended use. Additional transportation costs
incurred to move existing fleet between operating segments are expensed in the year in which they are incurred. Depreciation is provided
on a straight-line basis to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value, of property, plant and equipment over their estimated
useful lives. Estimated useful lives and residual values are as follows:
Useful lives Residual values
Short leasehold properties the lease period nil
Rental fleet 7 to 13 years 5-20%
Office fixtures and equipment 7 to 13 years nil
Motor vehicles 3 to 5 years nil
Residual values and useful economic lives are reassessed annually.
Goodwill
Goodwill is the excess of the fair value of the consideration payable for an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of identifiable
net assets of a subsidiary acquired at the date of acquisition. Fair values are attributed to the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent
liabilities that existed at the date of acquisition, reflecting their condition at that date. Adjustments are made where necessary to bring the
accounting policies of acquired businesses into alignment with those of the Group.
Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there
are indications that goodwill might be impaired. An impairment charge is recognised for any amount by which the carrying value of goodwill
exceeds its fair value.
Gains and losses on the disposal of an entity include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold, allocated where necessary
on the basis of relative fair value.
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment. Other intangible assets acquired as part of an
acquisition of a business are capitalised separately from goodwill, if those assets are separable and their fair value can be measured
reliably. Intangible assets acquired separately from the acquisition of a business are capitalised at cost.
Certain costs incurred in the developmental phase of an internal project are capitalised as intangible assets provided that a number of criteria
are satisfied. These include the technical feasibility of completing the asset so that it is available for use or sale, the availability of adequate
resources to complete the development and to use or sell the asset and how the asset will generate probable future economic benefit.
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition
Intangible assets recognised on acquisition are detailed in note 12. They are estimated to have asset lives in the range of 1 to 6 years and
are amortised on a straight-line basis accordingly.
Computer software
Acquired computer software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring to use the specific software.
Computer software licences are held at cost and are amortised on a straight line basis over 3 to 5 years.
Costs that are directly associated with the production of identifiable and unique software products controlled by the Group, and that will
generate economic benefits beyond one year, are recognised as intangible assets. Computer software development costs recognised as
assets are amortised on a straight line basis over 3 to 5 years. Costs associated with maintaining computer software programmes are
recognised as an expense as incurred.
Intellectual property
Intellectual property comprises trademarks and patents which are initially recognised at cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis
over a period of up to 5 years.

Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements
1.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Impairment of property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other intangible assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation but are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to
depreciation or amortisation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating units). In
assessing the value in use, the estimated future cash flows of the cash generating units are discounted to their present value using a
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and associated risks.
The directors consider that a cash generating unit is generally an individual country of operation.
Employee benefit costs
The Group operates several defined contribution pension schemes, the assets of which are held separately from those of the Group.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into an independently administered fund.
The Group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all
employees the benefits relating to employee service in the current and prior periods. The cost of providing these benefits, recognised in
the income statement, comprises the amount of contributions payable to the schemes in respect of the year.
Following the acquisition of the Gardemann group of companies in 2006, the Group now has an obligation to a single ex-employee of the
Gardemann group under a defined benefit pension scheme. The scheme is unfunded, but a full provision of £171,000 (2012: £158,000),
based on an actuarial valuation, is included in the Group’s balance sheet under accruals. Given the immateriality of this single obligation
to the Group as a whole, management do not consider the full disclosure required by IAS19 (revised) “Retirement Benefits” to be
appropriate in this instance.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Lavendon shareholders are recognised in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which the dividends
are approved, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Inventories
Inventories, comprising ex-rental fleet equipment available for sale, third party equipment purchased for resale, machine spare parts and
consumables, are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost basis used within the Group is a ‘First In First Out’ or FIFO
basis. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Ex-rental fleet disposals are transferred to inventory prior to external sale or scrappage.
Taxation including deferred tax
Provision for taxation is made at the current rate.
Deferred taxation is provided in full, using the liability method, on differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and
their carrying amounts in the consolidated financial statements. However, if the deferred taxation arises from initial recognition of an asset
or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable
profit or loss, it is not accounted for. Deferred taxation is calculated using tax rates that are expected to apply when the related deferred
taxation asset is realised or the deferred taxation liability is settled.
Deferred taxation assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the
amounts can be utilised.
Deferred taxation is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of
the reversal of the temporary difference is controlled by the Group, and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the
foreseeable future. 1.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Share based payments
The Group operates a number of equity settled, share based compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services received under
such plans is recognised as an expense in the income statement. Fair value is determined by use of the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model
for share option schemes and in the case of share matching plans and the long-term incentive plan, by use of a Monte Carlo simulation.
The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives, excluding the impact of
any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share
incentives that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are
expected to vest. The impact of the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding
adjustment to equity, over the remaining vesting period.
Share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over the Parent Company’s shares)
are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone financial statements of the Parent Company.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to employees of subsidiary undertakings in the Group is treated as a
capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised over
the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary undertaking, with a corresponding credit to equity. This does not have an
impact on the Group’s financial statements.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less and bank overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current liabilities on the Group
Balance Sheet. For the purposes of the Group cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents are as defined above, net of outstanding
bank overdrafts.
Key assumptions and estimates
Significant estimates have been used in respect of the calculation of the residual values of property, plant and equipment, the
calculation of any impairment to the carrying value of goodwill, the valuation of intangible assets recognised on acquisition, and the
trade receivables provision.
The residual values and useful lives of property, plant and equipment are estimated based on management’s historic experience of
disposals of such used equipment and their judgement of the current market conditions.
Goodwill is tested for impairment on an annual basis or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts of the goodwill are calculated on a discounted cash flow basis using estimating long-term growth rates and
appropriate discount rates, based on historic trends adjusted for management’s estimates of future prospects. Other intangible assets
are tested for impairment if there are indications they might be impaired. Full details of the assumptions used are given in note 12.
The fair value of intangibles recognised on acquisition is derived from a combination of previous knowledge, experience and consultation
with independent valuers.
The trade receivables provision is based on management’s best estimate of the recoverability of specific customer balances, after taking
into account the recent payment experience, underlying economic climate and discussions with key customers.
Equity settled share based payment schemes require management to estimate the fair value of each award at the grant date and estimate
the number of options expected to vest by adjusting for expected leavers. In making these assumptions management apply option pricing
models using externally obtainable actual and historic inputs where possible. The expected number of leavers is based on historic trends
and is adjusted based upon management’s judgement where considered appropriate.
Exceptional items
The Group defines exceptional items to be those that, by virtue of their nature, size or frequency, warrant separate disclosure in the
financial statements in order to better understand the underlying performance of the Group. These include, but are not limited to, costs
of reorganisation and restructuring, impairment of non-current assets, significant one-off financing costs and significant one-off claims.

2.   SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
The internal reporting arrangements for Lavendon Group plc comprises of five operating segments based on the geographical locations of
UK, Germany, Belgium, France and Middle East and one non operating Corporate cost centre. The Corporate cost centre comprises the
Group directorate, statutory compliance and Group functions and holds the Group’s bank borrowing facilities.
The Group’s chief operating decision maker (“CODM”) is the Group Board. The Group Board reviews the Group’s internal reporting in order
to monitor and assess performance of the operating segments for the purpose of making decisions about allocation of resources.
Performance is evaluated based on actual results compared to agreed targets and performance in prior periods.

Note
The depreciation charge shown for the Middle East operation includes rental equipment owned by the UK operation for the first half of the year, but which were
used by and costed to the Middle East operation. The inclusion of the depreciation charge in the Middle East more accurately reflects the commercial nature of the
arrangement and the reporting to the CODM. The associated assets were transferred to the Middle East in June 2012.
Inter segment trading has been eliminated in the analysis presented above, so that only trading between the Group and external third parties is represented.
The assets, liabilities and operating costs associated with BlueSky have been included within Corporate items, as it is believed that this is a more appropriate
allocation given its role as a Group function. The 2012 segmental analysis has restated to reflect this.

– current year 6,916 8,647
– adjustment in respect of prior years 57 341

– re-measurement of deferred tax due to change in UK tax rate (1,429) (1,074)
– adjustment in respect of prior years 287 444
– taxation movement on share based payments 115 (154)
Total deferred tax (2,607) (4,356)
Taxation charge 4,366 4,632
The taxation charge on the underlying profit is £5,936,000, (2012: £6,388,000). The taxation credit on amortisation charges, exceptional
items and fair value movements on financial derivatives is £1,570,000 (2012: £1,756,000), see note 3.
In addition to the amount of taxation charged to the income statement, net tax of £55,000 (2012: £555,000) was credited directly to
reserves in respect of share based payments. This comprises a current tax credit of £608,000 (2012: £nil) in excess of the amount credited
to the income statement in respect of options exercised during the year and a deferred tax charge of £553,000 (2012: £555,000 credit)
representing the net reduction (2012: net increase) in the deferred tax asset held in respect of share based payments, which is in excess of
the charge (2012: credit) to the income statement.
No provision has been made in the financial statements for any tax liability which may arise upon future distributions of profit to the
United Kingdom from overseas subsidiaries.
Reconciliation of taxation
The tax charge for the year is lower (2012: lower) than the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 23.25% (2012: 24.50%).
The differences are explained below:
2013 2012
£’000 £’000
Profit before taxation 23,417 20,798
Profit at standard rate of corporation tax in the UK: 23.25% (2012: 24.50%) 5,444 5,096
Adjustments to tax in respect of prior years – current tax 57 341
Adjustments to tax in respect of prior years – deferred tax 287 444
Effect of overseas tax rates 434 700
Expenses not deductible for tax purposes 53 955
Additional tax losses recognised (732) (2,150)
Effect on deferred tax due to the tax rate change in the UK (1,429) (1,074)
Tax losses not recognised 252 368
Timing differences on which deferred tax is not provided – (48)
4,366 4,632
The standard rate of corporation tax in the UK changed from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013. Accordingly, the standard rate of corporation
tax applied to the Group’s UK profits for the accounting period is 23.25%.
The March 2013 UK Budget Announcement included further proposals to reduce the main rate of corporation tax to 21% from 1 April 2014
and 20% from 1 April 2015. These changes were substantively enacted on 2 July 2013 and are therefore reflected in the deferred tax
balances in these financial statements.

Under Long Term Incentive Plan and Approved Options 4.2
Diluted earnings per share 16,166 169.2 9.55p
Underlying earnings per share
Basic 21,174 165.0 12.83p
Diluted 21,174 169.2 12.51p
Earnings per share are calculated on the 167,014,501 weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue for the year ended
31 December 2013 (year ended 31 December 2012: 164,990,033).
Diluted earnings per share assumes conversion of all potential dilutive ordinary shares which arise from share incentive scheme
awards granted to employees, where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary share capital
during the year. The effect of this dilution is to increase the weighted average number of ordinary shares to 168,158,046 (year ended
31 December 2012: 169,167,889).
Underlying earnings per share is presented to exclude the impact of amortisation charges, exceptional items and movements in the fair
value of financial derivatives in the year and their associated tax effect. The directors believe that underlying earnings per share provides
additional relevant information about underlying business performance.

5,231 3,512
The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2013 of 2.40 pence per ordinary share
which will distribute an estimated £4,033,000 of shareholders’ funds. It will be paid on 30 April 2014 to those shareholders who are on the
register at 7 March 2014 subject to approval at the Company’s Annual General Meeting. 12. INTANGIBLE ASSETS

Goodwill acquired in a business combination was allocated, at date of acquisition, to the cash generating unit that benefited from that
business combination. The directors consider that a cash generating unit is generally an individual country of operation.
Where there is a change in the way the Group manages and operates, the goodwill allocation to individual cash generating units is
reviewed and reallocated where appropriate.

Total 78,384 77,728
Goodwill is tested annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. For the purpose of
determining potential goodwill impairment, recoverable amounts are determined from value in use calculations using cash flow projections
based on financial plans covering a three year period. The growth rate assumptions used in the plans are based on past performance and
management’s expectations of market developments. The growth rate assumptions used to determine the cash flows beyond the three
year period are 2% for UK and Germany and Belgium (2012: 2.25% for UK and Germany and 2% for Belgium). The pre-tax rate used to
discount the projected cash flows for Germany is 10% (2012: 11%) and for UK and Belgium are 11% (2012: 11% and 11.4% respectively). 
The impairment review for Belgium identified headroom of £5,941,000 (2012: £5,955,000) against the carrying value of the assets.
No additional impairment would be required for Belgium if any of the following were to occur: if the pre-tax rate used to discount the
projected cash flows increased by 1.5% to 12.5%, or if the long term growth assumption reduced by 2% to nil, or if projected earnings
before interest, taxation and amortisation in the periods beyond the initial three year period is reduced by 12%.
The impairment review for Germany identified headroom of £8,497,000 (2012: £33,371,000) against the carrying value of the assets.
No additional impairment would be required for Germany if any of the following were to occur: if the pre-tax rate used to discount the
projected cash flows increased by 1.2% to 11.2%, or if the long term growth assumption reduced by 1.5% to 0.5%, or if projected earnings
before interest, taxation and amortisation in the periods beyond the initial three year period is reduced by 6%.

22. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide
returns for shareholders, benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the overall cost of capital.
There were no changes in the Group’s approach to capital risk management during the year.
Consistent with other companies in the rental industry, the Group monitors capital by measuring the return on capital employed and the
ratio of net debt to equity:
2013 2012
£’000 £’000
Total borrowings (note 19) 117,836 111,012
Less: unamortised debt issue costs (note 19) (687) (820)
Less: cash and cash equivalents (note 16) (20,123) (13,667)
Net debt after unamortised debt issue costs 97,026 96,525
Total equity 211,165 196,832
Debt to equity ratio 46% 49%
Return on capital employed 10.6% 10.7%
The ratio of net debt to equity decreased during the year, due to the increase in total equity that was principally derived from profits
generated during the year. During the period the Group has complied with its banking covenants, and expects to remain compliant for
the foreseeable future.

22. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED
The Group has exposure to the following principal risks:
• market risk;
• credit risk; and
• liquidity risk.
The Group’s overall risk management policy aims to minimise the potential adverse effects of financial markets on the Group’s financial
performance. The Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out centrally by the Group except for customer credit risk which is the responsibility of each operational entity.
Market risk 1.
Market risk is the risk that the Group’s income, or its financial instruments, will be affected by changes in market prices, for example interest
rates or foreign exchange rates. The Group has exposure to interest rate risk on its financial liabilities. The risk is currently managed by
maintaining a proportion of borrowings at fixed interest rates, principally hire purchase and finance lease agreements and the loan placement
undertaken during 2012. Interest rate risk is presented in the Strategic Report on page 26.
The Group also has exposure to movements in foreign exchange rates. This risk is minimised through the use of foreign currency
borrowings and net investment hedging. The effect on the Group’s 2013 results due to movements in foreign exchange rates is presented
in the Strategic Report on page 18.
2. Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual
obligations. Such risk arises principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and cash and bank balances.
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is shown in the table below:
2013 2012
£’000 £’000
Cash and cash equivalents (note 16) 20,123 13,667
Trade and other receivables excluding prepayments (note 15) 54,402 51,249
74,525 64,916
Cash and cash equivalents
Surplus cash is held in current and deposit accounts with established financial institutions. All the financial institutions have at least a
Moody’s credit rating of Baa.
Trade and other receivables
The management of credit risk exposure to customers is the responsibility of each operation who have formal credit policies in place to
mitigate this risk. The credit policies require that the credit worthiness of a customer is assessed prior to trading and that the level of
exposure to that customer remains within agreed credit limits. To support these policies, the Group maintains certain levels of credit
insurance for its main operating subsidiaries.
The Group’s only exposure to concentrations of credit risk is to geographic and industry sector risk. As set out in the Strategic Report
on pages 8 and 25 the construction sector is an important market and particularly sensitive to pricing levels. This exposure is actively
managed with efforts being focused on widening the Group’s customer base to other sectors.
No individual customer makes up more than 3% of revenue (2012: 3%). 22. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT CONTINUED

Euros 15,384 13,484
Middle East currencies 18,347 16,706
54,402 51,249
3. Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group aims to achieve a balance
between certainty of funding and a flexible, cost effective borrowing structure. The Group has committed debt facilities of £100 million and
€60 million which finally mature in July 2016 and July 2019 respectively. This is supplemented by hire purchase and finance lease facilities.
The Group aims to ensure that there are sufficient funds or credit lines available to supplement cash flows generated from trading to meet
known obligations in the next twelve months. An analysis of liquidity risk, being the maturity of financial liabilities and the undrawn
committed borrowing facilities is presented in note 21.
The Group’s financial liabilities are analysed in note 20.

The movements in deferred tax assets and liabilities (prior to the offsetting of balances within the same jurisdiction as permitted by IAS 12)
during the year are shown in the table below. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are only offset where there is a legally enforceable right of
offset and there is an intention to settle the balances net.
During the year, a deferred tax asset has been recognised based on brought forward tax losses of £22,093,000 (2012: £23,498,000).
Deferred tax assets are recognised for tax loss carry-forwards to the extent that there is convincing evidence to support the realisation of
the related tax benefit through future profits is probable.
There are unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to trading losses in overseas operations. The losses which have not been recognised
amount to £22,190,000 (2012: £22,271,000). The tax values associated with these losses are £6,129,000 (2012: £6,154,000).

25. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS
The Group operates five equity settled compensation plans:
• the Lavendon Group 1996 Company Share Option Plan (the “Employee Scheme”);
• the Lavendon Group 1996 Unapproved Executive Share Option Scheme (the “Executive Scheme”);
• the Lavendon Group Share Matching Plan 2005 (the “Plan”);
• the Lavendon Group Long Term Incentive Plan (the “LTIP”); and
• the Lavendon Group Share Incentive Plan (the “SIP”).
The total charge for the year relating to the five equity settled compensation plans was £646,000 (2012: £690,000), all of which related to
equity settled share based payment transactions. After deferred tax (debited)/credited to the income statement, the total charge was
£761,000 (2012: £536,000).
Share option schemes
The Company established two share option schemes on 10 October 1996. The Company has made periodic grants of options under both
schemes, details of which are given in the Directors’ report on pages 28 to 33. Both the Employee Scheme and the Executive Scheme
closed in October 2006. Consequently no further awards have been made since that date.
The fair value of the share options is based on historic volatility of the share price over the last five years. The expected life is the average
expected period to exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on zero coupon UK government bonds of a term consistent with the
assumed option life.

25. SHARE BASED PAYMENTS CONTINUED
Long term incentive plan
The Lavendon Group Long Term Incentive Plan (“the LTIP”) was approved at the Company’s Annual General Meeting on 28 April 2006.
2010-2012 awards:
The performance condition is based on the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the performance of the
FTSE Small Cap Index excluding Investment Trusts over the vesting period. The number of shares which vest is dependent upon relative
achievement against agreed criteria.
2013 awards:
There are two performance conditions applying to the 2013 award. 50% of the award is subject to a performance condition comparing
the Group’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) against a comparator group of companies comprising the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding
investment trusts and financial services companies) over three years commencing on the date of grant of the award. The remaining 50%
of the award is subject to a performance condition based on the average Return on Capital Employed (ROCE) of the Group over three
financial years ending on 31 December 2015. A general performance underpin also applies. The number of shares which vest under
both performance conditions is dependent upon relative achievement of each condition against agreed criteria.
The assumptions used to calculate the fair value of the awards made in 2013 are detailed below:
TSR ROCE
Share price at grant date (pence) 170 170
No. of employees 33 33
Rights granted 446,139 446,139
Vesting period (years) 33
Award pricing model Monte Carlo Monte Carlo
% expected to vest 82% 82%
Fair value of award (pence) 103 161
Share Incentive Plan (“The SIP”)
In November 2007 the Group introduced the Lavendon Group plc Share Incentive Plan.
126,969 SIP shares (2012: 189,225) were issued during the year of which 47,544 shares were SIP matching shares (2012: 72,922).
The fair values are calculated by applying the following models:
Share Incentive Plan – Black-Scholes option pricing model:
Share price Price at date of grant
Exercise price Nil pence per share
Expected share price volatility 34.2% – 43.5%
Expected share price volatility is estimated by calculating the annualised daily volatility of the share price over the preceding three years.
Expected dividends Based on historical dividend yield
Risk-free interest 4.5%
Levels of early exercises and lapses are estimated using historical averages. 26. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS

Report on the financial statements
Our opinion 
In our opinion the Parent Company financial statements:
• give a true and fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 December 2013;
• have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
• have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
This opinion is to be read in the context of what we say below.
What we have audited
The Parent Company financial statements, which are prepared by Lavendon Group plc, comprise:
• the Parent Company balance sheet as at 31 December 2013; and
• the notes to the Parent Company financial statements, which include a summary of significant accounting policies and other
explanatory information.
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation comprises applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
In applying the financial reporting framework, the directors have made a number of subjective judgements, for example in respect of
significant accounting estimates. In making such estimates, they have made assumptions and considered future events.
What an audit of financial statements involves
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK & Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”). An audit involves
obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of:
• whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and
adequately disclosed;
• the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
• the overall presentation of the financial statements.
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the annual report and financial statements to identify material
inconsistencies with the audited Parent Company financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinions on matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
• The information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Parent Company financial
statements are prepared is consistent with the Parent Company financial statements.
• The part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
Other matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of accounting records and information and explanations received
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received
from branches not visited by us; or
• the Parent Company financial statements and the part of the Annual Report on Remuneration to be audited are not in agreement
with the accounting records and returns.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility. 96   Lavendon Group plc 2013
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report if, in our opinion, certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by law
have not been made. We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Other information in the Annual Report
Under ISAs (UK & Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
• materially inconsistent with the information in the audited Parent Company financial statements; or
• apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Parent Company acquired in the course of
performing our audit; or
• is otherwise misleading.
We have no exceptions to report arising from this responsibility.
Responsibilities for the financial statements and the audit
Our responsibilities and those of the directors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities set out on page 32, the directors are responsible for the preparation
of the Parent Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable law and
ISAs (UK & Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 of
Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Lavendon Group plc for the year ended 31 December 2013.

1.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable
Accounting Standards in the United Kingdom (UK GAAP). The principal accounting policies and estimation techniques have been applied
consistently and are set out below:
Basis of accounting
The financial statements are prepared in accordance with the historical cost convention.
Foreign currencies
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into Sterling at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of transaction. Exchange differences
are taken into account in arriving at the operating result.
Fixed asset investments
Investments are included at cost stated at the historical Sterling value at the time of investment other than where overseas investments
are hedged by foreign currency borrowings in which case the investment is included at cost, restated at the year end Sterling value at the
balance sheet date and any exchange movement is taken to reserves. Where appropriate, the carrying values of fixed asset investments
are measured by reference to their discounted future operational cash flows, or their imputed resale value, and provision is made for any
diminution in value where necessary.
Share based payments
The Company operates a number of equity settled, share based compensation plans on behalf of the Group.
The fair value of the employee services received under such plans is recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account. Fair value
is determined by use of the Black Scholes Option Pricing Model for share option schemes and the Share Incentive Plan, and in the case
of Share Matching Plan and the Long-Term Incentive Plan, by use of a Monte Carlo simulation. The amount to be expensed over the
vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions.
Non- market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about the number of share incentives that are expected to vest.
At each balance sheet date, the Company revises its estimates of the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of
the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the profit and loss account, with a corresponding adjustment to equity, over the
remaining vesting period.
Share-based transactions involving treasury shares or involving Group entities (for example, options over the Parent Company’s shares)
are accounted for as equity-settled share-based payment transactions in the stand-alone financial statements of the Parent Company
and the Group.
The amounts in the Company are immaterial and are therefore not disclosed.
Dividend distribution
Dividend distributions to Lavendon shareholders are recognised in the Company’s financial statements in the periods in which the
dividends are approved, or when paid in the case of an interim dividend.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the
borrowing. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and
the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings using the effective interest rate method.
Borrowing costs are expensed in the period in which they are incurred, except for issue costs. Issue costs arising from a modification of a
borrowing facility are amortised over the period of the borrowing or until the facility is considered to be “extinguished” at which point any
unamortised costs are recognised immediately in the income statement. Costs associated with the re-negotiation of an existing facility,
that are not separately identifiable, are treated as an extinguishment and are recognised in the income statement as incurred. Overview Strategic report Governance Group financial statements Parent Company financial statements

1.   PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES CONTINUED
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit can differ from net profit/loss as reported in the profit and
loss account because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items
that are never taxable or deductible. The Company’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
2.   RESULT FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Parent Company’s profit and loss account has not been presented in these
financial statements. The Parent Company’s loss after tax for the financial year was £3,681,000 (2012: loss of £6,647,000).
3.   EMPLOYEE INFORMATION
The Company has no employees. Non-executive directors of the Company are employed under letters of appointment. Full details of
Executive and Non-Executive remuneration is disclosed in the Annual Report on Remuneration on pages 49 to 53.

Introduction
As reported in the interim results, 2009 has seen a period of weak 
demand from our major customers and this has been a difficult 
backdrop against which to continue the transition of the Group from 
manufacturer to solutions provider.
Nevertheless, despite the poor economic climate, I am delighted to 
be able to report that the benefits of this transition have allowed the 
Group to show improved underlying profitability despite reduced 
turnover. Operating profit, before exceptional items, increased by 
45% in 2009 to £750,000 (2008: £516,000). EBITDA before 
exceptional items grew in the same period by 53% to £1,845,000 
(2008: £1,208,000).
Exceptional items totalling £1,005,000 were incurred during the year 
mainly as a result of further restructuring of the Group. These costs 
contributed to an overall loss before taxation of £599,000 (2008: 
loss of £484,000).
The highlight of the year was undoubtedly the signing of an 
enhanced contract with Wm Morrison Supermarkets plc. Morrisons 
is a long-established and valued customer of the Group and we are 
delighted to extend that relationship into the foreseeable future.
Results
The impact of weak demand saw Group turnover fall by 12.5% 
compared to the prior year. This is a larger fall than reported at the 
half year, but was expected given the strength of demand 
experienced in late 2008. Turnover in the second half was slightly 
less than reported in the first half (3% down) but operating 
profitability was higher in the second half, as a result of the cost 
reductions implemented earlier in the year.
With an improvement in the sales mix, gross margin percentage 
increased to 35.9% from 32.6% in the prior year, reflecting the 
benefits of the move from manufacturing to services and the 
consequent restructuring of the business. Savings in our operational 
cost base have been made and Group headcount has been 
reduced by 17% during the course of the year, resulting in a 
reduction in staff costs of 19%. It is also worthy of note that two
of the Group’s four segments actually grew their turnover during
the year.
Operating profit, before exceptional items, represents a 5.1% 
operating margin, compared to 3.1% in 2008. The 9% reduction in 
administrative costs was a significant component of this 
improvement.
During the year we incurred significant restructuring costs of 
£801,000 (2008: £534,000), as we continued the transition from 
manufacturing to solutions provider. Incurring these costs enables 
the Group to proceed with a much reduced cost base and 
enhanced operational gearing. As the wider business community 
recovers confidence and normal levels of capital expenditure 
resume, the Board anticipates that this reduced cost base should 
allow the Group to benefit from a recovery in demand for our 
products and services. We continue to pay close attention to our cost 
base, although we would not expect further exceptional costs of the 
scale reported here in the foreseeable future.
Approach by Brulines Group plc
The approach by Brulines Group plc was a significant event during 
the year. Whilst we remain in an offer period there is no agreement 
for Brulines to undertake any due diligence on the Company. 
However, it is also worth noting the impact on trading that an 
approach of this sort can have. The requirement to obtain Brulines’ 
consent resulted in a frustrating and unavoidable delay in signing 
the Morrisons’ contract. This delay impacted 2009’s results, and in 
addition significant costs were incurred primarily relating to 
increased advisers’ fees.
The approach from Brulines continues to be a significant distraction 
for the management team whose main focus has to be guiding the 
Group through these difficult economic conditions. It is worth 
repeating here that the Directors remain committed to delivering 
value to all of the Group’s shareholders.
Annual General Meeting
At the 2009 Annual General Meeting a proposed resolution to allow 
the Group to issue share options or to raise funds via a placing did 
not receive sufficient shareholder support. After significant changes 
to the management team over the last two years the Group is 
unable to align the team’s interests with those of its shareholders, a 
situation which the Board does not believe is satisfactory. In addition, 
the Group’s ability to raise funds if necessary via a placing is equally 
important. Obtaining additional debt finance currently is both 
expensive and difficult, and without recourse to potential sources of 
equity funding the Group runs the risk of missing out on 
opportunities that may arise.
For these reasons, enabling resolutions will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM and I would urge all shareholders to vote in 
favour.

Board of Directors
After 23 years of outstanding service, both in an Executive and a 
Non-Executive capacity, Barrie Brinkman has decided to stand down 
as a Director at the conclusion of the 2010 Annual General Meeting.
I thank Barrie for his contribution over the years.
Dividend
Whilst we continue to focus on delivering growth in profits, the 
availability of funding to deliver such growth impacted results in 
2009. The receipt of £1 million of further funding from our bank late 
in the year should not disguise the difficulties of obtaining finance 
during 2009. The existing credit facilities require significant capital 
repayments during 2010, and consequently we do not recommend 
paying a dividend for the year. We will continue to review the 
position regarding future dividend payments as the Group 
progresses.
Outlook and Prospects
Being able to report an increase in underlying profitability, despite a 
reduction in turnover, shows the progress that has been made. 
However, the challenge for 2010 is to return the Group to a position 
of turnover growth whilst maintaining that increased underlying 
profitability. Progress in winning new business is being made in all 
four divisions of the Group and coupled with the restructuring that 
has already occurred, turnover growth would provide the Group 
with a firm foundation for future enhanced profitability.

Chief Executive’s Report
 
In the face of the most severe global economic downturn in recent 
years the focus for 2009 was necessarily improving profitability, cash 
flow and developing recurring revenue streams. Growth was 
inevitably affected by capital expenditure freezes within much of our 
customer base as well as by the continuing squeeze on available 
debt finance. Underlying operational profitability before exceptional 
items improved as a result of tough cost reductions. These actions 
will continue to improve profitability and cash flow and will ensure 
that full advantage can be taken in any future economic upturn.
Financial Performance Review and Key Performance Indicators
The Group recorded an overall loss before taxation of £599,000 
(2008: loss of £484,000) which was significantly impacted by 
£1,005,000 of exceptional items. This mostly related to £801,000 of 
restructuring costs reflecting cost-cutting programmes in our 
manufacturing operation, and the closure of our Spanish office. 
Whilst an increasing loss is disappointing, the exceptional costs 
incurred were necessary to allow the Group to meet the twin 
challenges of a business in transition and a difficult economic 
environment. Levels of cost remain under review at all times; 
however, the main foreseeable restructuring costs have now been 
incurred.
The early action taken on cost reduction reduced overhead costs by 
9% to £4,454,000 (2008: £4,882,000) and provided the platform for 
a 45% increase in operating profit, before exceptional items, to 
£750,000 (2008: £516,000). This was against the disappointment of 
a revenue decrease of 12.5% resulting from the economic recession. 
Despite this, gross margins grew to 35.9% from 32.6% in the prior 
year. Operating margin, before exceptional items, rose to 5.1% from 
3.1% in 2008 and is moving towards our goal of exceeding 10%. 
Profit before tax and exceptional items increased by 149% to 
£406,000 (2008: £163,000).
The 53% growth in EBITDA (as calculated in note 2) from £1,208,000 
to £1,845,000 demonstrates that progress continues to be made in 
improving operational cash generation. Investment in fixed assets 
over the last two years has changed the Group’s cost structure, 
increasing the total depreciation and amortisation charge by 
£403,000 from the prior year. Whilst investment will continue, the 
asset base is now in place that will allow the Group to deliver 
growth.
The Board will continue to monitor revenue change, operating profit, 
cash generation and customer satisfaction as key performance 
indicators. Service excellence has become an essential element in 
customer relationships with demands for improved service level 
agreement (SLA) targets being widespread. Overall SLAs for 2009 
were 94% (2008: 96%) which are above contractual requirements. 
Contracted service revenues are a key element of PFS sales and 
requests from an increasing number of customers are being made 
for a 24/7 service.
Universe Data Systems (UDS)
The segmental reporting breakdown shows an increase in revenue 
of 63% for the year to £3,086,000 (2008: £1,885,000) which in turn 
drove segmental profit to £959,000 (2008: loss of £69,000).
During the later part of 2008 UDS began the roll-out of what is 
believed to be the largest and only truly global real time loyalty 
scheme. Early 2009 saw the web based system go live in four 
European countries with licence arrangements for more to come on 
stream in future periods. In excess of 100 million transactions have 
been processed by our data centre for the first year and significant 
ongoing revenue streams will accrue from the initial five year 
agreement.
Currently the PCIDSS approved data centre handles £8 billion worth 
of transactions per year and has loyalty schemes with up to 14 
million members operating in a real time environment. HTEC 
provides Mission Critical Services to two of the UK’s supermarket 
groups and four of the major oil companies, either in the UK or 
Europe.
Progress has been made during the year to establish UDS outside 
the petrol and oil industry. Partnerships and alliances with market 
specialists are continuing to introduce exciting new opportunities as 
UDS is positioned as a data handling platform in the extended 
loyalty and customer relationship management (CRM) space.
Long sales cycles remain a feature of loyalty systems projects but a 
growing number of interesting opportunities are now presenting 
themselves, which indicate strong future potential based on a 
recurring revenue model. The SaaS (software as a service) model of 
operation gives increasing benefits to both customer and supplier 
as utilisation of capacity increases.
During the year, development was completed on the automatic 
number plate recognition software (ANPR) range enabling 
agreements to be signed with five channel partners in the latter part 
of 2009. The HTEC data centre can hold and process data with 
reference to a central database for partners dependent on the 
application. The rapidly increasing market for surveillance and 
security products will provide a growing sales channel for future 
years. The ANPR product range now includes forecourt drive off 
control, car park barrier control, visitor systems and a central on-line 
warning list database.

 Chief Executive’s Report continued
  
Petrol Forecourt Systems (PFS)
The PFS business segment produced £1,644,000 (2008: £2,486,000) 
of profit and remains the Group’s largest and most profitable 
segment despite a 25% fall in turnover. Prior year sales and profit 
benefited from a major supermarket payment terminal roll-out but 
excluding that, underlying sales were up 15% compared to 2008. 
Recurring contract business is in excess of 70% of turnover for this 
segment.
The core solutions of the PFS business relate to the supply of point of 
sale (POS) payment systems and wet stock management reporting.
HTEC has occupied a prominent position in the UK forecourt 
managed services market for a number of years and its systems 
currently run the petrol forecourts of two major supermarket chains 
and over 33% of all UK forecourts have HTEC equipment on them. 
Development of the software continues in order to improve 
functionality for the growing convenience store market, and to allow 
easier integration with other third party products.
HTEC has a wide range of end to end approvals to handle bank and 
fuel payment cards and will continue to be a market leader for this 
type of payment processing. HTEC’s payment terminals are 
recognised as some of the most secure within the industry, meeting 
the challenges posed constantly from card fraud criminals. 
Investment in the next generation payment terminal which will begin 
roll-out in 2010 has been carefully controlled to give a rapid payback 
to the Group.
Disappointingly, 2010 saw a fall in turnover as customers cut back 
on new project spending. I can however report that we renewed a 
significant long-term contract with Morrisons for enhanced services 
supporting its store IT replacement project.
New outdoor payment terminal roll-outs were particularly badly 
affected last year as capital expenditure plans were put on hold. 
This product is however now opening up new markets related to 
airfields, marinas and commercial truck stops.
Manufacturing (CEM)
The traditional core business of HTEC, subcontract design and 
manufacture, has over a number of years been in decline. 
Continued monitoring showed that although it was loss making at 
the pre-tax level, it did have a positive contribution to fixed 
overheads so an immediate disposal was ruled out as impractical 
because of the requirement to supply components for other 
segments of the Group.
Revenue continued to decline in 2009 to £2,056,000 (2008: 
£3,263,000). Whilst the cost base was significantly reduced to 
ensure a positive contribution to fixed overheads, a loss at the 
operating profit level was recorded of £97,000 (2008: loss 
£120,000). Encouragingly the economic challenges last year have 
actually benefited this part of the business and new customers are 
creating welcome opportunities early in 2010.
JetSet
The financial crisis which began in 2008 continued to seriously affect 
the JetSet business. The market became increasingly tough as 
capital expenditure was cut back and asset finance to support 
machine placement was still both difficult to obtain and 
unreasonably expensive. Despite the conditions, turnover increased 
by 31% to £1,933,000 (2008: £1,475,000). However, due to having to 
operate the production facility in Bedford at below capacity, 
operating losses increased to £241,000 (2008: loss of £181,000), 
particularly weighted to the earlier part of the year.
By Q4 of 2009 JetSet was EBITDA positive and, with an improved 
trading environment, has a high expectation of achieving regular 
and sustainable profitable trading. Visibility of potential prestigious 
future contracts with existing Group customers demonstrates that 
the business has growth potential assuming new asset funding 
avenues are available.
The concept of revenue share from equipment owned by JetSet and 
sited on the customers’ premises has already resulted in the 
winning of contracts from customers such as ASDA, Co-op and BP, 
clearly demonstrating the cross selling opportunity from other 
Universe business units.
Prior year adjustment in respect of Goodwill
The introduction of IFRS8 on Segmental Reporting has required the 
Group to allocate the historic goodwill associated with the HTEC 
subsidiary (£17.3 million) across the operating segments contained 
within HTEC. A significant proportion of this goodwill (£6.3 million) 
has necessarily been allocated to the historic Manufacturing 
segment. The requirement to allocate goodwill to the segments is a 
change of accounting policy and consequently must be applied 
retrospectively, resulting in the allocation being made as at
1st January 2007. Cash flow forecasts for the segment, at that time, 
would not support the carrying value of the goodwill allocated to 
Manufacturing and consequently an impairment provision of £5.1 
million would have been required had impairment been measured 
on a segmental basis in 2007. Consequently, a £5.1 million provision 
has been booked in 2009 and treated as a prior year adjustment.

Balance Sheet, Cash Flow, Banking Facilities and Going Concern
During 2009 the priority has been to generate cash and to improve 
the debt repayment profile of the Group’s borrowings. By the year 
end net borrowings (debt less cash) had dropped from £3.2 million 
to £2.5 million, and the repayment profile had improved significantly, 
with 73% of net borrowings due in more than one year (2008: 45%). 
Debt repayment will remain a significant drain on the Group’s cash 
flow in 2010, with scheduled repayments due of £858,000, but this 
debt repayment burden is scheduled to drop significantly in 2011.
Overall the Group generated £1.1 million of cash during the period. 
Clearly the negotiation of a new long-term loan from our bankers 
was a significant part of that, but in reality most of these proceeds 
served to refresh facilities that have been paid down over the last 
two years on an accelerated schedule. Net proceeds from financing 
activities were £371,000, with the balance of the cash arising from 
£1.4 million generated by the operation, net of the £707,000 
invested into software product development and an expansion of 
the JetSet revenue share estate.
During the year the Group breached one of its banking covenants, in 
respect of the net worth of the Group which has been significantly 
impacted by the goodwill impairment referred to above. All other 
covenants were met, and the breach has been subsequently waived 
by HBOS. HBOS has also agreed to remove covenants from both 
loans going forward, and compliance with the loan terms now rests 
on the ability to repay loan instalments as they fall due. The Directors 
have reviewed financial forecasts for the business covering the 12 
months from the date of this report and are confident that the 
repayment schedule will be satisfied and that the Group will be able 
to operate within its current banking facilities. As a result, the 
Directors have continued to adopt the going concern basis in 
preparing the financial statements.
Outlook
The strategy of the management team is to grow and transform the 
Group from lower margin product sale and manufacturing activity to 
a software and services business with associated recurring revenue 
targeted at tier 1 businesses. Dealing with the burdensome debt 
structure, limited funding for investment and an inappropriate 
operational structure has been a difficult task. Restructuring 
write-offs have been higher than expected and new product 
development has been hindered by ongoing support requirements 
from legacy products.
2010 sees us go into a year where the cost structure has been 
significantly improved by the actions taken in 2008/9, new products 
have been added to the portfolio and the economy is emerging 
from a deep recession. The Group is now better placed to deliver 
growth and profitability. 2010 will see further debt reduction and by 
the end of this year our debt repayment profile will have improved 
significantly.
The sales pipeline for UDS continues to grow and strategic 
partnerships within the loyalty/CRM field are beginning to generate 
significant new opportunities. The PFS business is maintaining its 
market leading position and is seeing growth opportunities from its 
major customers. JetSet has the potential to move into profit this year 
and reach critical mass for equipment placements.

 Directors’ Remuneration Report
  
The Company is not required to comply with Schedule 8 of the 
Companies Act 2006 or the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority as its shares are traded on AIM; the following disclosures 
are therefore made on a voluntary basis.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee consists of the Non-Executive 
Directors of the Company. The role of the Committee is to determine, 
on behalf of the Board, the Company’s policy on Executive Directors’ 
and other senior employees’ remuneration, within set written terms 
of reference approved by the Board. The remuneration of the 
Non-Executive Directors is approved by the Board of Directors. As 
Chairman of the Committee, I have been asked by the Board to 
report to you on all remuneration matters on its behalf.
Remuneration Policy
The remuneration policy of the Company is:
 l
to provide a suitable remuneration package to attract, motivate 
and retain Executive Directors who will run the Company 
successfully;
 l to formulate a package that will include a significant proportion 
of performance related pay and to align the Directors’ personal 
interests to those of the shareholders; and
 l to ensure that all long-term incentive schemes for the Directors 
are approved by the shareholders.
Other than as disclosed at note 30 and as shareholders, none of the 
Committee has any personal financial interest, conflicts of interest 
arising from cross-directorships or day-to-day involvement in 
running the business. The Committee makes recommendations to 
the Board. No Director plays a part in any discussion about their 
own remuneration. The Remuneration Committee members are 
expected to draw on their experience to judge where to position the 
Company, relative to other companies’ and other groups’ rates of 
pay, when considering remuneration packages for Executives. The 
committee may use outside professional advice if they consider it 
necessary. No such advice has been sought during the year or the 
preceding year.
Benefits in kind include the provision of medical insurance premiums 
and a car or car allowance. Two Executive Directors participate in the 
Company’s pension plan. The pension contributions represent the 
Company’s contribution to defined contribution pension plans. 
Bonuses and benefits in kind are not pensionable.
All of the Executive Directors have service contracts, which provide 
for notice periods of no more than one year. All the Non-Executive 
Directors have service contracts, which provide for notice periods of 
three months.
The Remuneration Committee recognises the importance of 
appropriate incentive arrangements in assisting with the
recruitment and retention of senior Executives. The Remuneration 
Committee believes that share-based incentives align the interests
of employees with those of shareholders but recognises that
options to acquire shares at their market value on the date of grant 
are not always the most appropriate way to achieve this.
An EMI option scheme was set up on 27 June 2007 for the Executive 
Directors of Universe Group plc and an unapproved option scheme 
was set up for the Non-Executive Chairman of Universe Group plc 
on 27 June 2007. These options will lapse if a) the Directors leave 
employment for any reason other than a ‘Good Reason’ as defined 
within the schemes and b) at the end of the tenth anniversary of the 
Date of Grant.
The Group also operates a Long Term Incentive Plan (‘LTIP’) for 
employees (including certain Executive Directors) selected by the 
Board (but taking account of the recommendations of the 
Remuneration Committee). The LTIP operates by issuing matching 
shares in respect of qualifying share purchases by certain Directors 
and employees. No such shares were issued during 2009.

 Corporate Governance Report
  
The Board is accountable to the Company’s shareholders for good 
governance and this statement describes how the principles of good 
corporate governance are applied by the Company.
The Company is not required to comply with Schedule 8 of the 
Companies Act 2006 or the Listing Rules of the Financial Services 
Authority as its shares are traded on AIM; the following disclosures 
are therefore made on a voluntary basis.
The Group does voluntarily comply with many of the requirements of 
the Combined Code as described in this statement and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report and consequently, this report is 
intended to highlight the key areas in which the Group complies with 
the code but does not serve as report into the Group’s compliance 
with the whole code.
The Board
As at the date of signing of these accounts, the Board comprises two 
Executive Directors and three Non-Executive Directors.
The Board meets formally at least ten times a year and full 
information is given to the Directors to enable the Board to function 
effectively and to allow the Directors properly to fulfil their 
responsibilities. Board papers are usually distributed four days in 
advance of meetings and decisions may be deferred if Directors 
require further information to be made available to them. The 
Company Secretary is responsible to the Board for the timeliness of 
the information provided to it.
Board Committees
In furtherance of the principles of Corporate Governance the Board 
has appointed the following Committees, each of which has formal 
terms of reference. The membership of the Committees is shown 
below.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee, comprising the Non-Executives, is chaired by 
John Scholes and meets two or three times a year with the Executive 
Directors and representatives of the Auditors in attendance as 
required. The Committee assists the Board in the discharge of its 
duties concerning the announcements of results and the Annual 
Report and Accounts and the maintenance of proper internal 
controls; it reviews the Auditors’ findings and considers Group 
accounting policies and the compliance of those policies with 
applicable legal and accounting standards.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee, comprising the Non-Executive 
Directors under the Chairmanship of John Scholes, sets the Group’s 
overall remuneration policy. It determines, on behalf of the Board, 
the remuneration and other benefits of the Executive Directors. It 
meets on a regular basis, usually twice a year and additionally 
whenever required. The Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on 
pages 12 and 13.
Internal Controls
The Directors are responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control. However, such a system is designed to manage, rather than 
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can 
provide only reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
misstatement or loss. The Directors have put in place an 
organisational structure and framework of controls which is 
periodically reviewed for its effectiveness. The key financial 
procedures within the Group’s system of internal control are as 
follows:
 l There is a comprehensive budgeting system with the annual 
budget being approved by the Board. Actual results and 
updated forecasts are prepared regularly and compared 
against budget;
 l The annual capital investment budget is approved by the Board 
together with significant individual items prior to commitment; 
and
 l Significant treasury items are reserved for the Board.

Directors’ Report
 
The Directors present their report and the audited accounts for the 
year ended 31 December 2009.
Principal Activities
The principal activity of the Company is as a holding company, with 
two main trading subsidiaries, HTEC Limited (‘HTEC’) and Jet Set 
Wash Systems Limited (‘JetSet’). HTEC is engaged in the provision of 
managed services, payment and loyalty systems for the Petrol 
Forecourt and Retail sector. JetSet was established in late 2007, 
focusing on the provision of car wash and valeting services.
Result for the Year
For 2009 there was an operating profit before exceptional items of 
£750,000 (2008: £516,000). The Company’s loss for the year after 
interest and exceptional items, but before taxation, was £599,000 
(2008: £484,000 loss).
Business Review
A review of business in 2009 is included in the Chief Executive’s 
Report on pages 7 to 9.
Key performance indicators (‘KPIs’)
There are three main KPIs that management monitor within the 
Group:
 l The order inflow at HTEC and JetSet each day to ensure that 
annual sales forecasts are on schedule.
 l Detailed cost of sales documents, which are prepared each 
month in order that forecast product margins are achieved.
 l Performance against contracted service level agreements.
The performance against these KPIs is discussed in the Chief 
Executive’s Report on page 7.
Principal risks and uncertainties facing the Company
During 2009 the market for petrol forecourt equipment declined as 
capital programmes were put on hold. However, the market for 
recurring repairs and maintenance services remains steady. The 
Group has been adversely impacted by the availability of asset 
based lending necessary to fund the expansion of its JetSet 
operations. Whilst these funding restrictions persist the expansion of 
JetSet is likely to be slower than would be possible in more normal 
credit markets.
A discussion of the market, liquidity and credit risks in relation to 
financial instruments held within the Group takes place in note 20.
Going Concern
UK Company Law requires directors to consider whether it is 
appropriate to prepare the financial statements on the basis the 
Company and Group are going concerns. Throughout the financial 
statements there are various disclosures relating to going concern. 
This Directors’ report summarises the key themes and references 
those areas where greater disclosure is given.
The Group has good visibility of recurring revenues, which make up 
a significant proportion of annual revenues. However, the Group 
does still have some exposure to current economic conditions which 
have the potential to impact annual revenues. The Directors have 
therefore prepared downside sensitised forecasts for the current 
and following years and have continued to implement cost 
reductions programme in order to improve operational gearing.
The Group’s main sources of finance are bank loans, finance leases 
and invoice discounting. The year end amounts outstanding on each 
are discussed within note 18. In addition to this, the Group has a
£0.1 million overdraft facility that is currently not in use. The bank 
loans have several covenants attached that, if breached, give the 
lender the option to immediately recall the funding. During the year 
the Group breached one of the covenants associated with one of the 
loans on one occasion. This breach was waived by the lender. 
Further details of the breach are discussed within note 18 to the 
financial statements. Subsequent to the year end, the bank has 
agreed to remove all financial covenants associated with both 
loans.
The downside sensitised forecasts have been reviewed by the 
Directors to ensure that the profit and cash generation derived from 
these forecasts are sufficient to ensure that the existing bank 
facilities are sufficient to meet the Group’s requirements. This is 
discussed further within liquidity risk in note 20 and is the key factor 
in relation to going concern.
As a result of this review, the Directors are of the opinion that the 
Company and Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future, and have continued 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial 
statements.
Financial instruments
Information about the use of financial instruments by the Company 
and its subsidiaries, and the Group’s financial risk management 
policies is given in note 20.

Environment
The Company’s policy with regard to the environment is to ensure 
that the Group’s operational subsidiaries understand and effectively 
manage the actual and potential environmental impact of their 
activities. Operations are conducted such that they comply with all 
the legal requirements relating to the environments in which they 
operate. During the period covered by this report no Group company 
has incurred any fines or penalties or been investigated for any 
breach of environment regulations.
It is Company policy to continually carry out research and 
development on new products and processes to minimise the 
impact of its operations on the environment.
Employees
The quality and commitment of the Group’s employees has played a 
major role in the success of HTEC and JetSet over the years. This has 
been demonstrated in many ways, including improvements in 
customer satisfaction, the development of new product lines and the 
flexibility employees have shown in adapting to changing business 
requirements and new ways of working. Employee turnover remains 
below the 10% target set by the Executive Directors.
Research and development
The Company has a continuing commitment to a high level of 
research and development. During the year expenditure on research 
and development of £937,000 (2008: £967,000) was charged to the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. In addition, 
development costs of £327,000 (2008: £569,000) were capitalised. 
Research and development in the year concentrated on the further 
development of the online loyalty and back-office products.
Dividends
The Directors do not propose the payment of a dividend (2008: £nil).
Supplier payment policy
The Group’s policy is to settle terms of payment with suppliers when 
agreeing the terms of each transaction, ensure that suppliers are 
made aware of the terms of payment and abide by the terms of 
payment.
Trade creditors were equivalent to 66 (2008: 62) days’ purchases, 
based on the average daily amount invoiced by suppliers during
the year.
Capital structure
Details of the authorised and issued share capital, together with 
details of the movements in the Company’s issued share capital 
during the year, are shown in note 22. The Company has one class 
of ordinary shares which carry no right to fixed income. Each share 
carries the right to one vote at general meetings of the Company.
There are no specific restrictions on the size of a holding nor on the 
transfer of shares, which are both governed by the general 
provisions of the Articles of Association and prevailing legislation. 
The Directors are not aware of any agreements between holders of 
the Company’s shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of securities or on voting rights.
Details of employee share schemes are set out in note 28 and no 
person has any special rights of control over the Company’s share 
capital and all issued shares are fully paid
Directors’ indemnities
The Company has made qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
for the benefit of its Directors. These provisions remain in force at the 
date of this report.
Annual General Meeting
The resolutions to be processed at the Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 28 June 2010, together with explanatory notes, appear in the 
separate Notice of Annual General Meeting sent to all shareholders.

Statement of Directors’ responsibilities for
the ﬁ nancial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and 
the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors
are required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the Parent 
Company financial statements under IFRSs as adopted by the EU. 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Company for that period.
In preparing these financial statements, International Accounting 
Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 l properly select and apply accounting policies;
 l present information, including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable 
information;
 l
provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to 
understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and
 l make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Responsibility statement
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 l
the financial statements, prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or loss 
of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and
 l the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.
Disclosure of information to Auditors
At the date of making this report each of the Company’s Directors, as 
set out on page 17, confirm the following:
 l so far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant information 
needed by the Company’s Auditors in connection with preparing 
their report of which the Company’s Auditors are unaware; and
 l each Director has taken all steps that he ought to have taken as 
a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant 
information needed by the Company’s Auditors in connection 
with preparing their report and to establish that the Company’s 
Auditors are aware of that information.
This confirmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of s418 of the Companies Act 2006.

A resolution to reappoint Deloitte LLP will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.

Independent Auditors’ Report
to the Members of Universe Group plc
 
We have audited the Group and Parent Company financial 
statements (‘the financial statements’) of Universe Group plc for the 
year ended 31st December 2009 which comprise the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income, the consolidated statement of 
recognised income and expense, the Group and Company 
statement of changes in equity, the consolidated and Company 
balance sheets, the consolidated and Company cash flow 
statements and the related notes 1 to 31. These financial statements 
have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them 
in an Auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to 
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members, as a 
body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have 
formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s (APB’s) Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have 
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements.
Opinion on ﬁ nancial statements
In our opinion:
 l the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state
of the Group’s and the Parent Company’s affairs as at
31st  December 2009 and of the Group’s and the Parent 
Company’s loss for the year then ended;
 l the financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; and
 l the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 l
the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial 
year for which the financial statements are prepared is 
consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following:
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in 
our opinion:
 l adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or
 l the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or
 l certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law 
are not made; or
 l we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit.

 Notes to the Accounts
 year ended 31st December 2009
1. Significant Accounting Policies
General information
Universe Group plc is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom under the Companies Act 2006. The address of the registered office is 
given on page 11. The nature of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out on page 15.
In the current year, the following new and revised Standards and Interpretations have been adopted and have affected the amounts reported 
in these financial statements.
Standards affecting the calculation of income or expenses:
IAS23 IAS23 is a standard that deals with the capitalisation of borrowing costs in respect of capital projects. The Group has 
capitalised £13,000 of borrowing costs associated with its software development projects. No amounts have been 
identified for previous periods and consequently the financial statements have not been restated for the introduction of 
this standard.
Standards affecting presentation and disclosure:
IFRS8 IFRS8 is a disclosure Standard that has required further disclosure relating to the Group’s segments and which 
required the allocation of Goodwill amongst the Group’s reporting segments (see note 4).
Amendments to IFRS7 The amendments to IFRS7 expand the disclosures required in respect of fair value measurements and liquidity risk. 
The Group has elected not to provide comparative information for these expanded disclosures in the current year in 
accordance with the transitional reliefs offered in these amendments.
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, the following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied in these 
financial statements were in issue but not yet effective:
IFRS1 (amended) Cost of an Investment in a Subsidiary, Jointly Controlled Entity or Associate
IFRS3 (revised 2008) Business Combinations
IAS27 (revised 2008) Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements
IAS28 (revised 2008) Investment in Associates
IFRIC17 Distributions of Non-cash Assets to Owners
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of these Standards and Interpretations in future periods will have no material impact on the 
financial statements of the Group except for treatment of acquisitions of subsidiaries and associates when IFRS3 (revised 2008), IAS27 
(revised 2008) and IAS28 (revised 2009) come into effect for business combinations for which the acquisition date is on or after the beginning 
of the first annual period beginning on or after 1 July 2009.
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted for use in the EU and as applied in accordance with the Companies Act 2006.
A summary of the more significant accounting policies, which have been applied consistently, is set out below.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the Parent Company has not been separately presented in 
the financial statements. The Parent Company’s result for the year is disclosed in the Company statement of changes in equity on page 21.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each year. Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the effective date 
of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Going concern
The Directors have undertaken a detailed review of the financial position and financial forecasts of the Group as explained in the Directors’ 
Report on page 15 and on the basis of this review have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

1. Significant Accounting Policies continued
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition represents the excess of the fair value of the consideration given, plus associated costs, for a business, over 
the fair value of the net assets acquired after accounting for identifiable intangible assets. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost 
and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is capitalised. In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included at the amount recorded 
previously under UK GAAP.
In accordance with IFRS3 ‘Business Combinations’ goodwill is not amortised.
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to operating segments, which are tested for impairment annually or more 
frequently if impairment indicators are found. If the recoverable amount is found to be less than the carrying value, impairment is allocated 
first to goodwill and then pro rata to other assets in the cash-generating unit.
Prior period restatement
The introduction of IFRS8 on Segmental Reporting has required the Group to allocate the historical goodwill associated with the HTEC 
subsidiary (£17.3 million) across the operating segments contained with HTEC. Under the previous standard, IAS14 ‘Segmental Reporting’, the 
Group allocated the goodwill to the entire HTEC segment. The requirement to allocate goodwill to the segments is a change of accounting 
policy and consequently must be applied retrospectively resulting in the allocation being made as at 1st January 2007. Consequently, a 
review of impairment was required to be undertaken for each segment and this gave rise to an impairment of goodwill within the CEM 
operating segment. Please see note 31 for details of the adjustment and the impact on the relevant financial statement captions.
Impairment of tangible and intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine whether there is any 
indication that those assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated 
in order to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are independent from 
other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with 
an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash flows 
are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and 
the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the 
asset (or cash-generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately, unless 
the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined had no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (or cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is 
recognised as income immediately, unless the relevant asset is carried at a revalued amount, in which case the reversal of the impairment 
loss is treated as a revaluation increase.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs attributable to capital projects are capitalised during the development phase of the project. Loan issue costs are accounted 
for on an accrual basis in the statement of comprehensive income and expense, and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to 
the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
Operating profit/(loss)
Operating profit/(loss) is stated after charging restructuring and other exceptional costs but before investment income and finance costs.
Exceptional Items
Costs are treated as exceptional costs when they are associated with normal activities, are of a non-recurring nature and/or are of an 
exceptional magnitude that if they were not shown separately the accounts would not present a true and fair view. Management track the 
performance of the business excluding these items.

1. Significant Accounting Policies continued
Leasing
Where assets are acquired under finance leases (including hire purchase contracts), which confer rights and obligations similar to those 
attached to owned assets, the amount representing the outright purchase price of such assets is included in property, plant and equipment. 
Depreciation is provided in accordance with the accounting policy below. The capital element of future finance lease payments is included in 
creditors and the interest element is charged to the statement of comprehensive income and expense over the period of the lease in 
proportion to the capital element outstanding.
Expenditure on operating leases is charged to the statement of comprehensive income and expense on a straight-line basis.
Foreign currencies
The individual financial statements of each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates (its functional currency). For the purposes of the consolidated financial statements, the results and financial position of each Group 
company are expressed in pound sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and the presentation currency for the 
consolidated financial statements.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded using the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated using the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date and the gains and 
losses on translation are included in the statement of comprehensive income and expense.
The assets and liabilities of overseas subsidiary undertakings are translated at the closing exchange rates. Profit and loss accounts of such 
undertakings are consolidated at the average rates of exchange during the year. Gains and losses arising on these transactions are taken to 
reserves.
Pension costs
The Group operates a defined contribution scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an 
independently administered fund. The pension costs charged represent contributions payable by the Group to the fund together with the 
administration charge of the fund. In addition, the Group continues to contribute to personal pension plans for certain employees.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the statement of 
comprehensive income and expense because it excludes items of income and expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or 
substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the 
financial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit, and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be 
utilised. Such assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or the initial 
recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investment in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient tax profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised based on 
tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in 
equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities 
and when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities 
on a net basis.

1. Significant Accounting Policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
The cost of property, plant and equipment is their purchase price, together with any incidental costs of acquisition.
Depreciation is charged so as to write off the cost of property, plant and equipment less residual value, on a straight-line basis over the 
expected useful lives of the assets concerned.
The principal annual rates used for this purpose are:
Computer and office equipment 25%
Operational equipment 14 – 33%
Leasehold improvements Over the lease term subject to maximum of 20 years
Assets under finance leases are depreciated over useful economic life on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, over the term of 
the relevant lease.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs
to sell.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction 
rather than through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and the asset (or disposal group) 
is available for immediate sale in its present condition. Management must be committed to the sale, which should be expected to qualify for 
recognition as a completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received or receivable and represents amounts receivable for goods and services 
in the normal course of business, net of discounts, VAT and other sales related taxes.
Sales of goods are recognised when goods are delivered and title has passed. Revenues from service contracts are recognised evenly over 
the contractual period.
Where sales of goods and services involve the provision of multiple elements such as licence fees, installation fees and maintenance fees, 
the appropriate revenue recognition convention is then applied to each element. The consideration allocated to each element is measured 
by reference to their fair value.
Development expenditure
Development expenditure relating to specific projects intended for commercial exploitation is capitalised as an intangible fixed asset where 
the following conditions are met:
 l
an identifiable asset is being created;
 l it is probable that the asset created will generate future economic benefits; and
 l the development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Such expenditure is amortised over the period during which the benefits of the project are expected to arise. Expenditure on research 
activities is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs 
and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Cost is calculated using the 
weighted average method. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.

Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on hand and demand deposits, and other short-term highly liquid investments that are readily 
convertible to a known amount of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including 
premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accrual basis in the statement of 
comprehensive income and expense, and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the 
period in which they arise. Borrowing costs associated with capital projects are capitalised during the development phase of the project.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Share-based payment
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS2 ‘Share-based Payments’. In accordance with the transitional provisions, IFRS2 has been 
applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested at 1st January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair 
value (excluding the effect of non market-based vesting conditions) at the date of grant. The fair value determined at the grant date of the 
equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares 
that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured by use of the Black–Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best estimate, for the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
Critical estimates and judgements
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, which are described above, management has made the following judgements 
and estimations about the future that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements. The estimates 
and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current 
and future periods.
Impairment of goodwill
The carrying value of goodwill at the year end is £12.6 million (2008 as restated: £12.6 million). An annual impairment review is required 
under IAS36 ‘Impairments of Assets’ involving judgement of the future cash flows for cash-generating units and the discount rates applied to 
future cash flows in order to calculate present value. Management prepare such cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent budgets 
approved by the Board.
The introduction of IFRS8 resulted in the Group allocating goodwill amongst its operating segments as explained in note 31. The key risk and 
judgement for the Group relates to the impairment of the goodwill allocated.
Recoverability of capitalised development costs
The capitalisation of development expenditure is a requirement of IAS38 ‘Intangible Assets’. All capitalised and ongoing projects are 
reviewed regularly to ensure they meet the criteria for capitalisation. The key judgements required by management are the judgement of the 
capitalisation of development expenditure and whether it meets the criteria defined within IAS38 ‘Intangible Assets’ and the potential 
impairment of the intangible assets once capitalised.

4. Business and Geographical Segments
The Group has adopted IFRS8 Operating Segments in the year and applied this retrospectively across all reportable periods. IFRS8 requires 
operating segments to be identified on the basis of internal reports about the components of the Group that are regularly reviewed by the 
Chief Executive in order to allocate resources to the segments and to assess their performance. The introduction of IFRS8 has not resulted in the 
Group making changes to its reporting of segmented performance other than a recategorisation of software support costs between 
administrative expenses and cost of sales as detailed in note 31. The business segments recognised in the prior year complied fully with the 
definition of business segments included within IFRS8.
The Group has four business segments operating within HTEC Limited and Jet Set Wash Systems Limited. All material operations are in the UK. 
HTEC Limited is currently organised into three trading divisions: Universe Data Services (UDS), Manufacturing and Petrol Forecourt Solutions 
(PFS). Further information is presented below on a divisional basis.

Carrying amount at 31 December 2009   12,150 462 12,612 12,612
As stated in note 1 the goodwill has been tested for impairment in accordance with IAS36 by discounting estimated future cash flows.
The recoverable amounts of each of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in use 
calculations are those regarding the discount rates, growth rates and expected changes to selling prices and direct costs during the period. 
Management estimates discount rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks 
specific to the CGUs. Changes in selling prices and direct costs are based on past practices and expectations of future changes in the market.
Following adoption of IFRS8, the goodwill relating to the HTEC acquisition was required to be allocated to all operational segments within HTEC 
whereas under IAS14 the Group previously allocated this to the HTEC entity. Consequently, the Group allocated goodwill across the three HTEC 
segments and undertook impairment reviews at each reported balance sheet date based on the new allocation. As explained in notes 1 and 
31 the prior period adjustment at 31st December 2007 therefore arose from this change in accounting policy. The carrying values of goodwill in 
the HTEC segments are disclosed at note 31.
The Group tests for impairment by preparing cash flow forecasts derived from the most recent financial budgets approved by the Board. The future 
cash flows used are those anticipated in the budget for 2010 with 3% profit growth assumed for the PFS, UDS and JetSet segments for the following 
five years and no growth thereafter. The current growth rates used reflect anticipated future turnover growth; however, the Group has conducted 
sensitivity analysis on the impairment tests of these segments carrying values. For these segments, the growth rate could reduce to zero percentage 
points after the 2009 budget and this would still result in the carrying value being in excess of its recoverable amount. For the JetSet CGU a reduction 
in the anticipated cash flows of 50 percentage points would result in the carrying value being reduced to its recoverable amount.
The Board has concluded that no impairment of goodwill is required for the PFS, UDS and JetSet operating segments.
For the manufacturing segment the implementation of IFRS8 resulted in £1.2 million of goodwill being allocated to the segment after booking an 
impairment provision as explained at note 31. The future cash flows used to test for impairment in the manufacturing segment are these anticipated 
in the budget for 2010 with no profit anticipated thereafter. The growth rates used reflect the current difficult economic conditions for manufacturing.
The Board has concluded that no further impairment of goodwill is required in the manufacturing segment.
The risk adjusted rate used to discount each of the CGU cash flow forecasts is 12.5% (2008: 12.5%).

The average credit period taken on sales of goods and services is 41 days (2008: 46 days). No interest is charged on the receivables. Before 
accepting any new customer, the Group uses an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and defines 
credit limits by customer. Of the trade receivables balance at the end of the year, £757,225 (2008: £679,000) is due from the Group’s largest 
customer.
Included in the Group’s trade receivable balance are debtors with a carrying value amount of £590,000 (2008: £669,000) which are past due 
at the reporting date for which the Group has not made any provision as there has not been a significant change in credit quality and the 
amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold collateral over these balances. Ageing of past due but not impaired 
receivables is 30–60 days £455,000 (2008: £543,000), 60–90 days £34,000 (2008: £70,000) and 90 days and over £101,000 (2008: £56,000).
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the 
date the credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the customer base being large 
and unrelated. Accordingly, the Directors believe that no bad debt provision is required (2008: £nil).

(i) Bank loans consist of two separate term loans. They are secured by a first charge over all undertakings and assets of the Group. The 
weighted average interest rate paid in 2009 was 9.84% (2008: 8.76%). The original term loan bears interest based on a fixed rate of
5.33% plus a risk margin of 3.35%. At 31 December 2009 £760,000 was drawn on this loan and is being repaid on a monthly basis with 
final payment due in April 2011. The second loan, of £1,000,000, was drawn during the year and bears interest at 10% over HBOS bank 
rate. This loan is repayable in 60 instalments commencing in April 2011.
 At the year end the Group was in breach of the net worth covenant attached to the original term loan. This breach has been waived 
subsequent to the year end, but in accordance with IAS1 the amount outstanding on the loan is shown as current. The amount of the loan 
consequently shown as current but actually to be paid in 2011 is £242,000.
(ii) Finance lease liabilities are secured by the assets leased. The average lease term is five years. For the year ended 31 December 2009, the 
average effective borrowing rate was 7.9% (2008: 8.8%). Interest rates are fixed at the contract date. All leases are on a fixed repayment 
basis and no arrangements have been entered into for contingent rental payments.
(iii) The invoice discounting facility is secured on the trade receivables of HTEC Limited and bears interest at an effective rate of 6% (2008: 6%).
(iv) The Directors and management loans are unsecured and bear interest at 15% (2008: 15%).
All borrowings are denominated in sterling.
The Directors consider that the carrying amount of the bank loans and finance lease obligations approximates to their fair value.
At 31 December 2009, the Group had available £100,000 (2008: £310,700) of undrawn committed borrowing facilities in respect of which all 
conditions precedent had been met.
The bank overdraft and bank loans are secured by a debenture over the assets of the Group and are subject to certain covenants in respect
of interest cover, cash flow cover and net asset value.

The revised IFRS7 requires that an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped 
into Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable, is given. The levels are as follows:
 l Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 l Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the 
asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and
 l Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not
based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
The Group’s financial instruments, recognised at fair value, all fall into the Level 1 categorisation.
Financial risk management objectives
The Group’s operations expose it to a variety of risks including the effect of changes in interest rates on debt, credit risk and liquidity risk. In 
2009 the Group did not have significant risk on foreign currency.
Neither the Company nor the Group has material exposures in any of the areas identified above and consequently they do not use derivative 
instruments to manage these exposures.
Market risk
The activities of the Company and Group primarily expose them to the financial risks of changes in interest rates (see below). The Group does 
transact business in euros and US dollars but at approximately 10% of turnover the exchange risk is small.
Interest rate management
The Company and the Group are exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at floating interest rates. The Group 
continually reviews the appropriateness of fixing interest rates on its borrowings.
The Company and the Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk 
management section of this note.
Interest rate sensitivity
The sensitivity analysis below has been determined based on the exposure to interest on the financial instrument balances at the reporting 
date and the stipulated change taking place at the beginning of the financial year and held constant throughout the reporting period.
At the reporting date, if interest rates had been 1% higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group and Company’s net
loss and equity reserves for the year ended 31 December 2009 would increase/decrease by £11,000 (2008: £8,000). This is mainly
attributable to the Group and Company’s exposure to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings. A 1% movement in basis points has been 
used as this provides a benchmark against which to measure any future interest rate movements.

Credit risk
Credit risk refers to the risk that a counterparty will default on its contractual obligations resulting in financial loss to the Group. The Group’s 
policy is to only deal with creditworthy counterparties, carrying out background checks before any new accounts are opened so as to mitigate 
the risk of financial loss from defaults. The Group’s exposure and the credit ratings of its counterparties are monitored regularly with no 
significant concentration of credit risk with a single counterparty. Credit exposure is controlled by counterparty limits that are reviewed and 
approved by senior management as and when necessary, but at a minimum annually.
The carrying amount of financial assets recorded in the financial statements, net of any allowances for losses, represents the Group’s 
maximum exposure to credit risk.
Liquidity risk management
Ultimate responsibility for liquidity risk management rests with the Board of Directors, which reviews and manages the Group’s short and 
medium-term funding and liquidity requirements on a regular basis. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves, 
banking facilities and reserve borrowing facilities by regularly monitoring forecast and actual cash flows whilst attempting to match the 
maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities.
As noted within the Directors’ Report on page 15, there were breaches of the loan covenant during the year that were waived by the bank.
One of the key liquidity risks is to ensure ongoing compliance with banking covenants. Subsequent to the year end the bank have removed all 
covenants from the loan facilities.
The following table details the Company and the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its non-derivative financial liabilities. The table has 
been drawn up based on the undiscounted contractual maturities of the financial liabilities including interest that will accrue to those liabilities.

27. Capital and Other Financial Commitments
As at 31st December 2009 the Group had not entered into any contracts for future capital expenditure (2008: nil).
28. Share-based Payments
Summary of share option schemes in operation during the year
The Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 13 describes the plans to which IFRS2 applies. In summary, the Group operated the following 
plans during the period:
 l Enterprise Management Incentive (‘EMI’) Plan
 l Discretionary Unapproved Share Option Plan
 l The Group recognised a total expense of £nil in 2009 (2008: £nil).
Equity-settled share option schemes
The exercise price of options granted under the EMI and unapproved share option plans was set at the market value at the date of grant, that 
is the price which equates to the closing middle market quotation for the shares on AIM on the date of grant. Consequently, no table of 
assumptions is shown below.
The options are not subject to any performance conditions and vested immediately upon grant. Where options remain unexercised after a 
period of ten years from the date of grant the options expire. Moreover, the options will lapse in the case of termination of employment,
subject to the good leaver provisions or the Remuneration Committee exercising its discretion to permit options to be exercised.
The total number of shares under option is as follows:
  Weighted

Unapproved share options No. £

31. Prior Year Adjustments
(1) Goodwill
The Group has restated the carrying value of goodwill associated with the HTEC subsidiary. This is as a result of the adoption of IFRS8 which
requires goodwill to be allocated to operating segments.
The transitional provisions of IFRS8 permitted the allocation of goodwill as at 1st January 2007, the date at which the Group introduced 
segmental reporting of the three segments currently recognised within the HTEC subsidiary.
Goodwill has been allocated based upon value in use calculations for the three segments reflecting their operational cash flows in 2007.
The results of this exercise are to allocate goodwill and the subsequent impairment across the segments as follows:
 PFSManufacturing UDS Total
£’000 £’000 £’000 £’000
At 31 December 2007  9,228 6,334 1,688 17,250
Impairment  — (5,100) — (5,100)
Carrying value at 31 December 2007  9,228 1,234 1,688 12,150
Impairment testing of these balances indicates that a £5.1 million write-off of goodwill in the manufacturing segment would have been 
required as at 31st December 2007, and this has been booked as a prior year period adjustment to the closing reserves at 31st December 
2007. Consequently, the balance sheet at 31st December 2007 on page 22 has been restated as it arises from the adoption of a new 
accounting standard. This gives rise to the restatement of previous year’s net assets as follows:
Goodwill and
profit and loss
reserve
£’000
Adjustment to opening net assets at 1 January 2008 and January 2009  (5,100)
(2) Categorisation of costs
The introduction of IFRS8 Segmental Reporting led to a review of cost classifications. Consequently, the Group will now recognise the cost of its 
software engineering department as a component of cost of sales. In previous years these costs have been included within administrative 
expenses and the comparative information for the year ended 31st December 2008 has been restated to reflect this revised treatment. This 
gives rise to the restatement of prior year cost of sales and administrative expenses as follows:
 Before Exceptional 2008
exceptional items items Total
£’000 £’000 £’000
(Increase) in cost of sales  (970) — (970)
Decrease in administrative expenses  970 — 970

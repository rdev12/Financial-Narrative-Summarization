Financial Highlights On 3 December 2008, the Court of Appeal ﬁnally put an end to the Serious Fraud Ofﬁce’s endeavour
to prosecute the Company. Despite the outcome being positive the persistence and length of the
litigation, over six years, have caused damage to the reputation of the Group. It is a credit to the
management that through this turbulent time the business has delivered strong growth, proﬁts and
cash ﬂows. The Board is committed to continue to build its market position by providing quality
service and products, and focusing on strengthening mutually beneﬁcial business partnerships with
the Company’s stakeholders.
Our refocus on the Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health product businesses has delivered
encouraging results. During the year, senior managers have devoted a signiﬁcant amount of time to
restructure the business and upgrade its systems and processes for future growth. The systems
upgrade with a majority of SAP systems and processes implementation is due for completion by the
end of this calendar year.
The pharmaceutical side of our business continues to provide good margins and we are actively
pursuing the introduction of new products to ensure that this continues. Our Consumer Health
business remains “work in progress” and is undergoing strategic changes. There are encouraging
positive signs from the sale of our branded weight management products.
We also have developed strategies to increase our market share in the territories we cover outside
the UK and bring new quality products to the consumer in a more cost effective and efﬁcient way.
I hope to report positive progress during the course of the current ﬁnancial year.
We are in a very sound ﬁnancial position with substantial cash balance of £27.5 million and no
debt. We intend to spend our cash reserves on new product introductions, creating brands in the
future and paying dividends.
The Group has strengthened its corporate governance by having a strong non-executive Director
presence on the Board and a newly appointed CFO, Ram Swamy. We are fully committed to continue
to improve our corporate governance platform; for example, this year we launched our risk
management assessment program across the Group.
I am pleased to inform you that Kirti V. Patel has agreed to rejoin the Board as Group Executive
Director in August 2009. Kirti has been closely associated with the Company from its inception,
most recently as strategic advisor. I am conﬁdent Kirti’s undoubted knowledge and standing within
the pharmaceutical industry will add much value to our future success.
After a successful last ﬁnancial year, we have had an encouraging start to the current ﬁnancial year
but we expect to face a more challenging economic environment in the short-term future. I am
conﬁdent that Goldshield is a Group which can grow further, with the support of its dedicated
employees.
Dr. Keith Hellawell QPM
Chairman

Chairman’s Overview 5
I am pleased to report another encouraging performance across the Group for the year ended 31
March 2009. Our efforts to concentrate on the core Pharmaceuticals and Consumer Health
businesses have proved successful and have delivered Group revenues of £98.4 million, an increase
of 15.9% over 2008 (£84.9million) or 12.2% at constant exchange rates. Our proﬁt before tax and
exceptionals was £20.0 million (2008: £13.2 million), excluding a credit of £2.1 million in relation
to litigation costs (2008: charge of £0.3 million) and a £0.7 million non-cash impairment charge
(2008: £0.7 million). Earnings per share were 39.7 pence (2008: 16.9 pence). During the year,
the Group generated cash of £12.9 million from operating activities (2008: £4.8 million), and we
ﬁnished the year with £27.5 million of cash (2008: £19.2 million). I am delighted to report that
we have proposed to increase the ﬁnal dividend to 5.8 pence, which brings the total dividend to 8.7
pence (2008: 8.0 pence), an increase of 8.8%.
Our pharmaceuticals product portfolio has performed well with sales of £73.8 million (2008: £63.8
million) and operating proﬁt of £23.8 million (2008: £14.0 million) beneﬁting from a combination
of favourable product mix and operational efﬁciencies. Despite this encouraging performance, the
Pharmaceuticals business is facing increasing regulatory costs and pricing pressure on its branded
pharmaceuticals products sold to the NHS due to the Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme. This
has a 3.9% price reduction effective as of February 2009 and further 1.9% price reduction as of
January 2010.
Sales from the Consumer Health business are up to £23.5 million (2008: £19.2 million) reﬂecting,
in particular, a strong performance by our two leading weight management products: Lipobind and
Appesat. However, the Consumer Health business incurred an operating loss of £4.7 million (2008:
loss of £1.6 million) due to a challenging market environment and increased investment in brand
building. The product lines have been rationalised, a number of non-core product areas have been
closed and the division has been restructured, resulting in non-recurring costs last year in the region
of £1 million. While we believe that this division has good long term prospects, especially in weight
management and joints & mobility, further work is required to build a sustainable business and we
expect the division to continue to be loss-making in the current ﬁnancial year.
Our decision to restructure our US business by strengthening the direct sales has shown encouraging
performance. It is our intention to operate in our core markets - Europe and North America - and
invest in new products and our marketing capabilities.
During the year we have made major efforts to improve efﬁciency with a rationalisation of our
product base and a review and reorganisation of processes to strengthen our operational platform.
In line with this, we are implementing SAP business management systems. I expect the majority of
systems and processes integration to be complete by the end of the calendar year.
We have made signiﬁcant progress in strengthening our senior management in the areas of quality,
regulatory, technical and medical affairs which will greatly assist us in supporting and growing our
product-focused business. As already mentioned in the Chairman’s report I am pleased to welcome
Kirti Patel back to the Group Board. He will be a valuable addition to the Group.
A detailed business review is provided on pages 11 to 13 in the Report of the Directors.
This is an exciting period for the Group. We remain committed to the development of lifestyle
consumer health brands and the introduction of new pharmaceutical products. Our strong balance
sheet allows us to be conﬁdent of weathering the economic downturn and our cash ﬂow and cash
reserves facilitate our commitment to grow the business. We intend to use our resources to invest
Chief Executive Officer’s Operating Review 6
in new product introductions via development, in-licensing and acquisitions together with building
brands. Long term sustainable growth is an area that is at the forefront of our objectives and I am
conﬁdent we can maximise value for our shareholders.
The past year has been one of a major change for the Group and I would like to extend my gratitude
to the entire staff at Goldshield for their hard work and commitment.

Chief Executive Officer’s Operating Review
(continued) 7
Revenue
The revenue for the year grew by 15.9% to £98.4 million (2008: £84.9 million).
Revenues in the UK and Western Europe have increased to £89.8 million (2008: £77.6 million)
primarily due to increase in sales by all the units of Pharmaceutical division and through the Retail
distribution channel of Consumer Health division.
Revenues in North America grew by 29.4% to £6.6 million (2008: £5.1 million) due to an upswing
in the Canadian business, growth of active customers and favourable currency translations.
Gross proﬁt
The Group’s gross proﬁt for the year was £68.2 million (2008: £57.5 million). The gross margin
achieved was 69.3% (2008: 67.7%).
Earnings and operating results
The Group Earnings before Tax, Amortisation, Impairment and Exceptional costs (EBTA) were £24.2
million (2008: £17.5 million) a growth of 38.3%. The reconciliation to the Group’s operating proﬁt
is given below:
2009 2008
£’million £’million
Operating profit 20.2 11.2
Amortisation 4.3 4.3
Impairment losses 0.7 0.5
Exceptional legal and professional costs (2.1) 0.3
Finance income 1.1 1.2
EBTA 24.2 17.5
The Group operating proﬁt was £20.2 million (2008: £11.2 million) representing a margin of
20.5% (2008: 13.2%). The operating proﬁt is stated after:
• Exceptional legal and professional costs in connection with the Serious Fraud Ofﬁce and
Department of Health litigation, credit of £2.1 million (2008: charge of £0.3 million).
• Impairment in relation to the goodwill of the Regina Health Limited business and property, plant
and equipment of the Well Being Centre at Ahmedabad and Consumer Health Direct business in
India amounting to £0.7 million (2008: £0.5 million).
Research and development expenditure
Research and development expenditure incurred and written off directly to the income statement
was £0.7 million (2008: £0.3 million). As at 31 March 2009 the Group does not have any capitalised
development expenditure (2008: £nil).
Taxation
The taxation charge of £7.4 million (2008: £6.1 million) represents an effective tax rate 34.9%
(2008: 49.6%). The tax charge is higher than the standard rate principally as a result of tax
disallowance on amortisation, impairment, other expenses and the tax losses of some of our
overseas business which are not available to be offset against proﬁts elsewhere in the Group.
The deferred tax credit included in the tax charge was £0.4 million (2008: Deferred tax charge of
£0.2 million). The deferred tax credit is due to the temporary difference on account of amortisation
of intangible assets.
Report of the Chief Financial Officer Earnings and dividends
Basic earnings per share is 39.7 pence (2008: 16.9 pence) and the diluted earnings per share is
39.7 pence (2008: earnings of 16.9 pence).
The Directors propose a dividend of 5.8 pence per share (2008: 5.5 pence).
The dividend paid during the year was 8.4 pence (2008: 7.6 pence). The proposed dividend will
be subject to approval at the Annual General Meeting, to be held on 5 August 2009, and is expected
to be paid on 19 August 2009 to Ordinary Shareholders on the register at the close of business on
24 July 2009.
Cash ﬂow and liquidity
During the year the Group generated £12.9 million from operating activities (2008: £4.8 million).
The primary use of the operating cash was to meet increased working capital needs of the business
and payment of corporation tax and dividends to shareholders. The Group has not bought back any
shares during the year (In 2008 it used £4.67 million to buy back 1,650,000 shares which have
subsequently been held as Treasury Shares). In addition, the Group has expended £1.4 million on
property, plant and equipment (2008: £1.2 million) and an amount of £1.0 million towards
purchase and implementation of Enterprise Resource Planning (ERP) software costs. The Group also
funded the Employee Beneﬁt Trust (EBT) for the purchase of shares to be used for the Group’s
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) amounting to £0.8 million (2008: £1.9 million).
The Group ended the year with a cash balance of £27.5 million (2008: £19.2 million). The Group
deployed its cash surpluses in money market instruments, earning interest income for the year. The
average rate of interest earned on short term deposits during the year was 5.7% (2008: 6.8%).

The Group operating proﬁt was £20.2 million (2008: £11.2 million) representing a margin of
20.5% (2008: 13.2%). The operating proﬁt is stated after:
• Exceptional legal and professional costs in connection with the Serious Fraud Ofﬁce and
Department of Health litigation, credit of £2.1 million (2008: charge of £0.3 million).
• Impairment in relation to the goodwill of the Regina Health Limited business and property, plant

India amounting to £0.7 million (2008: £0.5 million).
Research and development expenditure
Research and development expenditure incurred and written off directly to the income statement
was £0.7 million (2008: £0.3 million). As at 31 March 2009 the Group does not have any
capitalised development expenditure (2008: £nil).
Taxation
The taxation charge of £7.4 million (2008: £6.1 million) represents an effective tax rate 34.9%
(2008: 49.6%). The tax charge is higher than the standard rate principally as a result of tax
disallowance on amortisation, impairment, other expenses and the tax losses of some of our
overseas businesses which are not available to be offset against proﬁts elsewhere in the Group.
The deferred tax credit included in the tax charge was £0.4 million (2008: Deferred tax charge of

Report of the Directors
(continued) 13
Pharmaceuticals division
The Pharmaceuticals division achieved total sales of £73.8 million (2008: £63.8 million)
representing 15.7% growth. The operating proﬁt was £23.8 million (2008: £14.0 million), an
increase of 70.0%. The business beneﬁted from product portfolio mix and efﬁcient operational
platform across the Group.
Our European retail brand business achieved sales of £43.0 million (2008: £36.6 million), an
increase of 17.5% in sales. The increase is attributable to improvements in our service levels and
growth in our pain and anti-infective products portfolios well above our expectations. However,
increasing pressure across Europe by authorities to reduce the reimbursement cost of medicines has
impacted our growth.
Our Hospitals business in Europe recorded sales of £13.3 million (2008: £12.6 million), an
increase of 5.6% in sales. Synopsis, our osteoarthritis pain management product, was launched in
March 2009. Business increased by winning more contract lines on the national tenders in England,
Wales and Northern Ireland.
Retail generics achieved sales of £11.5 million (2008: £9.3 million), an increase of 23.6%.
The business has beneﬁted from product rationalisation initiatives and better operational efﬁciencies.
Country distributors’ business achieved sales of £5.9 million (2008: £5.3 million), an increase of
11.3% delivered by better sales of existing products into our existing markets.
Consumer Health division
The Consumer Health division recorded sales of £23.5 million (2008: £19.2 million) representing
an increase of 22.4% over the previous year. The increase is mainly attributed to increased sales of
our branded products via retail channel. However, the business incurred losses of £4.7 million due
to challenging market conditions and extensive investment in brand building (2008: loss of
£1.6 million). In addition, during the year we have discontinued our Consumer Health Direct
business in India and closed our last Wellbeing clinic in Ahmedabad in line with our product-focused
long term strategy. Our primary focus in the future remains to grow our European and North-
American businesses.
Brand building efforts were focused on two top selling brands in the Weight Management category:
Appesat was introduced in 2009 while maintaining the growth of Lipobind. We are committed to
develop and launch new branded products in the lifestyle consumer health segments, particularly in
weight management and joints & mobility.
European Direct to Consumer business achieved sales of £11.6 million (2008: £11.1 million), an
increase of 4.5% beneﬁting from extended distribution network via direct to consumer and the web.
Consumer Health Retail Europe achieved sales of £4.7 million (2008: £2.7 million), an increase of
74.0%. The year witnessed establishing new partnerships with a wider range of national accounts
and retailers, and completion of product rationalisation.
North America business achieved sales of £6.6 million (2008: £5.1 million), an increase of 29.4%.
The improvement is attributable to the change in the management structure, focus on the Direct
Sales in the operating business model and positive impact of currency translation.
Future outlook and strategy
Our strategy to move back to the Group’s core strengths of marketing pharmaceutical products and
developing lifestyle consumer health brands has delivered good results. Supporting restructuring
of the business divisions is carried out with focus on product portfolio mix, efﬁcient processes
and systems, and long term growth and proﬁtability. Our SAP (Enterprise Resource Planning)
implementation program remains on schedule. We anticipate that the majority of systems and
processes integration will be completed by this calendar year. We are committed to continue to
invest in product development, marketing and brand building across the Group.
Report of the Directors

Principal risks and uncertainties
The management of the business and the nature of Group’s strategy are subject to a number of risks.
Capacity constraints of suppliers of key products
The planned sales growth of some of our key pharmaceutical products may be impacted due to
capacity constraints of our suppliers, the availability of Active Pharmaceutical Ingredients and receipt
of timely approvals of Marketing Authorisations. The senior management is working on initiatives to
mitigate these risks in order to deliver the forecasted sales growth.
Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risks arising from various
currency exposures, primarily with respect to the US dollar and EURO. Wherever relevant, the
agreements with suppliers provide for remedy due to variation in exchange rates beyond a threshold
limit.
Economic downturn
The success of the Consumer Health business is reliant on consumer spending. The current
economic downturn, resulting in a reduction of consumer spending power, will have an impact on
the sales achieved by the Group.
The Group keeps abreast of economic conditions; marketing and pricing strategies will be modiﬁed
to reﬂect the changes in market conditions.
High proportion of ﬁxed overheads and variable revenues
A large proportion of the Group’s overheads are ﬁxed. There is the risk that any signiﬁcant changes
in revenue may lead to the inability to cover such costs.
Senior management closely monitors ﬁxed overheads against budget on a monthly basis and cost
saving exercises is implemented when there is an anticipated decline in revenues.
Competition
The market in which the Group operates is highly competitive. As a result there is a constant
downward pressure on margins and the additional risk of being unable to meet customers’
expectations. Policies of constant price monitoring, ongoing market research and customer
relationship management frameworks are in place to mitigate such risks.
Pharmaceutical Price Regulation Scheme (PPRS)
PPRS changes have resulted in a 3.9% price reduction effective as of February 2009 and a further
1.9% price reduction as of January 2010.
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a
going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders and beneﬁts for stakeholders. Consistent
with others in the industry and of its size, the Group believes that an optimum capital structure is
currently achieved entirely through equity and with no net debt. Total equity at 31 March 2009 was
£52.0 million (2008: £39.4 million).
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends
paid to shareholders, issue new shares or raise future funds through debt.
The capital structure of the Company, and the rights and obligations attaching to shares in the
Company, are detailed in note 12 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Essential contracts
The Group’s performance is largely reliant on sourcing high quality products at the lowest possible
prices. Whilst price is important, the Directors do not believe that lowering price is an acceptable
alternative to producing quality products. The Group has beneﬁted from a number of contracts with
suppliers which have proved essential in enabling the Group to deliver quality products at the lowest
possible price.
Report of the Directors
(continued) 15
In addition the Group has a number of members of staff who, due to their knowledge of the Group
and its intellectual property, are essential to the continued smooth running of the business. The Group
reviews its employment policies at regular intervals, including a review of its performance-related pay
policies, so as to ensure these members of staff continue to remain incentivised and their goals remain
congruent with those of the Group. All employment contracts contain non-compete agreements. All
employment contracts also stipulate that all intellectual property remains that of the Group.

Group employees
The Group’s employees are fundamental to the future success of the business. Regular training
programmes are offered to new recruits and existing members of staff. Annual staff satisfaction
surveys are undertaken to ensure that the training programs and other staff initiatives meet the
needs of staff.
To ensure the aspirations of employees are congruent with the objectives of the Group, all employees
are incentivised based on performance. The success of the Group is dependent upon the quality and
performance of its employees and the Group continues to ensure this through continuous training
and development, facilitated by Investors in People. The Group has also enhanced its performance
evaluation process supported by SAP .
Information about the Group’s activities is regularly communicated to all employees through an
internal web-site called the ‘Grapevine’.
It is the policy of the Group to give full and fair consideration of the employment of disabled persons
in jobs suited to their individual circumstances and, as appropriate, to consider them for recruitment
opportunities, career development and training where possible, arrangements are made for the
continuing employment of employees who become disabled whilst in Group’s employment.

Employee sharesave scheme
An employee sharesave scheme is open to all eligible employees. Under the terms of the scheme
the Directors may offer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to employees who enter
into an HM Revenue & Customs approved sharesave contract. The price of each share option is at
a discount of 20% from the market price at the date of granting the options. Options may normally
be exercised during the period of six months after the completion of the sharesave contract.
Share options
During the year no new share options were granted to employees. Details of the options granted to
date are set out in note 12 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The Company has also introduced a LTIP to select senior management personnel (including the
executive Directors). The awards under the LTIP are based on performance targets to be achieved
in terms of Earnings Per Share and Total Shareholders Return.
Details of the Directors’ Share Options and LTIP awards are shown in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report on page 29.
Charitable and political donations

year end amount to 33 days’ purchases (2008: 38 days).
Auditor
Grant Thornton UK LLP have expressed willingness to continue in ofﬁce. In accordance with section
489 (4) of the Companies Act 2006 a resolution to re-appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP will be
proposed at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 5 August 2009. 17
Annual General Meeting (AGM)
It is proposed that the next AGM of the Company will be held on 5 August 2009, at 10.00 am,
notice of which is set out on pages 68 to 70. In addition to the proposed resolutions to receive the
Report and Accounts, declare a dividend, re-appoint Directors in accordance with the Company’s
Articles of Association, to appoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as Auditor and to authorise the Directors
to ﬁx the Auditor’s remuneration, and to approve the Remuneration Report, it is proposed that the
following business be transacted:
Directors’ authority to allot securities (Resolution 8 - Ordinary resolution)
The Directors seek to renew this authority each year at the AGM. The effect of resolution 8 is to
grant to the Directors authority to allot new securities limited to an aggregate nominal amount of
£581,378 representing approximately one third of the Company’s issued share capital as at 31
March 2009 (being the date of the Company’s last Annual Accounts). This renewed authority would
remain in force for 15 months from the passing of the resolution or, if earlier, until the next AGM.
Disapplication of pre-emption rights (Resolution 9 - Special resolution)
The Directors seek to renew this authority each year at the AGM. Under the Companies Act 1985,
shareholders have “rights of pre-emption” in relation to the issue of equity securities. This means
that if new shares in the Company are to be offered for subscription for cash they must ﬁrst be
offered to the existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings at the time of such offer. The
Companies Act requires that the Directors seek the approval of the shareholders if they wish to
disapply these rights. The Directors are seeking authority to disapply pre-emption rights over
1,760,135 equity securities, representing approximately 5% of the issued share capital of the
Company as at 31 March 2009. This renewed authority would remain in force for 15 months from
the passing of the resolution or, if earlier, until the next AGM.
Company’s authority to purchase its own shares (Resolution 10 - Special resolution)
The Directors are seeking to renew the authority for the Company to purchase in the open market
up to 10% of the issued share capital of the Company. The Company undertakes that it will, if the
resolution is passed, only exercise such authority to buy back its own shares if such purchase would
have the effect of increasing the earnings per share and if they believed that to do so would be in
the best interests of the shareholders generally.
If the resolution is passed the Company will be authorised to buy in one transaction or any number
of transactions an aggregate maximum of 3,488,271 shares, representing approximately 10% of the
issued share capital of the Company as at 19 June 2009 (being the latest practicable date prior to
publication of the Notice of AGM).
The maximum price the Company will be permitted to pay will be equal to 5% above the average
middle market quotations for the ﬁve business days preceding the transaction and the minimum
price will be 5 pence (being the nominal value of the shares).
The total number of options to subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding as at 19 June 2009 was
130,284 representing approximately 0.37% of the issued share capital of the Company at such date.
If the authority to purchase shares were to be exercised in full, the total number of options to
subscribe for ordinary shares outstanding as at 19 June 2009 would represent 0.32% of the issued
share capital (assuming no other further ordinary shares were issued after that date).
Notice of General Meetings (Resolution 11 – Special resolution)
The Shareholder Rights Directive is intended to be implemented in the UK in August of this year.
One of the requirements of the Directive is that all general meetings must be held on 21 days’ notice
unless shareholders agree to a shorter notice period. The Company is currently able to call general
meetings (other than annual general meetings and general meetings for the passing of special
resolutions) on 14 days’ notice and would like to preserve this ability. In order to be able to do so
after August 2009, shareholders must have approved the calling of general meetings (other than
Report of the Directors
(continued) annual general meetings or general meetings for the passing of special resolutions) on 14 clear days’
notice. We are proposing resolution 11 at the AGM to seek this approval. The approval will be
effective until the Company’s next annual general meeting when it is intended that a similar
resolution will be proposed.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year which
give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the parent Company and the Group as at the end
of the ﬁnancial year and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for the ﬁnancial year. Under that law the
Directors are required to prepare the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International
Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs). The Directors have
elected to prepare the parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP). In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the
Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent
• for the Group ﬁnancial statements, state whether applicable IFRSs have been followed, subject to
any material departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements;
• for the parent Company ﬁnancial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial
statements;
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume
that the Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable
accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the
ﬁnancial statements comply with the Companies Act. They are also responsible for safeguarding the
assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of
fraud and other irregularities.
In so far as the Directors are aware:
• there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and
• the Directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any
relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Responsibility statement required by Disclosure and Transparency Rules
To the best of our knowledge:
• the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards,
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
• the management report includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business
and the position of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

The Company is controlled through its Board of Directors. The Board comprises the non-executive
Chairman and two other non-executive Directors, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the Chief Financial
Ofﬁcer and one other executive Director. The Board’s main roles are to create value for shareholders,
to approve the Company’s strategic objectives and to ensure that the necessary ﬁnancial and other
resources are made available to enable them to meet those objectives. Speciﬁc responsibilities
reserved to the Board include: setting Group strategy, reviewing operational and ﬁnancial
performance, approving major acquisitions, divestments and capital expenditure; approving
appointments to the Board and the Company Secretary, approving policies relating to Directors
remuneration and the severance of Directors’ contracts; and ensuring that a satisfactory dialogue
takes place with shareholders.
The executive Directors of the Board are:
Rakesh V Patel
Ajay M Patel
Ram Swamy
All the above executive Directors submit themselves for re-election at least every three years and at the
ﬁrst AGM after appointment.

Nick Woollacott is the Senior independent non-executive Director and also chairs the Audit Committee.
Paul Edwards MBE is another independent non-executive Director and also chairs the Remuneration
Committee.
The Board met 9 times during the year under review. At each meeting the Board receives reports from
the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and other Directors and senior management as required.
The Board has three Committees, whose terms of reference can be inspected by prior arrangement at

scope, results and cost effectiveness of the audit, any changes in accounting policies and
procedures, the judgmental decisions affecting ﬁnancial reporting, compliance with accounting
standards and with the Companies Act and considering the auditors’ comments on internal controls
and management’s response. The Audit Committee monitors the nature and extent of non-audit
services provided by the auditors to ensure their independence and objectivity is maintained.

the Chairman, the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer and the Company Secretary.
The Committee considers the Group’s annual and interim ﬁnancial statements and any questions
raised by the auditors on the statements and ﬁnancial systems.
During the year, the Audit Committee met twice and reviewed the Group’s draft ﬁnancial statements
and interim results statement prior to Board approval and considered the external auditors’ detailed
reports thereon. The Committee also reviewed the performance of the in-house internal audit
function. The audit plan is independently drawn up by the in-house internal audit department and
discussed with the Audit Committee for adequacy of coverage. The Audit Committee also directs the
internal audit department to carry out speciﬁc assignments. The internal audit reports are given to
the operating heads, and are also independently discussed with the Audit Committee for their
feedback and suggestions which are then implemented upon.
The Group’s auditors, Grant Thornton UK LLP , provide some non-audit services. The majority of
these are compliance services on various taxation issues within the Group, and do not compromise
their independence as auditors. The level of non-audit fees (which are less than the audit fees) are
reviewed annually by the Committee.
Remuneration Committee

Shareholder relations
The Chairman and the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer meet and telephone institutional shareholders to
discuss the Group’s strategy and ﬁnancial performance. Efforts are made to keep shareholders
informed through analysts’ meetings, road shows and soundings taken from individual shareholders
as and when required.
All shareholders can gain access to information about the Group, including the annual report,
through the Goldshield website www.goldshieldplc.com.
Risk management and internal controls
The Directors acknowledge their responsibility for the Group’s system of internal controls. The intent
is to manage risk rather than eliminate it and controls cannot provide an absolute assurance against
material misstatement or loss. Decision on key issues is taken by the Board keeping in mind the
possible risks associated with the situation and ability of the Group to manage those risks effectively.
The key features of the Group’s systems of internal controls are as follows:
• Control environment: short and direct lines of responsibility are designed to ensure that business
risks are communicated for prompt review. The performance of each business unit is reviewed at
regular monthly meetings. The full Board also reviews the same at regular Board meetings held at
least six times each year. A period of at least ﬁve days each year is set aside for strategic planning
and assessment of risks affecting the Group attended by senior managers from all parts of the
Group when matters of strategic importance are discussed with speciﬁc emphasis on training and
development. Further, the Board meets every quarter for a two day strategic meeting during which
the Board evaluates the strategic direction and performance of the Group.
• Operating procedures: key quality and ﬁnancial controls are documented as operating procedures
setting out responsibilities and ﬁnancial authority levels.
• Budgeting: a comprehensive budgeting procedure is followed. The Chief Financial Ofﬁcer presents
an annual forecast at Group level for discussion and agreement by the Board.
• Information systems: the Group’s accounting systems are backed up and scaleable to meet
business needs.
Sufﬁcient precautions are taken to retain the processed data in an off-site location, which forms part
of the disaster recovery program followed by the Group. The Group has selected SAP as the
Enterprise Resource Planning software which is on schedule to be implemented by the end of the
calendar year.
A regular review takes place with the Group insurance brokers to assess the adequacy of the Group’s
insurance cover in the face of operational and other risks of the business.
The Board fully recognises the importance of adopting appropriate risk and control measures. The
Group has initiated steps in introducing a risk management program with a requirement to have
speciﬁc risk management objectives for key associates. The Audit Committee has reviewed the annual
report from the in-house internal audit function and is satisﬁed with the scope and quality of audit work
taken up in different areas of operational controls and the work undertaken to compile a comprehensive
Risk Register. The Committee also reviews the internal audit reports keeping in mind the need to take
remedial actions on signiﬁcant audit ﬁndings pursuant to C.2.1 of the Combined Code.
Going concern
After considering the plans of the Group for the forthcoming year and after making enquiries, the
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in
operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the ﬁnancial statements. An explanation of the Group’s cash ﬂow position
at 31 March 2009 is set out on page 35.
Corporate Governance Report
(continued)
22 23
Goldshield is committed to being a socially responsible corporate citizen.
Environment
Measures to save energy and ﬁnite resources are taken where practicable; in particular relating to
controlled use of energy, paper and other resources. The Board does not consider it appropriate to
implement a detailed environmental policy for its activities given that it does not itself manufacture
products. The Board does however share current concerns on environmental issues and will where
possible ensure that its activities are carried out in an environmentally friendly manner. The Group
has partnered with TREES FOR THE FUTURE, INC., in 2008. T .F .T .F . is a non-proﬁt organisation
dedicated to helping people of the world’s poorest communities to begin environmentally beneﬁcial,
self-help projects. Through this partnership, Goldshield has planted 39,757 trees around the world.
Health and safety
The Board aims to take due and proper care of risks to the health, safety and welfare of its
employees taking into account the differences that apply to legislative requirements in the different
countries where it operates. Particular attention is paid to ﬁre drills and other safety procedures in
establishments operated by the Group.
Ethics
The Group has policies on business practices, receipt of gifts, use of the internet and whistle
blowing. The Group realises that its reputation depends on adopting ethical and socially responsible
procedures and will encourage adoption of necessary employment, health and safety and other
appropriate procedures to meet this objective.
Employment
The Group employs over 900 employees worldwide based in the United Kingdom and India,
principally, and in other countries. Our success depends on the skills and attitude of our employees.
Our human resource strategies are aimed at ensuring that employees are trained to be competent to
fulﬁl their roles and with an opportunity to develop to their full potential. Emphasis is placed on
sharing knowledge for the beneﬁt of employees and the Group.
The Group operates in an international market and we believe all employees shall be treated with
dignity and respect. Decisions relating to recruitment, development, promotion and training of
individual employees are based on an objective assessment of skills and job requirements.
Community involvement
Employees are encouraged to make contributions to charities and other community causes and
collections are regularly made for charitable purposes. The Group is involved making donations of
medicine to charities and securing the environment by planting trees.

Directors’ Remuneration Report
Introduction
This report has been prepared in accordance with the requirements of Schedule 7A to the
Companies Act 1985 (as amended by the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002). It
also describes the Company's compliance with the Combined Code of Corporate Governance in
relation to remuneration matters.
The report is divided into two parts. The ﬁrst part contains commentary of the remuneration policy
which is not required to be audited. The second part contains the remuneration tables which have
been audited in accordance with the relevant statutory requirements.
Section 1: Information not subject to audit
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the Committee) is comprised of independent non-executive Directors.
The Committee is chaired by Paul Edwards MBE. None of the Committee members has any personal
ﬁnancial interest in the matters to be decided, nor potential conﬂicts of interest arising from cross
directorships nor any day-to-day involvement in the running of the business.
The role of the Committee is to recommend to the Board the policy for the remuneration of the
Company Chairman, the executive Directors and the management tier below Board level.
The Committee invites the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer and other executive Directors to attend its
meetings when appropriate although no person is present for any discussion or decision relating to
their personal remuneration. The Committee receives external advice from Hewitt New Bridge Street.
The Committee met twice during the course of the year. Its terms of reference are available from the
Company Secretary on request.
Remuneration Policy
The Committee aims to ensure that Directors’ remuneration is fair and in line with market rates in
comparable companies. Incentive schemes are designed to provide rewards for achieving objectives
that will increase shareholder value. A signiﬁcant proportion of remuneration is performance-related.
The table below summarises each key element of Executive Director's Remuneration:
In setting the remuneration policy for executive Directors, the Committee considers how packages
compare with remuneration for employees across the Company more generally. The Committee also
has discretion to consider corporate performance on environmental, social and governance (ESG)
issues when setting the remuneration of executive Directors. The Committee does not believe that
ESG risks are inadvertently raised by the remuneration structure currently in place.
The remuneration policy is reviewed annually by the Committee.

Elements of Remuneration
Base Salary
Executive Directors’ base salaries are reviewed annually by the Committee taking into account the
responsibilities, skills and experience of each individual, and the salary levels within companies of
similar size in the pharmaceutical and healthcare sectors and the executive Director market generally.
Salaries were last reviewed in May 2009 when it was decided to increase the salaries as detailed
below:
Base salary levels as at 1 April 2008 and 2009 are as follows:
1
Appointed 6 August 2008
Beneﬁts
Beneﬁts comprise medical insurance, critical illness insurance and life insurance.
Annual Bonus
Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus arrangement based on EBITDA (Earnings Before
Interest, Tax, Depreciation and Amortisation) targets related to the proﬁt expectations in the
Company’s business plan and the market, pre-determined business unit ﬁnancial targets and non-
ﬁnancial targets. The Committee has discretion to vary, increase or decrease bonuses that are
mechanistically produced by these formulae.
The maximum annual bonus was capped at 65% of base salary for 2008/09.
The annual bonus awarded for 2008/09 was 65% of base salary to Rakesh V Patel, 52% to
Ajay M Patel and 56% on pro-rated base salary to Ram Swamy.
Long-term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
The LTIP was approved by shareholders at the 2007 Annual General Meeting and is the primary
long-term incentive arrangement operated by the Company. Awards granted during 2008/09
ﬁnancial year have the following features:
• Awards are granted at the discretion of the Committee.
• Awards are in the form of Performance Shares.
• Performance conditions are 50% Total Shareholder Return (TSR) and 50% Earnings per Share
(EPS) growth.
• The maximum award size is 170% of base salary (face value) per annum.
• Performance and vesting periods are normally three years. There is no retesting of performance
targets (i.e. awards lapse if performance targets are not met).
• On a change in control of the Company, the number of LTIP shares to be released to a participant
will be determined by the Committee at its discretion. In the exercise of its discretion, the
Committee may take into account the period elapsed from the start of the performance period to
the date of the change in control, and the performance of the Company over the same period.
For awards granted in 2008/09:
• 150/170th of the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s award, 100/120th of the Group Executive Director's
award and 100/120th of the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer's award will vest if both the TSR and EPS
maximum performance levels are achieved. If they are both achieved then the Committee may
allow the remaining 20% of salary award to vest.

Name Role Salary at 1 April 2009 Salary at 1 April 2008

Chief Financial Ofﬁcer £175,000 – 26
• The performance target attached to 50% of an LTIP award is based on absolute TSR performance.
25% of this part of an award will vest for compound TSR growth of 12.5% per annum rising on
a straight line basis to full vesting for compound growth of 25% per annum.
• The performance target attached to the other 50% of an LTIP will vest for performance against
EPS targets deﬁned as proﬁt after tax excluding exceptional legal costs divided by weighted
average number of equity shares. 25% of this part of an award will vest for EPS of 22.5 pence
on 31 March 2011 rising on a straight line basis to full vesting for EPS of 30 pence.
The Committee considers that the combination of EPS and TSR performance provides a good
balance of performance metrics, with EPS targets aligned to ﬁnancial achievement and TSR targets
aligned to market value growth for shareholders. TSR calculations are prepared by a third-party data
provider and are reviewed by the Committee.
It is the intention of the Committee to make further awards during the 2009/10 ﬁnancial year under
the LTIP using similar performance conditions to those above that are robust and challenging, whilst
taking into account prevailing industry and market conditions.
Goldshield Group plc Share Option Plan
The Company has made awards under the Goldshield Group plc Share Option Plan in the past. No
grants were made to Executive Directors during the year under this Plan.
All-Employee Share Scheme
The Company operates a Sharesave Scheme that is open to all employees in the UK, including
Executive Directors. No performance conditions are attached to options granted under the Scheme
as it is an HM Revenue & Customs approved all-employee scheme.
Pension
The Company contributes 10% of base salary for each executive Director, either to a Company
Deﬁned Contribution pension scheme, an Executive Personal Pension, or provides an equivalent
taxable cash allowance. For the year commencing 1 April 2009 this has been increased to 12% of
base salary.
Shareholding Requirements
There is no minimum shareholding requirement for any Director, although the Committee
encourages Executive Directors to increase their shareholdings over time.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
Non-executive Directors’ remuneration is set by the Board as a whole (except the Chairman's fee
which is set by the Committee) reﬂecting time commitment, responsibility of each role and fees
paid in comparable companies. Non-executive Directors are not able to participate in any of the
Company's share incentive schemes or annual bonus arrangements, and do not receive any other
beneﬁts.
Fee levels as at 1 April 2008 and 2009 are as follows:
1. Chairman of the Audit Committee 2. Chairman of the Remuneration Committee

Service Contracts
The Company’s contracts of service for executive Directors are for a twelve monthly renewable period
(six months for non-executive Directors). There are no other provisions relating to early termination.
External Directorships
No executive Director currently holds any external non-executive directorships.
Remuneration strategy throughout the Group
The Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s strategy, with the support of the Committee, is to ensure that support
departments and sales units operate as if they were independent entities with performance schemes
structured for the delivery of commercial targets. This has enabled managers to partake in the bonus
plan based on the performance of their respective units, which has helped to focus attention on driving
the performance of those units.
Total Shareholder Return performance graph
The graph below shows the Company's ﬁve-year performance, measured by Total Shareholder Return
(TSR), compared with the FTSE Small Cap Index (excluding Investment Trusts). The FTSE Small Cap
Index is a widely recognised comparator index. The graph indicates that over the 5 years to 31 March
2009, £100 invested in Goldshield Group plc shares would have grown in value to £152, whilst £100
invested in the Index would have reduced in value to £62 over the same period.

We have audited the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Goldshield Group plc for the year ended
31 March 2009 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Balance
Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Recognised Income
and Expense and notes 1 to 26. These consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been prepared under
the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company ﬁnancial statements of Goldshield Group plc
for the year ended 31 March 2009 and the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that
is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235
of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the

no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body for our audit work, for
this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements in accordance with United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
within the Report of the Directors.
Our responsibility is to audit the consolidated ﬁnancial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration

in our opinion the information given in the Report of the Directors is consistent with the ﬁnancial
statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other
transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂects the Company’s compliance with
the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined Code speciﬁed for our review by the Listing Rules of the
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether
the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with
the audited consolidated ﬁnancial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors,
Secretary and Advisors, the Business Highlights, Chairman's Overview, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer's
Operating Review, Report of the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, Five Year Review, Directors, Report of the
Directors, Corporate Governance Report, Corporate Social Responsibility Report and the unaudited
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.

assessment of the signiﬁcant estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of
the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the
Group's circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance
that the consolidated ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by
fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of
the presentation of information in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:

adopted by the European Union, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2009 and of
its proﬁt for the year then ended;
• the consolidated ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation; and

Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs
As explained in Note 1 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the Group, in addition to complying
with its legal obligation to comply with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also complied
with the IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board.
In our opinion the consolidated ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with
IFRSs, of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2009 and of its proﬁt for the year then ended.

Basis of consolidation
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiary undertakings
drawn up to 31 March 2009. A subsidiary is an entity which the Company controls, which is achieved
when the Company has the power to control the financials and operating policies of an entity. Profits
or losses on intra-group transactions are eliminated in full. The results of the subsidiary undertakings
acquired during the year have been included from the date of acquisition. On acquisition of a
subsidiary, all of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities which exist at the date of acquisition are
recorded at the fair values reflecting their condition at that date. Goodwill arising on consolidation,
representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair values of the identifiable
net assets acquired, is capitalised net of any provision for impairment. An Employee Benefit Trust that
is controlled by its sponsoring entity, which is the Company in case of the Group, is consolidated into
the financial statements.
Revenue
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement when the
significant risks and rewards of ownership have been transferred to the buyer. Revenue is measured at
the fair value of the consideration received/receivable by the Group for goods supplied and services
provided, excluding value added tax and trade discounts. Revenue from services rendered is recognised
in the Consolidated Income Statement by reference to the stage of completion of transactions at the
balance sheet date. The stage of completion for the Global Solutions – call centre business is
determined by the man days spent on the project for rendering the service at the end of each billing
cycle. Subscription revenue is accrued over the period of the subscription. Advertising revenue for the
Wellbeing media business is recognised when the related advertisement appears in the magazine.
Intangible assets
Goodwill
All business combinations are accounted for under the purchase method and goodwill has been
recognised on acquisitions of subsidiaries. In respect of business combinations that have occurred since
1 April 2004, goodwill represents the difference between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value
of the net identifiable assets acquired. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment
losses. Goodwill arising on acquisitions before 1 April 2004 has been retained at the previous UK GAAP
amounts at 31 March 2004. Goodwill is allocated to cash generating units and is not amortised but
tested for impairment annually or more frequently if events or changes in circumstances indicate that it
might be impaired.
Other intangible assets
Externally purchased product licences, trademarks, brand-names, know-how and similar intangible
items are capitalised at historical cost, net of any provision for impairment and amortised on a straight
line basis over their estimated useful economic lives which range between seven and ten years. The
amortisation cost has been included within administrative expenses in the Consolidated Income
Statement.
Software
Acquired software licences are capitalised on the basis of the costs incurred to acquire and bring into
use the specific software. These costs are amortised over their estimated useful lives between three
to five years. The amortisation cost has been included within administrative expenses in the
Consolidated Income Statement.
Notes to the Financial Statements
(continued) 39
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less the accumulated depreciation. Depreciation is
charged on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives on the cost of the assets less their
residual value. Land is not depreciated.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Freehold buildings and
leasehold improvements – 25 years or over the period of lease
Ofﬁce equipment – 5 years
Plant and equipment – 6 to 7 years
Motor vehicles – 5 years
Residual values are re-assessed annually.
Directly attributable costs for construction of assets are shown under Capital work in progress and
will be transferred to the relevant category on completion of construction of the asset. Capital work in
progress is carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation commences when assets
are ready for their intended use.
Impairment of non-ﬁnancial assets
Assets that have an indefinite useful life excluding land, for example goodwill, are not subject to
amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to amortisation are
reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying
amount may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are
grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash generating
units). An impairment loss is recognised at the amount by which the asset’s or cash generating unit’s
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable amount. The recoverable amount is based on the higher of the
fair value less costs to sell and value in use.
If at the balance sheet date there is any indication that an impairment loss recognised in prior periods
for an asset other than goodwill no longer exists, the recoverable amount is reassessed and the asset is
reflected at the recoverable amount.
Research and development expenditure
Expenditure on development activities is capitalised if the product or process is technically and
commercially feasible, the costs are separately identifiable and the Group has sufficient resources to
complete development. Capitalised development costs are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation
and impairment losses. Capitalised development costs are amortised from the point at which the asset
is ready to use on a straight-line basis over its useful life, not exceeding five years. All other research
and development expenditure is written off to the Consolidated Income Statement in the period in which
it is incurred.
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. The cost is determined using the
weighted average price method. The cost of ﬁnished goods comprises of product cost, its packaging
and applicable duties and taxes. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary
course of business, less applicable variable selling expenses.
Accounting for income taxes
Current income tax assets and/or liabilities comprise those obligations to, or claims from, ﬁscal
authorities relating to the current or prior reporting period, that are unpaid at the balance sheet date.
They are calculated according to the tax rates and tax laws applicable to the ﬁscal periods to which
they relate, based on the taxable proﬁt for the year.

Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying
amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used
in the computation of taxable proﬁt and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
This involves comparison of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the consolidated ﬁnancial
statements with their respective tax bases. However, deferred tax is not provided on the initial
recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial recognition of an asset or liability unless the related
transaction is a business combination or affects tax or accounting proﬁt. Deferred tax liabilities are
always provided for in full. Deferred tax assets and liabilities are calculated, without discounting, at
tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when asset is realised or the liability is settled,
based on tax rates (tax laws) that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet
date. All changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are recognised as a component of tax expense
in the Consolidated Income Statement, except where they relate to items that are charged or credited
directly to equity (such as translation reserve and pre 7 November 2002 grants of share options) in
which case the related deferred tax is also charged or credited directly to equity.
Tax losses available to be carried forward as well as other income tax credits to the Group are assessed
for recognition as deferred tax assets. Deferred tax assets are only recognised to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which the asset can be recognised and are
reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related tax beneﬁt will be realised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries except
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences is controlled by the Group and it is
probable that the temporary difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three
months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s
cash management are included as a component of cash.
Employee beneﬁt trust
The assets and liabilities of the Employee Beneﬁt Trust (EBT) have been included in the consolidated
ﬁnancial statements. Any assets held by the EBT cease to be recognised on the Consolidated Balance
Sheet when the assets vest unconditionally in identiﬁed beneﬁciaries.
The costs of purchasing own shares held by the EBT are shown as a deduction against equity. The
proceeds from the sale of own shares held increase equity. Neither the purchase nor sale of own
shares leads to a gain or loss being recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Employee beneﬁts
The Group operates a deﬁned contribution pension scheme whereby contributions are made to
individual employee pension plans of certain employees. These costs are charged against proﬁts in
respect of the accounting period in which they are paid.
Indian gratuity costs, which represent a form of long term service beneﬁts are accrued based on
actuarial valuation at the balance sheet date, carried out by an independent actuary.
Leased assets
All leased assets are identiﬁed as operating leases if they do not transfer substantially all the risks and
rewards to the lessee.
Payments made under operating leases are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement on a
straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Foreign currencies
The reporting currency for these ﬁnancial statements is GB sterling (£) which is the parent Company’s
functional currency.
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the
transaction into the parent company’s presentational currency. Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign
currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. Foreign exchange
differences arising on translation are recognised in proﬁt or loss. Non monetary assets and liabilities
that are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign entity are translated using the exchange rate
at the date of the transaction.
Notes to the Financial Statements
(continued) 41
All assets and liabilities in the ﬁnancial statements of foreign subsidiaries are translated at the
closing rate at the balance sheet date. The results of foreign operations have been converted into
Group’s reporting currency at the actual rates over the reporting period and the exchange differences
arising have been taken to translation reserve, a component of equity. The exchange differences
arising from re-translation of the net investments in subsidiaries are directly taken to translation
reserve.
Share options
For all employee share options an expense is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement with a
corresponding credit to equity. The equity share based payment is measured at the fair value at the grant
date using the binomial lattice method. If vesting periods or other vesting conditions apply, the expense
is allocated over the vesting period, based on the best available estimate of the number of share options
expected to vest.
Long-term share incentive plan
As soon as practicable after the start of each performance period, each eligible participant will be
notiﬁed about the number of shares awarded to him/her in respect of that period. The participant
will also be informed about the form of the award, the performance targets to be achieved in relation
to the performance period and any other conditions to which the award may be subject. The fair
value of the share awards granted is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding
increase in equity. The fair value is measured at each award date and spread over the period during
which the participants become unconditionally entitled to the awards. The fair value of the share
awards is measured using a binomial model, taking into account the terms and conditions upon
which the shares will be released to the participants.
Provisions - Legal and other disputes
Provision is made where a reliable estimate can be made of the likely outcome of legal or other
disputes against the Group. In addition, provision is made for legal and other expenses arising from
claims received or other disputes. No provision is made for other possible claims or where an
obligation exists but it is not possible to make a reliable estimate. Costs associated with claims made
by the Group against third parties are charged to the Consolidated Income Statement as they are
incurred. The provisions are not discounted as the impact is not material.
Exceptional legal and professional costs
Exceptional legal and professional costs are expenditure incurred and provided for defending the legal
claims against the Group by the Department of Health and the Serious Fraud Ofﬁce.
Dividends
Dividends proposed or declared after the balance sheet dates are not recognised as a liability.
However the amounts of such dividends are disclosed in the ﬁnancial statements.
Segmental reporting
A segment is a distinguishable component of the Group that is engaged either in providing products
or services (business segment) or in providing products or services within a particular economic
environment (geographic segment) which is subject to risks and rewards that are different from those
of other segments.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the Consolidated Balance Sheet when the
Group becomes a party to the contractual terms of the instrument.
Held to maturity investments
Held to maturity investments are non-derivative ﬁnancial assets with ﬁxed or determinable payments
and a ﬁxed date of maturity where it is the intention of the Directors to hold them until maturity. Held
to maturity investments are measured subsequent to initial recognition at amortised cost using the
effective interest method. If there is objective evidence that the investment has been impaired, the
ﬁnancial asset is measured at the present value of estimated cash ﬂows. Any changes to the carrying
amount of the investment are recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Notes to the Financial Statements
(continued) 42
Loans and receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost
using the effective interest method, less provision for impairment. A provision for impairment of trade
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect
all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. Signiﬁcant ﬁnancial difﬁculties of
the debtor, probability that the debtor will enter bankruptcy or ﬁnancial reorganisation, and default
or delinquency in payments (more than 60 days overdue) are considered indicators that the trade
receivable is impaired. The amount of the provision is the difference between the asset’s carrying
amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows, discounted at the original effective
interest rate. The carrying amount of the asset is reduced through the use of an allowance account,
and the amount of the loss is recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement within ‘Other
administrative expenses’. When a trade receivable is uncollectible, it is written off against the
allowance account for trade receivables. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are
credited against 'Other administrative expenses' in the Consolidated Income Statement.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at fair values on initial recognition. Finance
charges including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are
accounted for on an accruals basis to the Consolidated Income Statement using the effective interest
method and are added to the carrying value of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled
in the period in which they arise.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are initially stated at their fair values and thereafter at
amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issue
costs.
Equity comprises of the following:
- Share capital - represents the nominal value of equity shares
- Share premium - represents the excess over nominal value of fair value of consideration
- Treasury shares - represents purchase of the Company’s equity share capital, the consideration
paid, including any transaction costs and is deducted from total shareholders' equity
- Shares held by Employee Beneﬁt Trust – represents amounts paid for shares of the Company held
by the Employee Beneﬁt Trust of the Long-Term Incentive Plan
- Retained earnings - represents the accumulated retained proﬁts
- Translation reserve - represents gains or losses on foreign currency differences arising on
consolidation of the net investment in subsidiaries.

2. SEGMENTAL REPORTING
Segment information is presented in the consolidated ﬁnancial statements in respect of the Group’s
business segments, which are the primary basis of segment reporting. The business segment-
reporting format reﬂects the Group’s management and internal reporting structure.
Primary - Business segments
The Group is organised into ﬁve major business units – Retail Brands, Retail Generics, Hospitals,
Consumer Health Europe (CH E) and, Consumer Health North America (CH NA). Other business units
– Country Distributors, Global Services, Wellbeing Centre, Wellbeing Villages, Resorts and
Management Services – constitute Other Segments. These units form the basis for the Group’s
reporting of primary segment information.
Secondary - Geographical segments
The geographical segments are considered for disclosure as secondary segments. Geographical
revenues are segregated based on the location from which the revenues are generated.
Assets are identiﬁed with the segment on the basis of their place of use.
Segment results
Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated
on a reasonable basis.
All inter-segment transfers are priced and carried out at arm’s length.
Segment assets and liabilities
Segment assets include all operating assets used by a segment and consist principally of operating
cash, trade and other receivables and property, plant and equipment, net of allowances and provisions
which are reported as direct offsets in the Balance Sheet. Segment liabilities include all operating
liabilities and consist principally of trade and other payables and other liabilities.
Segment assets and liabilities do not include deferred income taxes.
Unallocated segment income and expenses
Unallocated segment income comprises interest income and miscellaneous receipts not directly
attributable to any particular segment. Unallocated segment expenditure represents interest on loans
and provision for income taxes, which cannot be directly attributed to any segment.

At 31 March 2009 4,568 9,388 66 884 14,906
Subsequent to the annual impairment test for 2009, the carrying amount of goodwill is allocated to the following
cash generating units:
2009 2008
£’000 £’000
Hospitals 9,388 8,044
Regina Health Limited – 486
9,388 8,530
The recoverable amounts for the cash generating units given above are determined based on internal discounted
cash ﬂow evaluation. The cash ﬂow evaluation is based on actual operating results and ﬁve year forecasts at the
growth rates stated in the key assumptions.
The key assumptions are:
Growth rates 2009 2008
Hospitals Zero Zero
Regina Health Limited – Zero
Notes to the Financial Statements

Notes to the Financial Statements

Discount rates 2009 2008
Hospitals 8% 8%
Regina Health Limited – 8%
Management assumes the Hospitals business units continue to earn the current level of proﬁt margins and achieve
the same level of sales in the future forecasts.
The growth rate for the Hospitals business is assumed to be zero based on past experience.
The discount rate applied for the impairment review workings is based on the Weighted Average Cost of Capital for
the Group.
The Regina Health Limited business has shown a 42% decline in revenue over previous year due to the economic
downturn and reduced sales from one of its major customers which has led to the recognition of the impairment
charge.
The related goodwill impairment loss of £486,000 (2008: £237,000) is included under “Impairment losses” in
the Consolidated Income Statement.
The Directors believe that any reasonably possible change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount
are based would not cause the carrying amount to exceed its recoverable amount.

The creation and release of provisions for impaired receivables have been included in 'Other administrative
expenses' in the Consolidated Income Statement. Amounts charged to the allowance account are generally
written off, when there is no expectation of recovering additional cash.
The other classes within trade and other receivables do not contain impaired assets.
Trade receivables are usually due within 50 days and do not bear any effective interest rate. All trade receivables
except the factored portion of the Retail Generics segment are subject to credit risk exposure. However the Group
does not identify speciﬁc concentration of credit risk with regards to trade receivables, as the amount recognised
consist of a large number of receivables from various customers.
The fair value of these short term ﬁnancial assets is not individually determined as the carrying amount is a
reasonable approximation of fair value.

Goldshield Group plc unapproved scheme
The unapproved share option scheme is administered by the Group. Options are granted to employees during their
tenure of service and these can be exercised until expiry of 10 years from the date of grant, provided
the employee continues to remain in service at the earliest exercise date. The options are exercisable based
on the achievement of performance criteria with regards to growth in earnings per share and turnover. The
Remuneration Committee has the discretion to consider any exception in meeting the performance criteria when
the options are exercised.
Goldshield Group plc sharesave scheme
The scheme allows all eligible employees to beneﬁt from the growth of the Company through savings deducted
directly from pay, tax-free bonuses and a right to purchase Goldshield Group plc shares in the future but at a ﬁxed
price, which does not exceed the middle market value of a share over the three dealing days immediately
preceding the issue of this invitation. The approved sharesave scheme has option exercise terms of 3,5 or 7 years.
The sharesave scheme can be exercised for 6 months only after the 3,5 or 7 year maturity dates.
The options outstanding at 31 March 2009 have an exercise price in the range of 260.7 pence to 480.5 pence
and a weighted average contractual life of 4.64 years.
There were no share options granted during the year.
Goldshield Group plc Long-Term Incentive Plan
Participation in the plan is restricted to employees (including executive Directors) of the Group who are required to
devote substantially the whole of their working time to their duties to the Group. Ordinarily, the Remuneration
Committee selects participants at or before the start of each performance period but the Remuneration Committee
may, in exceptional circumstances, decide to select participants at any time.
As soon as practicable after the start of each performance period, each participant will be notiﬁed about:

14. EARNINGS PER SHARE
The calculation of the basic earnings per share is based on the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders
divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue during the year, excluding those held by employee
beneﬁt trust and those held as treasury shares.
The calculation of diluted earnings per share is based on the basic earnings per share, adjusted to allow for the
issue of shares and the post tax effect of dividends, on the assumed conversion of all dilutive options.
Reconciliations of the earnings and weighted average number of shares used in the calculations are set out below.

22. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
The Group uses ﬁnancial instruments, comprising cash, short term borrowings, trade receivables and trade
payables, which arise directly from its operations. The main purpose of these ﬁnancial instruments is to raise
ﬁnance for the Group’s operations.
Capital management
The Groups capital management objectives are to ensure that the entities in the Group will be able to continue
as a going concern whilst maximising the return to shareholders. The Group currently has no debt.
Short term payables and receivables
The Group’s trade and other receivables are actively monitored to avoid signiﬁcant concentrations of credit risk.
Interest rate risk
The Group ﬁnances its operations through a mixture of retained proﬁts and bank facilities. Bank borrowings are
made using variable interest rates.
Liquidity risk
The Group seeks to manage ﬁnancial risk, to ensure sufﬁcient liquidity is available to meet foreseeable needs
and to invest cash assets safely and proﬁtably.
Short-term ﬂexibility is achieved through overdraft facilities and short/medium term borrowings.
Borrowing facilities
The Group has undrawn facilities available of £500,000 expiring within one year (2008: £500,000).
Currency risk
The Group is exposed to translation and transaction foreign exchange risk. In relation to translation risk the
proportion of assets held in the foreign currency are matched to an appropriate level of borrowings in the same
currency. Transaction exposures are hedged when known, mainly using the forward exchange hedge market.
The Group seeks to hedge its exposures using a variety of ﬁnancial instruments, with the objective of minimising
the impact of ﬂuctuations in exchange rates on future transactions and cash ﬂows.
The Group has overseas subsidiaries operating in Ireland where reserves and expenses are denominated in Euros.
£22.8 million (2008: £20.8 million) of the sales of the Group’s business is to customers in continental
Europe/foreign markets excluding North American operations. The majority of these sales are invoiced in the
currencies of the customers involved. The Group policy is to minimise all currency exposures on any balance not
expected to mature within 30 days of its arising through the use of forward currency contracts, however there were
none in place at the year end. All other sales of UK business are denominated in sterling.

(continued) 25. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
Indemnities and guarantees
The Group has given indemnities in respect of advance payments, deferred purchase consideration and import duty
guarantees issued on its behalf in the normal course of business. The indemnities given at 31 March 2009
amounted to £688,000 (2008: £707,000).
26. ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS
Estimates and judgments are continually evaluated and are based on historical experience and
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and judgements concerning the future. The estimates and judgements that have a
signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next
ﬁnancial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and other intangibles
The Group test annually the carrying values of goodwill and other intangibles for impairment in accordance with
the accounting policy statement in Note 1. The achievement of the growth and proﬁtability by the individual cash
generating units is critical in substantiating the carrying value of goodwill and intangibles. Refer to note 7 of
Consolidated Financial Statements on page 48.
Share options
The share options calculation takes into account future dividends of 6 pence and a volatility rate of 45%, based on
expected share price. It is assumed that the 3 and 5 year share save options are held for 3 and 5 years respectively,
ie. the duration of the savings contracts, because the bonus is paid then and the employee has cash tied up. For
the employee stock options it is assumed that 3 year options will be held for 5 years and that 5 year options will
be held for 6 years. Both could be held for longer before expiry, but on average employees are likely to seek liquidity
or leave the Company before the full term. The risk-free interest rate was determined at 5%. The underlying
expected volatility was based upon a calculation of historic volatility during the period 2002-2004.
Long-Term Incentive Plan
The costs for Long-term incentive plan share rewards were calculated using the Binomial model with the
following assumptions:
Date of award 12 Sep 07 12 Sep 07 17 Sep 08 17 Sep 08
Performance criteria TSR EPS TSR EPS

Risk free interest rate 5% 5% 3.5% 3.5%
Binomial model £ fair value £1.39 £2.31 £1.01 £2.535
Income taxes
The Group is subject to taxes in various jurisdictions. Signiﬁcant judgment is required in determining the Group
provision for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination
is uncertain during the ordinary course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues
based on estimates as to whether additional taxes will be due. Where the ﬁnal tax outcome of these matters is
different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred
tax provision in the year in which such determination is made.

Notes to the Financial Statements
(continued) 61
We have audited the parent Company ﬁnancial statements of Goldshield Group plc for the year ended
31 March 2009 which comprise the Balance Sheet and notes 1 to 13. These parent Company ﬁnancial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the consolidated ﬁnancial statements of Goldshield Group plc for the
year ended 31 March 2009.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of
the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to
anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body for our audit work, for this
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and
the parent Company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent Company ﬁnancial statements give a true and
fair view and whether the parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report

In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records,
if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information
speciﬁed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with
the audited parent Company ﬁnancial statements. The other information comprises only the Directors,
Secretary and Advisors, Financial Highlights, Chairman's Overview, Chief Executive Ofﬁcer’s
Operating Review, Report of the Chief Financial Ofﬁcer, Five Year Review, Directors, Report of the
Directors, Corporate Governance Report, Corporate Social Responsibility and the unaudited part of
the Directors' Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of
any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the parent Company ﬁnancial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland)
issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the signiﬁcant
estimates and judgments made by the Directors in the preparation of the parent Company ﬁnancial
statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
Report of the Independent Auditor to the
Members of Goldshield Group plc 62
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we
considered necessary in order to provide us with sufﬁcient evidence to give reasonable assurance that
the parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be

forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the
parent Company ﬁnancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
•
the parent Company ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United

Company Balance Sheet at 31 March 2009 1. PRINCIPAL ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards
and under the historical cost convention. The Directors have reviewed the principal accounting policies and
consider they remain the most appropriate for the Company. The principal accounting policies of the Company
have remained unchanged from the previous year.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings in the balance sheet of the Company are included at the cost of the
shares held less amounts written off.
Intangible ﬁxed assets
Goodwill, brand names, know-how, licences, trademarks and similar intangible items are capitalised at historical
cost net of any provision for impairment and amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful
economic lives, which range between seven and ten years.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the Group an
obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future have occurred by the balance sheet
date. Deferred tax assets are recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax
is measured using rates of tax that have been enacted or substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxes are not discounted.
Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary
assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.
All other exchange differences are dealt with through the proﬁt and loss account.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and ﬁnancial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s balance sheet when the Company
becomes a party to the contractual terms of the instrument.
•
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at their fair values, which equal the estimated present
value of the future cash ﬂows.
•
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at fair value. Finance charges, including premiums payable
on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an accruals basis to the proﬁt and loss
account using the effective interest method and are added to the carrying value of instrument to the extent that
they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
•
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their fair value.
Share options and long-term share incentive plan
The share options and the long-term share incentive plan is available to eligible employees who are employed by

the meeting. Members so entitled may appoint one or more persons to attend and (on a poll) vote on their
behalf. A proxy need not be a member of the Company.
2. A form of proxy is enclosed for use in connection with the business set out above. To be valid, the form of
proxy and any power of attorney or other authority under which it is signed must be lodged with the Company’s
Registrars, Capita Registrars, The Registry, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU, not less than
48 hours before the time appointed for holding the General Meeting or adjournment as the case may be. You
can only appoint a proxy using the procedures set out in these notes and the notes to the proxy form.
3. Completion and return of a form of proxy does not preclude a member from attending and voting at the meeting.
4. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment
service may do so by using the procedures described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other
CREST sponsored members and those CREST members who have appointed voting service provider(s), should
refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) who will be able to take the appropriate action on
their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate
CREST message (a "CREST Proxy Instruction") must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear
UK & Ireland Limited's (formerly CRESTCo's) speciﬁcations and must contain the information required for
such instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the
appointment of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a previously appointed proxy, must in
order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received by Capita Registrars (ID RA 10) by no later than 10.00
am on 3 August 2009. No such message received through the CREST network after this time will be
accepted. For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp
applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the registrars are able to retrieve the
message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST . After this time, any change of instructions
to proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service provider(s) should note that
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular
message. Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy
Instructions. Is it the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a
CREST personal member or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that
his CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a
message is transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST
members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers are referred, in particular,
to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation
35(5)(a) of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001.
5. Copies of all Directors’ service contracts will be available for inspection at the principal business address of
the Company, No.1 Croydon, 12-16 Addiscombe Road, Croydon, Surrey CR0 0XT , during normal business
hours on each business day (Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays excluded) and at Panmure Gordon,
155 Moorgate, London EC2M 6XB, ﬁfteen minutes prior to and during the above Annual General Meeting.
6. Pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001, the Company speciﬁes that only
those shareholders registered in the Register of Members of the Company as at: 6.00 pm on 3 August 2009;
or if this general meeting is adjourned at 6.00pm on the day two days prior to the adjourned meeting, shall
be entitled to attend or vote at the above Annual General Meeting in respect of the number of shares
registered in their name at that time. Changes in the Register of Members after that time will be disregarded
in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
7. In order to facilitate voting by corporate representatives at the meeting, arrangements will be put in place
at the Meeting so that:
(i) if a corporate member has appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative with
instructions to vote on a poll in accordance with the directions of all the other corporate representatives for
that member at the meeting, then, on a poll, those corporate representatives will give voting directions to
the Chairman and the Chairman will vote (or withhold a vote) as corporate representative in accordance
with those directions; and
(ii) if more than one corporate representative for the same corporate member attends the Meeting but the
corporate member has not appointed the Chairman of the meeting as its corporate representative, a designated
corporate representative will be nominated, from those corporate representatives who attend, who will vote
on a poll and the other corporate representatives will give voting directions to that designated corporate
representative.
Corporate members are referred to the guidance issued by the Institute of Chartered Secretaries and
Administrators on proxies and corporate representatives, available from www.icsa.org.uk, for further details
of this procedure. The guidance includes a sample form of representation letter to appoint the Chairman as
a corporate representative as described in (i) above.

Chairman’s Statement
Idox is a specialist high end provider of 
document management, case management, 
workflow systems, content and related 
web-based portals. These skills have been 
successfully applied to the local government 
domain and are increasingly being developed on 
a managed or shared service partnership basis 
with groups of councils to save costs and gain 
efficiency.  The Group is now positioned to apply 
these skills to wider market sectors. 
By the end of 2010, the Group served more than 
90% of UK local authorities, with 62% recurring 
revenues (2009: 55%) and the Group’s land & 
property software solutions business comprises 
over 60% of installed UK local government 
planning solutions. 
The Group was also bolstered through the 
acquisition and integration of GRANTfinder, 
Strand Electoral Management Services and 
the Local Authority Modernisation Programme 
(LAMP) long-term managed services contracts 
with 11 local authorities. These acquisitions 
enabled the Group to expand into additional 
managed service agreements, election 
management software and further grants 
content.  The acquisition of GRANTfinder 
brings the critical mass required to make the 
Solutions segment a significant profit generator 
in forthcoming periods. 
The acquisition of j4b Software & Publishing 
Limited in 2009 had already added an 
international dimension to our business in 
Holland and in late 2010 Idox won its first 
contract in Spain. 
The post financial year-end acquisition of 
McLaren Software, a Glasgow based company 
with a presence in Germany and Houston, 
Texas, marks a step in the Group’s strategy to 
provide its document management services to 
broader public and private markets in the UK 
and internationally. The acquisition broadens 
the Group’s footprint into McLaren’s industrial 
markets in pharmaceuticals and oil & gas.
The acquisition will also build on the Group’s 
document management systems, workflow and 
related technology and expertise to expand a 
development centre of excellence in Scotland 
and offer this expertise to other markets where 
Idox can become a technology and market 
leader.
The Group will continue to identify opportunities 
to diversify into new geographies and new 
markets and aims through organic growth, 
acquisition and expansion outside the UK and 
public sector to grow its revenue and profits. 
The Board also continues to buy-back shares to 
fund share option incentives whilst pursuing its 
objective of promoting double-digit normalised 
EPS growth.
2010 highlights and markets
The publication of the government’s CSR in 
October 2010 has brought clarity to both central 
and local government spending plans. As a 
result the Board is confident that there will be 
no major adverse impact on software & services 
expenditure at local government level where it 
supports efficiencies in areas like planning. 
Local government has become increasingly 
outcomes driven, focused on return on 
investment and improvements in effectiveness 
and the maintenance of services to the 
community. Since the CSR was announced, 
independent market research company Kable 
has re-iterated its forecast of modest growth 
in the local government software and services 
market for the next three years.
In 2010 the Group passed a further milestone 
in its development as it diversified beyond its 
traditional local government client base into 
wider market sectors.
EBITDA rose 16% despite a 3% fall in revenues, 
which reflected in part the successful wind down 
of the large Scottish government planning portal 
project in the previous financial year.  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 3
For the year ended 31 October 2010
By the end of 2010, the 
Group served more 
than 90% of UK local 
authorities, with 62% 
recurring revenues 
(2009: 55%)
Operating costs were reduced during the 
year, even after the acquisitions of LAMP , 
Strand Electoral Management Services 
and GRANTfinder.  On a like-for-like basis, 
excluding acquisitions, overheads were £1.5m 
or 9% lower, as a result of tight cost controls 
and continued productivity and efficiency gains.  
In line with its previously announced policy of 
accelerating dividend increases, the Board 
proposes a significant rise in its final dividend to 
0.35p per share.
Finally, I would like to thank, on behalf of 
the Board, all our staff for their skills and 
dedication as Idox has transformed into a 
significant provider of profits with a market 
leading position over the last three years, 
most of it during a time of great economic 
uncertainty.  Our thanks are also extended to 
our shareholders who have been so supportive 
over this period.

Chief Executive’s Report
When CAPS Solutions was acquired in 2007, 
the Group inherited a large embryonic contract 
to provide a planning system for Northern 
Ireland. This year not only saw the successful 
completion and roll out of this system across 
Northern Ireland but also the completion of the 
Scottish government contracts with a faultless 
post completion audit.   
Project sales within the Solutions segment were 
affected by Government cutbacks.  However, 
Idox enters 2011 with a strong pipeline. The 
Solutions segment gained critical mass through 
the acquisition of GRANTfinder, which has 
enabled it to deliver improved grants information 
and policy web solutions to the UK and now 
Europe utilising a common infrastructure. The 
same model is now being extended in both 
Holland and Spain, building on the division’s EU 
grants information coverage. 
The Recruitment segment had its most difficult 
year yet with public sector contractor revenues 
falling materially in the middle of the year and 
permanent recruitment revenues growing only 
slowly as it tracked the hesitant private sector 
recovery. Despite this, the business managed to 
deliver a positive contribution in the year. The last 
quarter saw a marked improvement in sentiment 
in both contract and permanent activity, giving 
the Board confidence for the current trading 
year.
In 2010, Idox continued to invest in software 
application development and has coordinated 
a number of initiatives internally to provide 
better solutions for customers. The Group has 
continued to manage its cost base meticulously 
and integrated three acquisitions without 
2010 was a challenging year which Idox 
successfully navigated. The customer base 
started the year already well advanced in their 
thinking on the need to cut costs, but uncertain 
as to the level of savings they would be required 
to achieve. Despite the uncertainty around 
the election in May, which distorted first half 
trading and delivery schedules, as well as the 
mini budget in July and the CSR in October, the 
outturn was broadly in line with most authorities’ 
expectations.
Going forward into 2011, Idox’s market is 
already well advanced in its execution and 
is now making final adjustments. Therefore 
the Group expects the market for application 
solutions that deliver a tangible return on 
investment will grow now from a flat base in 
2009/10.
The Software segment managed this change in 
the market well, ending the year with a strong 
sales performance. The year closed with a 
different mix from originally forecast as some 
major projects were stopped and investment 
in dashboard productivity solutions was 
surprisingly weak, but this was offset by strong 
performance in public access web solutions. 
The Software segment had some notable 
successes in partnering with authorities to build 
shared service solutions. This approach, plus 
a more comprehensive offering in managed 
technical services and outsourcing, delivered 
tangible improvements in services, cost 
efficiencies and speed of implementation.  
Internally Idox continued to place a strong 
emphasis on quality and customer care with 
further improvements in product performance, 
delivery and data migration. In 2011, the Group 
will further improve customer support and 
enhance client customer communication and 
strategic partnering.
The acquisition of the LAMP managed services 
contracts and Strand Electoral Management 
Services added to the Group’s market 
penetration, provided further synergies and 
expanded and improved the premium managed 
services offering.

increasing overheads.  As part of the integration 
process, the Group has also revised its 
corporate branding. 
Outlook
The Group has started the current financial year 
in a strong position, with greater predictability 
than has been the case for the past two years 
and a strong pipeline in all its businesses.  
Although total public sector spending is under 
intense pressure, Idox products and services 
enhance local government efficiencies and the 
Group expects the market for solutions that 
deliver a tangible return on investment to grow.  
The Group also has a wider range of capabilities, 
larger market share and broader reach in its 
markets.  There are encouraging signs of 
increased activity in a number of areas and 
Idox is well positioned to take advantage of 
new opportunities emerging in both 2011 and 
beyond.

For the year ended 31 October 2010 Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 6
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Gross margins for the Group saw a marked 
improvement to 83% (2009: 77%), with 
increases in all three businesses.  Software 
margins of 87% (2009: 85%) improved due to 
the higher mix of recurring maintenance and 
managed service revenues and the absence of 
the additional costs incurred in 2009 in relation 
to the delivery of the Scottish Government 
Stream 2 project.   
The continuing shift within the Recruitment 
segment toward permanent placements 
resulted in gross margins of 39% (2009: 31%).  
The increased scale and recurring content 
subscription revenues within the Solutions 
business generated margins of 92% (2009: 
72%).
Operating costs were further reduced to £17.3m 
(2009: £17.4m) even after the three acquisitions 
in the last financial year.  On a like-for-like basis, 
excluding acquisitions, overheads were £1.5m, 
or 9%, lower as a result of tight cost controls 
and continued productivity and efficiency gains.  
EBITDA increased by 16% to £8.7m 
(2009: £7.5m) reflecting the progress made 
in managing revenues in a challenging 
environment, increasing gross margins and 
managing operating costs in addition to the 
maiden contribution from acquisitions.  As a 
result EBITDA margins increased to 28% (2009: 
23%)
Normalised pre-tax profit, excluding 
amortisation, share options costs and 
exceptional charges increased by 21% to £8.0m 
(2009: £6.6m). Pre-tax profit was £4.9m (2009: 
£4.5m) after the non cash amortisation charge 
following the acquisitions made in the year, 
non cash share option charge and exceptional 
restructuring and corporate finance charges of 
£0.6m (2009: £0.4m). 
Group revenues were £31.3m (2009: £32.2m) 
reflecting the reduction in the low-margin 
contract recruitment business and the benefit 
in the prior year of the large Scottish Executive 
contract.
  
The Software segment, which accounts for 77% 
of Group revenues, delivered £24.1m (2009: 
£25.1m), of which around 62% were recurring 
(2009: 52%).  In 2009, Software revenue was 
boosted by £1.0m by the inclusion of both 
the second and third phases of the Scottish 
Government e-planning project.    
In common with the previous financial year, 
newly contracted business contained a higher 
proportion of maintenance and managed 
service contracts which, on a like-for-like 
basis, contributed to a 6% increase in software 
maintenance revenues and increases revenue 
visibility into 2011 and beyond.   
The acquisition of the 11 LAMP managed 
services contracts in March 2010 for £2.9m and 
Strand Electoral Management Services in July 
2010 for £4.4m together contributed £1.1m to 
Software revenues.  
The Solutions segment increased revenue by 
24% to £4.2m (2009: £3.4m) as a result of a six-
month contribution from GRANTfinder, acquired 
in May 2010, which provides content to local 
authorities and other public sector bodies.  The 
acquisition of GRANTfinder for £3.3m has further 
augmented recurring revenues, which now make 
up 62% (2009: 53%) of Solutions turnover.  
The Recruitment segment reported revenues 
of £3.0m (2009: £3.8m), reflecting a £1.2m 
decline in the low margin contract recruitment 
business.  However, revenues in the high margin 
permanent recruitment business doubled to 
£0.6m as its core operating markets showed 
signs of recovery during the final quarter of the 
financial year.
Chief Financial Officer’s Review Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 7
Normalised earnings per share were up 16% to 
1.75p (2009: 1.51p). Basic earnings per share 
were 1.07p (2009: 1.01p).
The Board proposes a final dividend of 0.35p to 
give a full year dividend of 0.45p (2009: 0.20p). 
The 125% increase in dividend reflects the 
Board’s continuing confidence in the long-term 
strength of the business, its revenue visibility and 
its healthy operating cash generation. 
Idox ended the year with £2.0m cash (2009: 
£6.9m) and net debt of £0.9m (2009: £3.2m 
net cash) after funding the three acquisitions, 
totalling £10.6m, a dividend payment of £0.8m 
and share buy backs of £0.3m.

members regularly attend external H,S&E courses and internal reviews are performed on a regular 
basis to ensure compliance with best practice and all relevant legislation.
Employee Consultation
The Group consults employees through the National Company Council (NCC).  The NCC sits 
regularly during the year and is made up of representatives voted on the Council by employees.  An 
employee consultation policy is also in place.  Employees are encouraged to present their views 
and suggestions in respect of the Group’s performance and policies.  In addition, the Group has an 
intranet which facilitates faster and more effective communication.
An Employee Share Investment Trust is in place to allow employees a tax efficient way of investing 
in the Company. The Company purchases matching shares which become the property of the 
employee after a three year vesting period.
Financial Risk Management Objectives and Policies
The Group uses various financial instruments which include cash, equity investments, bank loans 
and items such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations. The main 
purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are credit risk, liquidity risk and interest 
rate risk. The directors review these risks on an ongoing basis. This policy has remained unchanged 
from previous years.
Credit Risk
The Group’s principal financial assets are cash and trade debtors. The credit risk associated with 
cash is limited as the counterparties have high credit ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies. The principal credit risk arises therefore from its trade debtors. 
In order to manage credit risk, the management review the debt ageing on an ongoing basis, 
together with the collection history and third party credit references where appropriate.  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 11
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Directors’ Report cont’d
Liquidity Risk
The Group seeks to manage financial risk by ensuring sufficient liquidity is available to meet 
foreseeable needs and to invest cash assets safely and profitably.
Interest Rate Risk
Any funds over and above the current working capital requirements of the Group are invested in 
high interest deposit accounts. The Group’s bank borrowings bear interest at rates linked to the 
LIBOR.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
The principal risks and uncertainties affecting the Group include the following:
Political – the Group has a large customer base in local government. A change in spending  >
priorities by the current or a future Government could materially impact the Group.  However this 
risk is mitigated due to the contractual nature of the recurring revenue in the Group.  
Economic – elements of the recruitment area of the business activity could be adversely affected  >
by a further slowdown in the economic environment.  However, in the event of an improvement 
in the economy, some recruitment revenue streams may improve. The software area of the 
business could be adversely affected if the government reduces the grants to local authorities in 
an economic downturn. The Group has increased diversification through acquisitions to mitigate 
against economic risks.
Competitors – the Group has certain competitors for its software products. To mitigate this risk,  >
the Group continues to invest in and develop its software.  Competitor risk is also mitigated 
through the long term nature of customer relationships and recurring software maintenance 
revenue.

Going Concern
The Directors have reviewed the Group’s budget and cash flows for 2011 in the context of the 
Group’s banking facilities and covenants, the level of recurring revenue within the business, the 
outlook for our chosen markets, and our current working capital resources, and are satisfied that it 
is appropriate to prepare accounts on a going concern basis. As a result of acquisitions during the 
year and the subsequent acquisition post year end, on 10 December 2010 the Group put in place a 
short term six million pound working capital facility. There are no events or conditions that may cast 
significant doubt about the ability of the Group to continue as a going concern. 
Post balance sheet events
The Group signed a short term working capital banking facility of £6m on 10 December 2010.
On 13 December 2010, the Group announced the acquisition of McLaren Software Group Limited 
for £1.0m in cash.  Full disclosure is provided in note 28.
 
Disclosure of Information to Auditors
In so far as each of the directors is aware:
there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditors are unaware; and >
the directors have taken all steps that they ought to have taken to make themselves aware of any  >
relevant audit information and to establish that the auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint Grant Thornton UK LLP as auditors and to authorise the Directors to agree 
their remuneration will be placed before the forthcoming Annual General Meeting of the Company.

Report on Remuneration
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee operates within defined terms of reference.  The Remuneration 
Committee comprises the Chairman and two Non-Executive Directors.  It is chaired by Christopher 
Wright.
Remuneration Policy
The policy of the Group is to set levels of remuneration to attract, retain and motivate Executive 
Directors and key staff.  The packages are designed to be competitive in value to those offered to 
the Directors of similar sized public companies in related sectors. It is the Board’s policy to align the 
interests of managers with those of our shareholders in the grant of option and other equity rewards 
which underlying securities grantees are very much encouraged to retain over the longer term.
The components of the Executive Directors’ remuneration packages are currently a basic salary, 
bonus, money purchase pension contributions and benefits in kind.  The benefits include car 
allowance, private medical cover, life cover and critical illness cover.  The bonus elements are 
dependent on the Executive Directors achieving performance criteria set out by the Remuneration 
Committee.  The criteria include targets for revenue and profits as well as for cash balances.  In 
addition, the Group operates share option schemes for the Executive Directors.

Corporate Governance Report
Corporate Governance
The Group is committed to applying 
the highest principles of corporate 
governance commensurate with its 
size. The Group has adopted the 
Quoted Company Alliance (QCA) 
Corporate Governance Guidelines 
for AIM Companies as published in 
September 2010. The Group complies 
with the QCA Corporate Governance 
Guidelines except whereby:
 
the Board does not currently  >
undertake performance evaluation 
of the Board, its committees, and 
its individual directors.
the Board held 7 Board meetings  >
and 2 of each Committee meetings 
during the year.  All Directors 
attended each Board meeting. Two 
Directors attended each Committee 
meeting.
Internal Controls
The Board takes responsibility for 
establishing and maintaining reliable 
systems of control in all areas of 
operation. These systems of control, 
especially of financial control, can 
only provide reasonable, but not 
absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. 
The key matters relating to the system 
of internal control are set out below:
Idox plc has established an  >
operational management structure 
with clearly defined responsibilities 
and regular performance reviews
the Group operates a  >
comprehensive system for 
reporting financial and non-financial 
information to the Board including 
preparation and review of strategy 
plans and the preparation and 
review of annual budgets
financial results are monitored  >
against budgets, forecasts and 
other performance indicators with 
action dictated accordingly at each 
meeting
a structured approval process  >
based on assessment of risk and 
value delivered
sufficient resource is focused to  >
maintain and develop internal 
control procedures and information 
systems, especially in financial 
management.
The Board considers that there have 
been no substantial weaknesses 
in internal financial controls that 
have resulted in any material losses, 
contingencies or uncertainties which 
need to be disclosed in the accounts.
The Group supports an internal 
audit function that performs annual 
audits on its management systems.  
This function is supported by a 
management review of the audit 
findings.  Audits are currently carried 
out on the Group’s Quality and 
Environmental management systems.
Following publication of Internal 
Control: Guidance for Directors on 
the Combined Code (the “Turnbull 
Guidance”), the Board confirms 
that there is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing 
the significant risks faced by the 
Group, and that this process has 
been in place for the year under 
review and up to the date of approval 
of the Annual Report and Accounts. 
This process is regularly reviewed by 
the Board and is consistent with the 
Turnbull Guidance. 
Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for 
preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors 
to prepare financial statements for 
each financial year. Under that law 
the directors have to prepare the 
consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted 
by the European Union (IFRSs). The 
directors have elected to prepare the 
company financial statements under 
UK Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (“UK GAAP”).  
The financial statements are required 
by law to give a true and fair view of 
the state of affairs of the group and 
parent company and of the profit or 
loss of the group for that period. In 
preparing these financial statements, 
the directors are required to:
select suitable accounting policies  >
and then apply them consistently
make judgments and estimates that  >
are reasonable and prudent
state whether applicable IFRSs  >
have been followed, subject to any 
material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements
prepare the financial statements on  >
the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for 
keeping adequate accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the financial position of 
the Group and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply 
with the Companies Act 2006.  They 
are also responsible for safeguarding  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 16
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Corporate Governance Report cont’d
the assets of the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and 
other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for 
ensuring that the Directors’ Report 
and other information included in 
the Annual Report is prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom 
company law. They are also 
responsible for ensuring that the 
Annual Report includes information 
required by the AIM Market Rules. 
The maintenance and integrity of the 
Group’s web site is the responsibility 
of the Directors; the work carried 
out by the auditors does not involve 
consideration of these matters and, 
accordingly, the auditors accept no 
responsibility for any changes that 
may have occurred to the information 
contained in the accounts since they 
were initially presented on the web 
site. 
Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and the 
dissemination of the accounts and 
other information included in annual 
reports may differ from legislation in 
other jurisdictions. 
Accounting Policies
The Board considers the 
appropriateness of its accounting 
policies on an annual basis. The Board 
believes that its accounting policies 
are appropriate in particular in relation 
to income recognition and research 
and development.
Board of Directors
The Board, comprising the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief 
Financial Officer and two Non-
Executive Directors, is responsible 
for the overall strategy and direction 
of Idox plc as well as for approving 
potential acquisitions, major capital 
expenditure items and financing 
matters. The Board has a formal 
schedule of business reserved to it 
and meets regularly during the year. 
The Board is supplied in a timely 
manner with information in a form 
and of a suitable quality appropriate 
to enable it to discharge its duties. 
Advice from independent sources 
is available if required. The Board 
monitors exposure to key business 
risks and reviews the strategic 
direction of the Group, the annual 
budgets as well as their progress 
against those budgets.
The Board members and their 
roles are described on page 8.  In 
accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association, one third of 
the Directors are required to retire 
by rotation at the Annual General 
Meeting.
Shareholder Relations
Idox plc is committed to open 
communication with all its 
shareholders. The Directors hold 
regular meetings with institutional 
shareholders to discuss and review 
the Group’s activities and objectives. 
Communication with private 
shareholders is principally through 
the Annual General Meeting, where 
participation is encouraged and where 
the Board is available to answer 
questions. Idox plc maintains up-
to-date information on the Investor 
Relations section of its website
www.Idoxplc.com.
Every shareholder has access to a 
full annual report each year end and 
an interim report at the half year end. 
Care is taken to ensure that any price 
sensitive information is released to all 
shareholders, institutional and private, 
at the same time in accordance 
with London Stock Exchange 
requirements. 
Idox plc strives to give a full, 
timely and realistic assessment 
of its business in a balanced way, 
in all price-sensitive reports and 
presentations. 
The Group has adopted the Quoted 
Company Alliance (QCA) suggested 
terms of reference for the various 
Board committees as set out by the 
QCA.
The Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is chaired by 
Peter Lilley and includes Christopher 
Wright. The Report of the Audit 
Committee can be found on page 17.
The Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is 
chaired by Peter Lilley and includes 
Christopher Wright. 
The Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee is 
chaired by Christopher Wright and 
includes Peter Lilley.  This Committee 
determines the remuneration and 
benefits packages for the Executive 
Directors and any changes to the 
service contracts. The Committee also 
approves any share related incentive 
schemes within the Group.
Membership and Meetings
The Audit Committee is a committee 
of the Board and is comprised of two 
Non-Executive Directors: Peter Lilley 
and Christopher Wright.  
The Audit Committee invites the 
Executive Directors, the external 
auditors and other senior managers 
to attend its meetings as appropriate. 
The Company Secretary is also the 
Secretary of the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee is considered 
to have sufficient, recent and relevant 
financial experience to discharge its 
functions.
During the period under review, the 
Audit Committee met three times. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 17
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Report of the Audit Committee
Role, Responsibilities and Terms 
of Reference
The Audit Committee’s role is to assist 
the Board in the effective discharge 
of its responsibilities for financial 
reporting and internal control.
The Audit Committee’s responsibilities 
include:

and interim financial statements of

monitor and review the requirement  >
for an internal audit function
to review the arrangements for  >
staff to whistle-blow on financial 
reporting and other matters
safeguard the auditor’s objectivity  >
and independence when non-audit

oversee the relationship with the  >
external auditor, including approval 
of their remuneration, agreeing the 
scope of the audit engagement, 
assessing their independence, 
monitoring the provision of non-
audit services, and considering their 
reports on the Group’s financial 
statements.
The Audit Committee operates within 
agreed terms of reference, which can 
be found on the Company’s website.
Independence of External Auditors
The Committee keeps under review 
the relationship with the external 
auditors including:
the independence and objectivity  >
of the external auditors, taking 
into account the relevant UK 
professional and regulatory 
requirements and the relationship 
with the auditor as a whole, 
including the provision of the non-
audit services
the consideration of audit fees and  >
any fees for non-audit services.
The Audit Committee develops and 
recommends to the Board the Group’s 
policy in relation to the provision of 
non-audit services by the auditors, 
and ensures that the provision of such 
services does not impair the external 
auditor independence.

(non-derivative) equity instruments.  This 
amendment applies for periods commencing 
on or after 1 February 2010.
Amendments to IFRS 2 – Group cash- >
settled share based payment transactions.  
The amendment clarifies that an entity that 
receives goods or services from its suppliers 
(including employees) must apply IFRS 2 even 
where the obligation to make the required 
share-based cash payment lies with another 
group entity.  This amendment is effective 
from 1 January 2010.  
IAS 24 (Revised 2009) “Related Party  >
Disclosures” - effective 1 January 2011. The 
revised standard modifies the definition of 
related parties.
The directors anticipate that the adoption of 
these Standards and Interpretations will have no 
marked impact on the financial statements when 
they come into effect.
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following new standards and amendments 
to standards have been adopted by the Group 
during the year.
IAS 1 Revised ‘Presentation of financial 
statements’.  The revised standard prohibits the 
presentation of items of income and expenses 
(that is ‘non-owner changes in equity’) in the 
statement of changes in equity, requiring non-
owner changes in equity to be presented 
separately from owner changes in equity.  All 
non-owner changes in equity are required to 
be shown in a performance statement.  It also 
requires that where a balance sheet is restated 
that the opening balance sheet is also disclosed.  
There has been no restatement of the balance 
sheet and therefore an opening balance sheet 
has not been disclosed.
IFRS 2 (amendment) ‘Share-based payment’.  
This revision of an existing standard deals with 
vesting conditions and cancellations.  It clarifies 
that vesting conditions are service conditions 
and performance conditions only.  Other features 
of a share-based payment are not vesting 
conditions.  This has resulted in no change 
to the share-based payments charge for the 
period.
1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
General Information
Idox plc is a leading supplier of software 
and services for the management of local 
government and other organisations. The 
company is a public limited company which 
is listed on the London Alternative Investment 
Market and is incorporated and domiciled in the 
UK. The address of its registered office is 160 
Queen Victoria Street, London. The registered 
number of the company is 03984070.
The financial statements are prepared in pound 
sterling.
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union (EU) and the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS.  
The financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention as modified 
by the revaluation of certain financial assets and 
liabilities, being available for sale investments.
As set out on page 12 of the Directors’ Report, 
the financial statements have been prepared on 
a going concern basis.
International Financial Reporting Standards 
and Interpretations issued but not yet 
effective
At the date of authorisation of these 
financial statements, certain new standards, 
amendments and interpretations to existing 
standards have been published that are 
mandatory for forthcoming financial periods, but 
which the Group has not adopted early.  Those 
which are considered relevant to the Group’s 
operations are as follows:
IAS 32 Amendment: Classification of Rights  >
Issues.  The Amendment alters IAS 32 so that 
rights, options or warrants to acquire a fixed 
number of the entity’s own equity instruments 
for a fixed amount of any currency are equity 
instruments if the entity offers the rights, 
options or warrants pro rata to all of its 
existing owners of the same class of its own  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 26
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
Amendment to IFRS 7, ‘Financial instruments; 
Disclosures’ – The amendment increases 
the disclosure requirements about fair value 
measurement and reinforces existing principles 
for disclosure about liquidity risk.  The 
amendment introduces a three-level hierarchy 
for fair value measurement disclosure and 
requires some specific quantitative disclosures 
for financial instruments in the lowest level of the 
hierarchy.  In addition, the amendment clarifies 
and enhances existing requirements for the 
disclosure of liquidity risk primarily requiring a 
separate liquidity risk analysis for derivative and 
non-derivative financial liabilities.  This has not 
resulted in any changes to the disclosures in 
these financial statements.
IFRS 3 R, ‘Business combinations’– The revised 
standard requires that all acquisition related 
costs are to be expensed in the period incurred 
rather than added to the cost of the investment, 
that changes to contingent consideration 
following a business combination are shown in 
the statement of comprehensive income rather 
than changing goodwill, and that changes 
to deferred tax assets relating to business 
combinations are only reflected within goodwill 
if they occur within the measurement period. 
Furthermore, purchase accounting only applies 
at the point when control is achieved. The 
Group has applied IFRS 3 R prospectively to all 
business combinations from 1 November 2009. 
Where a business combination and the related 
assets and liabilities arising were acquired before 
1 November 2009 they are not adjusted by IFRS 
3 R and as a result comparatives for 2009 have 
not been restated. 
IAS 27 R, ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements’, the revised standard requires that 
acquisitions and disposals that do not result in 
a change of control are accounted for within 
equity. Any difference between the change in 
the non-controlling interest and the fair value of 
the consideration paid or received is recognised 
directly in equity and attributed to the owners of 
the parent and does not generate goodwill. 
Improvements to IFRS issued May 2010 – part 
effective 1 July 2010, other parts effective 1 
January 2011. 
Critical accounting estimates and 
judgements
Estimates and judgements are continually 
evaluated and are based on historical experience 
and other factors, including expectations of 
future events that are believed to be reasonable 
under the circumstances.
The Group makes estimates and assumptions 
concerning the future.  The resulting accounting 
estimates and assumptions will, by definition, 
seldom equal the related actual results.  The 
Group has evaluated the estimates and 
assumptions that have been made in relation to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in 
these financial statements.  The estimates and 
assumptions which have the most significant 
impact on the financial statements which are 
recognised in the financial statements are as 
follows:
(i) Intangible assets 
The Group recognises intangible assets acquired 
as part of business combinations at fair value 
at the date of acquisition.  The determination of 
these fair values is based upon management’s 
judgement and includes assumptions on the 
timing and amount of future incremental cash 
flows generated by the assets and selection of 
an appropriate cost of capital.  Furthermore, 
management must estimate the expected 
useful lives of intangible assets and charge 
amortisation on those assets accordingly.  In 
determining the useful economic life of the 
intangible software assets, management has 
given consideration to the length of time that its 
own software is typically used within its market.  
In addition, management reviewed competitor 
products and the length of time they had also 
been in use.
Consideration was also given as to the likelihood 
that a new competitor could enter the market 
with a new product.  This was considered 
unlikely due to the up-front capital investment 
which would be required to develop a new 
product, the requirement for reference sites to 
demonstrate the product, and the long life cycles 
which products have in the market. For details 
on the estimates made in relation to intangible 
assets, see note 11. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 27
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
considered to be 1 March 2010, the date the 
sale and purchase agreement was signed and 
the date the risk and rewards of the contracts 
transferred and control passed to the Group.
This acquisition does not fall under IFRS3 
revised as it was the acquisition of an asset or 
a group of assets which does not constitute a 
business under the definition.
Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts 
of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings 
drawn up to 31 October each year.  Subsidiaries 
are those entities over which the Group has the 
power to control the financial and operating 
policies.  Over all its subsidiaries, Idox plc 
obtains and exercises control through 100% of 
the voting rights.
The Group elected not to apply IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations retrospectively to business 
combinations prior to 1 November 2006.  
Accordingly the classification of the combination 
(acquisition, reverse acquisition or merger) 
remains unchanged from that used under UK 
GAAP .  
Assets and liabilities are recognised at the date 
of transition if they would be recognised under 
IFRS, and are measured using their UK GAAP 
carrying amount immediately post-acquisition as 
deemed cost under IFRS, unless IFRS requires 
fair value measurement.  Deferred tax is adjusted 
for the impact of any consequential adjustments 
after taking advantage of the transitional 
provisions.
All inter-company transactions are eliminated on 
consolidation. 
For business combinations occurring since 
1 November 2009, the requirements of IFRS 
3R have been applied.  The consideration 
transferred by the Group to obtain control of 
a subsidiary is calculated as the sum of the 
acquisition date fair values of assets transferred, 
liabilities incurred and the equity interests issued 
by the Group, which includes the fair value of 
any asset of liability arising from a contingent 
(ii) Development costs
The Group reviews half yearly whether the 
recognition requirements for development 
costs have been met.  This is necessary 
as the economic success of any product 
development is uncertain and may be subject 
to future technical problems at the time of 
recognition.  Judgements are based on the 
information available at each balance sheet 
date.  In addition, all internal activities related to 
the research and development of new software 
products are continuously monitored by the 
directors. See note 11 for further information.
(iii) Impairment of goodwill
The Group is required to test, as least annually, 
whether goodwill has suffered any impairment.  
The recoverable amount is determined based 
upon value-in-use and net realisable value 
calculations.  The value-in-use method requires 
the estimation of future cash flows and the 
choice of a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate the present value of these cash flows. 
Pre-tax discount rates have been applied and 
are based on WACC calculations.   See note 11 
for further commentary.  
(iv) Revenue recognition
The group recognises revenue on certain 
contracts such as work in progress, prior 
to an invoice being raised, where work has 
been completed and there is a high degree 
of certainty of the contract being completed 
and the invoice raised and cash received. See 
paragraph headed ‘Revenue’ below for more 
detail on how the Group accounts for revenue. 
(v) Dilapidations
Dilapidation provisions are management’s best 
estimates based on actual costs incurred in 
existing or similar properties. See note 18 for 
details of the amounts included in the balance 
sheet at the year end.
(vi) Business combination assessment
On 1 March 2010 the group acquired eleven 
long term managed service contracts from 
MacDonald, Detwiller and Associates Limited.  
Consideration of £2.9m was paid on 24 
September 2010.  The date of acquisition is  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 28
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
consideration arrangement.  Acquisition costs 
are expensed as incurred. 
 
Revenue
Revenue represents the amounts receivable in 
respect of goods and services provided during 
the year, stated net of value added tax.  Where 
work has been done, but a billing milestone has 
not been reached, the income has been accrued 
and included in amounts recoverable within 
trade and other receivables. 
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the right 
to consideration. The Group derives its revenue 
streams from software solutions, information 
solutions and recruitment services.  
Idox Software products’ revenue is recognised 
in stages based on contract signing, delivery, 
configuration and client acceptance. For 
small value orders, the whole invoice amount 
is recognised at the billing point. For larger 
value orders, revenue is reviewed to see if 
the appropriate amount of work has been 
completed. For the largest orders, the amount 
of revenue recognised is dependent on the 
percentage of completion of the Group’s 
contractual obligations. The revenues for 
maintenance and managed service contracts are 
spread over the period of the agreement, which 
is typically one year.  
Revenue derived from information solutions 
content is recognised over the life of the 
subscription, which is typically one year.  
Revenue from projects is recognised over the life 
of the project in accordance with the stage of 
completion.  Revenue from information solutions 
based managed services is recognised on a 
usage basis as the service is performed.
Recruitment revenue from permanent 
placements is recognised in the month when 
the placement starts.  Revenue from contract 
recruitment is recognised as the service is 
performed.
Contract revenue
The amount of profit attributable to the stage of 
completion of a long term contract is recognised 
only when the outcome of the contract can be 
foreseen with reasonable certainty. Revenue for 
such contracts is stated at the cost appropriate 
to their stage of completion plus attributable 
profits, less amounts recognised in previous 
years. Provision is made for any losses as they 
are foreseen.
Amounts recoverable on contracts are included 
in trade and other receivables and represent 
revenue recognised in excess of payments on 
account.
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner 
consistent with the internal reporting provided 
to the chief operating decision-maker.  The chief 
operating decision-maker has been identified as 
the steering committee, which comprises the 
Chief Executive Officer and the Chief Financial 
Officer, that makes strategic decisions.  Given 
a segmental balance sheet is no longer used 
for internal reporting purposes, this is no longer 
shown.
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated after separate recognition of 
identifiable intangible assets.  It is calculated 
as the excess of the sum of a) fair value of 
consideration transferred, b) the recognised 
amount of any non-controlling interest in the 
acquiree and c) acquisition-date fair value of 
any existing equity interest in the acquiree, over 
the acquisition-date fair values of identifiable net 
assets.  If the fair values of the identifiable net 
assets exceed the sum calculated above, the 
excess amount (i.e. gain on a bargain purchase) 
is recognised in profit or loss immediately.
Cash-generating units to which goodwill has 
been allocated are tested for impairment at 
least annually.  All other individual assets or 
cash-generating units are tested for impairment 
whenever events or changes in circumstances 
indicate that the carrying amount may not be 
recoverable. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 29
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
Goodwill is carried at cost less accumulated 
impairment losses.  Negative goodwill is 
recognised immediately after acquisition in 
the statement of comprehensive income.  
Unallocated goodwill on acquisitions relates 
mainly to workforce valuation, synergies and 
economies of scale obtained on combining 
acquisitions with existing operations.
Goodwill written off to reserves prior to the 
date of transition to IFRS remains in reserves.  
There is no re-instatement of goodwill that was 
amortised prior to transition to IFRS.  Goodwill 
previously written off to reserves is not written 
back to profit or loss on subsequent disposal.  
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets with a finite useful life are 
amortised to the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income on a straight-line basis 
over their estimated useful lives, which are 
reviewed on an annual basis.  Amortisation 
commences when the asset is available for 
use.  The residual values of intangible assets are 
assumed to be zero.
 
(i) Research and development
Expenditure on research (or the research 
phase of an internal project) is recognised as 
an expense in the period in which it is incurred.  
Development costs incurred are capitalised 
when all the following conditions are satisfied:
completion of the intangible asset is  >
technically feasible so that it will be available 
for use or sale
the group intends to complete the intangible  >
asset and use or sell it
the group has the ability to use or sell the  >
intangible asset
the intangible asset will generate probable  >
future economic benefits.  Among other 
things, this requires that there is a market for 
the output from the intangible asset or for the 
intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used 
internally, the asset will be used in generating 
such benefits
there are adequate technical, financial and  >
other resources to complete the development 
and to use or sell the intangible asset, and
the expenditure attributable to the intangible  >
asset during its development can be 
measured reliably.
Development costs not meeting the criteria 
for capitalisation are expensed as incurred.  
The cost of an internally generated intangible 
asset comprises all directly attributable costs 
necessary to create, produce, and prepare 
the asset to be capable of operating in the 
manner intended by management.  Amortisation 
commences upon completion of the asset, 
and is shown separately on the statement of 
comprehensive income.
Careful judgement by the directors is applied 
when deciding whether the recognition 
requirements for development costs have been 
met.  This is necessary as the economic success 
of any product development is uncertain and 
may be subject to future technical problems at 
the time of recognition.  Judgements are based 
on the information available at each balance 
sheet date.  In addition, all internal activities 
related to the research and development of new 
software products are continuously monitored by 
the directors.
Amortisation is calculated using the straight line 
method over a period of 5 years.
(ii) Customer relationships
Customer relationships represent the purchase 
price of customer lists and contractual 
relationships purchased on the acquisition of 
CAPS Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited, j4b 
Software & Publishing Limited, Strand Electoral 
Management Services Limited and GRANTfinder 
Limited.  These relationships are carried at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses.  Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight line method over a period of 
20, 10 and 5 years. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 30
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
(iii) Trade names
Trade names represent the named intangible 
asset recognised on the acquisition of CAPS 
Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited, j4b 
Software & Publishing Limited, Strand Electoral 
Management Services Limited and GRANTfinder 
Limited.  These trade names are carried at cost 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses.  Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight line method over a period of 
20 and 10 years.
(iv) Software
Software represents the Uniform, Acolaid and 
electoral software purchased on the acquisition 
of CAPS Solutions Limited, Plantech Limited 
and Strand Electoral Management Services 
Limited.  The software is carried at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses.  Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight line method over a period of 5 
and 10 years.  Software also includes software 
licences purchased which are amortised using 
the straight line method over a period of 3 years. 
(v) Database
Database represents the grant information 
database purchased on the acquisition of j4b 
Software & Publishing Limited and GRANTfinder 
Limited.  The database is carried at fair value 
less accumulated amortisation and accumulated 
impairment losses.  Amortisation is calculated 
using the straight line method over a period of 5 
years.  
(vi) Order backlog
Order backlog represents the managed service 
contracts and subscription deferred revenue 
purchased on the acquisition of 11 land and 
property information solution contracts and 
GRANTfinder Limited. Amortisation on the 
managed service deferred revenue is calculated 
based on the weighting and length of each 
contract purchased.  Subscription deferred 
revenue is calculated using the straight line 
method over a period of 5 years.
Impairment
For the purposes of assessing impairment, 
assets are grouped at the lowest levels for which 
there are separately identifiable cash flows (cash-
generating units).  As a result, some assets are 
tested individually for impairment and some are 
tested at cash-generating unit level.  Goodwill is 
allocated to those cash-generating units that are 
expected to benefit from synergies of the related 
business combination and represent the lowest 
level within the group at which management 
monitors the related cash flows.
Goodwill, other individual assets or cash-
generating units that include goodwill, other 
intangible assets with an indefinite useful life, 
and those intangible assets not yet available for 
use are tested for impairment at least annually.  
All other individual assets or cash-generating 
units are tested for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the 
carrying amount may not be recoverable.
An impairment loss is recognised for the amount 
by which the asset’s or cash-generating unit’s 
carrying amount exceeds its recoverable 
amount.  The recoverable amount is the higher 
of fair value, reflecting market conditions 
less costs to sell, and value in use based on 
an internal discounted cash flow evaluation.  
Impairment losses recognised for cash-
generating units, to which goodwill has been 
allocated, are credited initially to the carrying 
amount of goodwill.  Any remaining impairment 
loss is charged pro rata to the other assets in 
the cash generating unit.  With the exception of 
goodwill, all assets are subsequently reassessed 
for indications that an impairment loss previously 
recognised may no longer exist.

For the year ended 31 October 2010
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are 
stated at cost less accumulated depreciation.
Depreciation is charged to the income 
statement using the following rates and bases 
so as to write off the cost or valuation of 
items of property, plant and equipment over 
their expected useful lives.  The rates that are 
generally applicable are:
Computer 
hardware
50% and 100% straight line
Fixtures, fittings 
and equipment
25% straight line
Library books 
and journals
33 1/3% straight line
Useful economic lives and residual values are 
reviewed annually.
Employee benefits
Defined contribution pension plans
Contributions paid to private pension plans of 
certain employees are charged to the income 
statement in the period in which they become 
payable. Contributions paid to the group 
personal pension plans of employees are 
charged to the income statement in the period in 
which they become payable.
Share-based payment transactions
All share-based payment arrangements granted 
after 7 November 2002 that had not vested 
prior to 1 November 2006 are recognised in the 
financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange 
for the grant of any share-based payment are 
measured at their fair values.  Where employees 
are rewarded using share-based payments, 
the fair values of employees’ services are 
determined indirectly by reference to the fair 
value of the instrument granted to the employee.  
This fair value is appraised at the grant date 
and excludes the impact of non-market vesting 
conditions (for example, profitability and sales 
growth targets).
All equity-settled share-based payments are 
ultimately recognised as an expense in the 
income statement with a corresponding credit to 
the share option reserve.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting 
conditions apply, the expense is allocated 
over the vesting period, based on the best 
available estimate of the number of share 
options expected to vest.  Estimates are revised 
subsequently if there is any indication that the 
number of share options expected to vest 
differs from previous estimates.  Any cumulative 
adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the 
current period.  No adjustment is made to any 
expense recognised in prior periods if share 
options that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds 
received net of attributable transaction costs are 
credited to share capital, and where appropriate 
share premium.
Reserves
Equity comprises the following:
“Share premium” represents the excess over  >
nominal value of the fair value of consideration 
received for equity shares, net of expenses of 
the share issue.
“Capital redemption reserve” represents when  >
the entire deferred ordinary share capital was 
bought in exchange for one ordinary 1p share. 
“Merger reserve” which arose as a result of  >
a group reconstruction that occurred in 17 
November 2000.  This represents the issued 
share capital and share premium account in 
the Company’s subsidiary undertaking, Idox 
Software Limited.  
“Share options reserve” represents shares to  >
be issued on potential exercise of those share 
options that have been accounted for under 
“IFRS 2 Share Based Payments”.
“ESOP trust” represents share capital  >
purchased to satisfy the liability of the  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 32
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Notes to the Accounts cont’d 
employee share scheme. Purchased shares 
are classified within the ESOP trust reserve 
and presented as a deduction from total 
equity.
“Retained earnings” represents retained  >
profits.
“Treasury reserve’ represents shares  >
repurchased by the company to be held for 
redistribution as share options.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises 
current and deferred tax.  Current tax is charged 
to the statement of comprehensive income 
except to where it relates to tax on items 
recognised directly in equity, in which case it is 
charged to equity.
Current tax is the tax currently payable based on 
taxable profit for the year.  
Deferred income taxes are calculated using 
the liability method on temporary differences.  
Deferred tax is generally provided on the 
difference between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities and their tax bases.  
However, deferred tax is not provided on the 
initial recognition of goodwill, nor on the initial 
recognition of an asset or liability unless the 
related transaction is a business combination or 
affects tax or accounting profit.  Deferred tax on 
temporary differences associated with shares in 
subsidiaries is not provided if reversal of these 
temporary differences can be controlled by the 
group and it is probable that reversal will not 
occur in the foreseeable future.  In addition, tax 
losses available to be carried forward as well as 
other income credits to the group are assessed 
for recognition as deferred tax assets.
Deferred tax liabilities are provided in full, 
with no discounting.  Deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
the underlying deductible temporary differences 
will be able to be offset against future taxable 
income.  Current and deferred tax assets and 
liabilities are calculated at tax rates that are 
expected to apply to their respective period 
of realisation, provided they are enacted or 
substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Changes in deferred tax assets or liabilities are 
recognised as a component of tax expense in 
the statement of comprehensive income, except 
where they relate to items that are charged or 
credited directly to equity in which case the 
related deferred tax is also charged or credited 
directly to equity.
Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as operating leases.  All leases are operating in 
nature.  Amounts paid under operating leases 
are charged to the statement of comprehensive 
income on a straight line basis over the lease 
term.  
Dividend distributions
Interim dividends in respect of equity shares 
are recognised in the financial statements in the 
period in which they are paid.
Final dividends in respect of equity shares are 
recognised in the financial statements in the 
period that the dividends are formally approved.
Foreign currency translation
The functional and presentation currency of 
Idox plc and its United Kingdom subsidiaries 
is the pound sterling (£).  Transactions in 
foreign currencies are initially recorded at the 
functional currency rate ruling at the date 
of the transaction.  Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
are retranslated at the functional currency rate 
of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date.  
All differences are taken to the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income.
Capital policy
The Group’s objectives when managing 
capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to 
continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and benefits for other 
stakeholders and to maintain a capital structure 
that optimises the cost of capital.  In order to  Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 33
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
maintain or adjust the capital structure, the 
Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid 
to shareholders, return capital to shareholders or 
issue new shares. 
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are 
recognised on the Group’s balance sheet when 
the Group has become a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and 
are initially stated at their fair value, as reduced 
by appropriate allowances for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts.  All receivables are 
considered for impairment.  Provision against 
trade receivables is made when there is 
objective evidence that the group will not be 
able to collect all amounts due in accordance 
with the original terms of those receivables.  The 
amount of the write-down is determined as the 
difference between the assets carrying value and 
the present value of estimated future cash flows.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash on 
hand and on deposit and are subject to an 
insignificant risk of changes in value.  
Investments
Investments consist of available-for-sale 
investments in equity instruments which are 
measured at market prices.  Movements 
in market value are recognised through the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are 
classified according to the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into.  An 
equity instrument is any contact that evidences 
a residual interest in the assets of the group after 
deducting all of its financial liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts 
are recorded initially at fair value, net of direct 
transaction costs.  Such instruments are 
subsequently carried at their amortised cost and 
finance charges, including premiums payable on 
settlement or redemption, are recognised in the 
income statement over the term of the instrument 
using an effective rate of interest.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are not interest 
bearing, are initially stated at their fair value and 
subsequently at amortised cost.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the company are 
recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct 
issue costs. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 34

 2 SEGMENTAL ANALYSIS
As at 31 October 2010, the Group is primarily organised into three main business segments, which are detailed below.
Financial information is reported to the Board on a business unit basis with revenue and operating profits split by 
business unit.  Each business unit is deemed a reportable segment as each offer different products and services.
Software – delivers software and service solutions to mainly local government customers across a broad range of  >
departments
Solutions – delivering both an information service and consultancy services to a diverse range of customers across  >
both private and public sectors
Recruitment – providing personnel with information, knowledge, records and content management expertise to a  >
diverse range of customers 
Segment revenue comprises of sales to external customers and excludes gains arising on the disposal of assets 
and finance income. Segment profit reported to the board represents the profit earned by each segment before the 
allocation of tax, interest payments and share option charges.  The assets and liabilities of the Group are not reviewed 
by the chief executive decision-maker on a segment basis.
The Group does not place reliance on any specific customer and has no individual customer that generates 10% or 
more of its total Group revenue.

Impairment test for goodwill
For this review goodwill was allocated to individual Cash Generating Units (CGU) on the basis of the Group’s operations. 
The carrying value of goodwill by each CGU is as follows:
2010 2009
£000 £000

Idox Information Solutions 3,804 1,310
TFPL Recruitment 1,957 1,957
23,631 19,237
The recoverable amount of all CGU’s has been determined using value-in-use calculations.  These calculations use pre-
tax cash flow projections based on financial budgets approved by management covering the next five financial years.  
Cash flows beyond this period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below.
For value in use calculations, the growth rates and margins used to estimate future performance are based on 
management’s best estimate of short term performance based on an assessment of market opportunities and macro 
economic conditions. In the year to 31 October 2010 and the year to 31 October 2009, the Weighted Average Cost of 
Capital for the Group has been used as an appropriate discount rate to apply to cash flows. This represents the overall 
required return on the Group as a whole and is also considered appropriate to each CGU.
The assumptions used for the value in use calculations are as follows and are considered appropriate for each of the risk 
profiles of the respective CGU:
2010 2009
Discount rate 12.5% 12.5%
Growth rate 2% 2%
These assumptions have been used for the analysis of each CGU.
Sensitivities have been run on cash flow forecasts for all CGU’s. Management are satisfied that the key assumptions are 
achievable and that reasonably possible changes to those key assumptions would not lead to the carrying amount of 
the relevant CGU exceeding the recoverable amount.   Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 45

The provision allowance in respect of trade receivables is used to record impairment losses unless the Group is 
satisfied that no recovery of the amount owing is possible.  At that point the amounts are considered irrecoverable 
and are written off against the trade receivable directly.  Where trade receivables are past due an assessment is made 
of individual customers and the outstanding balance.  No provision is required in respect of amounts owed by group 
undertakings.

The average interest rate paid was 4.28% (2009: 6.51%).  Bank borrowings of £2,866,000 (2009: £3,781,000) were 
arranged at floating interest rates.  
As security for the above loans, the Bank of Scotland plc holds a bond and floating charge over the assets of the Group, 
a composite guarantee supported by each Group company and a share pledge in respect of the entire issued share 
capital of each subsidiary company.
The loans are repayable in six monthly installments.  Interest on the loans is payable quarterly in arrears.

21 RISK MANAGEMENT OBJECTIVES AND POLICIES
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise cash and cash equivalents, short term deposits and bank 
borrowings. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s operations. The Group has 
other financial instruments which mainly comprise trade receivables and trade payables which arise directly from its 
operations.
Risk management is carried out by the finance department under policies approved by the board of directors. The 
Group finance department identifies, evaluates and manages financial risks. The board provides guidance on overall risk 
management including foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, and investment of excess liquidity.
The impact of the risks required to be discussed under IFRS 7 are detailed below:
Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
Foreign exchange risk arises when future commercial transactions or recognised assets or liabilities are denominated in 
a currency that is not the group’s functional currency.  The Group has minimal exposure to foreign exchange risk.  
(ii) Price risk
The Group is exposed to equity securities price risk due to investments held by the group.  The group is not exposed to 
commodity price risk.
(iii) Cash flow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk in respect of cash balances held with banks and other highly rated 
counterparties. 
The Group’s main interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings.  Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the 
group to cash flow interest rate risk.  Borrowings issued at fixed rates expose the group to fair value interest rate risk.  
During 2010 and 2009, all the group’s borrowings at variable rate were denominated in UK Sterling.
Credit risk
The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk is limited to the carrying amount of financial assets recognised at the 
reporting date, as summarised below:
2010 2009
£000 £000
Cash and cash equivalents 2,004 6,947
Trade receivables 4,509 4,128
Amounts recoverable on contracts 484 1,360
Assets available for sale 855 -
Other receivables 100 160
Financial assets at fair value 7,952 12,595
Credit risk is managed on a group basis.  Credit risks arise from cash and cash equivalents and deposits with banks 
and financial institutions, as well as credit exposures to customers, including outstanding receivables and committed 
transactions.  
The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.  It is the policy of the Group to present the 
amounts in the balance sheet net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based 
on prior experience and the current economic environment. The Group reviews the reliability of its customers on a 
regular basis, such a review takes into account the nature of and the Group’s trading history with the customer. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 52
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are three banks with high credit-ratings assigned 
by international credit-rating agencies. Management does not expect any losses from non-performance of these 
counterparties.
None of the Group’s financial assets are secured by collateral or other credit enhancements.
Liquidity risk
The Group closely monitors its access to bank and other credit facilities in comparison to its outstanding commitments 
on a regular basis to ensure that it has sufficient funds to meet obligations of the group as they fall due.
The board receives regular debt management forecasts which estimate the cash inflows and outflows over the next 
twelve months, so that management can ensure that sufficient financing is in place as it is required.  Surplus cash within 
the Group is put on deposit in accordance with limits and counterparties agreed by the Board, the objective being to 
maximise return on funds whilst ensuring that the short-term cashflow requirements of the Group are met.
Detailed analysis of the debt facilities taken out and available to the group are disclosed in note 19.  
As at 31 October 2010, the Group’s financial liabilities have contractual maturities (including interest payments where 
applicable) as summarised below:
Current Current Non-current Non-current
Within 6 months 6 – 12 months 1 – 5 years Later than 5 years
£000 £000 £000 £000
Bank borrowings 565 553 2,095 -
Trade and other payables 2,784 - - -
This compares to the maturity of the Group’s financial liabilities in the previous reporting period as follows:
Current Current Non-current Non-current
Within 6 months 6 – 12 months 1 – 5 years Later than 5 years
£000 £000 £000 £000
Bank borrowings 592 661 3,345 -
Trade and other payables 3,171 - - -
The above amounts reflect the contractual undiscounted cashflows, which may differ from the carrying values of the 
liabilities at the reporting date.
If interest rates increased by 1%, the contractual undiscounted cashflows would increase by £45,000. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 53
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Notes to the Accounts cont’d
Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in 
order to provide returns for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure 
to reduce the cost of capital. In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the group may adjust the amount of 
dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debts.
Capital for the reporting periods under review is summarised as follows:
2010 2009

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the company’s share price over the previous 
3 years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the management’s best estimate, for the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.

transactions during the year.

24 ACQUISITIONS
GRANTfinder
On 4 May 2010, the Group acquired the entire share capital of GRANTfinder Limited for a consideration of £3.3m, which 
was satisfied as detailed below. 
GRANTfinder is an important provider of value-added databases for government and EU funding information to a wide 
range of UK public and private customers. The acquisition will extend the capabilities of the Idox group with additional 
value-added content and boost its subscription-based recurring revenue stream. GRANTfinder will be easily integrated 
into the enlarged Idox Information Solutions Business which includes j4b Software & Publishing Limited, acquired in 
2009, and the longstanding planning content business. This will deliver a market leading position in the provision of 
grant related information in the UK.
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of GRANTfinder Limited has been capitalised and consists largely of the workforce 
value, synergies and economies of scale expected from combining the operations of GRANTfinder with Idox Information 
Solutions Limited.  None of the goodwill recognised is expected to be deductible for income tax purposes.  The 
purchase of GRANTfinder Limited has been accounted for using the acquisition method of accounting.

28 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
The Group signed a short term working capital banking facility of £6m on 10 December 2010.
On 13 December 2010, the Group announced the acquisition of McLaren Software Group Limited for £1.0m in cash.  
McLaren is a leading supplier of engineering document management and control applications serving many leading 
international companies in industries including oil & gas, mining, utilities, pharmaceuticals and transportation. 
McLaren had revenues of £6.4m for the year ended 31 December 2009, with an operating profit of £0.4m and a loss 
before taxation of £1m resulting from the pre-acquisition capital structure.  Net liabilities at completion are expected to 
be £1.3m.
The acquisition of McLaren extends Idox’s core skills in planning and building documents management into the related 
area of engineering drawings. This will provide Idox with the opportunity of broadening its activities into complementary 
UK and international markets in both the private and public sector, particularly where the management of complex 
engineering systems interacts with regulatory oversight.
Full IFRS 3(R) disclosure has not been included in the financial statements due to the timing of the acquisition.

1 ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable United Kingdom accounting standards and under the 
historical cost convention, except for the valuation of listed investments.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act, 2006.
The trade and assets of Idox Information Service Limited have been hived across to the fellow subsidiary company Idox 
Information Solutions Limited.  As a result, the respective carrying value of Idox plc’s investment in Idox Information 
Services Limited is not justified by the individual recoverable amounts of these entities.  However, a true and fair override 
is enacted to reflect that the value of the overall trade and assets now recorded within Idox Information Solutions Limited 
have not diminished and therefore no overall loss of value has occurred.
Investments
Investments, held as fixed assets, are included at cost less amounts written off for any permanent diminution in value.  
Investments in a UK listed company are measured at market prices.  Movements in market value are recognised 
through the revaluation reserve.
FRS 20 Share Based Payment
All share-based payment arrangements granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested prior to 1 November 2006 
are recognised in the financial statements.
All goods and services received in exchange for the grant of any share-based payment are measured at their fair values.  
Where employees are rewarded using share-based payments, the fair values of employees’ services are determined 
indirectly by reference to the fair value of the instrument granted to the employee.  This fair value is appraised at the 
grant date and excludes the impact of non-market vesting conditions (for example, profitability and sales growth 
targets).
Employees to whom share options have been granted provide their services in subsidiary companies of Idox plc.  All 
equity settled share-based payments are recognised as an expense in the profit and loss account of the relevant 
subsidiary company.  In Idox plc, the cost is allocated to investments in subsidiaries.
If vesting periods or other non-market vesting conditions apply, the expense is allocated over the vesting period, based 
on the best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest.  Estimates are revised subsequently 
if there is any indication that the number of share options expected to vest differs from previous estimates.  Any 
cumulative adjustment prior to vesting is recognised in the current period.  No adjustment is made to any expense 
recognised in prior periods if share options that have vested are not exercised.
Upon exercise of share options, the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital, 
and where appropriate share premium.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax is recognised on all timing differences where the transactions or events that give the company an obligation 
to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred by the balance sheet date.  Deferred 
tax assets are recognised when it is more likely than not that they will be recovered.  Deferred tax is measured using 
rates of tax that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Financial instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the entity after 
deducting all of its financial liabilities. Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 63
For the year ended 31 October 2010
Notes to the Company Financial Statement 
cont’d
Where the contractual obligations of financial instruments (including share capital) are equivalent to a similar debt 
instrument, those financial instruments are classed as financial liabilities. Financial liabilities are presented as such in 
the balance sheet. Finance costs and gains or losses relating to financial liabilities are included in the profit and loss 
account. Finance costs are calculated so as to produce a constant rate of return on the outstanding liability.
Where the contractual terms of share capital do not have any terms meeting the definition of a financial liability then this 
is classed as an equity instrument. Dividends and distributions relating to equity instruments are debited direct to equity.
Interest and expenditure arising on financial instruments is recognised on the accruals basis and credited or charged to 
the profit and loss account in the financial period to which it relates.  The Group does not apply FRS 26.
Operating leases
Leases where the lessor retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as operating leases.  
All leases are operating in nature.  Amounts paid under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a 
straight line basis over the lease term.
2 DIRECTORS AND EMPLOYEES
There are no wages and salaries paid by the parent company.
The company has no employees and directors are remunerated by other group companies.  Details of the remuneration 
for each director are included in the Report on Remuneration which can be found on page 13 but which do not form 
part of the audited accounts.

The directors have proposed the payment of a final dividend of 0.35p per share, which would amount to £1,205,000

4 LOSS FOR THE FINANCIAL YEAR
The parent company has taken advantage of section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 and has not included its own 
profit and loss account in these financial statements.  The parent company’s loss for the year was £712,000 (2009: loss 
£589,000). Idox plc Annual Report and Accounts 2010 64

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the company’s share price over the previous 
3 years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on the management’s best estimate, for the 
effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
The company recognised total expenses of £185,000 (2009: £99,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions during the year.
Transitional Provisions
Under the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 share options granted prior 7 November 2002 but not vested at 1 November 
2006 fall out with the measurement and recognition criteria of IFRS 2 “Share-based Payment”.

treated in accordance with FRS 6 under merger accounting. The share options reserve represents shares to be issued 
on potential exercise of those share options that have been accounted for under FRS20 (IFRS2) Share Based Payments.

13 RELATED PARTY DISCLOSURES
As the parent company of a wholly-owned group, the Company is exempt from the requirements of FRS 8 to disclose 
transactions with other members of the Group headed by Idox plc.
As in the prior year, no transactions with other related parties, including key management personnel, were undertaken

14 POST BALANCE SHEET EVENTS
The Group signed a short term working capital banking facility of £6m on 10 December 2010. 
On 13 December 2010, the Group announced the acquisition of McLaren Software Group Limited for £1.0m in cash.  
McLaren is a leading supplier of engineering document management and control applications serving many leading 
international companies in industries including oil & gas, mining, utilities, pharmaceuticals and transportation. 
McLaren had revenues of £6.4m for the year ended 31 December 2009, with an operating profit of £0.4m and a loss 
before taxation of £1m resulting from the pre-acquisition capital structure.  Net liabilities at completion are expected to 
be £1.3m.
The acquisition of McLaren extends Idox’s core skills in planning and building documents management into the related 
area of engineering drawings. This will provide Idox with the opportunity of broadening its activities into complementary 
UK and international markets in both the private and public sector, particularly where the management of complex 
engineering systems interacts with regulatory oversight.

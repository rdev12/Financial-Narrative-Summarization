Highlights 02  Chime Communications plc
It is a pleasure and a privilege to be joining 
Chime at such an exciting point in its 
development. As Chris Satterthwaite explains 
in his Chief Executive’s Statement, this has 
been a defining year of significant change, and 
one that positions the Group extremely well for 
growth in the future.
Chairman’s Statement
I would like to extend my heartfelt thanks to the outgoing 
Chairman Lord Bell for the leadership that has helped 
to guide Chime to this point. I have been immensely 
impressed by the strength of Chime’s executive team, 
their sense of common purpose and the backing that 
they receive from shareholders. I give Tim great credit for 
building such a strong on-going operation and wish him 
all the best in his future endeavours. As a result of Tim’s 
departure, we will be reshaping the Chime board, with 
new appointments during 2013.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012  03
The breadth of the Chime client list points to the 
considerable strength of the business – and as Chris 
and the divisional heads report in the Chief Executive’s 
Statement, our on-going businesses have continued to add 
to this breadth with new clients and new propositions in 
rapidly growing sectors.
Opportunity in sports marketing and entertainment
We will follow up on our deep involvement in the London 
2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games to take a lead role in 
forthcoming major sports events worldwide, and help brands 
to leverage the uniquely global communications platform that 
sport increasingly represents. London 2012 demonstrated 
the importance of such major showpiece events in 
bringing disparate communities together and forging deep 
engagement with different audiences; it also proved the 
expertise of the UK when it comes to executing such events. 
For the UK’s leading sports marketing and communications 
group, a great opportunity lies in applying this expertise on 
an international scale. I am delighted by the recent arrival of 
Lord Sebastian Coe as Executive Chairman of CSM Sport 
& Entertainment and can think of nobody better to lead our 
efforts to exploit this opportunity .
Driving further integration
There are things that we can do better – and we will 
continue to evolve the Group during 2013 in order to do 
so. A key focus for me lies in continuing to drive greater 
integration across our different disciplines and divisions. 
Today’s communications challenges increasingly call for 
the application of a range of skills and a discipline-neutral 
approach to achieving solutions. We have met these 
challenges successfully by embedding a more integrated 
way of working within Chime brands such as the VCCP 
Partnership, Teamspirit, Open Health and the Good Relations 
Group. I believe that we can create yet more opportunity 
across our sectors by cross-fertilising ideas and solutions 
across these divisions.
Prospects for the business
Despite the continuing challenges of the global economic 
environment, the coming years hold great opportunity for 
Chime. We will continue to evolve our businesses to take full 
advantage of this opportunity . I commend this report and 
accounts to the shareholders as evidence of the progress 
that we are making on this journey .
Lord Davies
Chairman
6 March 2013
Today’s communications challenges 
increasingly call for the application of  
a range of skills and a discipline-neutral 
approach to achieving solutions. We  
have met these challenges successfully  
by embedding a more integrated way of  
working within Chime brands.  04  Chime Communications plc
The strength of Chime’s proposition is 
demonstrated by a strong performance from  
all five of our brand groups during the year.  
2012: A defining year 
2012 has been a defining year for Chime. It has seen 
the disposal of one part of our business and the rapid 
development of several others, building our position as an 
international communications and sports marketing group.  
It has seen us take full advantage of the potential revealed 
by the 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games in London and 
it has introduced new leadership to the Group that will help 
to ensure these opportunities extend into the future.
Introducing new leadership
It gives us great pleasure to welcome Lord Mervyn Davies 
as the new Chairman of Chime. Lord Davies brings a rare 
combination of experience of both government and business 
to the role, and a respected reputation established through 
his work at Standard Chartered and his recent role as Minister 
of State for Trade Investment and Small Business. We are 
also delighted by the arrival of Lord Sebastian Coe as the 
Chairman of CSM Sport & Entertainment. His leadership 
will be invaluable in the global development of our sports 
marketing business and in unlocking the full potential of 
Chime’s international proposition. 
Strong growth from across the Group
The strength of Chime’s proposition is demonstrated by a 
strong performance from all five of our brand groups during 
the year . The Olympics and Paralympics helped to drive 
an excellent contribution from CSM Sport & Entertainment 
as well as generating strong future growth opportunities; 
Chime Insight & Engagement demonstrated the strength of 
its results-focused, highly responsive approach by delivering 
impressive growth in a challenging environment for market 
research; Open Health has built a position as a major player 
in the European healthcare communications market in its first 
full-year of operation; whilst the VCCP Partnership, including 
Teamspirit, has continued to increase revenues at the same 
time as investing in diversified income streams that will help 
to ensure continued growth in the future. The Good Relations 
Group has redefined our proposition in public relations 
following the departure of the Bell Pottinger companies, with 
a strategy built around the “Power of Good” for business.
Leveraging our Sports & Entertainment capabilities 
internationally
The London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games  
re-affirmed the world’s passion for sport and the UK’s  
expertise in building innovative partnerships around it. 
Chief Executive’s Statement  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  05
In this context, the work of CSM Sport & Entertainment in 
London provided a powerful showcase that positions us 
to drive additional growth over the next decade. Chime 
agencies helped to define the experience of the Games for 
both audiences and brands, dressing every Olympic event 
and venue, activating events and hospitality for Olympic 
sponsors, and co-ordinating activity for the International 
Olympic Committee itself. For our branding and way-finding 
specialist agency ICON and event activation business 
iLUKA, work in London is already opening up powerful 
opportunities in Brazil and Russia, the settings for the major 
sporting events taking place between now and 2020.
London 2012 also provided the strongest example yet of 
sport’s power as a global marketing channel, a form of 
content that reaches consumers in every corner of the 
world and excites passion, excitement and loyalty that no 
other communications platform can match. The growing 
importance of sport to brands is shown by the premiums 
that top rights such as the English Premier League still 
command in the midst of a global recession, and by the fact 
that Brazil 2016 is on track to surpass London 2012 when 
it comes to commercial support and sponsorship. Such 
increased demand continues to enhance growth prospects 
across CSM businesses. 
Deeper connections through entertainment
Brands’ demand for content that can drive new levels of 
engagement will not be limited to sport, however . Music 
offers an alternative avenue for building highly emotional 
connections, often with young consumers who are resistant 
to conventional marketing approaches. CSM Sport & 
Entertainment is increasingly extending its sponsorship 
expertise to the music space with work for Lynx Deodorant 
and Beefeater Gin during 2012. Meanwhile, VCCP has 
built on its experience around the launch of the O2 arena, 
now the world’s premier music venue, with its launch of the 
experiential marketing arm, VCCP Live.
Digital channels
Imaginative use of digital and social media is helping to 
bolster leadership positions and create new opportunities 
to grow share across our businesses, and is typified by the 
Good Relations Group’s ground breaking partnership with 
Google and the industry-leading Digital Academy .
VCCP’s approach to advertising is perfectly suited to the 
social media age, focused on populating popular culture, 
with ideas for Compare the Market and Coors Light that 
significantly extend the potential of media budgets through 
“earned” exposure. The agency’s work for easyJet has 
further reinforced its reputation for effectiveness this year . 
Additionally a new facet has been added to its integrated 
offer with the development of real-time search bidding 
solutions that help clients to maintain the fame of their 
brands and campaigns in the digital space.
The rapid growth of Open Health is driven by a highly 
integrated approach built from the start around the new set 
of challenges facing pharmaceutical companies in bringing 
products to market. The launch of digital market research 
agency Watermelon Research has helped to drive growth  
for Chime Insight & Engagement, with innovative use of  
geo-location technology to serve location-specific surveys 
and real-time reporting dashboards that help to align the 
outputs of research ever more closely with clients’  
immediate needs.
The launch of Chime Ventures, which invests in promising 
ideas in marketing communications, will help to ensure a 
pipeline of such market-changing ideas within the Group. 
Chime Innovate, a board of employees under the age of 30, 
that is charged with developing new business propositions, 
ensures that we make full use of the ‘digital native’ human 
resource already at our disposal.
An international business
The international nature of both sports marketing and 
communications is central to Chime’s growth strategy . The 
global sports marketing calendar is driving the expansion of 
CSM Sport & Entertainment. Chime Insight & Engagement 
this year opened research capabilities in Sydney and VCCP 
has increased its footprint in Europe and Asia. We believe 
that such international expansion has a vital role to play in 
delivering sustainable future growth, and we will continue to 
pursue relevant opportunities as they arise.

marketing and communications is central to 
Chime’s growth strategy. 06  Chime Communications plc
CSM Sport & Entertainment
2012 marked a pivotal year in the development of the 
CSM Sport & Entertainment division. Our agencies’ 
in-depth involvement in the Olympic and Paralympic 
Games delivered strong revenue growth during the year, 
and leveraging the expertise demonstrated in London 
is generating powerful additional opportunities both in 
sports marketing and the broader entertainment field.
CSM Sport & Entertainment includes the strategic 
sponsorship agency Fast Track, the rights and athlete 
management business Essentially , branding and way- 
finding specialist Icon, event activation agency iLUKA,  
and pmplegacy, the bid consultancy business which will  
be developed into a fifth pillar for the division during 2013.
London 2012 Olympic and Paralympic Games
The 2012 Games demonstrated the tremendous depth of 
the CSM Sport & Entertainment division’s full-service sports 
marketing offer through the spectacularly successful and 
high-profile work of its leading agencies. 
The work of branding and way-finding specialist Icon was 
seen across the 2012 venues, with its turnkey solution to 
implementing the Olympic livery and palette, dressing 
venues and ensuring easy navigation for visitors, all forming 
an important and high-profile element of the Games’ 
success. iLUKA, the event activation specialist acquired 
by the division this year , dominated hospitality during the 
Games, activating programmes for 14 official partners. The 
agency’s event programmes included those of Coca-Cola, 
GSK, Lloyds TSB, Cadbury , and a spectacular solution 
for BP that transformed the Royal Opera House in Covent 
Garden into an Olympic museum. In addition, iLUKA ’s 
work for the International Olympic Committee included 
management of the IOC club hospitality at the Olympic 
stadium itself.
Our strategic consulting agency Fast Track developed 
communications and activation strategy for Games  
sponsor BT in the build-up to and during the Games, and 
handled the majority of sports presentation work at Olympic 
and Paralympic venues, co-ordinating the live experience  
for spectators.
Demonstrating the broader value of sport
Beyond the impact on revenues during 2012 itself, the 
London Games provided the most powerful example yet 
of the potential of sports sponsorship to forge deeper 
connections with consumers; connections that can be 
executed and expressed across a growing range of content 
platforms – and which increasingly reach audiences across 
every corner of the globe. Fast Track’s strong performance 
during the year demonstrates the growing demand for such 
powerful sponsorship solutions, with work for brands such as 
HSBC, Land Rover , BT , GSK and Emirates across sports from 
Rugby and Cricket to Football, Tennis, Triathlon and beyond.
Leveraging the London opportunity
The CSM Sport & Entertainment division has moved 
decisively to leverage the opportunity that the London 
Games is generating on the global stage. The arrival of Lord 
Sebastian Coe as chairman is hugely exciting, introducing 
the expertise of arguably the most recognisable and 
respected figure in the business of sport, and providing 
a compelling reason for CSM Sport & Entertainment 
to be invited into the decisions of countries bidding 
for major sporting events – and corporations weighing 
sports sponsorship options. Lord Coe’s arrival will help to 
accelerate the development of our pmplegacy business, with 
the agency’s offer in the bid consultancy space providing 
the division with a fifth pillar alongside Fast Track’s strategic 
sponsorship consultancy, Essentially’s rights and athlete 
management expertise, and the executional excellence of 
iLUKA and Icon.
International growth represents another immediate 
opportunity, in particular the division’s increasing footprint in 
the territories that will dominate the world’s sporting calendar 
over the next decade. Golden Goal, the business previously 
acquired in Brazil and now rebranded as CSM Brazil, is 
expanding rapidly in response to accelerating demand 
in the territory that will host both the 2014 FIFA World 
Cup and 2016 Olympic and Paralympic Games, creating 
opportunities around these events for agencies across the 
division. The expansion of our Moscow office is helping to 
generate further business around the 2014 Winter Olympics 
in Sochi – and our presence in Qatar and Abu Dhabi ensures 
continuing opportunity around the very biggest sporting 
events over the longer term.
Strengthening through strategic acquisition and  
key hires
The division’s acquisition policy will continue to focus on 
areas of strategic opportunity both geographically and in 
terms of adding capabilities to address areas of increasing 
demand. Organic growth, supported by the hiring of new 
talent, will also play a key role in this.
Divisional Review  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  07
In line with this policy , the arrival of McKenzie Clark during 
2012 introduces valuable branding and production skills that 
are hugely complementary to the proposition of Icon. The 
acquisition of iLUKA, and the immediate results that this has 
delivered through activity at London 2012, demonstrates that 
CSM Sport & Entertainment is now a leading global player in 
the execution of major sporting events and the activation of 
sponsorship programmes connected to them.
Expansion into the entertainment space
Like sport, entertainment offers brands an opportunity 
to build new forms of emotive, content-rich connections 
with consumers, and this potential is shown in rapidly 
increasing demand for applying Essentially’s expertise to 
music sponsorship deals. Lynx Deodorant, SABMiller and 
Beefeater Gin are among the brands the agency has worked 
with to leverage music’s connection to key youth audiences. 
The division is investing in building additional expertise  
in this area to meet fast-growing interest amongst  
potential clients.
Outlook for 2013
The CSM Sport & Entertainment division’s high-profile role in 
the success of London 2012, together with our geographical 
exposure to other major upcoming sporting events, provides 
strong impetus for continued growth in 2013. However , 
growth potential is not limited to the major sporting cycles 
of the FIFA World Cup and Olympic Games, with additional 
opportunities continually emerging around global football, 
cricket, rugby and many other areas. 
Part of the strength of sport lies in its genuinely global 
appeal – and part of the strength of the sports marketing 
business lies in the way that it provides access to growth 
opportunities in diverse markets, countering the impact of 
on-going recession in Europe. Even within those countries 
that continue to feel the impact of the economic downturn, 
the large sums commanded by rights owners testify to the 
robust value of sport in the eyes of marketers.
In an age where content is frequently declared “king”, 
sport often provides the most compelling content of 
all, commanding loyalty beyond reason amongst fans 
and generating huge opportunities for sponsor brands 
in meeting audiences’ appetite for more. CSM Sport & 
Entertainment will continue to grow its expertise in digital 
content and platforms to ensure that it remains at the cutting 
edge in leveraging the opportunities that both sport and 
entertainment provide. 
VCCP Partnership
At a time of continued pressure on marketing budgets, 
The VCCP Partnership has maintained its strong track 
record for delivering famous, effective marketing 
campaigns, whilst broadening its offer to develop new 
channels for growth.
The VCCP Partnership is an integrated marketing services 
business offering advertising, content, experiential 
marketing, data consultancy and media. It also includes  
the specialist financial services agency group Teamspirit.
Delivering famous work in challenging times
The Partnership has felt the impact of intensifying pressure 
on clients’ marketing budgets, which have constrained 
revenues for the marketing services industry as a whole 
during 2012. Despite this, it has continued to grow revenues 
year-on-year , and further reinforced its reputation for 
delivering high-profile, highly effective campaigns that can 
generate increased value through “earned” media exposure. 
Our strategy of populating popular culture through highly 
integrated campaigns that leverage the full potential of 
digital and social platforms is seen in stand-out work for 
Easyjet, which has been credited with contributing to a 
doubling of the company’s share price, O2, which we now 
support across five European markets, Coors Light and 
Compare the Market.
At a time when clients are focused on the tangible 
returns that marketing investment can deliver , The VCCP 
Partnership’s ability to set the popular culture agenda and 
extend the impact of media budgets ensure that its services 
remain in strong demand. The Partnership added a number 
of high-profile new accounts during the year , including the 
online bookmaker BetVictor , for which it delivered yet another 
famous campaign, McLaren, Laithwaites wine, Which? 
Magazine, the Avis Budget Group and the cancer charity 
MacMillan. 
Diversified revenue streams
The VCCP Partnership has responded to the constraints  
on traditional Above-the-Line spend with significant 
investment in a broader offer that is already delivering  
new lines of revenue.
The recently launched content marketing business, VCCP 
Content is delivering significant amounts of work for clients 
across both online and traditional broadcast channels, 
with O2’s Guru TV service helping customers to get more 
from their mobile phones, a particular highlight. VCCP Live,  08  Chime Communications plc
the experiential marketing business launched during the 
year is working with McLaren to deliver high-profile events 
throughout the F1 calendar . The data consultancy Conduit 
meets a demand increasingly expressed by clients for 
planning resources to keep pace with the data generated  
by digital channels. VCCP Media, which specialises in  
digital platforms, ensures that the Partnership now provides 
a fully end-to-end service when it comes to planning 
integrated campaigns.
Teamspirit continued to experience strong demand for its 
content-generation, digital and PR offerings, demonstrating 
the increasing value of “earned” and “owned” channels for 
the financial services market. The agency delivered a strong 
new business performance with encouraging momentum in 
the second half of the year . A solid performance from Pure 
Media showed the continuing competitiveness of its high-
value, specialised media planning for financial services and 
other clients. 
International growth
The Partnership has significantly increased its international 
footprint, responding to client demand for new approaches 
within Europe, whilst opening up additional opportunities in 
faster growing markets.
The Partnership has built on the continued success of 
its Prague and Berlin offices with the launch of a Madrid 
operation that meets demand from existing client Telefonica 
whilst opening up new avenues of opportunity in the key 
rapid-growth market of Brazil. VCCP’s highly integrated, 
digital-led offer is generating strong interest within Spain,  
at a time when economic conditions are forcing marketers to 
challenge conventional approaches.
In Asia, the launch of the Group’s Sydney office continues to 
build presence in a key rapid-growth region, in conjunction 
with VCCP’s existing operation in Singapore.
Outlook for 2013
Investment in new market launches and the diversification of 
The Partnership’s offer has held back margins during 2012. 
However , we expect this investment to deliver improved 
growth in both margin and revenues during the year to come. 
The strong performance of VCCP Content during 2012 along 
with gathering momentum for VCCP Media points to these 
agencies making a contribution during the year . Expansion 
into new markets is likely to bring additional opportunity, 
particularly through The Partnership’s growing Asian hub, 
and the opportunities that our Madrid office is helping to 
develop in Latin America.
The Good Relations Group
The divestment of the Bell Pottinger Group in July 
ensured that 2012 was a defining year for Chime’s 
PR division. In establishing the Good Relations 
Group and building on our existing expertise in 
Corporate Responsibility, advocacy, b2b and brand 
communications, we have developed a compelling and 
timely offer that is already resonating in the marketplace.
The Good Relations Group comprises Good Relations Brand 
Communications, Good Relations Political Communications, 
Corporate Citizenship, Harvard, InEvidence, Good Relations 
Regional, TTA Property, Harvard Germany, MMK, and Traffic 
Communications.
Communications for radically transparent times
The restructuring of the division has enabled us to define 
a proposition for the Good Relations Group that addresses 
the rapidly changing needs of brands and companies in 
radically transparent times. Our new offering focuses on 
brand building communications and CR consultancy,  
helping clients to build trusted brands that are rooted in 
good relationships.
The new position has been expressed through a bold 
rebranding of the Group around the Power of Good 
in driving relationships and results for business. This 
new branding supports an end-to-end approach to 
communications, in which the actions of a brand or company 
are integral to its reputation, and the ability to leverage those 
actions through PR and customer advocacy are integral to 
its success.
Evidence is mounting that the success of a business is 
becoming closely linked to its ability to demonstrate that it is 
a “force for good”; and that the failure of many companies 
to do so accounts for the significant trust issues that they 
face. The solutions offered by the Good Relations Group 
enable clients to account for the good that they do through 
credible, in-depth impact studies, to make better decisions 
about the actions that they take and the CR strategies that 
they adopt, to engage consumers and stakeholders in their 
efforts using a range of digital and social platforms, and to 
turn those stakeholders and customers into valuable brand 
advocates. With the additional capability to deliver classic 
PR campaigns and to apply the Power of Good approach 
to specialist sectors such as technology and property, this 
adds up to a compelling and timely proposition.
Divisional Review
continued  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  09
New business performance
The strength of the Group’s offer is demonstrated by a 
new business performance that remained solid despite 
the considerable disruption caused by the divestment 
and restructuring process. Good Relations began work 
with Nicoventures, Pilsner Urquell / SABMiller , Serco and 
Budgens/Londis during the year , whilst new business for our 
leading CR agency Corporate Citizenship included EADS, 
Fujitsu, and the European Investment Bank. Technology 
specialist Harvard began work with Huawei whilst opening 
up new opportunities with Sky , Harvard Germany was 
appointed by HTC, and the customer reference agency 
InEvidence was appointed to the Vodafone account.
Innovative work across platforms
The Group’s strategy calls for a leap forward in the use 
of digital and social media for driving engagement and 
advocacy, with the goal of creating the most digitally 
literate and empowered employees in the PR industry . 
A groundbreaking partnership with Google marks a key 
early milestone in this roadmap, with agency employees 
undergoing intense training in use of Google’s growing 
range of search and social tools, a first for a PR agency  
in the UK.
The centrality of digital is already reflected in the stand-out 
work delivered by the Group during the year , including the 
global brand relaunch of Pilsner Urquell, building a global 
social media community for Airbus, driving advocacy and 
endorsement across Facebook and Twitter for Weetabix,  
and delivering integrated campaigns across digital and 
social platforms for Hewlett Packard and Sky .
Outlook for 2013 
Good Relations Group has developed a proposition to the 
market that perfectly reflects the reality of stakeholder and 
customer engagement in the digital age. The promising 
momentum shown in the second half of 2012 indicates the 
strength of demand for such an offer . We expect the Group 
to develop further during 2013 on the back of increased new 
business, the launch of new services around leadership, 
internal and crisis communications, and the extension of our 
leading-edge corporate citizenship and customer advocacy 
services to new markets.
OPEN Health Group
In its first full year of operation, the OPEN Health Group 
has established itself as a significant player in the 
European healthcare market, with a distinctive channel 
and discipline-neutral approach, and a focus on helping 
pharmaceutical companies adapt to a changing market 
environment and a new set of challenges.
OPEN Health includes the advertising and brand 
communication practice, OPEN LEC, the medical education 
agency Succinct, the healthcare public relations business 
Reynolds Mackenzie, the medical market research agency 
OPEN Plan, the digital operation The Earthworks, market 
access experts PH Associates and data consultants  
Harvey Walsh.
A business designed for growth
As a new player in the market, OPEN Health has been able 
to build its proposition around the strongest growth sectors 
in the pharmaceutical and healthcare industries, expanding 
the business through both organic growth and acquisition.
The Group’s senior management team are established 
names within the UK and European healthcare market, and 
this team has handpicked agencies to join the Group from 
across the sectors that it believes offer the strongest current 
and future opportunities.
The OPEN Health approach to client briefs aims to bring the 
specific expertise of our leading agency brands together , 
in a joined-up approach that adds significant value to client 
businesses. This approach is realised through a very ‘open’ 
management culture that brings together the leaders of 
the individual agencies in working groups and strategic 
leadership teams.
Rapid arrival as market leaders
Within its first full year , OPEN Health has grown to a point 
where it works with 87 different client companies and 250 
separate brands, with a very significant majority of the 
world’s leading pharmaceutical companies represented 
on its client list and increasing work amongst diagnostic 
organisations and device manufacturers. Significant wins 
during 2012 included the pan-European launch of a major 
new antibiotic that brought together five of the agency 
brands within the Group to deliver services from PR through 
market research to medical and brand communications. 10  Chime Communications plc
Meeting new challenges for the pharmaceutical sector
For pharmaceutical companies, the challenges involved in 
launching and promoting medicines are broader than ever . 
Governments and healthcare purchasing organisations 
demand an evidence-based approach to both the 
scientific and economic impact of medicines and medical 
interventions. Only treatments that can prove positive 
benefits in both of these areas are rewarded with access to 
markets. In building a market access and medical education 
offer that is designed around meeting these challenges, 
OPEN Health is establishing a leadership position in the area 
on which the launch of any medicine increasingly depends. 
Our integration of data planning with market access and 
medical communications skills has already supported a 
number of key clients with major launches during 2012.
With patients exercising greater influence over their own 
treatment, the economic impact of remedies increasingly 
depends upon an ability to communicate awareness to the 
broader public. End-to-end solutions that integrate market 
access consultancy with executional expertise through 
public relations and social and online media are therefore 
increasingly in demand – and the Group’s integrated offering 
is tailored to delivering them. 
Digital to the fore
Digital channels have an increasing role to play in 
communicating benefits to both patients and practitioners, 
and specific expertise is essential for balancing the use 
of digital and social channels with the requirements of 
medical regulation. Digital skills underpin every element of 
the OPEN Health business, from the gathering of insight 
and data for market access solutions to effective targeting 
of practitioners and patients and the execution of PR and 
marketing campaigns for both audiences.
Prospects for 2013
We expect OPEN Health to continue to deliver strong growth 
during 2013, as its uniquely integrated approach and market 
access expertise continue to generate traction in the market. 
The Group’s success in handling an increasing number  
of pan-European launch briefs points to the additional 
growth potential that exists in leveraging this expertise  
on a regional basis.
Divisional Review
continued
Chime Insight & Engagement Group
A high-quality, highly responsive approach and a 
focus on the role of research in driving engagement 
have helped Chime’s Insight & Engagement division to 
deliver strong growth in revenue and profitability in a 
challenging market.
Chime’s Insight & Engagement division comprises the 
agencies Facts International, Naked Eye, Opinion Leader , 
StratAgile, Tree London and Watermelon Research.  
It provides a full-service research offer to clients, 
incorporating digital, face-to-face and telephone-based 
techniques for qualitative, quantitative and deliberative 
research programmes.
2012 has continued to set challenges for the market 
research industry . The strong performance delivered by 
the division in meeting these challenges demonstrates that 
agencies focused on the measurable client benefits that 
research can deliver will continue to prosper . In beating 
its budget forecasts for the year , CIE continued to show 
the value of an integrated research approach, developing 
tailored solutions that draw on the complementary skills 
of its different agencies, from qualitative and quantitative 
programmes to deliberative workshops, face-to-face 
fieldwork and IVR. The 2012 performance incorporated  
year-on-year growth for each of these businesses.
The year also saw CIE improve its position from 16th to 8th  
in Marketing magazine’s league table of top insight agencies, 
establishing it as a top ten UK operation for the first time.
Applying research drives performance
The full title of the division, Insight & Engagement, 
encapsulates a commitment to the practical application 
of research, using client-side experience to analyse and 
present information in a way that anticipates how it can be 
most effectively used within a business. Our approach is 
focused on delivering immediate benefits to the bottom line 
in terms of audience engagement and revenue generation.
Major new projects conducted during the year for O2, 
Ofqual, Thames Water and HSBC testify to the demand that 
exists for this type of market research proposition, whether 
applied to quick-fire surveys that produce instant snapshots 
on customer satisfaction, in-depth ROI studies to assess the 
effectiveness of major sponsorships and brand campaigns, 
or deliberative strategic consultancy to help guide business 
development and public policy .   
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  11
Expanding capabilities and geographic reach
The launch of the digital research agency , Watermelon 
Research, has completed the division’s full-service research 
offer whilst delivering immediate profitability on a monthly 
basis. Watermelon’s work with mobile apps and online 
communities ensures real-time, instantly actionable feedback 
to help businesses respond to issues and opportunities as 
they develop.
The success of the launch demonstrates the growing 
importance of digital technology to research solutions. The 
division has succeeded in capturing a growing slice of such 
business thanks to a high-quality approach that leverages 
digital platforms to deliver greater responsiveness for clients, 
adapting questionnaires and programmes in real-time to 
reflect changing needs.
International expansion provides another route to extending 
our client offer . The agency is launching a new operation in 
Sydney, Australia, which will ensure 24-hour response and 
availability for clients worldwide.
Pioneering new forms of delivery
The division’s commitment to engagement extends to 
developing new platforms for sharing insights with clients 
rapidly and efficiently: we have made increasing use of 
mobile platforms to deliver results to key decision-makers, 
and videos and podcasts to communicate findings in new 
and more engaging ways.
Strengthening a quality team
The CIE Group approach is rooted in the expertise of its 
senior team, and the perspective that client-side experience 
brings in judging how research can play an effective role in 
delivering measurable business results. The division moved 
to strengthen this senior team further during 2012, with 
the arrival of Caroline Bates, formerly head of brand and 
marketing strategy for O2, and a number of other director-
level hires.
Outlook for 2013
The market research sector continues to face challenging 
conditions. However , the continuation of CIE Group’s highly 
integrated, results-focused approach will deliver further 
opportunities to outperform the market. The expansion  
of the division’s digital offering and the round-the-clock 
research support enabled through the opening of the 
Sydney operation will provide additional competitive 
advantages to be leveraged during the year . 12  Chime Communications plc

Reported operating profit decreased by 74% to £4.9 
million (2011: £18.7 million) and reported profit before tax 
decreased by 86% to £2.5 million (2011: £17.8 million). 
Reported earnings per share decreased to (1.6p) from  
15.9p in 2011.
The Board consider it important to set out for shareholders  
in more detail the background to the change in accounting 
that has resulted in a deemed remuneration charge of  
£11.3 million in the 2012 income statement and a £3.0 million 
adjustment to the prior year income statement.
The Group has acquired a number of businesses from 
founding shareholders who were also key managers 
of the businesses acquired. These businesses were 
acquired under sale agreements where a proportion of the 
consideration is paid on completion and a proportion is 
paid over time based on the performance of the acquired 
business, but is only payable if the sellers continue in 
employment, i.e. continue to drive the business forward in 
the Company’s interest and to protect the value of the asset 
the Company has acquired. This form of agreement is used 
to protect the Company from the risks of paying all the 
consideration at the date of acquisition. 
Over the period of the Sale Agreements these seller 
managers receive both salary and bonus as well as the 
deferred consideration for the business acquired. The 
position previously taken by management and supported 
by the Board has been that judgement should be used 
to determine what part of these combined payments are 
compensation and what parts are capital in nature. This was 
done by reference to paying market salaries and bonuses 
and clearly defining in the agreements the capital sums 
negotiated by reference to market conditions at the time  
of acquisition. 
1.  A reconciliation of these headline numbers to the reported numbers can be 
found on pages 14 and 15. The headline numbers adjust for the following:
• Business in the process of being discontinued – During 2012 all the Bell 
Pottinger branded businesses were either sold or were in the process of being 
exited. Chime has been exiting the geopolitical business within Bell Pottinger 
since late 2011, although there remains one contract which ends in April 2013. 
The work has been sub-contracted to third parties and Chime is not expected 
to make any profit or loss on this contract in the period to completion. Under 
accounting standards this line of business does not meet the definition of 
 discontinued at 31 December 2012 due to Chime’s legal obligation in the 
completion of the contract. Given the substantial exit of this business, we have 
shown the impact in this annual report as if this business was discontinued so as 
to provide helpful information about our on-going business.
• The impact of the change in accounting policy in respect of earn-out payments 
as explained in note 2.
• Charges to the income statement in respect of amortisation of intangible assets, 
impairment of goodwill and costs relating to acquisition and restructuring.
Note:  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  13
The position taken by the IFRS IC is that the presence of a 
clause requiring continued employment in order to receive 
the deferred consideration agreed under the share sale 
agreement, by its very existence, means all payments must 
be deemed remuneration for the service provided over the 
period of the continued employment. 
Although your Board does not believe that this approach 
reflects the substance of the agreements, in order to comply 
fully with IFRS as clarified by the IFRS IC, your Board has 
made the adjustments required to be consistent with the 
position taken by the IFRS IC.
Cash flow and banking arrangements
Net cash at 31 December 2012 was £4.2 million compared 
to £3.3 million at 31 December 2011. The Group continued 
to generate cash in 2012 with cash from operating activities 
of £12.0 million (2011: £12.9 million).
A new four year borrowing facility has been agreed with  
RBS for £47 million. This runs until September 2016, with  
an interest rate of between 1.75% and 2.25%, depending  
on use of the facility compared to EBITDA. 
Deferred consideration and deemed remuneration
The estimated earn-outs (which include consideration 
treated as deemed remuneration) payable in 2013 total 
£19.9 million and are payable £11.7 million in cash and  
£8.2 million in shares. 
Capital expenditure and investment
Total capital expenditure for 2012 was £3.1 million (2011: 
£5.0 million). The main category of investment is fixtures  
and fittings (£2.7 million).
Procurement
The Group operates a central procurement function which 
uses the power of the Group to ensure that all businesses 
buy materials and services as cost effectively as possible.
Pensions
All the Group’s employees are entitled to contribute to the 
Group’s pension scheme or to personal pension schemes. 
These are defined contribution schemes.
Taxation
The effective tax rate for 2012 was 27.6% compared to 
28.8% for 2011.
The effective tax rate excludes amortisation of intangibles, 
impairment of goodwill, write down of investments, costs 
of acquisitions, deemed remuneration and discounting of 
deferred consideration, none of which are tax deductible.
The rate is expected to reduce in future years particularly 
as the Group pays the majority of its tax in the UK where the 
rate of corporation tax continues to fall.
Dividends
The Board proposes a final dividend of 5.14p per share 
(2011: 4.50p per share). This will be payable on 14 June 
2013 to shareholders on the register at 24 May 2013.  
The ex-dividend date is 22 May 2013. 
Total dividend for the year was 7.24p compared to 6.58p in 
2012. An increase of 10%. This represents a dividend cover 
of three times. 
Finance costs
Finance costs net of interest receivable were £0.6 million. 
In addition there was a charge of £0.6 million in relation to 
the finance cost of deferred consideration and deemed 
remuneration.
Treasury policy 
The Group’s treasury policy is detailed in note 38 to the 
financial statements.
Capital structure
The Group is financed primarily through equity but has 
available credit facilities as detailed above.

Directors’ Statement on Corporate Governance  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  23
Corporate governance report
The Company is committed to the principles of Corporate 
Governance contained in the 2010 UK Corporate 
Governance Code issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council (the “Code”) for which the Board is accountable to 
shareholders.
Directors and the Board
Board balance
The Board is comprised of two Executive and six Non-
Executive Directors (including the Non-Executive Chairman). 
The respective periods of appointment are shown on page 
25 and the biographies of each Director are shown on 
pages 16 to 18.
Board effectiveness
The Board meets quarterly and additionally as necessary 
and is responsible for overall Group strategy , acquisitions 
and the consideration of significant financial matters and 
major areas of risk. It reviews the strategic direction of 
the Group’s trading companies, their annual budgets and 
their progress towards achievement of those budgets. The 
Board is responsible for ensuring the integrity of financial 
information and that the financial controls and systems of 
risk management, both financial and nonfinancial, are robust 
and appropriate. 
New Directors receive a full, formal and tailored induction 
on joining the Board in order to further inform them of the 
Group’s activities and structure. All Directors are able to take 
independent professional advice, at the Group’s expense, in 
the furtherance of their duties, if necessary . The Company 
also makes appropriate training available to all existing 
Directors. 
When absence from meetings is unavoidable, the views 
of the Director concerned are sought in advance then 
put to the meeting in order to facilitate a comprehensive 
discussion. Each Director continues to make themselves 
available to their fellow Directors and ensures he/she 
contributes to the major decisions before the Board. 
Executive Directors are entitled to accept external 
appointments outside the Company and retain the fees from 
such appointments provided that the Chairman’s permission 
is sought and confirmed by the Board.
Chairman, Chief Executive and Senior Independent 
Director
The Chairman, Lord Davies, ensures that all Directors 
receive sufficient, accurate and timely information on 
financial, business and corporate issues prior to meetings. 
He also ensures that his fellow Non-Executive Directors have 
access to any further supplementary information they require 
should they request it.
The Chief Executive’s (Christopher Satterthwaite) 
responsibilities focus on co-ordinating the Group’s business 
and implementing its strategy . He is also a member of the 
Executive Management Team as detailed on page 19.
Rodger Hughes is the Senior Independent Non-Executive 
Director and is also Chairman of each of the standing 
committees.
Non-Executive Directors
The Board considers its current Non-Executive Directors 
to be of sufficient calibre and number that their views 
be of sufficient weight that no individual or small group 
can dominate the Board’s decision making process. 
Their qualifications and experience is relevant to their 
directorships and in their appointments to the Committees 
where relevant.
The Non-Executive Directors’ terms and conditions of 
appointment are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office on request and will be available, together 
with the Executive Directors’ service contracts, at the 
forthcoming AGM. 24  Chime Communications plc
Special Committee
In January 2012 the Board convened a Special Committee 
to consider , manage and agree the disposal of the Bell 
Pottinger Businesses to Lord Bell (then Chime’s Chairman) 
and Piers Pottinger (then Deputy Chairman) and members 
of the Bell Pottinger management team. The Committee 
was made up of the Board excluding Lord Bell and Piers 
Pottinger and was chaired by Rodger Hughes, the Senior 
Independent Director .
Independence of Non-Executive Directors
The Code states that it is for the Board to determine 
whether a Director is independent in character and 
judgement and consider whether there are any relationships 
or circumstances that are likely to affect a Director’s 
judgement.
In applying the Code, the Board has considered a number 
of factors in determining the independence of each Non-
Executive Director .
Length of service
The length of service of each Non-Executive Director has 
been considered in determining their independence (see 
chart on page 25).
The Board has considered whether the length of service 
of Paul Richardson (15 years) has compromised his 
independence. He is experienced and accomplished in 
his fields of expertise. In his association with the Group he 
has acquired an understanding of the Group’s operations, 
its markets and the issues determining its success. He 
has shown commitment to the Company in both time and 
effort. The Board does not consider his long service to be 
detrimental or to have eroded his objectivity and it should not 
raise any concerns about his ability to perform his duties to 
the benefit of the shareholders. In December 2012,  
Mr Richardson stepped down from his membership of the 
Audit Committee. 
The Board has also considered the length of service of 
Catherine Biner Bradley (12 years). Catherine is a lawyer 
specialising in business law and international tax matters 
and additionally has experience from membership of Boards 
and Audit Committees of major companies. Her knowledge 
and experience of legal and risk management issues 
continues to be exercised in the performance of her duties 
and this is complemented by her knowledge of the Group 
gained during her service. The Board does not consider 
her long service as a Director to be detrimental or to have 
eroded her objectivity and it should not raise concerns 
about her ability to perform her duties to the benefit of the 
Company’s shareholders.
Non-Executive Directors’ shareholdings
The question of Non-Executive Directors’ shareholdings 
should also be considered when assessing independence. 
Rodger Hughes and Catherine Biner Bradley each hold a 
small number of shares in the Company as disclosed on 
page 40. The Board considers that these holdings are not 
significant and believes this should not raise questions 
regarding their independence. The Board considers that 
Directors owning shares in the Company directly aligns them 
with the interests of the shareholders.

 Senior Independent Non-Executive Director 
Non-Executive Directors’ representing a shareholder
Shareholder representation by a director is a criterion on 
which under the Code independence is also assessed. 
Paul Richardson and Christopher Sweetland are WPP 
representatives on the Board as provided for in the 
Subscription Agreement approved by shareholders in 1997. 
Paul is Group Finance Director and Christopher Deputy 
Group Finance Director of WPP Group, a company operating 
in similar markets to Chime, and therefore they both have 
relevant and current knowledge and skills that are beneficial 
to the Board.
Board assessment
In the past, annual appraisals by external investor research 
analysts have recommended that shareholders vote against, 
or abstain from, any proposed re-election of Non-Executive 
Directors due to a perceived non-compliance with the Code 
regarding the criteria quoted above. The Code requires 
companies to ‘Comply or Explain’. We have continually and 
consistently met this requirement.
We believe long term knowledge of our business brings 
our Non-Executive Directors the benefit of informed 
consideration of the issues. The holding of shares (within 
certain limits) or representation of a substantial shareholder 
by a non-executive director , is evidence of that Director’s 
belief and commitment to the business and further aligns 
them directly with the interests of our shareholders. The 
Board therefore considers each Non-Executive Director to be 
independent in both character and judgement and believes 
there are no circumstances that give rise to question their 
respective judgements when considering matters before 
the Board.
Lord Davies and Christopher Sweetland were appointed 
by the Board on the dates shown below. Both Directors 
will stand for election by shareholders at the Company’s 
forthcoming AGM.
Performance evaluation
The Board has a formal evaluation process to review the 
effectiveness of each of the Directors, the Board itself, the 
Standing Committees and the processes used by those 
forums. Areas for evaluation include:
•	 Board 	org anisa tion, 	 str ucture	 and 	 member ship;
•	 T he	 conduct	of 	meetings;
•	 T he	 responsibilities	of 	 the	 Board;
•	 T he	 perf or mance 	of 	 the 	Board	and	 its	processes;
•	 T he	 inf or ma tion 	pro vided	to	 Non-Ex ecutiv es; 	 and
•	 T he 	 ef f ectiv eness	of 	 the	 management 	 process	from	the	
Board to lower levels of management
The Remuneration Committee evaluated the 2012 
performance of the Executive Directors in early 2013.
At the start of each year the Committee agrees personal 
key performance indicators for each Executive Director . 
(Further details are included in the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report on page 34.) Performance against these forms part 
of the evaluation by the Committee at year end. Individual 
application and developments during the year are also taken 
into account when judging overall performance.
The performance evaluations of the individual Executive 
Directors for 2012 did not identify any areas of concern.
Non-Executive Directors – performance evaluation
The Executive Directors, in consultation with the Chairman, 
are responsible for the assessment of the performance of 
the Non-Executive Directors. The Senior Independent Non-
Executive Director is also consulted during this process 
except for evaluation of his own performance.  26  Chime Communications plc
The process of performance evaluation is designed 
to consider all elements of performance including any 
perceived shortcomings, training or development needs and 
unforeseen tasks and responsibilities that have arisen during 
the year .
Whilst no KPIs are set for individual Non-Executive Directors, 
the time, effort and application applied in the performance 
of their duties for the Board and, where applicable, 
Committees is taken into account. 
Performance evaluations of the Non-Executive Directors 
have shown a continued good record of involvement in 
Board discussions and each contributes additional help 
in furthering the development and delivery of the Group’s 
strategies. The evaluations assessed both performance of 
duties and whether each director should be considered 
independent.
The Board, the Committees and the management process 
– performance evaluation
In line with the requirements of the Code, the Company 
additionally carries out annual performance evaluations 
of the Board, the Committees and the processes utilised 
by each forum. The aim of the evaluation is to recognise 
the strengths and address any weaknesses and consider 
improvements to the management process. The evaluation is 
designed to ensure that the Board meets its objectives and 
that effectiveness is maximised. 
This evaluation addresses such issues as:
•	 the 	frequenc y	of 	 meetings	 and 	the	b usiness 	transacted;
•	 the	wor kload 	of 	eac h	f or um;
•	 the	timing ,	le v el 	 of 	 detail	and	appropria teness 	of 	
information put before meetings;
•	 the 	repor ting	 process	 from	 Committees 	 to 	 the 	 Board 	and 	
delegation process itself;
•	 the 	le v els 	of 	 e xper tise 	 a v ailab le	within	 the	member ship	
of the Committees and the need for , selection and use of 
external consultants.
The performance evaluations of the Board and Committees 
for 2012 did not identify any issues of concern or failure or 
incapacity to perform the duties for which they are convened 
or in meeting the duties as summarised above.
Retirement and proposed re-election of Directors
In accordance with recognised best practice, the Company 
has a policy of presenting all Directors for re-election at 
each AGM. This is in line with the Code provisions for FTSE 
350 companies and the Board believes governance is best 
served by doing so.
Biographies of each Director are shown on page 16. The 
appointment and subsequent re-election of directors by 
shareholders is shown on page 25.

The Committee and the external auditors 
The Audit Committee is responsible for the development, 
implementation and monitoring of the Group’s dealings 
with its external auditors. Oversight and responsibility for 
monitoring the independence, objectivity and compliance 
by the external auditors with ethical and regulatory 
requirements lies with the Committee, and day-to-day 
responsibility is delegated to the Group Finance Director . 
The external auditors are jointly responsible to the Board 
and the Audit Committee but the Committee is the primary 
contact. The Committee has a formal policy for the 
engagement of the external auditors to supply non-audit 
services and monitors such use on a regular basis. 
The external auditors were represented at each of the 
Audit Committee meetings during the year and may request 
a meeting of the Committee without management being 
present if necessary .

Membership of the Committee
Membership of the Committee is reviewed by the Chairman 
of the Committee and the Group Chairman (who is not 
a member of the Committee) at regular intervals and 
where appropriate they recommend new appointments to 
the Nominations Committee for assessment and onward 
recommendation to the Board. The Committee is comprised 
of three independent Non-Executive Directors, which is 
the minimum membership required under the Terms of 
Reference. Two members constitute a quorum. 
The Audit Committee is required to include one financially 
qualified member (as recognised by the Consultative 
Committee of Accountancy Bodies). Currently the Audit 
Committee Chairman, Rodger Hughes, and Christopher 
Sweetland both meet that requirement.
The Audit Committee in 2012
In 2012 the Committee met on three occasions during the 
year and discharged its responsibilities by performing 
the standing duties summarised above and the following 
additional activities:
•	 re viewed 	the 	 Group’ s	draft	preliminar y 	 and 	 interim	results	
statements prior to Board approval and reviewed the 
external auditors’ detailed reports thereon;

wide risk management process
•	 g a v e	o v er sight 	to	the	group	w histle b lowing 	 polic y	and	 the 	
use of the confidential helpline
The Audit Committee has considered reports made to it by 
the executive management of the Group, which assesses 
the major business risks and the control environment against 
the criteria for assessing internal financial controls which are 
set out in the guidance for Directors on reporting on internal 
control. The Audit Committee has reported to the Board that 
it has been able to review the effectiveness of the Group’s 
system of internal financial control for the accounting year 
and the period to the date of approval of the financial 
statements.
The Committee and the external auditors in 2012
To fulfil its responsibility regarding the independence of the 
external auditors in 2012, the Audit Committee reviewed:
•	 the 	e xter nal	 auditor s’ 	 plan	 f or	 the 	cur rent	y ear , 	noting	the	
role of the Senior Statutory Audit Partner , who signs the 
audit report and who, in accordance with professional 
rules, has not held office for more than five years, and any 
changes in the key audit staff;
•	 the 	ar rangements	 f or 	da y-to-da y	 management	of 	the	 audit	
relationship;
•	 a 	 repor t	from	 the	e xter nal 	auditor s 	describing	 their	
arrangements to identify, report and manage any conflicts 
of interest; and
•	 the 	o v erall 	 e xtent	of 	non-audit	ser vices 	pro vided	b y	the 	
external auditors in addition to its case-by-case approval 
of the provision of non-audit services by the external 
auditors within previously set criteria.
The Group has a policy for the employment of the auditors 
for non-audit work. The auditors work on tax issues and 
other matters closely related to their role as the Company’s 
auditors but any increase in fees is strictly controlled by 
the Audit Committee. Any other non-audit assignments can 
be awarded to the auditors during the year but only where 
fees and the scope of work remains within Audit Committee 
approved limits. Any appointments outside of the agreed 
policy are put to the Committee prior to engagement.
To assess the effectiveness of the external auditors, the 
Audit Committee reviewed:
•	 the 	ar rangements	 f or 	ensuring 	 the	e xter nal 	auditor s’ 	
independence and objectivity;
•	 the 	e xter nal	 auditor s’ 	 fulfilment	of 	 the	 agreed	audit 	plan	
and any variations from the plan;
•	 the 	rob ustness	 and 	 perceptiv eness 	 of 	 the	auditor s	in	their	
handling of the key accounting and audit judgements; and
•	 the 	 content 	 of 	 the	 e xter nal	auditor s’ 	repor ting	on	 
internal control.
Following the above, the Audit Committee has recommended 
to the Board that Deloitte LLP is re-appointed. 28  Chime Communications plc
Remuneration Committee
Summary of the role of the Remuneration Committee
Rodger Hughes is Chairman of the Remuneration 
Committee. The Committee has formal terms of reference 
approved by the Board.
The Committee measures the performance of the Executive 
Directors and of key members of senior management as 
a prelude to recommending their annual remuneration. 
Performance is measured against key performance 
indicators set by the Committee at the beginning of the year 
(for further details see page 35).
The Committee is also responsible for overseeing the 
operation and use of the Company’s share based incentive 
schemes. The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors 
is recommended by the Chairman and Chief Executive and 
takes account of the time spent on Board and Committee 
matters. Final decisions are made by the Board but no 
Director takes part in any discussion regarding his or her 
own remuneration.
When required the Chairman, Lord Davies, the Chief 
Executive, Christopher Satterthwaite and/or Mark Smith, the 
Chief Operating Officer and Finance Director attend the 
meetings but are not actually members. 
The Remuneration Committee in 2012
The Committee met on five occasions during the year , 
discharging its responsibilities by performing the standing 
duties summarised above together with the following 
activities: 
•	 Agreed 	the 	le v el 	 of 	 bon us	 a wards 	to	the	Ex ecutiv e	
Directors and Company Secretary for 2011;
•	 R e viewed	and	appro v ed 	the 	 ma turity 	of 	the	2009	grant	of

The Nominations Committee
Summary of the role of the Nominations Committee
Rodger Hughes is Chairman of the Nominations Committee. 
The Committee has formal terms of reference approved by 
the Board.
The Committee leads the process of appointments to the 
Board by evaluation of the skills, knowledge and experience 
required for a particular appointment. The Code requires 
the Company to have a formalised process for the selection 
and appointment of new Directors. The Board considers that 
a prescriptive procedure is inappropriate and could prove 
restrictive and costly both in terms of identifying potential 
candidates and the selection process itself. The Company 
does not believe that it should commit to the exclusive use 
of external recruitment consultants, although there may be 
occasions where this method is employed.
The Nominations Committee in 2012
The Nominations Committee met on one occasion during the 
year to consider the appointment of Christopher Sweetland 
as a Director of the Company .
The appointment of Lord Davies as a Director and 
Chairman was considered by the full Board following initial 
assessments by Rodger Hughes as Senior Independent 
Director and (then) interim Chairman of the Board.
Relations with shareholders
The Company is keen to promote two-way communications 
with its institutional and private investors and responds 
quickly to queries received. Christopher Satterthwaite, 
Chief Executive; and Mark Smith, Chief Operating Officer 
and Finance Director , are the Company’s principal 
spokespersons with investors, analysts, the press and other 
interested parties.
In addition to direct communications with its shareholders 
the Company publishes copies of all announcements and 
circulars etc. on the Group website, www.chimeplc.com. 
Shareholders are given at least 21 days’ notice of the Annual 
General Meeting at which all Directors are generally present 
and at which questions are both invited and encouraged.
Electronic communications
Shareholders have the option to receive shareholder 
communications by electronic means or to continue 
receiving paper copies. The Company believes this equates 
with the advice it gives to its clients regarding utilising all 
channels of communication and also further illustrates our 
commitment to the environment by reducing the carbon 
emissions associated with the production and delivery of 
printed matter . Currently 78% of our shareholders opt for 
delivery electronically .

Accountability and audit
Financial reporting
A review of the businesses in the Group is included in the 
Chief Executive’s Review. The Board uses this, together 
with the Chairman’s Statement and the Directors’ Report on 
pages 41 to 49 to present a balanced and understandable 
assessment of the Company’s position and prospects. 
The Directors’ responsibilities for the financial statements 
are described on page 50 of the Report and Financial 
Statements.
Internal control
The Board has an established process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing significant risks faced by the 
Group. The Board regularly reviews the process, which 
has been in place from the start of the year to the date of 
approval of this report and which is in accordance with 
revised guidance on internal control published in October 
2005 (the Turnbull Guidance).
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
The control and risk management procedures are designed 
to highlight any weaknesses and/or failures in the systems 
to the Board at the earliest opportunity together with action 
taken and/or proposed. Such a system is designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve 
business objectives and can only provide reasonable  
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement 
or loss.
Information on the Group’s significant risks, together with the 
relevant control and monitoring procedures, is reviewed on 
a monthly basis by the heads of the business units under 
the guidance of a nominated Executive Director and/or the 
Company Secretary . This information is presented to the 
Executive Directors to assess any identified risks and the 
overall effectiveness of the system of internal control. An 
update on all significant risk management issues is made to 
the Board at each quarterly meeting.
Additionally, companies annually complete a review of 
specified risk areas and their local risk management 
processes under the supervision of divisional management, 
the Group Internal Auditor and the Company Secretary . The 
Audit Committee monitors and investigates potential areas 
of risk raised by the trading companies, internal audit and 
by the Group’s centralised administrative functions such as 
Legal, Human Resources and IT at each meeting.
The Board recognises the need to ensure that established 
risk management procedures and standards are integrated 
into all acquired businesses and accordingly potential areas 
of non-compliance are identified during the due diligence 
process and addressed post-completion.
A review of the internal audit function has been conducted 
and reported to the Board within the annual review of the 
system of internal controls. Recommended changes to 
the scope and application of internal audit procedures 
have been adopted. The internal audit programme for the 
year has been presented to and approved by the Audit 
Committee. 
The Group is now a worldwide business and the Executive 
Directors continue to review new international opportunities. 
The Audit Committee has broadened the scope of work 
of both the internal audit functions and the systems of risk 
management in order to ensure standards of control are 
maintained throughout the enlarged Group. Control of the 
overseas businesses is currently effected by designated 
senior executives reporting directly to the Board. In 2012 
a Senior Executive was appointed to the new role of 
International Managing Director to oversee the operations  
of our overseas offices.
Given the nature of the Group’s activities, the Board 
recognises the risks associated with its ability to attract, 
motivate and retain talented employees. Accordingly, a 
significant part of the Group’s risk management processes 
are focused in this area and the Group continues to utilise 
employee benefits schemes shown on pages 35 and 36 to 
help meet this requirement.
Review of the risk management process
During 2012, the Board delegated the review of the risk 
management process to the Audit Committee in order to 
validate that the methods and channels used remained fit for 
purpose for the rapid growth and international expansion of 
the Group. In December 2011 the Board approved a revised 
process and agreed the Audit Committee’s proposal for the 
use of suitable resources. The revised process commenced 
in January 2012. The Audit Committee will now receive 
reports from the process directly from the Internal Auditor 
and the Group Secretary .
The Group has material investments in a small number of 
associated companies that are not managed by the Group. 
Accordingly, the Group can only influence, not control, their 
management practices and therefore the review of internal 
controls for these operations is less comprehensive than that 
for the Group’s managed operations.
Financial control
The financial control procedures are described under the 
following five headings:
1.  Financial reporting – The Group has a comprehensive 
system for reporting financial results to the Board; 
each trading company prepares monthly results with a 
comparison against budget. The Board reviews these 
for the Group as a whole and by operating segment 
and determines appropriate action. Towards the end of  30  Chime Communications plc
each financial year the operating units prepare detailed 
budgets for the following year . Budgets and plans are 
reviewed and necessary changes made by the Board 
before being adopted formally .
2.  Quality and integrity of personnel – One of the Group’s 
core values is integrity; this is regarded as vital to the 
maintenance of the Group’s system of internal financial 
control and is reflected in the quality and experience of 
the Group’s financial staff.
3.  Operating unit financial controls – Key controls over major 
business risks include reviews against performance 
indicators and exception reporting. The trading 
companies regularly assess their exposure to major 
business risks and appropriate action is taken both at 
operating and Group level in order to ensure that risk is 
minimised as far as possible
4.  Electronic Data Systems – The Group’s financial and 
management information is processed by and stored on 
data systems. Accordingly , the Group has established 
controls and procedures over the security of data held. 
The Group has put in place arrangements for processing 
to continue and data to be retained in the event of 
complete failure of any system.
5.  Controls over central functions – A number of the Group’s 
key functions, including treasury , taxation, acquisitions 
and insurance, are dealt with centrally . Each of these 
functions has clear and detailed procedures and is 
required to report to the Board on a regular basis; the 
treasury details are reported daily to the Finance Director .
Going concern basis 
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors 
likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Chief Executive’s Statement on 
pages 4 and 5. The financial position of the Group, its cash 
flows and borrowing facilities are described in the Finance 
Director’s Report on pages 12 and 13. In addition, note 38 
of the financial statements includes the Group’s objectives, 
policies and processes for managing its capital; its financial 
risk management objectives and details of its financial 
instruments; and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in note 27 to the financial statements, the 
Group meets its day-to-day working capital requirements 
through an overdraft facility and a committed facility which 
expires in September 2016. The facility was negotiated  
in 2012.
These facilities are subject to banking covenants as 
disclosed in note 38. 
In preparing forecasts the Directors have taken into account 
the following key factors:
•	 T he 	 ra te 	of 	growth	 of 	the	 UK	 and 	 global 	 econom y 	on 	the	
Group’s business during the economic recovery;
•	 K e y 	c lient 	account 	 renewals;
•	 Planned 	acquisitions	and	disposals;
•	 Anticipa ted	 pa yments	 under 	 def er red	 and	contingent 	
consideration and deemed remuneration payments;
•	 T he 	le v el 	 of 	 committed 	 and	 v ariab le 	 costs; 	and
•	 Cur rent 	 new	 b usiness	targets	 compared	to 	le v els 	ac hie v ed	
in previous years.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show 
that the Group should be able to operate within the level of 
its current facility and banking covenants.
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.
More detail on the Group’s cash position and facilities at 
31 December 2012, as well as maturities of the financial 
liabilities, can be found in note 38 to the financial statements. 
The principal risks and uncertainties faced by the Group are 
included in the Directors’ Report on pages 45 to 48. Details 
of potential contingent liabilities and potential cash outflows 
in relation to these liabilities can be found in note 34.
Ethics and integrity
Overview
Chime is a group of companies with a diverse range of 
cultures across its subsidiary businesses. The Group sets 
standards of behaviour which it expects the companies 
to meet irrespective of their market, their communication 
discipline or their culture. Our core values are the foundation 
of our standards.
Our values are expressed and find meaning through the way 
we behave and the responsibilities we accept towards our 
shareholders, customers, colleagues, and the communities 
we serve:
•	 Mutual Respect – for each other as colleagues, and 
between ourselves and our clients;
•	 Mutual Interest – we are a service business. We know that 
our own success is intimately linked to the success we 
help our clients build;
•	 Accountable – our job is to deliver results for our clients 
and to quantify those results as best we can;
Directors’ Statement on Corporate Governance 
continued  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  31
•	 Open-Minded – we are open-minded to each other and 
to new ideas. We know the enduring qualities of good 
business and best practice and yet we embrace change 
and new and better ways of doing things;
•	 Actively Diverse – in our employment practices as much as 
our thinking, because diversity is the soul of creativity;
•	 Network Savvy – because as modern communicators 
we rely on networks as never before and so each of us 
builds our own and leverages it to the advantages of all 
our audiences; shareholders, colleagues, customers and 
community;
•	 Tenacious – we don’t give up;
•	 Collaborative – groups can only work where collaboration 
is second nature. Collaboration works only where there is 
mutual understanding, mutual respect and trust.
Ethics
The Group meets all relevant laws, regulations and codes of 
practice issued by any relevant government or appropriate 
regulator . We ensure that all our people are aware and 
comply with such standards. In addition, we recognise that 
integrity is essential to the maintenance of our reputation 
in the marketplace. As part of our regular review process, 
issues of conduct are identified, reviewed and the Board 
is alerted as appropriate. We utilise our published Code of 
Conduct (see below) which formalises the values, behaviour 
and ethical standards expected of Chime employees. 
Bribery Act 2010
In accordance with best practice and government guidance 
the Group developed a response to the Bribery Act 2010 
(implemented July 2011) building on our existing processes 
and standards. The Board acknowledges its responsibility 
for developing and maintaining procedures to prevent 
corruption within Chime’s operations and has designed 
and implemented a clear process to do so. The Board will 
continue to use the Act as its minimum benchmark for ethical 
trading with clients and partners. Where additional measures 
are required, by virtue of working in new markets, for clients 
who have specific requirements or , due to our operations 
moving into new territories, the Company will adapt the 
chosen procedures to meet those needs as they arise.
The Executive Management Team will continue to promote 
our standards and make staff aware of the consequences 
of non-compliance.
Compliance with group standards
Chime has a Code of Conduct which applies to all staff 
covering:
•		Client	and	Compan y 	confidentiality;
•	 Equal 	 oppor tunities	and	the	promotion	of 	 a	meritocrac y;
•	 A	saf e 	 and 	 civilised	wor kplace;
•	 Proper 	considera tion	 of 	 the	 sensitivities 	of 	 potential 	
audiences when publishing materials;
•	 Honest 	b usiness 	 practice 	and	integrity; 	and
•	 Compliance 	 with	 all	la ws 	 and 	 regula tions .
The Code of Conduct remains under review in order that it 
may be adapted as market forces and legal requirements 
demand or as additional risks are identified. The risk 
management process includes testing of these areas and 
encompasses induction of new staff and suitability of 
training and reporting.
The Group has a clear , written whistleblowing policy and 
procedure available to all staff regarding concerns of 
employees about ethical behaviour and noncompliance with 
regulatory requirements and/or the law. The Group has a 
confidential helpline, run by an external third party, in order 
that staff can report any perceived shortcomings within our 
operations.
Corporate and social responsibility
We are in the business of managing brand and corporate 
reputation on behalf of clients and the Board acknowledges 
that being socially responsible is an important factor in the 
management of our business.
The Board believes that corporate responsibility should 
underpin everything that we do. The Group is therefore 
committed to demonstrating the importance of this, not only 
in our work for clients, but in our own working practices.
We now have a continuing and embedded programme of 
process to induct, brief and train our staff to ensure our 
efforts permeate throughout our Group. Our process design 
will always include assessment of our impacts but also our 
opportunities in socially responsible deployment.
The Board and Audit Committee receive regular updates 
on our corporate responsibility initiatives and performance. 
The Chief Executive, Christopher Satterthwaite, personally 
oversees our continuing efforts in this important area of our 
business. Regular consideration is given to the significance 
of social, environmental and ethical (SEE) issues (as defined 
by the Association of British Insurers), and as part of our 
wider operational risk framework, identifies significant risks 
arising from these areas to short-term and long-term value.
The Group also considers corporate responsibility to be 
an area of business opportunity . Our subsidiary, Corporate 
Citizenship, provides not only a focus for our investment in 
this field but provides the Group with specialist expertise. 32  Chime Communications plc
Measurement of performance
The Company measures the performance of each of its 
businesses against a benchmark list of minimum corporate 
responsibility standards. These cover:
•	 Promoting 	good	en vironmental	practices 	–	both 	in	our	 own	
operations and to our wider stakeholders;
•	 Empowering	comm unity	wor k 	–	the 	promotion 	of 	
volunteering and charity work by our staff and companies 
alike;
•	 Y oung 	people 	–	via	 our	inter nship , 	 wor k	e xperience	 and	
graduate schemes.
The standards are designed to be stretching and, as such, 
encourage continual improvement in these important areas. 
The minimum standards continue to be developed to ensure 
consistent improvement.
Performance against the standards is measured annually 
and the results are communicated to each operating 
business unit. Areas of potential improvement are addressed 
and successful best practice is identified and communicated 
across the Group.
We continue to report our corporate responsibility 
performance to our stakeholders via our website. This  
details not only the principles of our approach, our targets 
and our performance but also gives examples of the 
initiatives undertaken.
External recognition
The Company continues to be listed on the FTSE4Good 
Index, which evaluates companies’ performance on a 
number of corporate responsibility criteria. Chime is also 
a Carbon Trust Standard Bearer . The Standard recognises 
companies with a continuing commitment to improving 
environmental performance. Chime was the 400th company, 
and the first marketing communications group to receive this 
important accreditation.
The environment
Whilst the business of Chime Communications has 
expanded to a number of international locations, our 
operations remain predominantly in the UK. We deliver 
services to clients based on image, ideas, research, content 
and event execution. As such, our direct and indirect impact 
on the environment is minimal and considered relatively low-
risk. Our international expansion will obviously increase the 
need for air travel and we have continued to deploy video 
conferencing facilities and a revised travel policy to ensure 
that increases in carbon emissions from our international 
growth are kept to a minimum.
We do acknowledge that our customers, staff and 
other stakeholders have an interest in our impact on the 
environment and as such we have committed to monitor and 
improve our environmental performance where possible. 
The Group has continually reduced its carbon footprint since 
becoming Carbon Neutral in 2007. In 2012 we assessed 
that our carbon emissions had reduced by 12.2% per full 
time employee during 2011. We are currently assessing our 
2012 emissions reductions and expect to meet our target 
of a further reduction of 5%. We continue to consider and 
enhance the environmental impact of our businesses and 
are working closely with our major suppliers to ensure 
best practice is embedded in our wider operations. We 
regularly incorporate our environmental performance in 
business presentations as we believe this is an important 
consideration when evaluating reputation both for our 
companies and our clients alike.
Employee issues
As a people business, our reputation depends on the skills, 
knowledge and integrity of our people. Chime has fostered 
an entrepreneurial culture and each of our businesses is 
encouraged to create a stimulating, rewarding and inspiring 
work environment for our people. Chime’s role is to provide a 
framework of standards which each company must meet in 
its own way within its own culture.
We do recognise that central oversight on human resources 
issues is beneficial and continually review the employment 
standards across the Group as part of the general 
management and risk identification processes.
In order to attract and retain talented staff we continue 
to operate our Savings-Related Share Option Schemes 
together with our Co-Investment Plan, and Deferred Share 
Plan. We also continue to review our incentive schemes 
on an ongoing basis to ensure they are fit for purpose. 
We continue to encourage staff involvement in a number 
of initiatives including our work on our environmental 
performance and staff volunteering. We run a graduate 
scheme across Chime and encourage involvement in a 
number of semi-formal groups in order to develop ideas and 
to foster inter-company relationships.
Health and safety
We are a people business and, due to the nature of our 
work, the majority of our staff are office based. However , 
with the acquisitions of Maidstone Road Holdings Ltd (Icon) 
and MacKenzie Clark our operations now include a relatively 
small amount of manufacturing activity . We also now have a 
higher proportion of man days spent at events on location 
which brings an additional level and a variance in our health 
and safety risk profile. These developments have been 
acknowledged and addressed in our updated procedures. 
Our aim is to maximise the wellbeing of our people and 
all those we interact with. As such, the risk, and historical 
incidence of accidents is low.

This is an on-going process and the risk assessment of new 
developments or increases in activities with a higher level of 
risk, is embedded into our review process.
We take our duty of care seriously and have retained 
consultants, Safety Exchange Ltd, who provide not only 
guidance on identification and assessment of hazards but 
also practical support such as carrying out risk assessments 
for events and other activities.

Group policy on the remuneration of Directors  
and employees
This Report sets out the Group’s remuneration policies for 
the Directors for the year ended 31 December 2012. Except 
where noted, these policies are likely to continue to apply in 
future years, unless there are specific reasons for change. 
It has been prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the 
Accounting regulations under the Companies Act 2006 (“The 
Act”). The Report also meets the relevant requirements of 
the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority and 
describes how the Board has applied the principles relating 
to Directors’ remuneration in the Combined Code. As 
required by the Act, resolutions to approve this Report and 
the company’s financial statements will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
The Act requires the auditors to report to the Company’s 
members on certain parts of the Directors’ Remuneration 
Report and to state whether in their opinion those parts of 
the Report have been properly prepared in accordance  
with the Accounting Regulations. The Report has therefore 
been divided into separate sections for audited and 
unaudited information.
Unaudited information
Remuneration Committee
The composition, chairmanship and activities of the 
Remuneration Committee are set out on pages 17 and 28. 
The members of the Committee receive remuneration as set 
out in this report. They abstain from participating where their 
own interests are concerned and have no involvement in the 
day-to-day management of the Group’s operations. Other 
Directors attend meetings by invitation only but this would 
not include any occasion when matters relating to their own 
remuneration arrangements are discussed.
During the financial period under review, the Remuneration 
Committee sought the assistance of the Chairman, the Chief 
Executive and Chief Operating Officer relating to Directors’ 
performance and remuneration. The Committee used Towers 
Watson to provide specialist third party advice primarily on 
competitive market levels of remuneration.
Remuneration policy
The Group is committed to attracting and retaining high 
quality staff. Remuneration is set at market levels and is 
regularly monitored. The performance measurement of the 
Executive Directors and senior staff and the determination of 
their annual remuneration packages are undertaken by the 
Committee. More generally , the Committee reviews executive 
remuneration arrangements regularly to ensure that they 
remain effective, competitive and appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances and prospects, and monitors incentive award 
levels and consequent company liabilities.
Non-Executive Directors remuneration
The fees paid to the Non-Executive Directors during 2012 
are set out on page 38.
The Board remunerates its Non-Executive Directors as 
follows:
Senior Independent Non-Executive: £40,000 per annum 
Directorship: £25,000 per annum
Each Committee membership (additional): £5,000 per 
annum
Additional fees were paid to Rodger Hughes for his role as 
the Chairman of the Special Committee of the Board that 
considered the disposal of the Bell Pottinger businesses 
and on acting as interim Chairman following the resignation 
of Lord Bell (30 June) and prior to the appointment of Lord 
Davies (6 December).
Lord Davies was appointed Chairman on 6 December and 
receives fees of £250,000 per annum of which £50,000 will 
be paid in shares of the Company after the announcement 
of the Company’s preliminary results for the period.
WPP nominated Directors are unremunerated.
The Non-Executive Directors do not participate in the 
Company’s pension or share option or other incentive plans. 
The Board considers that the Non-Executive Directors’ 
remuneration conforms with the requirements of the Code.
Executive Director remuneration
In 2012 there were five main elements of the remuneration 
packages for Executive Directors:
•	 basic	 ann ual	 salar y 	 and 	benefits;
•	 pension 	 ar rangements .
•	 ann ual 	 bon us	pa yments;
•	 def er red 	share	 incentiv es;	 and
•	 long-ter m	incentiv e	 plans .
Basic annual salary and benefits
In setting salary levels, the Remuneration Committee 
considers the experience and responsibility of the Executive 
Directors and their personal performance during the 
previous year . The Committee also takes account of salary 
levels within other companies of a similar size and nature, as 
well as the rates of increases for other employees within the 
Group. The Remuneration Committee reviews salaries with 
effect from January each year .
When considering the salary of Chief Executive, Christopher 
Satterthwaite, the Committee takes into account that a 
proportion of his time is taken on fee earning client work and 
the management of key clients.
Directors’ Remuneration Report  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  35
hime Communications plc
In July 2012 Christopher Satterthwaite was awarded a 
pay increase of £25,000 (revised to £525,000pa). Mark 
Smith was awarded an increase of £50,000 (revised to 
£375,000pa) on the same date. The Committee awarded 
the increases to recognise the additional responsibilities 
transferred to them from the former Executive Chairman and 
Deputy Chairman.
The benefits provided by the Group to the Executive 
Directors consist principally of a car or car allowance and 
private medical insurance.
Pensions
Pension contributions on behalf of the Executive Directors 
are paid by the Company to the Group’s money purchase 
pension scheme for a personal pension arrangement up to 
the maximum value of 20% of their basic salary .
Annual bonus
The Executive Directors’ annual bonus arrangements are 
focused on the achievement of the Group’s short term 
objectives. The annual bonus allocation is capped at a 
maximum of 50% of salary for the Executive Directors; 
of this up to 25% of the relevant Director’s salary may be 
payable if the Company meets the profit targets set by the 
Board. A further maximum of 25% may be paid to each 
Executive Director , based on performance against personal 
key performance indicators linked to the Group’s stated 
strategy and tailored to their individual roles. Some of these 
are non-financial. The Remuneration Committee reviews 
the specific key performance indicators for each Director 
and assesses their overall performance both against those 
indicators and generally . Based on this assessment the 
Committee determines what, if any , further bonus is payable. 
The Committee believes the performance metrics chosen 
align with shareholder value creation. Bonus payments are 
not pensionable. In 2012, the key performance indicators 
included:
•	 Growth 	in	opera ting 	 profit 	 margin
•	 Growth	in	n umber	 and 	 v alue 	of 	 shared	 c lients
•	 Growth 	in	a v erage	 f ee 	 per	 c lient
•	 R e v en ue 	and	new	c lient 	genera tion
•	 Cash 	management	 and 	 con v er sion
•	 Quality 	of 	 inter nal	 control
•	 R etention 	of 	 senior 	e x ecutiv es
•	 Management 	 of 	de btor s
•	 T he 	strength	of 	 administra tiv e 	 and 	 financial	 management
In February 2013 the Committee assessed the performance 
of the Executive Directors.
The Committee considers 2012 to be an extraordinary year 
due to the completion of a major contract at the end of 
2011; the disposal of the Bell Pottinger Businesses and; the 
formulation and implementation of a revised strategy for the 
Group. The financial results reported in these statements 
reflect that the Directors have ensured that the Company has 
maintained continued good performance without increasing 
exposure to risk. The implementation of the revised strategy 
and the integration of acquisitions whilst presenting unique 
challenges (particularly in an Olympic year) have been dealt 
with successfully .
In considering bonus awards to the two Executive Directors 
the Committee has taken into account awards made to other 
senior staff in the Group; their respective performances in 
2011 and 2012 (bonuses were not paid for 2011 despite profit 
targets being met); the fact that the 2010 Co-investment 
Plan grant will not vest and that the personal KPIs for each 
Director were met or exceeded in a challenging year . 
The Committee has therefore approved the award of bonus 
payments equivalent to 37.5% of salary to each Director .
It is additionally intended that an award under the Deferred 
Share Plan of shares to a purchase value equivalent to 
37.5% of salary will be made after the AGM on 15 May 2013.
The Committee has previously notified shareholders that  
no awards under the Deferred Share Plan would be made 
to the Executive Directors whilst they are members of the 
Co-investment Plan. Both this and the level of the total award 
being 75%, and therefore above the previously notified cap 
on bonus payments, should be put to shareholders prior to 
payment, in order that they may consider , and if appropriate 
approve the level of the awards. 
Deferred Share Plan
During 2006 the Company introduced a Deferred Share 
Plan (the Plan). Under the Plan restricted rights over 
existing Chime Communications shares are granted to 
Executive Board Directors, subsidiary Board Directors and 
senior employees of the Group. A participant of the Plan 
must remain employed by the Group for a fixed period (as 
determined by the Remuneration Committee at the date of 
grant) after the date of grant for the shares to vest with the 
employee. There are no other performance criteria attached 
to the restricted shares. The Plan aims to encourage the 
retention of key employees. All grants under the Plan are 
approved by the Remuneration Committee. The grants under 
the Plan to date have been relatively modest. The Deferred 
Share Plan replaced the Executive Share Option Scheme. 
There are presently grants under the Deferred Share Plan 
that have vesting periods of one, two, and three years. 36  Chime Communications plc
2010 Co-investment Plan
The 2010 Plan was approved by shareholders at the AGM in 
May 2010.
The 2010 Plan is an annual ‘rolling’ plan with discretionary 
share awards made to participants subject to the approval 
of the Committee. Participation is intended to be limited 
to up to 20 senior employees (including the Executive 
Directors) of the Company and its subsidiaries. Participants 
receive an award of shares which will vest after a three-
year performance period, dependent on the achievement 
of demanding performance conditions to be set by the 
Committee for each award. Participation will be dependent 
upon the participant maintaining an investment in the 
Company throughout the period between award and vesting. 
For Executive Directors, this investment will be 25% of each 
award under the 2010 Plan. The maximum award of shares 
to a participant in a year will be set by the Committee but will 
normally be no more than 100% of annual salary .
Performance conditions for Executive Directors
The Committee considers that the primary engine for 
the creation of long-term shareholder value is sustained 
growth in profitability, for which the primary and most 
complete measure is earnings per share (EPS). However , 
the Committee is keen for the plan to reward the delivery of 
shareholder return. For the 2010, 2011 and 2012 awards, 
50% of the awards were subject to relative total shareholder 
return (TSR) (growth in share price plus reinvested 
dividends) and 50% subject to EPS growth.
Whilst the Committee has discretion to determine how EPS 
will be calculated for each annual grant, EPS performance 
for the 2010, 2011 and 2012 awards will be measured  
using the method included in the Notice of Meeting of the 
2010 AGM.
If the Company’s position in relation to the peer group 
places it at or above the 75th percentile then 100% of the 
shares tied to TSR will vest. If the Company’s position in 
relation to the peer group is between the 50th and the 75th 
percentile the number of award shares that will vest will 
vary on a straight line basis between 30% and 100%. For a 
position below the 50th percentile no award shares tied to 
TSR will vest.
Performance conditions – non-board participants 
In 2011 the Committee reviewed the performance conditions 
for the Plan for future grants to the non-Board participants. 
The Committee resolved to continue with 50% of any award 
being measured against EPS. The second measurement 
was revised. This will now be set on an individual basis by 
grant in order to incentivise each senior manager to deliver 
stretching targets set by the Board. It is envisaged that these 
may differ from person to person and from year to year .
The second element of performance measurement for 
the non-Board participants for the 2011 grant was set at 
the achievement of budgeted operational profit for the 
respective participant’s division.
There were no awards to non-board participants in 2012.
Share option schemes
Previously the Company has operated an Executive Share 
Option Scheme for Executive Directors, subsidiary Board 
Directors and senior employees.
All executive options granted from November 1997 
(other than special executive options) are subject to the 
Group achieving, during the period of grant, an average 
total shareholder return on the shares for the preceding 
three years which exceeds the average FTSE 100 total 
shareholder return for the same period and a percentage 
growth in earnings per share which is at least equal to the 
percentage growth in the Retail Price Index plus 6% over 
three years. The exercise price of the options granted 
under the above scheme is equal to the market value of 
the Company’s shares at the time when the options were 
granted. There have been no grants of Executive Share 
Options since 2005. Executive share options are only 
expected to be granted in future if there is a contractual 
commitment or in exceptional circumstances.
The Company also operates a Savings-Related Share Option 
Scheme which is open to all employees after an initial 
qualifying period of employment.
Directors’ interests in contracts and other transactions 
with Group companies
No Director has a material interest in any contract with any 
Group company other than a service contract. Lord Bell and 
Piers Pottinger , having an interest in the disposal of the Bell 
Pottinger Businesses, did not take part in the consideration 
or the final approval of the transaction.

in October 2012 of 2.10p per share makes a total of  
7.24p per share for the year (2011: 6.05p per share). 
Directors’ Report 42  Chime Communications plc
Dividends are recognised in the accounts in the year they are paid, 
or in the case of a final dividend when approved by shareholders, 
such that the amount recognised in the 2012 accounts comprises 
2011’s final dividend and 2012’s interim dividend.
The names of the Directors are set out on pages 16 to 
18, which include brief biographical details. There were a 
number of changes to the Board during 2012. As a result 
of the Bell Pottinger disposal, Lord Bell and Piers Pottinger 
resigned on 30 June 2012. Lord Davies was appointed 
Chairman on 6 December 2012. Christopher Sweetland 
was appointed as a Director on 2 July 2012. Christopher 
is a WPP nominated Director as provided for under the 
terms of the WPP subscription agreement approved by 
shareholders in 1997.
Rodger Hughes was appointed as Interim Chairman on  
1 July and stepped down on 6 December . On 6 December 
Paul Richardson stepped down from the Audit Committee 
and Christopher Sweetland was appointed as a member .
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting each of the 
Directors will resign and offer themselves for election or re-
election as appropriate.
Directors and their interests
The Directors’ interests in the shares of Chime 
Communications plc are disclosed as part of the Report of 
the Board to the Shareholders on Directors’ Remuneration 
on page 40. Details relating to Directors’ remuneration, 
share options, long-term incentives are also given as 
part of the Report of the Board to the Shareholders on 
Directors’ Remuneration.
Other than described in the Report of the Board to the 
Shareholders on Directors’ Remuneration no Director of the 
Company has, or had during the year , any interests in the 
shares of other Group companies or in any transactions 
which were unusual in their nature or were significant to the 
Company’s business.
Directors’ indemnities
As at the date of this report, indemnities are in force under 
which the Company has agreed to indemnify the Directors, 
to the extent permitted by law and Company’s Articles of 
Association, in respect of all losses arising out of, or in 
connection with, the execution of their powers, duties and 
responsibilities, as Directors of the Company or any of its 
subsidiaries. There is no agreement in place between the 
Company and its Directors and employees providing for 
compensation for loss of office of employment (whether 
through resignation, purported redundancy or otherwise) 
that occurs because of a takeover bid.
The Company has purchased and maintains Directors’ and 
Officers’ insurance cover against legal liabilities and costs 
for claims in connection with any act or omission by its 
Directors or Officers in the execution of their duties.
Donations
During the year the Group donated £49,436 (2011: 
£49,000) for charitable purposes.
The Group’s policy is not to make direct donations to 
support political parties. However , the nature of the Group’s 
work is such that to support its commercial activities, 
certain companies within the Group may need to attend or 
sponsor events which are organised by political parties or 
other political organisations, for which a charge is made. 
In addition, the Group may invite clients and prospective 
clients to attend events which fall within the meaning of the 
Companies Act 2006 provisions. The Companies Act 2006 
defines ‘”political party”, “political organisations”, “political 
donation” and “political expenditure” widely and as a result, 
it is possible that political organisations may include bodies 
concerned with matters such as policy review and law 
reform, or the representation of the business community or 
sections of it, or the representation of other communities or 
special interest groups.
During the year and adopting this wider definition, the 
Group made payments that may be deemed to be political 
donations totalling £5,500 (2011: £19,000) to various 
organisations connected with the Conservative Party .
All of the above political donations were made by the Bell 
Pottinger Businesses in the 6 months prior to the disposal 
on 30 June 2012.
In line with recommendations made by the Association 
of British Insurers, the Board intends to seek an annual 
authority to make donations or incur expenditure of a 
political nature.
Employee involvement
The Group places considerable value on the involvement 
of its employees and has continued to keep them informed 
and, where appropriate consult with them on matters 
affecting them as employees and on the various factors 
affecting the performance of the Group. This is achieved 
principally via the Group’s intranet site, e-mails and formal 
and informal functions. In addition, the Group’s Savings-
Related Share Option Scheme, Performance Related Pay 
and bonus schemes encourage employees at all levels 
to contribute to the achievement of the Group’s short and 
long-term goals.
The Group believes in an equality of opportunity for all 
employees based on merit and that no employee or job 
applicant should receive less favourable treatment on the 
grounds of: age, sex, marital status, disability, colour , race, 
religion, nationality or ethnic origin.
Employment of disabled persons
The Group gives full and fair consideration to all 
applications for employment made by disabled persons, 
having regard to their particular aptitudes and abilities. 
Directors’ Report
continued  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  43
Opportunities for training, career development and 
promotion do not disadvantage these employees or any 
members of staff who become disabled during their time 
with us.
Creditor payment terms
The Group’s policy on suppliers is that they will be paid in 
accordance with agreed terms and conditions of trade on 
a regular basis.
The number of days outstanding between receipt of 
invoices and date of payment, calculated by reference to 
the amount owed to trade creditors at the year-end as a 
proportion of the amounts invoiced by suppliers during the 
year , is disclosed in note 23.

of certificated shares which are not fully paid, or where the 
instrument of transfer has not been correctly stamped and 
lodged at the place designated by the Board accompanied 
by the certificate of shares and such other evidence of 
title as may be reasonably required to show the right of 
the transferor to make the transfer . The Directors may also 
refuse to register a transfer unless it is to a person who is: 
(i) not a minor; (ii) a bankrupt; (iii) is subject to an order 
made on the grounds of some mental or other incapacity

Risks and uncertainties
The Board has considered the risks and uncertainties 
affecting the Group as at 31 December 2012 and these 
are summarised below. The Group has specific policies in 
place to ensure risks are properly evaluated and managed 
at the appropriate level within the Group. These policies 
are set out in the Directors’ Statement on Corporate 
Governance in the section headed Internal Control on  
page 29.
In addition to the general economic and competitive risks 
affecting businesses operating in the Group’s markets, the 
following are considered to be the principal risks impacting 
the Group. These risks are regularly assessed and 
monitored by the senior management team in each division 
and by the Executive Management Team.
RISK MITIGATION / COMMENT
INTERNAL RISKS
Loss of key clients
The Group receives a significant proportion of its revenues 
from a limited number of large clients, and the loss of those 
clients would adversely impact the Group’s prospects, 
business, financial condition and result of operations.
The Group’s two largest clients accounted for approximately 
16% of operating income in the year ended 31 December 
2012 (2011: 19%) and the Group’s 30 largest clients 
accounted for approximately 49% of operating income in the 
year ended 31 December 2012 (2011: 45%).
The Group continues to maintain strong relationships with 
key clients and seeks to establish reputations in the industry 
that will attract and retain further key clients and talent.
Due to the number of services provided by the Group and 
the drive for cross Group working, on many occasions a 
shared client may be secured under a number of contracts. 
The loss of one contract does not necessarily mean the loss 
of that client.
Retention of key personnel
The Group is dependent on the talent, creative abilities and 
technical skills of its personnel, as well as their relationships 
with clients. If the Group were unable to attract and retain 
its key talent, or had inadequate talent management and 
succession planning for key management roles, the Group’s 
performance would be adversely affected through client 
losses and profitability . 
The Group seeks to retain and develop personnel at 
all levels. The Group’s future success is dependent on 
the continuity of services to clients and the retention of 
knowledge and relationships within the Group. The loss or 
lack of development of personnel could have a material 
adverse effect on the Group’s business. The Group and 
its divisions continue to design and implement training 
schemes in order to further motivate and develop staff.
Key staff are members of incentive plans which link  
remuneration to Company performance. These are designed 
to motivate and drive both the achievement of short term 
objectives and retain and reward staff in the long term.
Succession planning in terms of both management positions 
and relationships with clients are reviewed on a regular 
basis. Additionally, insurance is taken out on key individuals 
at a level to reflect the fee earning potential of the individual 
concerned.  46  Chime Communications plc
Reputation and sustainability 
Failure, or an issue, concerning a high profile individual, 
project or brand.
Chime’s business is maintaining and enhancing the 
reputations of brands, corporates and individuals. As such, 
management is aware and acknowledges the exposure it 
has to such issues occurring. Such exposure is expressly 
considered as part of the risk management process, both 
in terms of maintaining our own reputation and that of our 
individual key staff.
Inappropriate use of social networking
Client disputes and reputational loss due to staff misconduct 
on social networking sites is a risk faced by all businesses.
Our Group values (see pages 30 and 31) underpin 
everything that we do. Our induction programmes and 
employment standards convey the required levels of 
behaviour expected of our staff. The Group continues to 
review this developing area and will increase emphasis on 
the use of social media as necessary .
Management of overseas operations
a) Management of entities overseas 
Operational control being less effective due to distant central 
management. 
b) Over-reliance on one key individual within the  
overseas office
Many of the overseas offices are small and contact with 
Chime is at times reliant on a small group of individuals. 
In 2012 we created the role of Managing Director of 
International to oversee both existing overseas offices and 
our continued international growth. 
Our trading divisions continue to handle the day to day 
management of these entities.
Legal and regulatory 
a) Regulatory and statutory changes
The Group may be subject to regulations affecting its activities 
which could have a material adverse impact on the Group’s 
financial position. Changes in tax and accountancy laws 
or their application may also adversely affect the Group’s 
reported results.
b) Anti-bribery Act
Companies must be aware and conscious of the Bribery 
Act when dealing with commissions on new-business 
introductions. 
The Group actively monitors any proposed regulatory and 
statutory changes and, under the guidance of the Audit 
Committee, develops a response comparable to the risks or 
exposures faced by our operations due to such changes. 
Our policies and procedures introduced in 2010 remain 
under regular review and are currently subject to additional 
formalisation following our successful handling of our contracts 
around Olympic activities in 2012. These are lessons learned 
and we believe that a process of continual improvement will 
help our businesses and enhance our reputation.
Financial risks
a) Recoverability of debtors
The Group may be unable to collect balances due from clients 
that have filed for bankruptcy or become insolvent. 
b) Undetected fraud and cash thefts
Fraud taking place within the Group which remains 
undetected and escalates leading to a cash loss and 
reputational impact for the Group.
c) Reporting procedures
Errors and efficiency losses as a result of not having an 
accurate and timely reporting and consolidation package.
Client credit worthiness is assessed and monitored on an 
on-going basis. If necessary, credit insurance or payments 
in advance are sought. In the current economic climate 
the Group has seen client pressure to extend credit terms. 
Whilst this is challenged where possible, cashflow impact is 
monitored to ensure that sufficient financial resources are 
available.
The financial results and forecasts of each Group company 
are rigorously monitored and analysed on a monthly basis. 
All Group companies are subjected to an Internal Audit 
review when bank and cash controls, purchase approvals 
and payment authorisations are reviewed and tested. 
Whilst the Group’s current reporting systems and processes 
are fully functioning and effective, an on-going review is in 
place aimed at evaluating the effectiveness of alternative 
consolidation and reporting methods. 
Directors’ Report
continued  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  47
Acquired goodwill and intangible assets
Acquired goodwill and other intangible assets recorded on the 
Group’s balance sheet with respect to acquired companies 
may become impaired.
The Group has a significant amount of goodwill and 
other acquired intangible assets recorded on its balance 
sheet with respect to acquired companies that may 
become impaired if business performance does not meet 
expectations in the short and long term. 
The Group performs due diligence on all acquisitions and 
this forms part of the Board’s assessment of each proposed 
acquisition. In addition, future events could cause the Group 
to conclude that the asset values and goodwill associated 
with a given operation have become impaired. Performance, 
both historic and forecast is measured on a monthly basis.
Authority to commit
Companies may exceed their power of authority and 
unilaterally enter into agreements which require the express 
approval of Chime Group.
Standards and authority levels have been set by the Group. 
Company and Divisional Heads are aware that authority 
thresholds are in place limiting their power of authority . 
Where applicable, Chime Group approvals are required.
This is subject to review by Internal Audit. 
Contract terms not complied with
Financial loss through or legal disputes with client or loss of  
a client.
Major contract terms are verified by the Company, 
Divisional and Group legal departments. Guidance on 
acceptable liabilities and commitments are established. 
Any requirement above these pre-determined limits requires 
Group approval.
Once legal commitments are established in client 
contracts, levels of financial commitment (either in external 
procurement or a commitment of resources) are controlled 
accordingly . This process is a subject of focus by Internal 
Audit as part of the regular review of the application of our 
control framework.
Information systems and data security risks
a) Security of data
Data loss or breach of client confidentiality due to inadequate 
security of data. Failure to adequately protect data could 
impact the Group’s reputation and create the risk of litigation. 
b) IT standardisation across the Group
Lack of consistency in terms of standards and procedures 
across the Group.
The Group assists companies in developing principles on 
privacy and compliance. For certain companies, restricting 
employees’ network access is necessary and remains under 
review. We test our systems for authorised access. We 
believe our systems to be robust and our contingency plans 
would provide continual access to data if required in a crisis 
situation.
IT standards differ across all Group companies due to the 
various requirements, cultures and operating disciplines 
of each business. However , overriding standards and the 
access, use and deployment of IT systems are set by  
the Group and compliance verified as part of an IT  
review process. 48  Chime Communications plc
EXTERNAL RISKS
Economic and political environment
The Group operates in a number of territories with varied 
economic and political environments which could affect 
trading and profitability . Reductions in client spending, 
renegotiation of contract terms, or switching of client 
expenditure to non-traditional media may lead to reduced 
profitability .
The Group has reviewed the controls over the process of 
commitments to capital expenditure and working capital 
and these are deemed appropriate. Control processes are 
monitored and exceptions reported via the Audit Committee. 
The Group has invested in non-traditional media and has 
put digital and social media at the heart of campaigns. 
The Group, and in particular , CSM, is involved in the 
delivery of major sporting and entertainment events. An 
assessment of each event is undertaken to ensure that 
liabilities are reduced by advance funding by the client and/
or by appropriate insurance. For global events (such as the 
Olympics or FIFA World Cup) it is more likely that events 
would be delayed and rescheduled rather than cancelled.
Currency exchange rate fluctuations
The Group operates globally , as explained in note 3 to 
the financial statements. Fluctuations in exchange rates 
between currencies in which the Group operates, relative 
to pounds sterling, may cause fluctuations in its financial 
results, particularly in the current economic climate within the 
Eurozone. 
The main currencies which impact the Group’s operations are 
the Euro, Brazilian Real and US Dollar . 
An assessment has been performed of the impact of 
significant fluctuations in exchange rates of the main foreign 
currencies used by the Group, as shown in note 35 of these 
financial statements.
On negotiation of contracts and where possible client 
commitments are made in pounds sterling to alleviate risk.
Increased industry competition
The Group competes in a highly competitive industry . The 
competition for new clients and additional business is 
increasingly competitive, particularly in the current economic 
climate. Loss of clients and decreased business may reduce 
market share and decrease profits.
Increased pricing pressure from existing and new customers.
Procurement of marketing and event services face increased 
pressure on pricing and increased deliverables. This may lead 
to a reduced margin.
Group companies continue to establish reputations in 
their industries that attract and retain clients through the 
consistent delivery of quality creative services.
The Group is structured into divisions which operate in 
different industries – from a Group perspective, this further 
mitigates the risk. 
The Group has increased its legal and new business 
resources in order to meet the demands of client 
procurement processes. Profit margin remains a key 
performance indicator for subsidiary companies and for the 
Group as a whole.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable 
laws and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare such financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors 
are required to prepare Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation and have also chosen to prepare the parent 
company financial statements in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the company and of the profit or loss 
of the company for that period. In preparing these financial 
statements, the Directors are required to:
•	 select	suitab le	accounting	 policies 	and 	 then 	 appl y 	them	
consistently;
•	 mak e	 judgements	and	accounting	estima tes 	tha t 	are 	
reasonable and prudent; and
•	 prepare	the 	financial	sta tements	on	the 	going	concer n	
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
•	 proper l y 	 select	and	appl y	accounting	policies;	
•	 present	inf or ma tion,	inc luding	accounting	policies , 	in	 a 	
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; and
•	 pro vide 	additional	disc losures	w hen 	 compliance 	 with 	 the	
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance; and
•	 mak e 	 an 	 assessment 	of 	 the	compan y’ s 	ability	to	contin ue	
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Group’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Group and enable them to ensure

Independent Auditor’s report to the  
Members of Chime Communications plc 
We have audited the group financial statements of Chime 
Communications plc for the year ended 31 December 2012 
which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the 
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash Flow 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in 
Equity and the related notes 1 to 39. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body , for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the Group financial statements and for being satisfied that 
they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit 
and express an opinion on the Group financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards 
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require 
us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical 
Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error . This includes an assessment of: whether 
the accounting policies are appropriate to the group’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the group financial statements:
•	 giv e	 a	tr ue 	and 	fair 	 view	 of 	the	 sta te	 of 	the 	 group’ s	 af fair s 	
as at 31 December 2012 and of its profit for the year then 
ended;
•	 ha v e 	been	proper l y	 prepared	 in 	 accordance 	 with 	IFRSs	 as	
adopted by the European Union; and
•	 ha v e	 been 	 prepared	in 	accordance 	 with	the 	 requirements	
of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued by the 
IASB
As explained in note 2 to the group financial statements, the 
group in addition to complying with its legal obligations to 
apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, has also 
applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the group financial statements comply with 
IFRSs as issued by the IASB.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report 
for the financial year for which the group financial statements 
are prepared is consistent with the group financial 
statements.

Brazilian Real  3.30660 3.09664 2.88530 2.70768
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards. The 
financial statements have also been prepared in accordance 
with IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB) adopted for use in the European 
Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS 
Regulation.
The financial statements have been prepared on the 
historical cost basis except for certain financial instruments 
that are carried at fair value in accordance with the 
accounting policies set out below. 
Accounting policies have been applied consistently between 
years with the exception of the change in accounting policy 
described below and the new standards or amendments 
adopted in the year .
The consolidated income statement, consolidated 
balance sheet, consolidated statement of comprehensive 
income, consolidated statement of changes in equity and 
consolidated cash flow statement have been prepared on 
a basis consistent with the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2011 with the following exceptions:
•	 Headline 	n umber s	 ha v e 	been 	 remo v ed 	 from	 the 	face 	
of the income statement and are now located in the 
Appendix to the Finance Director’s Report (see pages  
14 to 15);
•	 Discontin ued	 opera tions , 	 as	per	 IFRS 	5, 	ha v e 	been	
disclosed separately, including the representation of 
comparative information as is required by the standard 
(note 4); and
•	 Change 	in 	accounting 	 polic y 	resulting 	from	 IFRS	 IC	
agenda decision on IFRS 3 and continuing employment.
Disclosure for change in accounting policy resulting 
from IFRS IC agenda decision on IFRS 3 and continuing 
employment
When a business is acquired from former shareholders 
who become employees of the Group, the Group uses the 
indicators set out in paragraph B55 of IFRS 3 to determine 
whether payments to those individuals are consideration for 
the business or remuneration for post-acquisition services. 
Previously the Group reached an overall conclusion 
based on a balanced assessment of all indicators, 
including whether payments are dependent on continuing 
employment. Following the publication in the January 2013 
Update of the IFRS Interpretations Committee’s agenda 
decision on contingent payments to selling shareholders 
who continue as employees following a business 
combination, the Group has changed its accounting 
policy and now treats all payments that are dependent on 
continuing employment as remuneration for post-acquisition 
services.
The changes impact continuing operations only . There is 
no impact to the balance sheet at 31 December 2010 and 
hence the balance sheet at this date is not reproduced in 
these accounts. 60  Chime Communications plc

Critical accounting judgements and key sources of 
estimation uncertainty
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, 
Management is required to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions that may affect the financial statements. 
Management believes that the judgements made in the 
preparation of the financial statements are reasonable. 
Howe v er , 	actual	outcomes	 ma y 	 dif f er 	from	 those	anticipa ted.
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, 
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment 
to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities, are 
discussed below:
Valuation and asset lives of separately identifiable  
intangible assets
In order to determine the value of the separately identifiable 
assets on the acquisition of a business combination, 
management are required to make estimates when utilising 
the Group’s valuation methodologies. These methodologies 
include the use of discounted cash flows, revenue and profit 
before tax multiples. Asset lives are estimated based on the 
nature of the intangible asset acquired and range between  
1 and 8 years and indefinite lives.
2. Significant accounting policies (continued)
The effects of this change in policy are summarised below:  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  61
 Impairment of goodwill and other intangible assets
There are a number of assumptions the Directors have 
considered in performing impairment reviews of goodwill 
and intangible assets, as determining whether goodwill or 
intangible assets are impaired requires an estimation of the 
value in use of the cash generating units to which goodwill 
has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires 
Directors to estimate the future cash flows expected to arise 
from the cash generating unit and a suitable discount rate 
in order to calculate net present value. Note 14 details the 
assumptions that have been applied.
Contingent consideration and deemed remuneration
Contingent consideration relating to acquisitions has been 
included based on the fair value of the Directors estimates 
of the most likely outcome (notes 28, 29 & 34).
Revenue and cost recognition on long-term contracts
Revenue and costs are recognised on long term contracts 
by reference to the stage of completion of activity under 
that contract as at the balance sheet date. Management 
has considered the stage of completion of each contract 
and made a number of assumptions in order to estimate 
the relevant revenues and costs to recognise under these 
contracts. Management are satisfied that the amounts 
recognised in 2012 are appropriate and consistent with the 
terms of the contracts and the stage of work completed.
Vacant property provisions
Provisions for property represent amounts set aside in 
respect of property leases which are onerous and the 
unavoidable costs of restoring leasehold properties to the 
condition specified in the lease at the end of the contractual 
term. The quantification of each of the provisions is 
determined based on the Directors’ best estimate and is 
dependent on the Group’s ability to exit the leases early 
or to sublet the properties. In general, property costs are 
expected to be incurred over periods for which individual 
properties remain vacant or , where occupied, to the 
termination of the leases in question. 
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the 
financial statements of the Company and entities controlled 
by the Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December 
each year . Control is achieved where the Company has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an 
investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities.
On acquisition, the assets and liabilities and contingent 
liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at 
the date of acquisition. Any excess of the cost of acquisition 
over the fair values of the identifiable net assets acquired 
is recognised as goodwill. Any deficiency of the cost of 
acquisition below the fair values of the identifiable net assets 
acquired (i.e. discount on acquisition) is credited to the 
income statement in the period of acquisition. The interest of 
non-controlling shareholders is stated at the non-controlling 
shareholder’s proportion of the fair values of the assets and 
liabilities recognised.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during 
the year are included in the consolidated income statement 
from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective 
date of disposal, as appropriate. Following the adoption 
of IAS 27 in 2011, transactions to acquire non-controlling 
shareholders’ interests in a subsidiary are recorded in equity .
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial 
statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies 
used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra-Group transactions, balances, income and expenses 
are eliminated on consolidation.
Going concern
The Directors have, at the time of approving the financial 
statements, a reasonable expectation that the Company 
and the Group have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. They 
continue to adopt the going concern basis of accounting 
in preparing the financial statements. Further detail is 
contained in the Corporate Governance Report on page 30.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group is in a 
position to exercise significant influence, but not control 
or joint control, through participation in the financial and 
operating policy decisions of the investee.
The results, assets and liabilities of associates are 
incorporated in these financial statements using the equity 
method of accounting except when classified as held for 
sale. Investments in associates are carried in the balance 
sheet at cost as adjusted by post-acquisition changes in 
the Group’s share of the net assets of the associate, less 
any impairment in the value of individual investments. 
Losses of the associates in excess of the Group’s interest in 
those associates are not recognised, unless the Group has 
incurred a legal or constructive obligation or made payments 
on behalf of the associate. 62  Chime Communications plc
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
Year ended 31 December 2012
2. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s 
share of the fair values of the identifiable net assets of 
the associate at the date of acquisition is recognised 
as goodwill and is included in the carrying value of the 
investment. Any deficiency of the cost of acquisition below 
the Group’s share of the fair values of the identifiable 
net assets of the associate at the date of acquisition (i.e. 
discount on acquisition) is credited in the income statement 
in the period of acquisition.
Where a group company transacts with an associate of the 
Group, unrealised profits and losses are eliminated to the 
extent of the Group’s interest in the relevant associate.
Other investments
Other investments represent investments in equity securities 
that present the Group with opportunity for return through 
dividend income and trading gains. They have no fixed 
maturity or coupon rate. The fair values of the listed 
securities are based on quoted market prices. For unlisted 
securities, where market value is not available, the Group 
estimates relevant fair values on the basis of publicly 
available information from outside sources. Where this is not 
possible, investments are held at cost and are reviewed  
for impairment.
Other investments are designated as ‘available for sale’ and 
are shown at fair value with any movements in fair value 
taken to equity .
On disposal the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is included within the profit or loss for 
the year . Impairment losses recognised in profit or loss for 
equity investments classified as ‘available for sale’ are not 
subsequently reversed through profit or loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess 
of the fair value of consideration over the Group’s interest 
in the fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities recognised. Goodwill is recognised as 
an asset and reviewed for impairment at least annually . Any 
impairment is recognised in the income statement and is not 
subsequently reversed.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions before the date of transition 
to IFRSs has been retained at the previous UK GAAP 
amounts subject to being tested for impairment at that 
date. Goodwill written off to reserves under UK GAAP prior 
to 1998 has not been reinstated and is not included in 
determining any subsequent profit or loss on disposal.
For acquisitions accounted for under IFRS 3 the 
consideration used in the calculation of goodwill includes 
third party costs incurred to effect the acquisition. Following 
the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised) (acquisitions from  
1 January 2010) these costs are expensed through the 
income statement and included in costs of acquisitions.
On disposal of a subsidiary or associate, the attributable 
amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the 
profit or loss on disposal.
For acquisitions accounted for under IFRS 3, future 
anticipated payments to vendors in respect of earnouts 
are based on the Directors’ best estimates of the fair 
value of future obligations, which are dependent on future 
performance of the interests acquired and assume the 
operating companies improve profits in line with Directors’ 
estimates and are included in liabilities greater or less than 
one year as appropriate. 
Following the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised), changes to 
earnouts are recorded in the income statement through 
costs of acquisitions. In both instances, when earnouts are 
to be settled in cash or share consideration, the fair value  
of the consideration is obtained by discounting to present 
value the amounts expected to be payable in the future.  
The resulting interest charge is included within finance 
costs of deferred consideration. The charge to the income 
statement is included in deemed remuneration and the fair 
value of the liability is included as deemed remuneration 
in the balance sheet, classified as current or non current 
liabilities as appropriate.
When a business is acquired from former shareholders 
who become employees of the Group, should their earn out 
payments be dependent on continuing employment then all 
payments are treated as remuneration for post acquisition 
services. This is a change to the previously adopted policy 
of the Group and is as a result of the publication in January 
2013 of the IFRS IC Update of the Committee’s agenda 
decision on IFRS 3 Business Combinations – Continuing 
employment.   
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  63
The change to the income statement is included in deemed 
remuneration and the fair value of the liability is included as 
deemed remuneration in the balance sheet, classified as 
current or non-current liabilities as appropriate.
In accordance with IFRS an impairment charge is required 
for both goodwill and other indefinite lived assets when the 
carrying amount exceeds the ‘recoverable amount’, defined 
as the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. 
Our approach in determining the recoverable amount utilises 
a discounted cash flow methodology , which necessarily 
involves making numerous estimates and assumptions 
regarding revenue growth, operating margins, tax rates, 
appropriate discount rates and working capital requirements. 
These estimates will likely differ from future actual results 
of operations and cash flows, and it is possible that these 
differences could be material. In addition, judgements are 
applied in determining the level of cash-generating unit we 
identify for impairment testing and the criteria we use to 
determine which assets should be aggregated.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration 
received or receivable and comprises the gross amounts 
billed to clients in respect of fees earned, expenses 
recharged and commission-based income. Revenue is 
recognised in the income statement when the economic 
benefits arising from an arrangement are probable.
Revenue is largely derived from retainer fees and services 
performed subject to specific agreement. Revenue is 
recognised when the service is performed in accordance 
with the contractual arrangement through an assessment 
of the time incurred to date compared to the total hours 
required to complete the contract, and an assessment of 
the value delivered to the client compared to the total value 
of the contract. If the outcome of these can be assessed 
with reasonable certainty , revenue and related costs are 
recognised in the income statement. Losses are recognised 
as soon as they are foreseen.
Operating income is revenue less amounts payable on 
behalf of clients to external suppliers where they are 
retained to perform part of a specific client project or 
service, and represents fees, commissions and mark-ups on 
rechargeable expenses and marketing products.
Contractual arrangements are reviewed to ascertain whether 
the group acts as principal or agent with regards to third 
party costs. If the relationship is that of agent then the 
recharge of third party costs is not recognised through 
revenue or cost of sales.
Revenue and operating income are stated exclusive of VAT , 
sales taxes and trade discounts.
Long-term contracts
Where the outcome of a long-term contract for services 
or goods can be estimated reliably, revenue and costs are 
recognised by reference to the stage of completion of the 
contract activity at the balance sheet date. 
The stage of completion is determined through an 
assessment of the proportion of services that have been 
delivered compared to the total services required to 
complete the contract, except where this would not be 
representative of the stage of completion.
Variations in contract work, claims and incentive payments 
are included to the extent that the amount can be measured 
reliably and its receipt is considered probable.
Where the outcome of a contract cannot be estimated 
reliably, contract revenue is recognised to the extent of 
contract costs incurred where it is probable they will be 
recoverable. Contract costs are recognised as expenses in 
the period in which they are incurred.
When it is probable that total contract costs will exceed total 
contract revenue, the expected loss is recognised as an 
expense immediately . 
Leasing
Leases are classified as finance leases whenever the terms 
of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards 
of ownership to the lessee. All other leases are classified as 
operating leases.
Assets held under finance leases and the related lease 
obligations are recorded in the balance sheet at the fair 
value of the leased assets at the inception of the leases 
or , if lower , the present value of minimum lease payments. 
The excess of the lease payments over the recorded 
lease obligations is treated as finance charges which are 
amortised over each lease term to give a constant rate of 
charge on the remaining balance of the obligation. 64  Chime Communications plc
2. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Rental costs under operating leases are charged to the 
income statement in equal annual amounts over the periods 
of the leases.
Benefits received and receivable as an incentive to enter into 
an operating lease are also spread on a straight-line basis 
over the lease term.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in UK companies denominated in currencies 
other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Gains and losses 
arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for 
the period. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s 
overseas operations are translated at the exchange 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and 
expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for 
the period unless exchange rates fluctuate significantly . 
Exchange differences arising, if any , are classified as equity 
and transferred to the Group’s translation reserve. Such 
translation reserve differences are recognised as income  
or as expenses in the period in which the operation is 
disposed of.
Translation differences on non-monetary financial assets 
and liabilities are reported as part of the fair value gain 
or loss. Translation differences on non-monetary financial 
assets, such as investments in equity securities classified as 
available for sale, are included in the fair value reserve  
in equity .
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the 
acquisition of a foreign entity are treated as assets and 
liabilities of the foreign entity and translated at the closing 
rate. 
Finance costs
Finance costs, which include interest and bank charges, are 
recognised in the income statement in the year in which they 
are incurred.
Operating profit
Operating profit is stated before the share of results of 
associate, investment income and finance costs. 
Retirement benefit costs 
The pension cost is the amount of contributions payable by 
the Group to the defined contribution pension scheme and 
to personal pension schemes of certain employees during 
the accounting period. These are charged as an expense as 
they fall due.
Long-term incentive schemes
The group operates a number of long term incentive 
schemes to remunerate certain employees. Benefits 
accruing under these schemes are recognised in the income 
statement at fair value as they are accrued.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the 
year . Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or 
recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised 
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and 
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than 
in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities 
in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the 
accounting profit.
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued
Year ended 31 December 2012  
Annual Report and Accounts 2012  65
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where 
the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity , in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in equity .
Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets comprise acquired customer 
relationships and contracts, brands and computer software. 
Customer relationships, contracts and corporate brand 
names acquired as part of acquisitions of business are 
capitalised separately from goodwill as an intangible if their 
value can be measured reliably on initial recognition and it 
is probable that the expected future economic benefit that 
are attributable to the asset will flow to the Group. Corporate 
brands are considered to have indefinite economic life and 
are therefore tested annually for impairment. Computer 
software is capitalised based on the cost incurred to acquire 
and bring to use the specific software. Intangible assets 
are stated at cost net of amortisation and any provision for 
impairment. The costs are amortised over their estimated 
useful lives using the following rates:
Computer software 4 years
Customer contracts and relationships 1 – 8 years
Brand names Indefinite life
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation 
is provided in equal installments to write off the cost less 
residual value over the estimated useful economic lives of 
asset type as follows:
Short-term leasehold improvements 5 years
Motor vehicles 6 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 4 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their 
expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or , 
where shorter , the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is 
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in 
the income statement.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets excluding goodwill
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its tangible and intangible assets to determine 
whether there is any indication that those assets have 
suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, 
the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order 
to determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). 
Where the asset does not generate cash flows that are 
independent from other assets, the Group estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the 
asset belongs. An intangible asset with an indefinite useful 
life is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an 
indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs 
to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the 
estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the 
risks specific to the asset for which estimates of future cash 
flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit) 
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to 
its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is immediately 
recognised as an expense in the income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the 
carrying amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is 
increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable amount, 
but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed 
the carrying amount that would have been determined had 
no impairment loss been recognised for the asset (cash-
generating unit) in prior years. 66  Chime Communications plc
2. Significant accounting policies (continued) 
Work in progress
Work in progress is stated at the lower of invoiced cost 
and net realisable value, net of payments received on 
account. Cost represents work supplied from outside the 
Group awaiting billing to clients at the year-end and directly 
attributable overhead costs.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that 
the Group will be required to settle that obligation, and are 
discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on 
the Group’s balance sheet when the Group becomes a party 
to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash, overdrafts (where the group has 
formal right of set off) and cash held on short-term deposit 
(up to three months). Cash equivalents are cash deposits 
held on three months deposit at the Royal Bank of Scotland 
plc. The deposits guarantee the loan note creditors. Interest 
accruing on the deposits are payable to the holders of the 
loan notes less any costs arising.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry any interest and are stated at 
their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts. 
Investments
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a trade 
date where a purchase or sale of an investment is under 
contract whose terms require the delivery of the investment 
within the timeframe established by the market concerned, 
and are initially measured at cost, including transaction 
costs.
Investments are classified either as available for sale, 
and are measured at subsequent reporting dates at fair 
value, or at amortised cost, where no fair value is readily 
determinable. Gains and losses on available for sale 
financial assets arising from changes in fair value are 
recognised directly in equity , until the security is disposed of 
or is determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative 
gain or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the 
net profit or loss for the period.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at 
the fair value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest-bearing and are stated at 
their nominal value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at 
the fair value of proceeds received, net of direct issue costs.
Put options over equity
Put options over equity are held on the balance sheet at 
fair value, with movements in fair value being taken to the 
income statement.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 Share-
based Payments. IFRS 2 has been applied to all grants of 
equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were invested 
as of 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant. The fair value 
determined at the grant date of the equity-settled share-
based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares 
that will eventually vest and adjusted for the effect of non-
market based vesting conditions.
Fair value is measured for all schemes with market-based 
conditions by use of the Monte Carlo model. For all other 
schemes, fair value is measured by use of the Black-
Scholes model. The expected life used in the model has 
been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for 
the effects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and 
behavioural considerations.
A liability equal to the portion of the goods or services 
received is recognised at the current fair value determined 
at each balance sheet date for cash-settled share-based 
payments.
The Group also provides employees with the ability to 
purchase the Group’s ordinary shares at 80% of the current 
market value. The Group records an expense, based on its 
estimate of the 20% discount related to shares expected to 
vest on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. Further 
details are included in note 36 to the accounts.

Comparatives
As discussed in note 2 the comparatives for the year ended 
31 December 2011 were restated. This has the following 
effect on the segmental analysis:
i. Discontinued operations have been removed from the 
Public Relations segment
ii. Change in accounting policy resulting from IFRS IC 
agenda decision on IFRS 3 and continuing employment 
resulting in a deemed remuneration charge, this charge 
relates to the Sport & Entertainment division.
In addition the following changes have been made to reflect 
changes in the way the group operates and the manner 
in which information in respect of decision making is 
presented:
iii.	 Healthcare 	 division 	 is 	 now 	 repor ted	as 	 a 	separa te	
segment whereas it was previously reported as part of 
Public Relations 
iv . Tree (London) Limited is now reported as part of

shareholders of BPP Communications, and as such the 
disposal is noted as a related party transaction.
The disposal was completed on 30 June 2012, on which 
date the control of the Bell Pottinger Businesses passed to 
the acquirer . 
The total consideration was £19.6m, settled in £13.9m cash, 
shares representing a 25% holding in BPP Communications 
Limited valued at £4.1m, an amount of £1.0m which 
has been deferred for a period up to 30 June 2013 and 
£0.6m of deferred consideration liability transferred. BPP 
Communications Limited has been recognised as an 
associate at the balance sheet date.

11. Deferred tax (continued)
Losses of £2.4 million in the UK (2011: £2.7 million) and $9 million in the US (2011: $8.2 million) have not been recognised in 
deferred taxation due to insufficient certainty that there will be appropriate profits available in the future to utilise them.
In the UK, legislation was introduced in March 2012 to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 25% to 24% from 1 April 
2012. This gives an effective tax rate of 24.5% for current tax for the year ended 31 December 2012. Legislation was also 
passed	in	 J ul y 	 2012 	to 	reduce	the 	main 	ra te 	of 	 UK 	cor pora tion	tax 	from	24% 	to 	23% 	from	1 	 A pril 	 2013.	Hence 	 the	tax 	ra te 	of 	
23% has been applied in the calculation of deferred tax.
The UK government has announced that it intends to introduce a further reduction to the main rate of corporation tax, with the 
rate falling to 21% from 1 April 2014. This further reduction has not been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and 
is therefore not reflected in these financial statements.

No deferred tax liability is recognised on temporary differences of £399,000 (2011: £399,000) relating to the unremitted 
earnings of overseas subsidiaries as the group is able to control the timing of the reversal of these temporary differences 
and it is probable that they will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The temporary differences at 31 December 2012 
represent only the unremitted earnings of those overseas subsidiaries where remittance to the UK of those earnings may 
result in a tax liability, principally as a result of dividend withholding taxes levied by the overseas jurisdictions in which these 
subsidiaries operate.

The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not been included 
as a liability in these financial statements. The dividend will be paid on 14 June 2013 to those shareholders on the register at 
24 May 2013. The ex-dividend date is 22 May 2013.
Under an arrangement dated 3 April 1996, The Chime Communications Employee Trust which holds 1,261,702 ordinary 
shares representing 1.5% of the Company’s called-up share capital, has agreed to waive dividends over 620,526 shares 
(0.7% of the company’s called-up share capital), the difference being those shares held under the deferred share scheme.

Diluted earnings per share is calculated on the profit for the year attributable to parent company shareholders divided by 
the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year adjusted for the potentially dilutive impact of 
employee share incentive schemes and shares to be issued as part of deferred or contingent consideration on acquisitions 
of subsidiaries.
Some share options that had a higher purchase price than the average market price of the shares for the year ended  
31 December 2012 were outstanding. These options have been excluded from the calculation of diluted earnings per share 
as they would have been antidilutive.

The recoverable amounts of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations. The key assumptions for the value in 
use calculations are those regarding discount rates and growth rates during the period. Management estimates discount 
rates using pre-tax rates that reflect current market assessments of the time value of money and has taken into consideration 
the risks specific to each CGU. 
The Group prepared cashflow forecasts based on the 2013 budgets approved by the Directors. The budgets were prepared 
by local management taking into account revenues from existing clients and the resources required to service the clients. 
They also used their industry knowledge with regards to the marketplace and pricing when formulating the budget. The 
group then applied a constant growth rate to these forecasts to produce a five year forecast.

Annual Report and Accounts 2012  81
The group applied a conservative growth rate of 2.5% (2011: 2.5%) to all but two CGUs in preparing the impairment reviews 
for 2012. After the initial five year forecast period, a long term growth rate of 2% (2011: 2%) has been applied to the cash 
flow forecasts into perpetuity . This rate does not exceed the long-term growth rate for the relevant markets, and is applicable 
to all of the CGUs. During the impairment reviews prepared for 2012, two CGUs had different growth rates to take account 
of recent re-organisations within those businesses. A growth rate of approximately 15% was used for one CGU and rates of 
between 21% and 59% for the other CGU in preparing the forecasts for years two to five and a long term growth rate of 2% 
has been applied to the cash flow forecasts into perpetuity . The CGUs operate within the Public Relations and Advertising 
and Marketing Services segments.
The pre-tax rate used to discount the forecast cashflows from all CGUs in the Advertising and Marketing, Public Relations, 
Healthcare 	 and 	Insight	 & 	Eng agement	 sector s	 is 	 11%	 (2011: 	 11%). 	 A	pre-tax	 ra te	 of 	 11%	(2011: 	 11%) 	 has	been	used	f or	 
the Sport & Entertainment CGUs, other than one CGU located in Brazil, where a rate of 13% (2011: 13%) has been assumed 
in order to take account of the risk profile.
The Group has conducted a sensitivity analysis on the impairment test of each CGU’s carrying value. If discount rates 
were increased by 1% and operating income reduced by 10% in each period, goodwill allocated to four CGUs would be 
impaired 	 b y 	£2,500,000.	 T he 	CGU’ s	 opera te 	 within	 the	 Pub lic	R ela tions 	 and 	Healthcare	 segments .	 F or	 the	 same 	CGUs ,	if 	the	
sensitivities were taken in isolation, two CGUs would not record an impairment and for the other two, rates would need to be 
adjusted as follows for no impairment to be recorded.
CGU 	in	 Healthcare	segment	–	reducing	 the 	 opera ting	income	b y 	9%	 and	 the 	pre-tax	discount 	 ra te	 would 	 need	to 	increase	to	
11.8% before any impairment would be recorded.
CGU in Public Relations segment – reducing the operating income by 6.4% and the pre-tax discount rate would need to 
increase to 11.5% before any impairment would be recorded.
The cumulative goodwill impairment as at the brought forward balance sheet date was £37,599,000.
In 2012 other changes in respect of prior year acquisitions predominantly include:
•	 R e vision 	of 	 pro visional 	 goodwill 	 rela ting	 to 	 Gullif ord 	 Consulting 	Ltd,	due	to 	more	inf or ma tion 	 becoming	 a v ailab le 	rela ting 	 to

The average credit period at year end 57 days (2011: 63 days). The Group’s trade receivables are stated after allowances for

The Directors consider that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates their fair value. Trade and other 
receivables are predominantly non-interest bearing. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited 
due to the Group’s customer base being large, unrelated and largely billed in advance. Due to this, the Directors believe 
there is no further credit risk provision required in excess of the allowance for bad and doubtful debts. 96  Chime Communications plc

and two in South London. Provisions for property represent amounts set aside in respect of property leases which are 
onerous and the unavoidable costs of restoring leasehold properties to the condition specified in the lease at the end of the 
contractual term. The quantification of each of the provisions has been determined based on managements best estimate 
and is dependent on the Group’s ability to exit the leases early or to sublet the properties. In general, property costs are 
expected to be incurred over periods for which individual properties remain vacant or , where occupied, to the termination 
of the leases in question. During the year the group made provisions of £2,378,000. It is expected that this provision will be 
utilised over the period to 2015.
Gross obligation under put option
The Gross obligation under put option was exercised in 2011. It had arisen as a result of a shareholders’ agreement with a 
non-controlling interest. The value of the option was estimated with regards to future profitability of the operation based on 
multiples of earnings.  100  Chime Communications plc

34. Contingent liabilities and commitments
Deferred and contingent consideration
In addition to the potential deferred and contingent consideration provided as disclosed in note 28 of £15,950,000 at  
31 December 2012 there was a maximum financial commitment of £28,033,000 undiscounted (2011: £28,473,000) in respect 
of unprovided deferred contingent consideration payable in respect of acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings.  
The calculation of the deferred consideration liability requires estimates to be made regarding the forecast future 
performance of these businesses for the earnout period. The unprovided deferred contingent consideration would become 
payable over periods from 2013 to 2018 and would be payable in cash/loan notes or cash/loan notes and new shares.
Deemed remuneration
In addition to the deemed remuneration provision as disclosed in note 29 of £14,680,000 currently provided at 31 December 
2012, £12,615,000 (2011: £6,081,000) will be expensed over the period of the service based on the current fair value.  
In addition an amount of £10,035,000 (2011:£4,029,000) (undiscounted) would be charged under the earn-out agreements 
should maximum performance targets be met. The calculation of the deemed remuneration liability requires estimates to 
be made regarding the forecast future performance of these businesses for the period of service. The unprovided deemed 
remuneration would become payable over periods from 2013 to 2018 and would be payable in cash/loan notes or cash/loan 
notes and new shares.

Between three and five years 14,243 16,014
Greater than five years 12,667 14,601
39,802 44,235
Operating lease payments represent rentals payable by the Group primarily for its office properties. Leases are negotiated for 
an average term of 13 years and rentals are fixed for an average of 5 years at the prevailing market rate. 
The Group as lessor
At the balance sheet date, the Group had contracted with tenants for the following future minimum lease payments:
2012
£’000
2011
£’000
Within one year 1,412 808
Between one and two years 1,475 754
Greater than five years 234 278
3,121 1,840
Property rental income earned from subtenants during the year was £2,043,000 (2011: £758,000).
36. Share-based payments
The Group operates various share plans relating to shares in the parent company including an executive share option 
scheme, an employee savings related share option scheme (SAYE), a deferred share scheme, the VCCP Partners Scheme 
and a Co-Investment Plan
The Group recognised total expenses in 2012 of £1,932,000 (2011: £801,000) related to equity-settled share-based payment 
transactions.
Share Options (executive options and SAYE)
The exercise price of the options granted under the executive share option scheme is equal to the market value of the 
Group’s shares at the time when the options are granted. The vesting period is generally three years but if they are special 
options it is five years. If the options remain unexercised after a period of 10 years from the date of grant, the options expire. 
Furthermore, options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest. 
The exercise price of the options granted under the employee savings related scheme is 80% of the market value at the 
date of offer . The vesting period is five years, if the options remain unexercised six months after this date, the options expire. 
Furthermore, the options are forfeited if the employee leaves the Group before the options vest.

Weighted average remaining contractual life 877 days 1,024 days
Weighted average share price for options exercised 
at date of exercise £2.228 £2.713
New options were granted on 26 October 2012. The aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted on that 
date is £64,000. In 2011 options were granted on 27 April, the aggregate of the estimated fair values of the options granted 
on that date is £45,000.
The fair value was calculated using the Monte Carlo and Binomial models. In valuing the options, the following assumptions 
were used:
2012 2011
Weighted average share price £2.067 £2.640
Weighted average exercise price £1.830 £2.150
Expected volatility 55.0% 53.3%
Expected life-savings related scheme 5.7 years 5.7 years
Risk-free rate 0.50% 0.50%
Dividend yield 3.18% 2.29%
Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous five 
years. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the effects of  
non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations. 106  Chime Communications plc

period is fixed at the grant date by the Remuneration Committee. Currently there are grants over vesting periods of one, two, 
three and four years from the date of award. If the employee leaves the Group before vesting then the restricted shares are 
forfeited. The employee receives the dividend on the shares during the vesting period.

period is fixed at the grant date by the Remuneration Committee. Currently there are grants over a vesting period of up to  
four years from the date of award. If the employee leaves the Group within the first two years of grant then the restricted 
shares are forfeited. 
Additional restricted shares were awarded on 29 June 2012. The share price at the date of the award was £1.565.  
The estimated fair value of the restricted shares awarded is £354,000 (2011: £142,000).

38. Financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise bank loans, bank overdrafts, finance leases, cash and short-term 
deposits. The main purpose of the financial instruments is to provide finance for the Group’s operations. The Group 
has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade receivables and trade payables, which arise directly from 
operations. During the year the Group has financed its business through an overdraft facility and revolving committed facility 
arranged with the Royal Bank of Scotland plc.
The Group uses financial instruments to manage its bank borrowings: this is done by the use of foreign exchange rate swaps. 
The Group does not hold or issue derivative financial instruments for financial trading purposes but derivatives that qualify 
for hedge accounting are accounted for as trading instruments. Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at 
fair value at the contract date and continue to be stated at fair value at the balance sheet date with gains and losses on 
revaluation being recognised immediately to the income statement. 
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk, liquidity risk and foreign currency risk.  
The policy for managing these risks is reviewed and agreed with the Board.
Interest rate risk
The Group holds variable rate financial debt. Fixed interest rates are for periods of up to three months at a time. The interest 
rate margins paid by the Group on financial debt are disclosed in note 27. The Group assesses its borrowing requirements 
monitors and interest rates and assess the risks through sensitivity analysis.
If interest rates had been 1% higher/lower during the year the impact to profit before tax would have been an increase/
decrease of £152,000 (2011: increase/decrease of £153,000). The impact on shareholders’ equity would have been a 
decrease/increase of £109,000 (2011: decrease/increase of £112,000).
Liquidity risk
The Group has an agreed committed facility of £45 million with the Royal Bank of Scotland. The facility matures in September 
2016. There is also an uncommitted facility available of £5 million, which is reviewed on a rolling basis. The Group manages 
liquidity risk by maintaining adequate reserves and banking facilities and by continuously monitoring forecast and actual 
cash flows. At 31 December 2012 the Group had net cash of £3,343,000 (2011: £3,343,000), which is after deducting an 
amount drawn down against the facility of £14,000,000 (2011: £7,750,000). The undrawn committed facility was therefore 
£27,800,000. 110  Chime Communications plc

Year ended 31 December 2012
38. Financial instruments (continued)
Externally imposed capital requirement:
Under the terms of the Group’s banking covenants the Group must meet certain criteria based on interest and dividend cover 
and net debt to EBITDA. There have been no breaches of the banking covenants in the current or prior year .
Foreign currency risk: 
The Group has 24 overseas operations (branches and subsidiaries) which trade in Europe, the USA, the Far East, the Middle 
East, South America, Australasia and Africa. The sterling value of the net monetary assets held in the principal foreign 
currencies held by the group are as follows:
2012
£’000
2011 
£’000
Net monetary assets/liabilities
US Dollars (355) 426
Euros (1,480) 1,404
Brazilian Real (777) (8,265)
The Group does on occasion agree to bill clients in a currency other than the local currency; it also makes some purchases 
overseas where the supplier bills in their local currency . The Group does not hedge the translation exposure on the fees 
due. The Group converts any fees received in foreign currency on receipt on funds. In some instances where it is viewed 
appropriate, the proceeds from the client are kept in currency so as to minimise the foreign exchange exposure on the 
transaction if there are third party costs to be paid out of the funds in that currency . In this instance the Group uses short-
term foreign exchange swaps to manage the Group’s borrowings. The fair value of the swaps entered into at 31 December 
2012 is estimated as an asset of £9,000 (2011: liability of £9,000). There was one swap open over the year end. This amount 
is based on the market values of equivalent instruments at the balance sheet date.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to reasonably possible changes in the US Dollar and Euro exchange rates, 
with all other variables held constant, of the group’s equity:
2012 2011
Strengthening/(weakening) of sterling +10% -10% +10% -10%

US Dollar 25 (27) 29 (32)
Euro 55 (60) (87) 96
Brazilian Real 77 226 (728) 801
Capital risk management:
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as going concerns while 
maximising the return to stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The capital structure of the 
Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents and equity attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued 
capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity .

Market price risk:
The Group’s exposure to market price risk comprises interest rate risk and currency rate risk. The Group regularly monitors 
these exposures which, setting aside the interrelationships between such rates and their wider impact on the economy, are 
not considered to have a significant impact on the Group. 
Fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities:
Fair value is the amount at which a financial instrument can be exchanged in an arm’s length transaction between informed 
and willing parties, other than a forced or liquidation sale.

Other investments: The Other Investments represent equity securities acquired by the Group and are classified as Available 
for Sale. The fair values of the listed securities (£354,000) are derived from quoted market prices and thus are considered to 
be a Level 1 fair value measurement.
There were no transfers between fair value levels during 2012 or 2011.

The Group considers its maximum exposure to credit risk to be as follows:
2012
£’000
2011
£’000
Trade receivables 47,841 60,205 
Deferred consideration receivable 1,307 507
The Group trades only with recognised, creditworthy third parties. Customers who wish to trade on credit terms are generally 
subject to credit verification procedures. In addition, receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis with the result 
that the Group’s exposure to bad debts has not been significant.
Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and 
unrelated.
With respect to credit risk arising from other financial assets of the Group, which comprises cash and cash equivalents, the 
Group’s exposure to credit risk arises from default of the counterparty, with a maximum amount of exposure equal to the

39. Subsequent events
Subsequent to the year end, the Group has made the following acquisition.
Complete Leisure Group (‘CLG’)
On 30 January 2013 the Group exercised its option to acquire Lord Coe’s 93% interest in CLG. On completion Chime paid an 
initial £1.96 million in cash. In addition future payments under an earn-out arrangement up to a maximum of £10.2 million are 
payable over the period to March 2017 on the achievement of various financial targets. 
Subsequent to acquisition, the results of CLG will be included within the Group’s Sport & Entertainment division.
Due to the proximity of completion of this transaction to the issue of these financial statements the information required to 
prepare the initial accounting for the business combination are as yet unavailable, therefore we are unable to provide the 
disclosure required under IFRS 3 at this time. 114  Chime Communications plc
Independent Auditor’s Report to the Members of  
Chime Communications plc 
We have audited the parent company financial statements of 
Chime Communications plc for the year ended 31 December 
2012 which comprise the parent Company Balance Sheet 
and the related notes 1 to 16. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is 
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
(United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken 
so that we might state to the company’s members those 
matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the company and the company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for 
the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the parent company financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility 
is to audit and express an opinion on the parent company 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements 
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error . This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read 
all the financial and non-financial information in the annual 
report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
financial statements. If we become aware of any apparent 
material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements

•	 giv e	 a	tr ue 	and	 fair	view	of 	 the	sta te	of 	 the 	compan y’ s	
affairs as at 31 December 2012;

Notes to the Company Financial Statements
Year ended 31 December 2012
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are drawn 
up in accordance with S434 to S436 of the Companies Act 
2006 and United Kingdom generally accepted accounting 
principles (“UK GAAP”). The preparation of financial 
statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting 
principles requires management to make estimates and 
assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and 
liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities 
at the date of the financial statements and the reported 
amounts of revenue and expenses during the reporting 
period. Actual results could differ from those estimates. 
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are 
recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised 
if the revision affects only that period or in the period of 
the revision and future periods if the revision affects both 
current and future periods.
The financial statements are prepared on a going concern 
basis as explained in the Directors’ Report.
The particular accounting policies adopted are described 
below. 
Accounting policies have been applied consistently 
between years. In 2012 the trade and assets of the central 
services function were transferred into the Company from a 
subsidiary.
The balance sheet and statements of movements on share 
capital, share premium and reserves have been prepared on 
a basis consistent with the financial statements for the year 
ended 31 December 2011 with the following exception:
•	 Change 	in	accounting 	 polic y
The Directors have taken guidance from the latest 
accounting pronouncements to consider the accounting 
policy for the treatment of contingent payments under earn-
out arrangements for acquisitions that are dependent on 
continuing employment. As UK GAAP is silent on the matter 
the guidance from IFRS 3 and the treatment adopted in the 
group accounts has been considered.
Following the publication in the January 2013 Update of 
the IFRS Interpretations Committee’s agenda decision on 
contingent payments to selling shareholders who continue 
as employees following a business combination, the 
Group has changed its accounting policy . It now treats all 
payments that are dependent on continuing employment as 
remuneration for post-acquisition services in the subsidiary 
company to which the services are provided.
Following this change in policy, the treatment in the Parent 
has been changed to account for deemed remuneration 
charge during the year incurred by a subsidiary, in 
connection with services to that subsidiary, as an addition to 
the investment in the subsidiary . The estimated liability to the 
former shareholder is shown in the Parent company balance 
sheet as a provision for deemed remuneration.
The effects of this change in policy are summarised below:

Annual Report and Accounts 2012  117
Cash flow
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption 
contained in FRS 1 “Cash Flow Statements” and has not 
produced a cash flow statement.
Financial instruments
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption 
contained in FRS 29 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” 
and has not produced any disclosures required by that 
standard, as full disclosures are available in Chime 
Communications plc Annual Report for the year ended  
31 December 2012.
Related parties
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption 
contained in FRS 8 “Related Party Disclosures” and has not 
reported transactions with fellow Group undertakings.
Accounting convention
The financial statements are prepared under the historical 
cost convention.
Investments
In the Company’s accounts, investments in subsidiary and 
associate undertakings are stated at cost less provision for 
any impairment in value.
Deferred consideration and deemed remuneration
When earnouts are to be settled in cash or shares with a 
fixed monetary value, the fair value of the consideration 
is obtained by discounting to present value the amounts 
expected to be payable in the future. If the earnouts are 
linked to further employment then they are classed as 
deemed remuneration but if there is no link to employment 
then they generally are classed as deferred consideration.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of 
financial instruments, are recognised on the balance sheet 
when the Company becomes a party to the contractual 
provisions of the instrument.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the 
Company are classified according to the substance of the 
contractual arrangements entered into and the definitions 
of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its 
liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other 
financial assets. Equity instruments issued by the Company 
are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct  
issue costs.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at 
the proceeds received, net of direct issues costs. Finance 
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or 
redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an 
accruals basis in profit or loss using the effective interest 
method and are added to the carrying amount of the 
instrument to the extent that that are not settled in the period 
in which they arise.
Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of equity settled share 
based compensation plans for the employees of subsidiary 
undertakings, using the Company’s equity instruments. 
Up to 2012, the fair value of the compensation given in 
respect of these share-based compensation plans was 
recognised as a capital contribution to the Company’s 
subsidiary undertakings, over the vesting period. The capital 
contribution is then reduced by any payments received 
from subsidiary undertakings in respect of these share-
based payments. In 2012, the Directors reconsidered the 
way in which contributions to the share based payments in 
subsidiaries were treated. Therefore in the current year it is 
being treated as a receivable from the subsidiary company . 
Dividends paid or received
Dividends paid and received are included in the financial 
statements in the period in which the related dividends are 
actually paid or received or , in respect of the Company’s 
final dividend for the year , approved by shareholders.
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in UK companies denominated in currencies 
other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of 
exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At 
each balance sheet date, monetary assets and liabilities that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the 
rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Gains and losses 
arising on retranslation are included in net profit or loss for 
the period. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms 
of historical cost in a foreign currency are not retranslated.
Taxation
The tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently 
payable and deferred tax.
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the 
year . Taxable profit differs from net profit as reported in the 
income statement because it excludes items of income or 
expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it 
further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax 
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the 
balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or 
recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable 
profit, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability 
method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised  118  Chime Communications plc
Notes to the Company Financial Statements continued
Year ended 31 December 2012
1. Accounting policies (continued)
for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax 
assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that 
taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and 
liabilities are not recognised if the temporary difference 
arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than 
in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities 
in a transaction that affects neither the tax profit nor the 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary 
differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, except where 
the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at 
each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it 
is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be 
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected 
to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the 
asset is realised. Deferred tax is charged or credited in the 
income statement, except when it relates to items charged or 
credited directly to equity , in which case the deferred tax is 
also dealt with in equity .
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost net of 
depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation 
is provided in equal installments to write off the cost less 
residual value over the estimated useful economic lives of 
asset type as follows:
Short-term leasehold improvements 5 years
Motor vehicles 6 years
Fixtures, fittings and equipment 4 years
Software 4 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their 
expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or , 
where shorter , the term of the relevant lease.
The gain or loss arising on the disposal of an asset is 
determined as the difference between the sales proceeds 
and the carrying amount of the asset and is recognised in 
the income statement.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present 
obligation as a result of a past event and it is probable that 
the Company will be required to settle that obligation, and 
are discounted to present value where the effect is material.
Vacant property provisions
Provisions for property represent amounts set aside in 
respect of property leases which are onerous and the 
unavoidable costs of restoring leasehold properties to the 
condition specified in the lease at the end of the contractual 
term. The quantification of each of the provisions is 
determined based on the Directors best estimate and is 
dependent on the Company’s ability to exit the leases early 
or to sublet the properties. In general, property costs are 
expected to be incurred over periods for which individual 
properties remain vacant or , where occupied, to the 
termination of the leases in question.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, which include those of 
the Company, together with the factors likely to affect its 
future development, performance and position are set out 
in the Chief Executive’s Statement on pages 4 and 5. The 
financial position of the Group, its cash flows and borrowing 
facilities are described in the Finance Director’s Report on 
pages 12 and 13. In addition, note 38 of the consolidated 
financial statements include the Group’s objectives, policies 
and processes for managing its capital; its financial 
risk management objectives and details of its financial 
instruments; and its exposure to credit risk and liquidity risk.
As highlighted in note 27 to the consolidated financial 
statements, the Group meets its day to day working capital 
requirements through an uncommitted overdraft facility and a 
committed facility which matures in September 2016. These 
facilities are subject to banking covenants as disclosed in 
note 38 to the consolidated financial statements.
In preparing forecasts the directors have taken into account 
the following key factors:
•	 T he 	ra te 	of 	 growth 	of 	the	UK 	and 	global	econom y	 on	the	
Group’s business during the economic recovery;
•	 K e y 	c lient 	account	renewals;
•	 Planned 	acquisitions	 and 	disposals;
•	 Anticipa ted 	pa yments	 under	def er red 	and 	contingent 	
consideration;
•	 T he 	 le v el 	of 	 committed 	and 	 v ariab le	costs; 	and
•	 Cur rent 	new 	 b usiness 	targets	compared	to 	le v els 	
achieved in previous years.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking account of 
reasonably possible changes in trading performance, show 
that the Group should be able to operate within the level of 
its current facility and banking covenants. 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus they continue to adopt the going concern basis of 
accounting in preparing the annual financial statements.

12. Contingent liabilities and commitments
Deferred and contingent consideration
At 31 December 2012 there was a maximum financial commitment of £2,633,000 undiscounted (2011: £19,352,000) in 
respect of unprovided deferred contingent consideration payable in respect of acquisitions of subsidiary undertakings. The 
calculation of the deferred consideration liability requires estimates to be made regarding the forecast future performance 
of these businesses for the earnout period. The unprovided deferred contingent consideration would become payable over 
periods from 2013 to 2018 and would be payable in cash/loan notes or cash/loan notes and new shares.
Deemed remuneration
In addition to the deemed remuneration provision as disclosed in note 10 of £14,299,000 currently provided at 31 December 
2012, £12,377,000 (2011: £6,081,000) will be expensed in the relevant subsidiary company, over the period of the service 
based on the current fair value. The investment in the parent company will increase by the same amount. In addition an 
amount of £9,709,000 (2011: £4,029,000) (undiscounted) would be expensed in the relevant subsidiary company, under 
the earn-out agreement should maximum performance targets be met, and the investment in the parent company would 
increase. The calculation of the deemed remuneration liability requires estimates to be made regarding the forecast future 
performance of these businesses for the period of service. The unprovided deemed remuneration would become payable 
over periods from 2013 to 2018 and would be payable in cash/loan notes or cash/loan notes and new shares.

13. Share-based payments
The Company currently uses a number of equity settled 
share plans to grant options and shares to the Directors 
and employees of its subsidiary undertakings. As at 31 
December 2012, the Company had 1,016,631 ordinary share 
options outstanding (2011: 1,384,679).
In 2012 the Directors reconsidered the way in which 
contributions to the share based payments in subsidiaries 
were treated. Therefore in the current year it is being treated 
as a receivable from the subsidiary company . Previously 
the company made a capital contribution to its subsidiary 
undertakings in relation to share-based payments and as at 
31 December 2012, the cumulative capital contribution net 
of payments received from subsidiary undertakings was 
£6,391,000 (2011: £7,288,000). During the year ended 31 
December 2012, the capital contribution arising from share-
based payments was £0 (2011: £759,000).
Full details of share-based payments, share option schemes 
and share plans are disclosed in note 36 to the Consolidated 
Financial Statements of Chime Communication Plc.

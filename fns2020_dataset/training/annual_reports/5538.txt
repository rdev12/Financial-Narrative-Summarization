14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:37  Page 1 I am delighted to report on our results for the year to 30 September 2007 during which pro-forma EBITDA, which
excludes the impact of batch disposals, increased by 3.7% to £526 million. Profit before tax and exceptional
items of £301 million resulted in adjusted earnings per share of 39.6p, an increase of 15.8% over the prior year.
Accordingly, the Board is recommending an increase of 15.6% in the dividend paid to shareholders, giving a total
for the year of 15.6 pence per share. Dividend cover based on adjusted earnings per share is 2.5 times. The final
dividend of 10.4 pence will be payable on 21 January 2008 to shareholders on the register on 28 December
2007.
During the year we continued to return cash to shareholders through a combination of our share buy-back
programme and dividend payments. We purchased 102.9 million shares in the year at a cost of £658 million
(excluding associated costs). In addition, we paid £79 million of dividends and therefore returned a total of £737
million to shareholders during the year. At the preliminary results presentation in November last year we
announced that we intended to return at least the same level of cash to shareholders as we did in the year to
September 2006. The total returned this year of £737 million compares to a total return in the previous year of
£463 million, representing an increase of 59%. Taking into account the cash flow needs of the business, we
expect to continue the share buy-back programme in the current financial year. Since 30 September we have
purchased 3.5 million shares at a cost of £21 million.
At 30 September 2007 the ratio of underlying net debt to EBITDA was 7 times. The Board considers this to be
the optimal leverage level for the Group based on the current financing structure. We announced at our interim
results presentation in May that we expected, subject to market conditions, the refinancing of the Unique
securitisation to be completed by the end of the calendar year. However, to avoid pricing new long-term debt at
a time of uncertainty in the debt markets, we consider that a delay into 2008 is appropriate.
Our performance over the past year represents another period of solid growth in a challenging environment
which reflects our ongoing commitment to improving the quality of our pub estate through churn and capital
expenditure and also the impact of our share buy-back programme. We will remain focused on meeting the
challenges of both changing consumer demand and the smoking ban and providing attractive financial returns
to our shareholders.

The year to 30 September 2007 has once again seen investment in enhancing the quality of the Enterprise Inns
(ETI) estate and increasing profitability for our licensees and shareholders alike. On a like-for-like basis, which
excludes the impact of batch disposals, pro-forma EBITDA increased by 3.7% to £526 million. Profit before tax
and exceptional items of £301 million resulted in adjusted earnings per share of 39.6p, an increase of 15.8% over
the prior year.
STRATEGY
ETI remains focused on the two key pillars of its business strategy: to be the leading specialist operator of leased
and tenanted pubs in the UK and to deliver long-term sustainable growth in shareholder value.
Our licensees have had a tough year. After a reasonable Christmas and New Year, the summer brought with it the
challenges of the ban on smoking, miserable weather and extensive flooding and, latterly, a general deterioration
in consumer confidence as a number of adverse economic factors created uncertainty in the minds of many
consumers.
Through these testing times, the strength of the leased and tenanted partnership has continued to deliver steady
results. We have worked closely with our licensees to create effective smoking solutions, sometimes through
investment and always with encouragement, advice and support. The majority of our estate is now well
positioned to manage the risks and opportunities that the ban has created, although we envisage that the ban
will lead to a number of pub closures across the industry, particularly amongst lower quality, wet-led outlets. The
poor summer weather was a disappointment for licensees, particularly those who invested heavily in gardens and
outside spaces. The summer floods resulted in the temporary closure of 207 pubs, some for several months, and
it is a tribute to our licensees and to our team that they “rolled up their sleeves” and got on with sorting out and
reopening their pubs. Consumer confidence appears to have been adversely affected by increases in taxation,
interest rates, utility bills, food and fuel prices together with the uncertainties surrounding global financial
markets. It is difficult to tell how this will impact on consumer behaviour over the next year, although caution
would seem to be the watchword.
The resilience of our operating model has delivered good trading results in this testing year, with shareholder
returns further enhanced by our commitment to returning cash to shareholders through our ongoing share buy-
back programme, which saw ETI purchase for cancellation some 102.9 million shares during the year,
representing 17% of the shares in issue (excluding treasury shares) at the beginning of the year.
TEAM
There have been a number of structural and personnel changes during the year, providing ever-improving
services to our licensees and strengthening the team at every level to ensure that we are well positioned to
meet the challenges of the business.
Our Associate Regional Manager programme has been particularly important, identifying and developing top
quality candidates through a six month full-time training programme to take on the key role of regional manager
in the ETI estate. During the year, this award-winning programme has successfully trained and promoted eight
candidates who are adding a strong new dimension to our field based teams.
Commitment, ownership and reward are vital ingredients in the motivation and retention of key staff and we are
delighted that all senior managers and 91% of all employees with over two years’ service at ETI have some form
of interest in ownership of the business, through direct share ownership, share options, Share Incentive Plans
and Save As You Earn schemes. During the year, our Share Incentive Plan won two awards, one for the Best New
Share plan for a FTSE 100 Company, another for Best Communication Programme for a Company with up to
1,000 employees.
ESTATE
The quality, value and profitability of the ETI estate have continued to improve during the year. Investment of
£75 million (2006: £54 million), alongside a similar amount from our licensees, saw developments at almost

14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:37  Page 3 1,600 pubs, either through major schemes or minor refurbishments. Whilst much of this investment was initiated
through business reviews addressing the challenges of the smoking ban, the end results reflect real
improvements in the overall quality and profitability of the chosen pubs, whether through the creation of food
offerings, accommodation or simply upgrading existing facilities for the benefit of customers.
In September 2006, we completed the sale of 769 pubs to Admiral Taverns, pubs which we had identified as not
fitting our quality and profitability profile for the future. This was followed on 5 December 2006 by the sale of
our entire Scottish estate of 137 pubs to Retail and Licensed Properties Limited for a consideration of £115
million which generated a profit over book value of £13 million. In addition, we sold 17 pubs and some surplus
land for £13 million, generating a further profit of £9 million.
Our attention remained focused on the market for individual acquisitions, where our estates team have found a
steady supply of top quality pubs, allowing ETI to purchase 108 great pubs during the year for a total
consideration of £91 million. In the absence of value enhancing corporate transactions, we continue to view
these individual acquisitions, generally at EBITDA multiples of around 10 times, as the best route to creating
value for shareholders.
Core growth, complemented by our continuing policy of investment and churn, has seen EBITDA per pub
increase to £68,300 for the 7,763 pubs which we owned at 30 September 2007. The book value of the pub
estate at the year end, valued on an individual pub by pub basis, increased to £5.7 billion, equivalent to an
average value of £736,000 per pub.
As in previous years, our annual estates review is designed to form a view of the quality and sustainability of
every pub in the estate. The past two years have seen the number of pubs with outside trading areas increase
from 83% to 91%, pubs serving food increase from 81% to 88% and it is encouraging to see that the team
continue to rank more than two-thirds of our pubs as ‘very good’ or ‘excellent’. The review did, however, identify
that a number of our pubs have or may become unviable as a result of changing market conditions, notably the
smoking ban. Against this background we have identified, and put on the market for sale, 96 pubs. We expect to
sell these pubs unlicensed, for alternative use, and are confident that we will achieve sale proceeds in excess of
book value.

14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:37  Page 4 As the quality of our estate improves, so do the opportunities for licensees to build and sustain a profitable
business. As ETI seeks to attract the best licensees, it remains a priority to ensure that the package that we offer
is fair, that rents are not excessive and that real help is offered, where required, to make the most of the
business opportunities that exist in any particular market.
Based upon our annual review of estate profitability, we estimate that the average level of licensee profitability
in the 7,763 pubs that we owned at 30 September 2007 has increased by around 4% to £47,000. This increase
reflects to some extent the benefit of churn in the estate, but we nevertheless estimate that on a like-for-like
basis licensee profitability, despite continuing cost and margin pressures, has increased by 2.6%, broadly in line
with inflation.
The ETI estate continues to be attractive to licensees, who recognise the quality of the pubs in our portfolio and
the essential fairness of our package. This is once again supported by key performance indicators:
 During the year, some 85,000 visitors used our Internet pub search facility, resulting in more than 1,500
formal applications, of which 80% were received online.
 With 84% of the estate let on long-term, assignable leases, most changes take the form of lease
assignments. During the year there have been 790 assignments, at an average premium of £69,000
(£86,000 including fixtures and fittings).
 Rent concessions at 30 September 2007 increased marginally to £1.5 million, around 0.5% of rent roll.
 1,457 rent reviews were completed during the year, with an average rental increase of 2.7% per annum.
Just three rent reviews went to arbitration, two of which were found in favour of ETI.
 Overdue balances are at similar levels to last year and bad debt costs remain around 0.1% of turnover.
Market conditions will continue to test our licensees and we believe that many poorer quality pubs across the
industry are likely to close. Nevertheless, given the quality and profitability of the ETI estate, we are confident
that our pubs and licensees will continue to meet the challenges, gain market share and prosper.
FINANCIAL STRUCTURE
Cash flow
Free cash inflow during the year amounted to £75 million, based on operating cash inflow and after deduction of
mandatory payments in respect of interest and tax and discretionary payments in respect of capital expenditure
and dividends.
Debt facilities
The Group has a flexible financing structure including a syndicated bank debt facility of £1 billion, corporate
bonds and securitised bonds. At 30 September 2007 underlying net debt was £3,716 million compared to £3,166
million at the start of the year. Underlying net debt represents amounts owed to banks and other lenders net of
cash retained in the business. During the year we repaid £81 million of securitised bonds from the proceeds of
the sale of pubs and drew down the remaining balance of our syndicated bank facility.
Financial leverage
The two key metrics the Group uses to measure financial leverage are interest cover based on EBITDA and the
ratio of underlying net debt to EBITDA. At 30 September 2007, interest cover was 2.4 times and underlying net
debt to EBITDA was 7 times.
We believe that there is scope to increase the leverage in the Group to around eight times underlying net debt
to EBITDA in a revised financing structure and the proposed refinancing of the Unique securitisation next year
will aim to bring the Group closer to this level.

14414 06/12/2007 Proof 6
14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:37  Page 5 Balance Sheet
The book value of the pub estate is £5.7 billion which includes a revaluation increase in the year of £312 million.
The net assets of the Group at year end were £1,483 million which compares to £1,602 million as at
30 September 2006. Notwithstanding profit generation and an increase in the value of our pubs, the reduction
in net assets arises as a result of the share buy-back programme.
Tax charge
The pre-exceptional tax charge of £85 million represents 28% of profit before tax and exceptional items. The
total tax charge of £46 million is 14% of profit before tax.
The exceptional tax credit of £39 million comprises two significant deferred tax credits partially off-set by an
exceptional deferred tax charge. The Finance Act 2007 reduced the rate of UK corporation tax to 28% with effect
from April 2008. A one-off credit of £23 million arises as a result of a reduction in deferred tax balances due to
this change. A second credit of £28 million arises in relation to indexation on the tax base cost of certain
properties. A deferred tax charge of £12 million has been recognised in relation to the movement in fair value of
interest rate swaps and profit on sale of property.
Cash outflow in respect of tax for the year was £71 million, equivalent to 24% of profit before tax and
exceptional items.
Exceptional items
The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the
Income Statement. Exceptional items are those which are separately identified by virtue of their size or nature to
allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group. As a result, the Group focuses on ‘pre-
exceptional’ performance measures in order to compare underlying performance year on year.
The most significant exceptional items in the year are profit on disposal of property, plant and equipment of £22
million and movements relating to the fair value of financial instruments of £16 million. As discussed above,
there is also a significant exceptional tax credit in the year of £39 million.
REAL ESTATE INVESTMENT TRUSTS (REITs)
The Group is involved in ongoing discussions with HMRC regarding a potential conversion to REIT status. HMRC
has expressed the view that the Group, as currently structured, does not meet the qualifying criteria for
admission as a REIT. We are, however, currently exploring with HMRC whether an internal restructuring of the
Group’s activities, currently being considered by the Board and designed to enhance shareholder returns and
optimise the benefits of our proposed refinancing, would result in the Group becoming eligible for admission to
the REIT regime. HMRC is considering various aspects of this proposed restructuring and we will update
shareholders when there are significant developments to report.
INDUSTRY ISSUES
Ban on smoking in pubs
There is now a total ban on smoking in pubs throughout the UK and there has been an almost universal level of
acceptance amongst pub-goers. Many people who avoided pubs because of the smoky atmosphere are now
potential customers and forward-looking licensees are capitalising on this opportunity. Often, these opportunities
arise through the provision of good quality food, and we estimate that food revenues across the ETI estate have
risen by 13% in the past year, now representing at least 20% of average pub turnover. With standards of pub food
constantly improving, there is a risk that the market place for “value for money” food may become overcrowded
so our advice to licensees tends towards “do it really well or not at all”, focusing above all on the key strengths
of each individual pub, and always trying to make sure that their pub is the best in each locality. The coming
year will be difficult for some pubs and we remain cautious about the next six to nine months. However, we are
confident of a positive outcome as the smoking ban becomes an accepted part of pub-going and licensees and
customers alike enjoy the benefits of the more pleasant, healthier smoke-free regime.

14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:37  Page 6 Responsible drinking
The pub industry, through its trade bodies working with Government and the police, has made real progress over
the past couple of years tackling the issues of under age drinking and irresponsible promotions. Proof of Age
cards are now a regular and accepted part of pub-going for under 21s, with the result that the number of under-
age drinkers being served in pubs has been significantly reduced. Furthermore, and without the need for
legislation, industry self regulation has resulted in a marked reduction in irresponsible promotions that
encourage excessive drinking, such as happy hours or “two for one” offers.
The pub is a highly regulated, professionally run environment, which should, and generally does, live up to its
reputation as “the home of responsible drinking”. Unfortunately, drink (and drug) fuelled anti social behaviour
remains a serious problem to be tackled at all levels in society. In this regard, one must question the pricing
policies of the major supermarkets and some other off trade outlets which sell alcohol, which is generally
consumed in an unregulated environment, at very low prices. Not only do they, on occasion, sell alcohol at
prices below cost but they have cheap alcohol at the heart of promotions policies, particularly in the run up to
Christmas. When it comes to the important issue of tackling irresponsible drinking, it is up to all stakeholders to
face up to their share of responsibility.
CONCLUSION AND OUTLOOK
In a challenging year for ETI and our licensees, the team has worked successfully to improve the quality of the
pub estate, grow licensee profitability and deliver substantial growth in earnings and dividends. The new
financial year has started well, but we remain cautious about consumer confidence and the impact through the
coming winter of the smoking ban. In spite of these uncertain conditions, we believe that the quality of our pub
estate will deliver performance ahead of the market and that the team will deliver further solid growth in
shareholder value.

14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:37  Page 7 The Group continues to adopt an approach to the management of corporate responsibility that balances the long
term interests of stakeholders by focusing on those matters which are relevant to long-term success and the
environment in which the business operates.
The Board is committed to act in a responsible manner. This report sets out the key areas we have focused on
during the period under review. Our approach to corporate responsibility includes:
 analysing and managing risk;
 maintaining a continuing dialogue with stakeholders; and
 managing the environmental and social impact of the business on employees and the community.
Social, Ethical and Environmental Risk Management
The identification, management and monitoring of key risks is undertaken as part of the Group’s system of
internal control as described on page 28. In addition, we work with employees, licensees and suppliers as
appropriate to ensure we understand any issues which may impact on the workplace, the community or the
environment. The Chief Executive is responsible for the development and implementation of the approach to
social responsibility matters. All executive directors are responsible for the promotion of good practice in
environmental matters and report to the Board as necessary on significant risks.
The most significant corporate responsibility issues for the Group are considered below and the Group has put in
place policies to ensure:
 compliance with relevant laws, regulations and codes of practice;
 employees are provided with a safe working environment; and
 ongoing training needs of employees are met.
The Workplace
The Group’s Health & Safety Policy (the ‘H&S Policy’) clearly states its intention to provide and maintain a
healthy and safe working environment.
In order to deliver this policy, the Group has established an internal Health & Safety Management Group (the
‘H&S Group’) with responsibility for advising, reviewing and delivering the agreed management systems
employed by the business to satisfy its health and safety responsibilities. The H&S Group reports to the Company
Secretary who is responsible for regular reporting to the Board. The H&S Group’s remit is carried out in
accordance with the Health and Safety at Work Act 1974 and all other relevant health & safety statutory
provisions and approved codes of practice.
The H&S Group has adopted the principles contained in the Health and Safety Executive guidance (HSG65)
“Managing Health and Safety”, which includes the following specific requirements:
 the establishment of a formal written policy;
 the establishment of a communication system with staff;
 the ongoing identification of risks and required responses; and
 the ongoing measurement of performance and the continual improvement of process and procedure to
address changing risks.
The H&S Group monitors accidents affecting staff, licensees and contractors, audits the understanding and
application of the H&S policy and procedure by staff and contractors and, in September 2007, provided its annual
report and risk assessment to the Board.
During the year the H&S Group has organised fire warden, first aid and lift evacuation training for office-based
employees. In addition, the H&S Group has reviewed its policy providing guidance for the health and safety of
employees driving on company business and introduced an HSE guidance pack for ‘homeworkers’.

key risk area in our working environment is the health, safety and well-being of employees. Employees work in a
low risk environment. Again there has been no material health and safety issue, incident or fine for non-
compliance during the period under review.
The Environment
The Group recognises its responsibility to achieve good environmental practice and to continue to strive for
improvement in areas of environmental impact. Our approach is to work towards continuous improvement
through education, communication and direct action where applicable.
(i) Carbon Management
The Pub Estate
The Group has established an Environmental Impact Committee with a view to reviewing strategy and
implementing policies to deliver high quality energy services to our pubs, including, in 2007:
 continued promotion of cellar cooling maintenance contracts under which our licensees are able to
utilise highly energy efficient cellar cooling equipment (4,244 pubs are currently under such contracts)
and to target the replacement of 10% of inefficient cellar cooling equipment each year to ensure optimal
energy performance;
 the introduction of a marketing campaign to raise the profile of and promote the benefits of the cellar
cooling maintenance contracts to our licensees; and
 continued focus on piloting and incorporating new technologies to ensure optimal energy performance of
cellar cooling equipment.
As reported in 2006 the Group adopted the Carbon Trust’s 5-Step Carbon Management approach across its
operations, including our head office and the pub estate to accelerate the integration of carbon issues
throughout the Group and address our short, medium and long-term climate impacts. During the year we
appointed LowC Communities Ltd, an external consultant, to provide the necessary skills and expertise to elevate
carbon and energy to the forefront of our business thinking.
In 2006 and 2007 we undertook a full carbon analysis of our operations, looking for both environmental and
business benefits. As a result of this work we now have a detailed 3 year implementation plan which will be
progressively rolled out throughout the business commencing in 2008.
The Group continues to be supported by the Carbon Trust and LowC to implement a range of measures focused
on our most energy intensive activities, including:
 the piloting of an energy efficient refurbishment programme in the pub estate, whereby a range of energy
efficiency upgrades (primarily to boilers and lighting) will be delivered through our existing supply chains,
delivering significant energy savings. This will encompass:

estate, including extensive maintenance to deliver improved energy efficiency (e.g. efficiency checks,
descaling of hot water heating elements) and to ensure that the installation of all new mechanical plant
carries the green flag efficiency mark to reduce wasted energy use;
 providing advice to licensees on the most beneficial energy contracts through an energy broker who is
also tasked to provide energy reporting methods to the pub estate and promote energy consciousness
and efficiency amongst our licensees;
 the consideration of a focused awareness programme targeting our licensees who will be able to choose
from a range of energy saving improvements for their pub and become involved in their implementation;
and
 undertaking ongoing audits of the pub estate to accurately measure energy efficiency savings and to
monitor and report the progress of the above-mentioned initiatives.
Head Office
During the year an energy audit was undertaken at our head office to highlight the most important activities that
need to be undertaken to reduce carbon emissions and energy costs. This audit tabled a carbon footprint which
showed carbon dioxide emissions were currently 818 metric tonnes of CO
2
, and found that current annual energy
consumption levels for our head office were as follows:
Electricity: 372 kWh/m
2
Gas: 333 kWh/m
2
Total: 705 kWh/m
2
Since the audit we have drawn up an action plan with a detailed list of initiatives that will target annual
reductions of approximately 10% of this carbon footprint over the next 12 months. It is anticipated that further
savings can also be made in future years. These savings will be targeted by the introduction of:
 an energy management programme adopting a formal ‘energy policy’;
 the appointment of an energy manager;
 investment in a monitoring and targeting system;
 implementation of an energy awareness campaign for all employees; and
 energy saving technologies, including a full lighting system upgrade.
In addition, annual water consumption levels for our head office are currently 1,726 m
3
.
The focus for 2008 is to capitalise on the substantial carbon saving opportunities identified in 2007, and to
explore in detail the possibility of introducing an ‘on-site’ renewable energy programme to further reduce our
direct business carbon impacts.
(ii) Other Environmental Issues
At head office materials continue to be recycled where possible and paper is sourced from a renewable and
sustainable source. Upon acquiring the building in 2002, the Group complied with the local planning authority’s
environmental policy relating to the construction, occupation and utilisation of office facilities. This included the
provision of a transport policy aimed at reducing the demand for car parking and promoting employee behaviour
consistent with local planning, environment and social policy. The Group supports home working where
appropriate.

possible biodegradable materials are used in its operation.
During the year, and in accordance with our obligations under the Packaging Waste Regulations, our compliance
manager recycled approximately 4,389 metric tonnes of glass, paper and plastic used in the pub estate by our
licensees.
The Community and Social Issues
The Group believes that the interests of responsible, entrepreneurial pub businesses are substantially aligned
with the interests of local communities and consumers. In this regard, the Group seeks to ensure that its pubs
provide a friendly, safe and controlled environment, and promote the positive contributions that pubs make to
their local communities.
The Group continues to work extensively with licensees, local authorities and local communities to ensure that
licensing hours and conditions are appropriate and take account of the opportunities and interests of all parties.
Through its membership of the BBPA, the Group continues to engage with Government departments within the
Home Office and the Department for Culture, Media and Sport, to promote understanding of, and compliance
with, the licensing regime.
A ban on smoking in public places was introduced across England and Wales in 2007. The Group works
extensively with licensees to provide solutions in pubs which balance the interest of smokers and non-smokers
alike. The Group’s capital investment programme continues to reflect opportunities to enhance the retail
proposition of pubs in the post-ban era.
In addition:
 the Group is committed to high standards of customer service to its licensees and gives serious
consideration to complaints from the local community. Procedures are in place to ensure disputes are
monitored and dealt with quickly;
 training is arranged to provide support to our licensees and to develop business potential;
 the Group has recently revised and updated its Code of Practice (with ‘benchmarked’ status from the BII
Benchmarking and Accreditation Services) under which the Group manages its relationships with
licensees, and includes provisions in its agreements with licensees requiring licensed premises to be
operated in a responsible manner; and
 the Group seeks to ensure that appropriate and reasonable actions have been implemented across the
pub estate to ensure its licensees comply with the Disability Discrimination legislation.
Finally, as a corporate sponsor we continue to support the philosophy and ethos of The Prince of Wales’s
‘Pub is the Hub’ campaign, encouraging rural licensees to diversify and deliver a wider range of services to the
communities they serve, ensuring that the pub becomes the heart of the community and continues to thrive as a
vital part of village life. During the year a number of our licensees have developed a range of such services
including the use of their properties as village shops and post offices.
Responsible Drinking
The irresponsible consumption of alcohol can have detrimental effects on the social structures of local
communities. The Group recognises that pub licensees, supermarkets, off-licences, the Government and the
consumer all have responsibilities as regards the promotion and management of a responsible drinking
environment. We seek to be responsible by the following means:

 through its membership of the BBPA, the Company has actively participated in discussions with
Government in the preparation of its National Alcohol Harm Reduction Strategy;
 continuing to work proactively with local authorities to develop and implement local policies and
strategies which are designed to address the potential consequences of alcohol misuse whilst not
penalising the majority of responsible licensees and their customers; and
 a number of our suppliers have introduced sensible drinking messages on their products.
Future Corporate Responsibility Requirements
During the year the Group has engaged the services of Salta Sustainable with a view to developing a long-term
approach to effective corporate responsibility strategy and the adoption of good reporting practices during the
next two years.
The Board is committed to continuous improvement in its corporate responsibility practices where relevant to its
operations and to build appropriate measures and procedures into its existing risk management and governance
systems.

Accounts and dividends
The Group profit for the year, after taxation, amounted to £291 million (2006 — £325 million) and is dealt with as
shown in the Group Income Statement.
The directors recommend the payment of a final dividend of 10.4 pence (2006 — 9 pence after restating for the
sub-division of shares on 17 January 2007) per ordinary share to be approved at the Annual General Meeting
on 17 January 2008. The final dividend will be paid on 21 January 2008 to members on the register on
28 December 2007. When added to the interim dividend of 5.2 pence (2007 — 4.5 pence after restating for the
sub-division of shares), this produces a total dividend for the year of 15.6 pence (2006 — 13.5 pence after
restating for the sub-division of shares) per ordinary share.
Principal activities and review of the business
The principal activity of the Group continues to be that of a leased and tenanted pub operator in the UK.
A review of the year’s activities is given in the Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s Review
(incorporating the Business Review) on pages 2 to 7.
Directors and their interests
The names of the current directors, together with related biographical information, are set out on pages 13 and
14. All directors served throughout the year and were in place on the date of signing of these financial
statements.
The rules for the appointment and replacement of directors are set out in the Company’s Articles of Association.
Directors are appointed by the Company by ordinary resolution at a general meeting of holders of ordinary shares
or by the Board on the recommendation of the Nominations Committee. The Corporate Governance Report sets
out further details of the requirements for re-election of directors on page 24. In addition, further details of the
workings of the Nominations Committee are set out on pages 25 and 26.
In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company, Mr Tuppen, Mr George, Mr Stewart and Mrs Murray
retire from the Board at the Annual General Meeting by rotation and offer themselves for reappointment. The Board
believes that their performance continues to be effective, that they demonstrate commitment to their roles and
have a range of skills and experience relevant to the direction and control of the Company. In addition, Mr Stewart
and Mrs Murray consider that they have sufficient time to commit to the Company’s affairs notwithstanding their
other business commitments and have no conflicting interests. Whilst Mr Stewart was initially appointed on
29 May 2001 the Board has conducted a rigorous evaluation of his performance and considers that his re-election is
justified and beneficial to the business.
At no time during the year did any of the directors have an interest in any contract with the Group. The interests
of the directors in the share capital of the Company, other than with respect to options to acquire ordinary shares
(which are detailed in the Directors’ Remuneration Report), were as follows:

Subject to meeting certain thresholds, holders of ordinary shares may requisition a general meeting of the
Company or the proposal of resolutions at Annual General Meetings.
Voting rights and restrictions on transfer of shares
On a show of hands at a general meeting of the Company every holder of ordinary shares present in person or by
proxy and entitled to vote has one vote and on a poll every member present in person or by proxy and entitled
to vote has one vote for every ordinary share held. Further details regarding voting at the Annual General
Meeting can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on page 28 and in the notes to the notice of the
Annual General Meeting on pages 120 to 124. Details of the exercise of voting rights attached to the ordinary
shares held by the Employee Share Trusts are set out in the section entitled, ‘Shares held by Employee Share
Trusts’ below. Voting rights for the ordinary shares held in treasury are suspended. None of the ordinary shares,
including the shares held by the Employee Share Trusts, carry any special rights with regard to control of the
Company. Electronic and paper proxy appointments and voting instructions must be received by the Company’s
Registrars not later than 48 hours before a general meeting.
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other than:
 certain restrictions may from time to time be imposed by laws and regulations (for example insider
trading laws);
 pursuant to the Company’s share dealing code whereby the directors and employees of the Company
require approval to deal in the Company’s shares; and
 where a person with at least a 0.25% interest in the Company’s certificated shares has been served with
a disclosure notice and has failed to provide the Company with information concerning interests in those
shares.
The Company is not aware of any arrangements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the
transfer of ordinary shares and for voting rights.
Own shares acquired by the Company
At the Annual General Meeting held on 16 January 2007, the Company was given authority to purchase up to
89,614,002 of its ordinary shares during the next 18 months or until the date of its next AGM. During the
financial year the Company, utilising this authority and the authority given at the AGM on 19 January 2006,
made on market purchases totalling 102,862,096 of its own ordinary shares of 2.5 pence each, representing 17%
of the issued share capital (excluding treasury shares) at the beginning of the year, for an aggregate
consideration of £658 million (excluding costs). These shares were cancelled. As at 30 September 2007,
50,000,000 shares were held in treasury. The maximum number of shares held in treasury during the year ended
30 September 2007 was 50,000,000 on 1 October 2006 for a period of 365 days, representing 7.5% of total
called up share capital at that time. The present authority for the Company to purchase its own shares will expire
at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 17 January 2008. The directors will be seeking a new authority for
the Company to purchase its ordinary shares as part of the planned continuation of the share buy-back
programme. It is expected that any shares purchased pursuant to the share buy-back programme will be
cancelled and the number of shares in issue reduced accordingly. Alternatively, the shares may be purchased and
held as treasury shares. Further details are set out in the explanatory notes to the notice of AGM on pages
120 to 124.
Shares held by Employee Share Trusts
The Company has established an employee benefit trust, the trustee of which is Halifax EES Trustees

awards made under the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans and other share option schemes. The voting rights in
relation to these shares are exercisable by the trustee; however, in accordance with investor protection
guidelines the trustee abstains from voting. The Company has also established a Quest trust to hold shares to

beneficiaries of shares held by these trusts (the ‘trusts’).
The total number of shares held by the trusts at 30 September 2007 was 10,027,700 representing 1.8% of the total
called up share capital at that date. During the year, the Quest Trust purchased 39,839 of the Company’s shares.
These shares were purchased for a consideration of £0.25 million (net of expenses) and had a nominal value of
£995. The maximum number of shares held by the trusts during the year ended 30 September 2007 was

that time.
During the year, 3,478,084 shares with a nominal value of £86,952 were disposed of by the trusts by way of the
exercise of share options under the share schemes. Of these, a total of 1,279,918 shares were disposed of
through the short-term and long-term incentive schemes for a consideration of £18 and a total of 274,561

Articles of Association
The Company’s Articles of Association (adopted by special resolution on 19 January 2006) may only be amended
by special resolution at a general meeting of the shareholders. At the Annual General Meeting to be held on
17 January 2008, a resolution will be put to shareholders proposing the adoption of new Articles of Association.
A summary of the principal proposed changes can be found in the explanatory notes to the notice of Annual
General Meeting on pages 120 to 124.
Significant agreements
The Company has entered into supply and distribution contracts with Scottish & Newcastle UK Limited and InBev
UK Limited which are terminable upon a change of control of the Company.
In addition, the Company is a party to certain funding documents which contain provisions that allow the
counterparties to terminate funding to the Company in certain circumstances where there has been a change of
control of the Company. These include:
 The second supplemental credit agreement (the “Credit Agreement”) dated 15 May 2006 between the
Company and the financial institutions named in the Credit Agreement which provides that if any person
or persons acting in concert gains control of the Company, the Company must promptly notify the agent
and the lenders must then negotiate with the Company with a view to continuing the loan facilities
under the Credit Agreement. If at the end of the required time frame, the Company has not received a
notice of continuance of the loan facilities from the lenders, the loan facilities will be terminated and all
of the loan commitments cancelled under the Credit Agreement.
 The £60 million 6% Secured Bonds due 2014, the £125 million 6.875% Secured Bonds due 2025, the
£125 million 6.875% Secured Bonds due 2021, the £275 million 6.375% Secured Bonds due 2031, the
£600 million 6.5% Secured Bonds due 2018 (collectively the “Secured Bonds”), the terms and conditions
of each of which provide that following the occurrence of a restructuring event (defined in the terms and
conditions to include (i) any person or persons acting in concert becoming interested in more than 50%
of the shares of the Company, (ii) any person or group of connected persons acquiring control of the
Company, or (iii) any person or persons acquiring the right to appoint more than 50% of the directors of
the Company) the Secured Bonds must, if they are not rated, after a written resolution of the
bondholders, be either redeemed by the Company or the Company must successfully seek an investment
grade rating for the Secured Bonds. If the Secured Bonds are rated, on a restructuring event, they must be
redeemed by the Company where such rating is below investment grade or later falls below investment
grade.

duty or breach of trust in relation to the Company. No such indemnities have been granted.
Employment policies
The Group is dependent on the skills and commitment of its employees and recognises the importance of
creating a workplace in which all employees are inspired and enabled to give their best. A core set of common
values means that employees at all levels of the business are encouraged to make the fullest possible
contribution as their performance is central to the successful delivery of its objectives. To attract and retain these
skills the Group is committed to equal opportunities and the creation of an entirely non-discriminatory and
diverse working environment. The aim of the policy is to ensure that no job applicant or employee receives less
favourable treatment because of, amongst other matters, gender, marital status, race, age, sexual preference,
religion, belief or disability. All decisions are based on the merit of the individual concerned. The Group is
dedicated to undertaking its business operations in a way which respects individual human rights, treats

employment under normal terms and conditions and to provide training and career development and promotion
to disabled employees wherever appropriate.
The Group’s employment policies and procedures are described in detail in a Staff Handbook which is provided to
all employees upon joining the Group. The Staff Handbook is regularly reviewed and updated to take account of
relevant employment legislation and best practice, and new policies and procedures are developed if required.
These include specific policies on equal opportunities, flexible working, training and development, acceptance of
gifts and hospitality and whistle-blowing.
The Group has systems in place to comply with the Data Protection Act 1998 to ensure the privacy of personal

Employee involvement and reward
The Group actively encourages learning and development and believes that effective training is essential to the
maintenance and improvement of the Group’s success and individual performance. The Group is committed to
providing all employees with relevant training to meet the business needs of the Group and to improve
individual employee skills. In providing this training and support we expect high standards and commitment in
return. All employees are provided with initial induction training and are set challenging personal objectives and
participate in discretionary bonus schemes.
The Group operates a comprehensive employee appraisal process which ensures that clear goals are set, personal
objectives are monitored, key competencies are assessed and any performance concerns addressed through
appropriate training and focus. Every employee has the opportunity to discuss work-related aspirations and
participate in appropriate training and development programmes.
During the year continued emphasis has been placed on effective communication regarding matters which may
affect employees and the overall performance and development of the Group. The policy of providing employees
with information about the Group has continued. Employee engagement is met through a variety of means

information and ideas via publications such as the ‘Innsider’ and ‘Eagle Eye’. Employees can also ask the
executive management team questions on an anonymous basis via the ‘Ask the Exec’ forum. In addition, an
annual conference is held to which all employees are invited and provides an opportunity for employees to be
made aware of key objectives and strategy. The use of email and the corporate intranet supplement effective
communication to all employees.
The Company continues to encourage employee ownership of its shares through the provision of the following
employee share plans administered by HBOS Employee Equity Solutions:
 The Save As You Earn Scheme in which 282 employees have entered into savings contracts for either five
or seven years at the end of which they are entitled to purchase shares at a discount of 20% to the
market price of the shares at the time of the issue of the options.
 The Share Incentive Plan in which 299 employees have purchased shares out of pre-tax income up to
statutory limits which are held in a trust. Currently, the Company awards one free matching share for
each share bought by an employee.
In November 2006 the Company won two awards from ifs Proshare for its Share Incentive Plan for ‘Best New
Share Plan’ and ‘Most Effective Communication of an Employee Share Plan — up to 1,000 employees’. These
awards demonstrate the Company’s commitment to encouraging employee share ownership and reward.
Charitable and political donations
At pub level, the Company supports local community initiatives and charitable causes through the appropriate
use of marketing investment. The Company does not make any corporate charitable donations. The Company has
not made any political donations during the year and intends to continue its policy of not doing so for the
foreseeable future.

The Group and the Company agrees terms and conditions for its business transactions with suppliers. Payment is
then made in accordance with these terms, subject to the terms and conditions being met by the supplier.

The Board recognises that good governance helps the business deliver its strategy, generate long-term
shareholder value and minimise risk. For the year under review the appropriate governance provisions are as set
out in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance adopted by the Financial Reporting Council in July 2003
(the “Combined Code”).
The Company is committed to maintaining high standards of corporate governance as set out in the Combined
Code provisions, the Turnbull Report on Internal Control and appropriate best practice guidance issued by
investor bodies. Our corporate governance framework is directed in a manner which is responsible and in
accordance with high standards of honesty, transparency and accountability. The Board considers that this
statement on governance provides the information to enable shareholders to evaluate how the provisions and
principles of the Combined Code have been applied.
Statement by the directors on compliance with the Combined Code
The Board is responsible for the policies and controls put in place to discharge the Company’s responsibilities
under the Combined Code. These include, for example, a sound system of internal controls and risk management
procedures designed to ensure the Company’s policies achieve compliance.
Throughout the year ended 30 September 2007 the Company has been in full compliance with the provisions set
out in Section 1 of the Combined Code and the principles of good governance.
The Company has also complied with the Smith Guidance on Audit Committees.
The Workings of the Board and its Committees
The Board
Role
The Board is responsible to the Company’s shareholders for the success of the Group and for its overall strategic
direction, its values and its governance. It provides the leadership necessary to enable the business objectives to
be met whilst ensuring the obligations to its shareholders are safeguarded.
Composition
For the year under review the Board comprised the Chairman, three executive directors and three independent
non-executive directors. The role of Chairman and Chief Executive are distinct and separate and clear divisions of
accountability and responsibility have been agreed by the Board, are set out in writing and operate effectively.
During the year the Board has again reviewed its composition and has concluded that its composition fully
satisfies the requirements of the business and ensures proper governance of the Group. There were no changes
to the membership of the Board during the year.
The Chairman, Mr H V Reid, has primary responsibility for leadership of the Board, sets its agenda and devotes
such time to his role as is necessary to properly discharge his duties. He facilitates the effective engagement of
the non-executive directors. He is responsible, jointly with the Chief Executive, for the effective communication
with the Company’s shareholders and representation of the Group externally.
The Chief Executive, Mr G E Tuppen, has executive responsibility for executing the Group’s strategy and
development. He leads the management of the Company in order to optimise long-term shareholder value by
meeting key strategic and financial objectives.
The Board requires that all non-executive directors are free from any relationship with the executive
management that could result in any conflict or affect their independent judgement. The Board recognises that
length of service can impact on the independence of a non-executive director and, having considered this, is
satisfied that all non-executives remain independent in character and judgement for the purposes of the
Combined Code. The Board membership and that of its Committees is designed to ensure that no one individual
or group dominates proceedings and that the wide variety of skills allows effective leadership across the
Company’s business activities.

continue to perform effectively and demonstrate commitment and time to their roles and duties.
In addition, given he is seeking re-election for a third three year term and in compliance with provision A.7.2 of
the Combined Code, the Board has rigorously reviewed the performance of Mr A J Stewart and concluded that his
re-election is justified and beneficial to the business.
Biographical details of the Board members are set out on pages 13 and 14.
Operation of the Board
The Company has an effective Board which leads and controls the Company and is responsible to the
shareholders for its proper management and its success. The Board therefore provides entrepreneurial leadership,
sets and monitors the Company’s strategic aims, reviews management performance and examines major capital
expenditure and acquisition opportunities.
The Board has established, and reviewed during the year, guidelines requiring that specific matters are reserved
for a decision by the full Board. This ensures that the Board maintains control over strategic, major financial and
key operational issues. Such matters include, for example, the approval of financial statements, material
acquisitions and disposals of assets, risk management and governance policies. All meetings of the Board are
structured to allow open discussion by all directors and ensure full participation in the decision-making process.
Meetings and Attendance
The Board held six scheduled meetings in the past year and is expected to hold a similar number of such
meetings over its next financial year. The Board can convene additional meetings as necessary to consider
matters that are time critical. In addition two separate Strategic Business Reviews are held ‘off site’ annually at
which high level strategic issues, such as future business direction and its financial and operational implications,
are reviewed and debated. These Strategic Business Reviews have a strong operational focus and also give the
Board the opportunity to hear contributions from the senior management team. All of the current directors
attended all Board Meetings and the Strategic Business Reviews during the year.
Non-executive directors and the Senior Independent Director
The non-executive directors complement the skills and experience of the executive directors and bring an
independent judgement to the decision-making process at Board and Committee level. Their role requires a time
commitment in the order of 15 days per annum plus additional time as necessary to properly discharge their
duties. In terms of commitments outside of the Company, any material changes must be reported to and pre-
cleared with the Chairman.
The Company has appointed a Senior Independent Director whose role and responsibilities are clearly defined,
set out in writing and agreed by the Board. The Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they
have any concerns that cannot be resolved through contact via normal channels.
In compliance with the Combined Code the Senior Independent Director met with the other non-executives
during the year to discuss matters in a forum that did not include executive directors or the Chairman. In
addition, all of the non-executives including the Chairman met twice during the year without the executive
directors being present to discuss in detail the matters which they believed to be relevant for the purposes of
the Strategic Business Reviews, including key operational and financial issues, performance of the Chief
Executive and overall feedback arising from the performance evaluation process.
Information and Training
The Board and its committees are supplied with full and timely information which enables the proper discharge
of their responsibilities.
All directors have access to the services of the Company Secretary and may take independent professional
advice at the Company’s expense. There is a formal written procedure concerning independent professional
advice setting out clear guidelines which have been agreed by the Board. The Company has arranged appropriate
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance to provide cover in the event of legal action against its directors.

14414 06/12/2007 Proof 6
14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:38  Page 23 The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the Board and its committees and is responsible for advising the
Chairman on matters of corporate governance, ensuring the good flow of information to the Board and its
committees and between the non-executives and senior management. The written responsibilities of the
Company Secretary are available on the Company’s website. During the year the Board has reviewed the joint
roles of Mr D C George as Chief Financial Officer and Company Secretary. As the Deputy Company Secretary
reports direct to the Board and Chairman on governance issues, has full day-to-day responsibility for the
Company Secretariat function within the Group and provides independent counsel to the non-executive directors,
the Board is of the view that given this delegation of responsibilities that there is no compromise to the
independence of the Company Secretary.
All new directors receive an appropriately tailored induction programme arranged to develop their knowledge
and understanding of the Group and the key business issues, including social, environmental and ethical issues.
The training needs of each director are regularly reviewed and assessed by the Board. Existing directors
undertake such professional development as is necessary for them to carry out their duties as directors. During
the year the directors have, amongst other matters, received appropriate guidance on the material provisions of
the Companies Act 2006 and the implications for periodic financial reporting under the Transparency Directive.
Re-election of directors
The Articles of Association of the Company require that any newly appointed directors will be subject to election
at the next following Annual General Meeting and also that at least one-third of directors (excluding those
appointed to the Board during the year) shall retire by rotation each year. This is applied so that each director
will submit themselves for election or re-election at regular intervals and at least once every three years.
The Board has determined that re-election of the Chairman and non-executive directors is not automatic and is
subject to formal review and recommendation by the Nominations Committee and approval by Shareholders.
Board Committees
In order to ensure effective leadership and governance the Board governs through clearly identified committees
which have delegated powers to deal with specific aspects of the Company’s affairs. A summary of the operation
of these committees is set out below. All committees of the Board that are subject to the requirements of the
Combined Code are chaired by an independent director or have a majority of independent directors as members.
The names and biographical details of all Board Committee members are set out on pages 13 and 14.
The Audit Committee
The Board’s obligation to establish formal and transparent arrangements for considering how it should apply
financial reporting and internal control principles and for maintaining an appropriate relationship with the
Company’s external auditors is met through the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr D A Harding who has current and relevant financial experience. The
Committee’s other members are Mr A J Stewart and Mrs S E Murray. All members are independent. The
Committee met three times during the year to coincide with the financial reporting and audit cycles of the
Company including the submission of the interim and annual financial statements. All Committee members
attended each meeting during the year. Representatives from the external auditors, the Chairman, Chief
Executive and Chief Financial Officer were in attendance at part or all of each meeting by invitation. As a matter
of best practice the Committee is able to meet alone with external auditors as required at the end of its
meetings.
The Committee has terms of reference which are set out in writing and agreed by the Board and are in
accordance with the recommendations set out in the Combined Code. These are available on the Company’s
website.
The Committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of financial matters including the interim and annual
accounts prior to their submission to the Board, and monitoring the controls which are in force to ensure the
integrity of the financial information reported to shareholders. The Committee advises the Board on the

The Committee has also been concerned to ensure that the appropriate standards of governance, reporting and
compliance are being met. The Company has in place a whistle-blowing policy under which employees may, in
confidence, raise concerns about possible improprieties in such matters as financial reporting.
For the year under review the Committee:
 has monitored the integrity of the financial statements, interim and final report and accounts and
relevant regulatory announcements;
 reviewed the adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards in the parent company accounts;
 agreed the annual audit plan, has considered external auditor reports and has monitored and followed up
management actions in response to issues raised;
 met regularly with management and with internal and external auditors to review the effectiveness of
internal controls and business risk management and is satisfied that proper and satisfactory internal
controls remain in place to identify and contain business risk;
 reviewed and monitored the independence and objectivity of external auditors;
 updated a formal written policy for the engagement of auditors for non-audit services, which includes
appropriate safeguards; and
 carried out an annual evaluation of its performance.
The Committee has adopted a policy on the engagement of external auditors for the provision of non-audit
services and reviews this annually.
The policy is designed to:
 ensure that the engagement does not impair the objectivity of the auditors’ opinion on the Group
financial statements;
 establish a transparent process and reporting to enable the Committee to monitor policy compliance; and
 avoid unnecessary restrictions on the engagement of auditors for non-audit services where the provision
of advice is of a higher quality and more cost-effective than other providers.
The policy covers the type of services permitted including:
 advice and assurance work regarding direct and indirect tax matters including tax compliance;
 due diligence investigations related to potential acquisitions and disposals; and
 accounting advice and reviews of accounting standards.
The Committee is confident that in reviewing the external auditors’ Annual Audit Results Report the objectivity
and independence of the auditors are not impaired by the provision of non-audit services. This report includes a
statement confirming compliance by the auditors with the Auditing Practices Boards Ethical Standard 5 (‘Non-
Audit services provided to audit clients’). The Committee is satisfied that such non-audit work is best handled by
them due to knowledge of the Group. The Committee aims to have non-audit work carried out in a manner that
affords full value for money and considers it appropriate for commercial and practical reasons, including
confidentiality, to use the external auditors for certain non-audit services. The amount of non-audit fees charged
by auditors is disclosed in note 6 to the accounts.
The Nominations Committee
The Committee is chaired by Mr H V Reid and its members are the Chief Executive, Mr G E Tuppen and the three
non-executive directors Mr A J Stewart, Mr D A Harding and Mrs S E Murray.

nominates, for approval by the Board, candidates for appointment to the Board, having regard to its balance
and structure. The Committee is also responsible for succession planning and takes into account the knowledge
and skills mix required by the Board in the future. The Committee meets as required and met twice during the
year when all Committee members attended. The Committee seeks the advice of external recruitment
consultants as necessary and follows a formal and transparent procedure to ensure that new appointments
comply with the principles set out in the Combined Code and satisfy the needs for the balance of the Board.
Any appointments are based on merit and against objective criteria, including the time available to, and the
commitment which will be required of, the potential director.
The Committee has terms of reference which are set out in writing and agreed by the Board and are in
accordance with the recommendations set out in the Combined Code to ensure that no director is involved in
discussions regarding his or her own succession. These terms of reference are available on the Company’s
website. The individual terms and conditions of appointment of directors can be inspected during normal office
hours at the Company’s registered office and at the Annual General Meeting.
During the year in review the Committee:
 reviewed the plan for the retirement of directors by rotation;
 reviewed the framework and the proposed timetable for succession planning for executive and non-
executive appointments; and
 carried out an annual evaluation of its performance.
The Remuneration Committee
The Committee is chaired by Mr A J Stewart and its members are the two other non-executive directors Mr D A
Harding and Mrs S E Murray. The Committee is responsible for determining the contract terms, remuneration
and other benefits of the executive directors and senior management, including performance related bonus
schemes and the Chairman’s fee. The remuneration of the non-executive directors is set by the Board.
The Committee appoints external remuneration consultants and advisers as necessary to provide remuneration
services and advice to the Remuneration Committee and the Company. The Committee met on five occasions
during the year and all Committee members were in attendance.
The Committee has terms of reference which are set out in writing and agreed by the Board and are in accordance
with the recommendations set out in the Combined Code. These are available on the Company’s website.
The responsibilities of the Committee, together with an explanation of how it applies the principles set out in
the Combined Code, are set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report which includes details of directors’
remuneration and directors’ interests in options, together with information on service contracts, and is set out
on pages 30 to 39.
During the period in review the Committee:

The Board has delegated, within agreed terms of reference, responsibility for certain matters of a routine nature
which are not reserved for full Board consideration to a Finance Committee. This Committee comprises two
executive directors, one of which must be the Chief Financial Officer. In addition and to ensure full compliance
with its obligations under the Disclosure Rules published by the UK Listing Authority, the Company has
established a Disclosure Committee comprising the Chairman, Chief Executive and Chief Financial Officer to
maintain adequate procedures, systems and controls to enable it to make timely and accurate disclosure of
information via a regulatory news service when it is impracticable to hold a full Board meeting. A separate
Monitoring Committee has been established to monitor compliance with UK Listing Principles including a
policy based on the Model Code which cover the dealings in securities and applies to directors, persons
discharging managerial responsibility and employee insiders.
Performance evaluation
Principle A.6 of the Combined Code provides that the Board should undertake a formal and rigorous annual
evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and individual directors. During the year the
Company has internally undertaken a critical self assessment performance evaluation programme in
accordance with this principle and has effectively evaluated the Board, its Committees and its individual
directors, including the Chairman.
Board performance evaluation
The process was led by the Chairman and all directors completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to
score a number of performance criteria. The results of these questionnaires are compiled into a report by the
Deputy Company Secretary and the Chairman presented the findings to the Board. This year’s review found that
the Board’s performance continues to be effective and appropriate for the needs of the business. In addition,
the more operational stance taken at the Strategic Business Reviews provided valuable input into future
business development and was welcomed by the Board.
Board Committee performance evaluation
For the Board Committee performance evaluation process each Committee Chairman and Committee member
completed a questionnaire in which they were asked to score a number of performance criteria. The results of
these questionnaires were compiled into a report by the Deputy Company Secretary and the Chairman
presented the findings to the Board. This year’s review found that the Committees continued to fully support
the Board, were of the right size and structure and concluded that the Committees fully utilised the overall
working relationships and discussions between members.
Non-executive director performance evaluation
This process was led by the Chairman and all non-executive directors completed a self-appraisal questionnaire
in which they were asked to score a number of performance criteria. Each non-executive director then met on a
confidential basis with the Chairman to review their questionnaire and to discuss matters in detail including
any matters arising from the evaluation of the Board and Committee performance. In addition, the Senior
Independent Director met with the other non-executives without the Chairman being present to review the
Chairman’s performance.
Executive director performance evaluation
This process was led by the Chief Executive and all executive directors completed a self-appraisal questionnaire
and were asked to score a number of performance criteria. Each executive director then met on a confidential
basis with the Chief Executive to review the questionnaire and to discuss matters in detail. Each executive
director is also set challenging performance objectives. The successful achievement of these objectives makes
up part of the short-term incentive criteria under the Annual Bonus Plan 2005.
Shareholder relations
The Board places considerable importance on maintaining clear communications with its stakeholders to
ensure a mutual understanding of its objectives and has a continuing dialogue with institutional investors to

meetings, presentations after the preliminary announcement for the year and the results for the half year and
specific analyst presentations with feedback from the Company’s brokers as necessary.
The Chairman is responsible for ensuring, via the Company Secretary, that views of major shareholders are fed
back to the Board on a regular basis. The effectiveness of how shareholder views are communicated forms part
of the annual Board performance evaluation process. During the year information about the progress of the
Company, including reports, regulatory announcements released through the London Stock Exchange and
presentations, is made available simultaneously on its website so that shareholders have full access to material
information. Directors regularly receive copies of analyst reports and reports on movements in major
shareholdings as well as key broker comments.
The Annual General Meeting, held in January each year, is the principal opportunity to encourage participation
by private investors and procedures at such meetings are in accordance with the Combined Code. The
Chairmen of the Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees are available at the Annual General
Meeting to answer questions. Details of the resolutions to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting on
17 January 2008 can be found in the Notice of the meeting on pages 116 to 119. The Notice is sent by first
class post to Shareholders at least 20 working days before the Annual General Meeting and details of proxy
votes for and against are made available after the result of hand votes. In accordance with the Combined Code
the Company has proposed in the Notice separate resolutions on each substantial matter. Again this year the
Company is, in line with relevant guidelines, offering shareholders a facility for electronic proxy voting and
voting through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service. The voting results are announced on the same
day to the London Stock Exchange and on the Company’s website.
The Company has adopted, pursuant to good investor practice, innovative ways of communicating with
shareholders and has given shareholders the opportunity to register and receive shareholder communications,
such as the report and accounts, the interim report and notices of meetings, electronically via the Internet
rather than in paper form through the post. In accordance with the new provisions introduced in the Companies
Act 2006 and good environmental practice, the Company is seeking shareholder approval at the Annual
General Meeting to expand the use of electronic and website communications in the future.
Finally the Company’s Registrars, Computershare Investor Services PLC, deal with a wide range of investor
queries on behalf of shareholders. Details of additional shareholder services are set out on page 115.
Internal Control
The Board is responsible for the overall system of internal control for the Group and for reviewing its
effectiveness. It carries out such a review at least annually covering all material controls including financial,
operational and compliance controls and risk management systems.
An ongoing process on internal control has been established for identifying, evaluating and managing risks
faced by the Group. This process is reviewed regularly by the Board and, with advice from its Audit Committee,
is satisfied that this meets the requirements of the guidance ‘Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the
Combined Code’ issued by the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales in 1999 and the
Turnbull guidance. The risk management process and systems of internal control are designed to manage rather
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives. It should be recognised that such
systems can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. This
process has been in place since the start of the financial year and up to the date of approval of the accounts.
The key procedures which the directors have established with a view to providing effective internal control are
as follows:
 Regular Board meetings to consider a schedule of matters reserved for directors’ consideration.
 The Board carries out an annual review of corporate strategy which includes a review of risks facing the
business, and how these risks are monitored and managed on an ongoing basis within the organisation.
This process is regularly reviewed by the Board.

appraisals are conducted and are reviewed by the Board.
 The Audit Committee of the Board, comprising non-executive directors, considers significant financial
control matters as appropriate.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason they continue to adopt the going
concern basis in preparing the accounts.

Remuneration Committee and advisers
The Company’s Remuneration Committee (the ‘Committee’) is composed entirely of independent non-executive
directors and is chaired by Mr A J Stewart, its other members being Mr D A Harding and Mrs S E Murray. No
member of the Committee has any personal financial interest in the matters being decided. Mr H V Reid and Mr
G E Tuppen attend meetings at the invitation of the Committee if necessary except when their own remuneration
is being discussed.
The Committee’s key objectives are to:
 Determine and recommend to the Board, within agreed terms of reference, an overall remuneration
package for executive directors.
 Monitor the level and structure of remuneration for senior management.
The Committee has been constituted and operated throughout the year in accordance with the provisions of
Schedule A and B of the Combined Code. This report also complies with Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985
which incorporates the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002.
During the year the Committee and the Company has continued to use the services of Ernst & Young LLP (E&Y)
who have provided specific advice (not regarding remuneration) on matters relating to share schemes and the
Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans (and who were appointed by the Committee for this purpose). E&Y are the
Group’s auditors and also provide advisory services in respect of non-audit matters and taxation. In addition, the
Committee has sought advice relating to directors’ remuneration and the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan 2005
from New Bridge Street Consultants LLP (who were appointed by the Committee and who provide no other
services to the Company save in respect of advice in connection with the operation of the Company’s incentive
schemes and executive remuneration more generally).
The Committee, amongst other matters, determines the level of awards made under the Company’s incentive
plans, considers feedback from shareholders and undertakes an annual review of its effectiveness.
When setting the remuneration of the executive directors, due regard is given by the Committee to pay and
conditions elsewhere in the Group.
Remuneration Policy — Executive Directors
The Remuneration Committee’s policy is designed to ensure that the level and structure of remuneration
arrangements allows the Company to attract, retain and motivate the exceptional individuals required to continue to
enhance shareholder value. Base salaries will be set accordingly, with a significant proportion of executive directors’
remuneration performance related so that appropriate levels of reward are available for outstanding performance. In
addition, the Committee is, at all times, mindful of remuneration practices in other relevant companies.
To achieve this, the remuneration package comprises:
 Fixed elements: comprising basic salary, benefits and pensions.
 Performance related elements: comprising short-term performance related cash and deferred share
bonuses and long-term incentive arrangements satisfied by the award of shares.
It is the Committee’s policy that the performance related elements of the package should equate to around two-
thirds of total remuneration for the executive directors based on an on-target, expected value approach to
valuing the package.
The Committee believes that these performance related incentive arrangements provide rewards which reflect an
appropriate balance between individual and Group performance and align the rewards to executive directors with
the long-term interest of shareholders. Share-based awards are satisfied by the use of existing shares held by an
Employee Benefit Trust.

14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:38  Page 30 The details of individual components of the remuneration package and service contracts are as follows:
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salary is a fixed cash sum payable monthly. The basic salary and benefits are reviewed annually against
appropriate comparators and taking account of individual performance. Benefits principally comprise car
allowances or the use of a motor car, fuel and private medical insurances. In determining the basic salary for the
executive directors the Committee takes account of the changes to executive director responsibilities,
benchmark data received from its remuneration advisers and the continuing outstanding performance of the
executives.
Pensions
The pension contributions are amounts equal to 25% of basic salary. The Committee has agreed that from
1 October 2006 G E Tuppen would receive a sum equivalent to 25% of basic salary in lieu of his pension
contributions as a salary supplement (this sum is not included in any bonus or share incentive award
calculations).
Current Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans (the ‘Plans’)
For the year in review the Company had the following relevant Plans:
 At the Annual General Meeting held on 24 January 2002 an ordinary resolution was passed adopting the
Enterprise Inns Incentive Plan 2002 (“the 2002 Plan”). The 2002 Plan provided for participants to earn
non-pensionable cash bonuses and short-term and long-term share incentives.
 At the Annual General Meeting held on 20 January 2005 ordinary resolutions were passed adopting the
Enterprise Inns 2005 Annual Bonus Plan and the Enterprise Inns 2005 Long Term Incentive Plan (“the
2005 Plan”).
The 2005 Plan has replaced the 2002 Plan and no further awards will be made except under the 2005 Plan.
Further details of the Plans are set out below.
Short-term share incentives under the 2002 Plan
Under the terms of the 2002 Plan (under which awards were last made for the financial year 2003/04), the
short-term incentive depended upon achievement of annual growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI. There
was a one year performance period for awards. No short-term award was made unless adjusted EPS growth
exceeded RPI by at least 2.5% over the performance period. To achieve the maximum award of 20% of salary,
adjusted EPS growth must have exceeded RPI by 15%. Awards between the minimum and maximum limits were
calculated on a straight-line basis pro rata to the growth in adjusted EPS between the minimum and maximum
targets. Short-term incentives may not ordinarily be exercised for 36 months after the end of the performance
criteria period and then remain exercisable for a further period of 72 months.
Short-term cash and share incentives under the 2005 Plan
Under the terms of the 2005 Plan (currently in operation) executive directors are eligible to participate in an
annual bonus scheme as determined by the Committee. For the year under review the maximum award level
under the 2005 Plan for the Chief Executive was 100% of salary. For the other executive directors the maximum
award level was 75% of salary.
During the year under review it was agreed that from 1 October 2007 and in line with current market practice for
FTSE 100 peers, these maximum award levels would be increased for the Chief Executive to 125% of salary and
for executive directors to 100% of salary. The Committee is satisfied that this increase in bonus potential is
appropriate given (i) practice amongst other FTSE 100 companies, (ii) the increase in bonus opportunity further
strengthens the link between executives’ pay and performance and (iii) the deferred share element of the short-
term incentive (described more fully below). In addition, the Committee has taken account of this increase in
bonus opportunity when determining the targets that are to apply to short-term incentive awards in the
forthcoming year.

14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:38  Page 31 Awards under the 2005 Plan are subject to demanding Company performance targets such that no less than 75%
of an executive’s bonus will be subject to a sliding scale of challenging annual adjusted EPS growth targets, with
no more than 25% subject to challenging personal targets. 60% of any bonus earned will be paid in cash, with
the remaining 40% deferred into shares (a Deferred Share award). Deferred Share awards may not ordinarily be
exercised for 36 months after the end of the performance criteria period and then remain exercisable for a further
period of 6 months. Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are calculated on a straight-line basis
pro rata to the growth in adjusted EPS between the minimum and maximum targets.
The cash bonus awards for the year are shown in the remuneration table on page 35.
Long-term share incentives under the 2002 Plan
Under the 2002 Plan, awards of ordinary shares were made to participants upon achievement of compound
growth in adjusted EPS measured against RPI over 3 years (the final such award under the 2002 Plan was made
for the financial year 2003/04). To qualify for any award, adjusted EPS growth must have exceeded RPI over a
three year period by 5% compound (15.8% simple), and to qualify for the maximum award of 100% of salary
(averaged over a three year period), adjusted EPS growth must have exceeded RPI over a three year period by
20% compound (72.8% simple). Awards between the minimum and maximum limits are calculated on a straight-
line basis pro rata to the growth in adjusted EPS between the minimum and maximum targets. Long-term
incentives may not ordinarily be exercised until 24 months after the end of the performance criteria period and
then remain exercisable for a further period of 108 months.
Long-term share incentives under the 2005 Plan
Under the 2005 Plan (which is currently in operation), long-term incentive awards have two elements:
 an award of Performance Shares (worth up to 150% of salary each year); and
 an award of Matching Shares linked to the co-investment of up to 25% of salary in ‘Investment Shares’,
which are then matched on a 2:1 basis.
Shares that can count as Investment Shares are:
 shares subject to the Deferred Share Award under the 2005 Plan; and
 shares acquired by participants using their cash bonus or other funds, up to the 25% of salary maximum.
Performance Share and Matching Share awards vest subject to the satisfaction of a sliding scale of average
compound annual adjusted EPS growth targets and the Company’s TSR performance against the FTSE 100. More
specifically, for awards made under the 2005 Plan in the past and (it is currently intended) in the future, one-half
of an award will be subject to a performance condition based on average compound annual adjusted EPS growth.
This EPS based condition will measure the Company’s average compound annual adjusted EPS growth by
comparing the Company’s adjusted EPS for the year prior to the date of grant (the “base year”) with the adjusted
EPS for the third financial year following the base year, such that awards will vest as follows:
Level of match under the relevant
Percentage of relevant portion of Matching Share Award
Average compound portion of Performance Share (Matching Award Shares:
annual adjusted EPS growth Award that vests Investment Shares)
Less than 7% 0% 0:1
7% 20% 0.4:1
15% 100% 2:1
Straight-line vesting will occur if average compound annual adjusted EPS growth is between 7% and 15%.
Directors’ Remuneration Report

14414 06/12/2007 Proof 6 144
14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:38  Page 32 The remaining half of the award will be subject to a TSR condition which compares the Company’s TSR
performance over the three year period commencing on the date of grant with the TSR of the FTSE 100 (as at
the date of grant) as follows:
Level of match under the relevant
Percentage of relevant portion of Matching Share Award
Company’s TSR ranking v portion of Performance Share (Matching Award Shares:
the FTSE 100 Award that vests Investment Shares)
Below median 0% 0:1
Median 20% 0.4:1
Upper quintile 100% 2:1
Straight-line vesting will occur if the Company’s TSR ranking is between median and upper quintile.
All awards vest in three equal tranches on the third, fourth and fifth anniversaries of grant and remain
exercisable for a further period of 6 months.
TSR will be calculated by averaging the Net Return Index of each company over the six month period prior to
grant and vesting, unless the Committee determines that a shorter or longer period is a more appropriate way of
ensuring that the condition constitutes a fair measure of the Company’s TSR performance over the period.
In addition, irrespective of the Company’s TSR performance, no part of this portion of the award will vest unless
the Company’s adjusted EPS grows by at least 10% over the performance period, unless the Committee believes
that it is inappropriate to apply this underpin.
For the avoidance of doubt, if both the threshold TSR hurdle of median performance against the FTSE 100 and
the threshold adjusted EPS growth hurdle of 7% average compound annual adjusted growth are met, 20% of the
total award will vest.
The Committee believes that these performance conditions are appropriate for the following reasons:
 the adjusted EPS growth targets will encourage the executive team to deliver substantial annual adjusted
EPS growth over the three year performance period; and
 the TSR targets will require the Company to deliver returns to shareholders in excess of its FTSE 100
peers.
The Committee will, however, review the appropriateness of these performance conditions (and the operation of
the 2005 Plan as a whole) on a regular basis in light of the Company’s circumstances and prospects. The
Committee will seek independent advice to determine the extent to which the adjusted EPS growth and TSR
targets are met.
Remuneration Policy — Non-Executive Directors
The fees for non-executive directors are determined by the Board within the limits in the Articles of Association.
The non-executive directors are not involved in any discussions or decision about their own remuneration.
The remuneration of the non-executive directors takes the form solely of fees, which are set by the Board having
taken advice on appropriate levels in light of the time commitment and responsibilities of each individual. The
Chairman’s fee is approved by the Board on the recommendation of the Committee.
Service contracts
The Company’s policy is for all executive directors to have a service contract of no fixed term under which they
are entitled to receive twelve months’ notice of termination. There are no special provisions in the executive
directors’ contracts for compensation in the event of loss of office. The Committee would consider the
circumstances of any individual case of early termination and would determine compensation payments
accordingly. A fair but robust principle of mitigation would be applied to the payment of compensation in the
context of professional advice received as to contractual entitlement.
The service contracts of the executive directors include the following terms:

Forward-looking statement
The Committee will keep the existing remuneration arrangements, as detailed in this report, under review during
the next year to ensure that the Company’s reward programmes remain competitive and provide appropriate
incentives.
Performance graph
The graph below shows the TSR, in terms of the change in value (with dividends reinvested) of an initial
investment of £100 on 30 September 2002 in a holding of the Company’s shares against the corresponding TSR
in a hypothetical holding of shares in the companies represented in the FTSE 100 index.
The FTSE 100 Index was selected as it represents a broad equity market index in which the Company is a
constituent member. The graph shows that the Company has outperformed the index over this period.

Notes:
(i) The award is calculated using average salary paid to participants between 1 October 2003 and
30 September 2006. Market value of each share is taken at the start of the incentive period (230.9 pence
as adjusted to take into account the sub-division of ordinary shares from 5 pence to 2.5 pence per share
on 17 January 2007).
(ii) The award is calculated at a maximum of 150% of salary at the start of the performance period as defined
under the 2005 Plan. Market value is calculated on the average share price over the five dealing days
following announcement of the results for the financial year 2003/04 (341.9 pence as adjusted to take
into account the sub-division of ordinary shares from 5 pence to 2.5 pence per share on 17 January
2007). The number of shares that will vest under this award are still subject to the satisfaction of the TSR
condition and approval of the Committee.
(iii) The award is calculated at a maximum of 150% of salary at the start of the performance period as defined
under the 2005 Plan. Market value is calculated on the average share price over the five dealing days
following announcement of the results for the financial year 2004/05 (440.25 pence as adjusted to take
into account the sub-division of ordinary shares from 5 pence to 2.5 pence per share on 17 January
2007).
(iv) The award is calculated at a maximum of 150% of salary at the start of the performance period as defined
under the 2005 Plan. Market value is calculated on the average share price over the five dealing days
following announcement of the results for the financial year 2005/06 (597.7 pence as adjusted to take
into account the sub-division of ordinary shares from 5 pence to 2.5 pence per share on 17 January
2007).
(v) Market value is calculated using the mid market price of the ordinary shares at 30 September 2007 being
£5.92 per share.
The high and low share prices during the year were £7.745 and £5.24 pence respectively.
The fair value of short-term and long-term incentive plans recognised as a cost in the Income Statement during
the year is shown in note 28 to the accounts on page 70.

The consolidated financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2007 were
authorised for issue by the Board on 19 November 2007. Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited company
incorporated and registered in England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union.
Consolidated accounts are drawn up to 30 September each year and adjustments are made to the accounts of the
subsidiaries where necessary to bring the accounting policies used in line with those used by the Group.
The 2006 balance sheet has been adjusted with respect to the treatment of contingent agreements entered into
regarding share buy-backs during the close period. In accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure
and Presentation’ a financial liability has been recognised as the Company has entered into a contingent
agreement with a third party which requires the Company to purchase shares during the close period. We have
restated the Balance Sheet for the comparative periods to recognise the financial liability estimated to have
existed at those dates.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of consideration over the fair value of identifiable assets and liabilities acquired in a
business combination. Goodwill is stated at cost less any impairment. Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for
impairment annually, or more frequently where events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value
may be impaired. On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination
of profit or loss on sale.
Goodwill arising on acquisitions prior to 1 October 1998 was written off against reserves and has not been
reinstated. Any such goodwill is not included in determining any profit or loss on disposal.
Property, plant and equipment
Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords’ fixtures and fittings and other assets are held
at cost. The Group’s licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, is revalued each
year by professionally qualified external valuers and employees who are professionally qualified to carry out such
valuations. Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken directly to the revaluation reserve except
where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset which has previously been recognised as an
expense in the Income Statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken directly to the
revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in
value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their
carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years. Residual value is reviewed at least at
each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlords’ fixtures and fittings are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. The useful economic life of additions
to landlord’s fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis
to write off the total cost less residual value over their useful economic life.
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lower of the remaining lease
term and their useful economic life of 50 years.
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line
basis to residual value.
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.

14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:38  Page 44 1. Accounting Policies (continued)
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment. Where any indications are
identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset
is less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and
value in use. Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the
same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement.
Leases
Leases where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases.
Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of future
minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease payable.
Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis. Lease payments are
apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to obtain a constant rate of interest on
the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged as an expense to the Income Statement.
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as
operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement
over the lease term. The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as
operating leases are classified in the balance sheet as ‘intangible assets: operating lease premiums’ within non-
current assets and are amortised over the lease term.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying value and expected sale proceeds, net of
selling costs. Pubs and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified for
disposal by the Group. They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should be
highly probable. These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease is
actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year. Pubs held for sale are not depreciated and
operating lease intangibles held for sale are not amortised.
Current assets held for sale
Current assets held for sale comprises tenants’ fixtures and fittings and are held at the lower of cost and net realisable
value. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred on disposal.
Repairs and maintenance
Repairs and maintenance expenditure is charged to the Income Statement as incurred.
Financial instruments
i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand. Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months
or less are classified as cash equivalents.
ii) Borrowings
Borrowings which include bank borrowings, syndicated debt finance, debentures, secured bonds and securitised
bonds are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. This method is used
to ensure that the interest charge associated with the debt, combined with the amortisation of the issue costs,
premiums and discounts, represents a constant percentage of the borrowings across the life of the instrument.
iii) Derivative financial instruments
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and these are classified as
derivative financial instruments. Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value on acquisition and are
subsequently restated to fair value at each reporting date. Any change in the fair value of the instruments is
recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting has been adopted. Hedge accounting is only adopted
where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation documentation of the hedging relationship and it
meets the Group’s risk management strategy for undertaking the hedge, and it is expected to be highly effective.

The portion of any change in the fair value of the hedging instrument used in a cash flow hedge which meets the
conditions for hedge accounting and is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity.
Changes in fair value relating to any ineffective portions are recognised in the Income Statement. Hedge
accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair
value of the hedging instrument recognised in equity are kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. In the
case of interest rate swaps, the ‘forecast transaction’ is the payment of interest.
iv) Equity instruments
Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds
received, net of any direct issue costs. The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in Share Capital and the
balance of the net proceeds is recorded in Share Premium.
Net debt
Net debt is the total of all financial assets and liabilities less cash. Underlying net debt is amounts repayable to
banks and other lenders, net of cash retained in the business.
Taxation
The income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred
tax. Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between
the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
No deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of
an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised
amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to
be settled net or simultaneously.
Both current and deferred tax are recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items recognised
directly in equity, in which case the corresponding tax is also recognised in equity. Tax is calculated using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events, it is
probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably
estimated. If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that reflects current
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amount of the provision
would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle the obligation.
Pension obligations
The Group has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees’ own pension plans is charged to the Income
Statement as incurred.
The defined benefit scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits. The net amount
recognised in the balance sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the scheme’s liabilities and the
fair value of the scheme’s assets. This is determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit credit
method. Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit. The net of the expected return on
scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance income or finance costs. Actuarial gains
and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.

Treasury shares
The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until
the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders’ equity. No
gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of
discounts and VAT. Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable. Sales of
beverages are recognised when these goods are delivered to our customers. Rents receivable are recognised on a
straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period
to which the income relates.
Segmental reporting
A business segment is a distinguishable component of an entity that provides a product or service that is subject to
risks and returns that are different to those of other segments. The Group has one business segment, being the
operation of a leased and tenanted pub estate. The Group operates solely within the UK and therefore also has just
one geographical segment.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payments’ and applied its requirements to
those awards granted after 7 November 2002 that were not vested at 1 January 2005.
The Group operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees. Share-based payments
are measured at fair value at the date of award and this value is subsequently updated at each balance sheet date for
management’s best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of equity
instruments that will ultimately vest. The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period by calculating
the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income Statement. A
corresponding entry is made to equity. The fair value of share options is measured using valuation models.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
Operating profit
Operating profit as referred to in the Income Statement is defined as being profit generated from normal trading
activities before interest receivable, finance costs and taxation.
Exceptional items
The Group has elected to classify certain items as exceptional and present them separately on the face of the
Income Statement. Exceptional items are classified as those which are separately identified by virtue of their size
or nature to allow a full understanding of the underlying performance of the Group and include the following:
Exceptional administrative costs
The exceptional item shown within administrative costs relates to restructuring costs.
Net profit on sale of property, plant and equipment
Net profit arising from the sale of property, plant and equipment.
Movements from revaluation of pub estate
Under IFRS any revaluation that causes the book value of a pub to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge in
the Income Statement. If that same pub later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds historic cost, the
increase in value is credited to the Income Statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognised. Where
pubs identified for disposal are written down to ‘fair value less costs to sell’, this write-down is also recognised in
this line. Most of the impact of the annual revaluation exercise is accounted for in equity and recognised in the
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.

Movement in fair value of financial instruments
Under IFRS, the interest rate swaps are revalued to fair value at each Balance Sheet date and the movement is
recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting is adopted. The movement in the fair value of swaps
where hedge accounting is not applied is shown as an exceptional item. Other movements include the unwind of
the share buy-back liability.
Tax
Under IFRS, a deferred tax liability has been recognised on the balance sheet relating to the pub estate. On
transition to IFRS, the Group elected to apply IFRS 3 retrospectively to acquisitions from 1 January 1999. This led
to an increase in goodwill in respect of this deferred tax. As this pre-acquisition liability reduces due to capital
gains indexation relief, a credit is recognised in the Income Statement. This has been classified as an exceptional
tax item due to its size and because it does not relate to any income or expense recognised in the Income
Statement in the same period. All other movements in respect of this deferred tax liability are accounted for in
equity and recognised in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.
The tax effect of all other exceptional items is also included within the exceptional items column in the Income
Statement.
New standards and interpretations
The Company has elected to adopt early IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure’ which is not yet mandatory for
adoption.
A number of other new standards and interpretations were issued by the IASB and IFRC with an effective date after
the date of these financial statements. The following standards which are relevant to the Company are not
expected to have a material impact on the financial statements although the Amendment to IAS 1 may require
some additional disclosure. The effective dates below represent the latest date that the Company will be required
to implement the standard:
 Amendment to IAS 1 — Capital Disclosures — effective from 1 October 2007
 Amendment to IAS 23 — Borrowing Costs — effective from 1 January 2009
 IFRIC 11 — Group and Treasury Share Transactions — effective from 1 October 2007
 IFRS 8 — Operating Segments — effective from 1 January 2009
 IFRIC 14 — The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction —
effective 1 October 2008
Use of accounting estimates and judgements
The Group makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements. Actual results may
differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The estimates and assumptions that have
the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below:
a) Property, Plant and Equipment
Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual
published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (‘RICS’). The valuation is based on market observations
and estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arms length transaction
after proper marketing. Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value and their
market value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub. Further information about the valuation of the
pub estate is provided in note 17 of these accounts.
The Group estimates the useful economic life and residual value of property, plant and equipment (PPE) and these
estimates influence the depreciation charged each year. For details of these estimates, see the detailed accounting
policy for PPE.

b) Testing goodwill for impairment
The Group annually tests whether goodwill has been impaired. The recoverable amount of the cash generating unit
that the goodwill has been allocated to is determined based on value-in-use calculations which require estimating
future cash flows and applying a suitable discount rate. Details of the tests and carrying value of the asset are
shown in note 14.
c) Valuation of interest rate swaps
The Group measures interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date. The swap valuation rates are
derived from the mid point of the zero coupon prevailing at the close of business on the balance sheet date. The
fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract
rate and the valuation rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry date. The calculation
therefore uses estimates of present values and future interest rates.
d) Taxation
Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot
be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Tax benefits are not
recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained. Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a
liability will arise. The Group reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate accounting
treatment.
e) Other
The Group also makes estimations and judgements in the valuation of share-based payments and the pension
liability. However, the value of these items is such that any variation in the estimates used is unlikely to have a
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Share buy-backs in close period
The 2006 Balance Sheet has been adjusted with respect to the treatment of contingent agreements entered into
regarding share buy-backs during the close period. In accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Presentation’
a financial liability has been recognised as the Company has entered into a contingent agreement with a third
party which requires the Company to purchase shares acquired during the close period. The Balance Sheet has
been restated for the comparative period to recognise the financial liability estimated to have existed at that date
of £74 million.

The Group disposed of 769 pubs to Admiral Taverns on 6 September 2006 and its Scottish estate of 137 pubs to
Retail and Licensed Properties Limited on 5 December 2006.
The pubs disposed of generated a total of £2 million of EBITDA before exceptional items in the year ended
30 September 2007 and £40 million in the year ended 30 September 2006.
An analysis of the impact of these disposals on current and prior period EBITDA is set out below, to allow for a

Total finance costs 212 193
The write-off of unamortised issue costs in 2006 resulted from refinancing exercises. This write-off was classified as
exceptional as it is not expected to occur every year and is not part of the cash outflow of servicing the Group’s debt.
The movement in fair value of interest rate swaps arises as a result of the revaluation of the swaps at the balance
sheet date (see note 1).
The total interest charge under the effective interest rate method (which excludes swap fair value movements and
the movement in fair value of the liability for share buy-backs) is £228 million (2006 — £233 million).

The calculation of basic earnings per share is based on earnings of £291 million (2006 — £325 million) and on
545.0 million (2006 — 644.2 million*) shares being the weighted average number of equity shares in issue during
the year after excluding shares held by trusts relating to employee share options and shares held in treasury.
Adjusted earnings per share, which the directors believe reflects the underlying performance of the Group, is
based on earnings adjusted for the effects of exceptional items, net of tax, of £216 million (2006 — £220 million)
and on 545.0 million (2006 — 644.2 million*) shares being the weighted average number of equity shares in issue

Impairment testing
Goodwill acquired via business combinations is tested annually for impairment. For this purpose, the goodwill is
allocated to the pub estate. This represents the lowest level within the Group that goodwill is monitored for
internal management purposes. The impairment test compares the recoverable amount of the cash-generating
unit with its carrying amount. The recoverable amount is determined using a value in use calculation. This
calculation discounts estimated future cash flows using a discount rate of 8% (2006 — 8%).
Future cash flows are estimated using management forecasts of cash flow over a five year period. Each element
of the cash flows beyond this forecast period is extrapolated using a growth rate of 3% (2006 — 3%). The
impairment test did not result in any impairment of goodwill.

Revaluation of property, plant and equipment
With the exception of properties identified for disposal, the Group’s licensed land and buildings were revalued as
at 30 September 2007 by Humberts Leisure Limited and Christie & Co., independent Chartered Surveyors, and by
the internal Head of Estates, Simon Millar MRICS, Chartered Surveyor.
The land and buildings were valued at market value (as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards
‘Red Book’), reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated
by each property capitalised at an appropriate yield. The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases
or tenancies under which the properties are let. Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location,
pub quality and tenure. The valuations are made by reference to market transactions within the UK pub sector.
The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in Enterprise Inns plc have been valued by
Humberts Leisure Limited. The balance of the estate held in Enterprise Inns plc has been valued by the Head of
Estates. The results of this internal valuation have been compared to that of the external valuers. This review
ensured that the results are consistent.
A representative sample of the pubs held by Unique Pub Properties Limited (‘Unique’) has been valued by Christie
& Co. The methods of this valuation have been applied across the rest of the Unique estate on a pub by pub basis
in line with the requirements of the securitisation. The results of both the Unique and Enterprise valuations are
also compared, ensuring consistency.
Pubs identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as ‘non-current assets held for sale’ are held
at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less cost to sell. This fair value is based on the estimated net
realisable disposal proceeds (ERV) which are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to
sell the properties.
If licensed land and buildings had been measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts would be as
follows:
Licensed land

The carrying value of property held under finance leases at 30 September 2007 was £248 million (2006 — £236
million). Additions during the year include £5 million of property held under finance leases (2006 — £3 million).
At 30 September 2007, the Group had entered into contractual commitments to purchase £26 million (2006: £9
million) of property, plant and equipment.

Non-current assets held for sale comprises both freehold and leasehold licensed and unlicensed properties that
have been identified by the Group for disposal as part of the continued improvement in quality of its property
portfolio. Non-current assets held for sale will usually be sold unlicensed for alternative use. The sale of all assets
within this category is expected to be completed within one year of the balance sheet date.
A balance of £1 million (2006 — £1 million) in relation to these pubs is held within the revaluation reserve
representing revaluation surpluses.

Fair values
Bank borrowings, the debenture, bonds and interest rate swaps were valued at fair value as at 30 September by J C Rathbone,
independent valuers. Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rates. The finance lease payables
are valued by calculating the present value of the future minimum lease payments.
The book and fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been analysed into categories as below:

Bank borrowings, corporate bonds and securitised bonds are held at amortised cost. Interest rate swaps are held at fair value and
finance lease payables represents the present value of future minimum lease payments. The liability for close-period share buy-back
contracts represents an estimate of the amount that may be incurred on share buy-backs during the period from 1 October to the date
of the preliminary announcement of results. There is no difference between the book value and the fair value of this provision. Other
categories of financial instruments include trade receivables and trade payables; however, there is no difference between the book
value and fair value of these items.

Interest rate swaps
On 29 September 2006 the Group designated the £350 million swap that expires in September 2011 as an
effective cash flow hedge under IAS 39. This cash flow hedge is hedging future movements in interest rates until
September 2011. As a result, changes in the fair value of the effective portion of this swap are recognised directly
in equity instead of in the Income Statement. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the hedge are
recognised in the Income Statement.
All of the Group’s swaps are in place to hedge cash payments made on the floating rate debt.
The movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps has been accounted for as follows:

Financial instruments and risk
The Group’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise bank loans, a debenture, secured bonds,
securitised bonds and cash. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s
operations. The Group also enters into derivative transactions, specifically interest rate swaps and contracts to
purchase shares in a close period. The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising
from the Group’s sources of finance and meet the objective of the Group’s share buy-back strategy.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. There is no
currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each of
these risks and they are summarised as follows.
Liquidity risk
The Group has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due. The
Group’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of
overdrafts, bank loans, debentures and securitised debt.
This objective is achieved through the following processes:
 Regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function
 Regular review of the Group’s debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile
 Maintenance of undrawn overdraft and bank facilities
 Management of share buy-back programme
At 30 September 2007, the nominal value of the Company’s borrowings (excluding interest rate swaps, liability
for share buy-back contracts and finance lease payables) comprised:
2007 2006
Syndicated and other bank borrowings 27% 13%
Corporate bonds 31% 36%
Securitised bonds 42% 51%

book value of Group debt includes the fair value of the interest rates swaps which is based on discounted cash
flows. The contractual maturity of trade and other payables is within one year. The liability for close-period share
buy-backs will be reversed within one year.
An analysis of minimum lease payments due under finance leases is set out in note 23.

Interest rate risk
The Group borrows its debenture and bonds, except for the A2N bonds, at a fixed rate. Bank debt and the A2N
bonds are borrowed at, and cash balances attract interest at, a floating rate. The Group’s objective is to manage
exposure to changes in interest rates. This exposure is managed by borrowing at fixed rates and using interest
rate swaps acquired with Group companies. At 30 September 2007, the Group’s borrowings were 89% fixed (after
including the impact of interest rate swaps) with a weighted average interest rate of 6.5% for an average of 11
years (2006 — 100% fixed at an average rate of 6.6% for 13 years).
Cash flows associated with cash deposits, debt and interest rate swaps and the fair value of these instruments
fluctuates with changes in interest rates. The effect on the profit for the year would have been as follows if
interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower during the period.

Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Group. The Group is exposed to a small amount of
credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances. The Group’s objective is to
minimise this risk by dealing with third parties with high credit ratings and carrying out credit checks where
appropriate. The amount of trade and other receivables included in the balance sheet are net of a bad debt
provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable accounts and is
based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account collateral held in
the form of cash deposits. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when management
considers that the debt is no longer recoverable. At 30 September 2007 the value of collateral is £30 million
(2006 — £27 million). This balance is held on the balance sheet in ‘other payables’.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below. This provision relates to trade
receivables which are primarily represented by licensees.

There are no trade receivables that are past due at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against.
There are no indications as at 30 September 2007 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect
of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are neither past due nor impaired. The
maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables and the fair value of interest
rate swaps classified as financial assets. The Group’s credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the Group only
invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.
Security
Senior debt finance is secured by a security deed entered into by substantially all of the companies which
comprise the Group, excluding Enterprise Inns Holding Company Limited and its subsidiaries and Unique Pubs
Limited and its subsidiaries. The lenders have a floating charge over all of the assets and undertakings of such
Group companies. The floating charge ranks subsequent to the fixed charges created by the debenture and
secured bonds. The value of assets secured by way of a fixed or floating charge as at 30 September 2007 is —
Property, Plant and Equipment £5,683 million (2006 — £5,317 million), operating lease premiums £19 million
(£24 million) and pubs held for sale £11 million (£10 million).

RetailLink Management Limited (a subsidiary Company) established a pension plan for its employees in January
1999. The plan has defined contribution and defined benefit schemes. The plan is now closed to new members
and for the future accrual of benefits and is administered and accounted for by Enterprise Inns plc. The most
recent full actuarial valuation of the defined benefit section of the plan was at 5 April 2005. This has been
updated to 30 September 2007. The valuation was carried out by Mercer, independent professionally qualified
actuaries, using the projected unit credit method.

Ordinary shares carry no right to fixed income. Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to vote at meetings.
On 17 January 2007 each of the Group’s issued and unissued existing ordinary shares of 5 pence each was sub-
divided into two new ordinary shares of 2.5 pence each.
At 30 September 2007, the Group owned 50 million (2006 — 50 million‡) of its own shares as treasury shares with a
nominal value of £1 million (2006 — £1 million) and a market value of £293 million (2006 — £264 million).
In addition, at 30 September 2007 the Group held 10,027,700 shares with a nominal value of £0.3 million and a
market value of £59 million (2006 — 13,740,506‡ shares, nominal value £0.3 million, market value £72 million).
These shares are held by the Employee Benefit Trust and Enterprise Inns Quest Trustees Limited and are shares
used to satisfy awards made under the Enterprise Inns Incentive Plans and other share option schemes (note 28).
During the year the Group made on market purchases totalling 103 million (2006 — 84 million‡) of its own
ordinary shares for an aggregate consideration of £658 million (2006 — £393 million) (excluding costs). These
shares were cancelled. Transaction costs of £3 million (2006 — £3 million) have been accounted for directly in
equity in the profit and loss reserve.

28. Share-based payments
The Group operates share-based payment schemes for both directors and other employees. Details of the Short-
Term Incentive Plan (STIP) and Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) which form part of the remuneration of the
Executive directors are given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 30 to 39.
The Group also operates an Employee Share Option Scheme (ESOS), a Savings Related Share Option Scheme
(SAYE) and a Share Incentive Plan (SIP).
A total expense of £3 million (2006 — £3 million) has been incurred in the year in relation to share-based
payments. This expense relates wholly to the equity-settled schemes described above.
Share Incentive Plan
The SIP is open to all employees. At times determined by the Company, employees may allocate the lower of
£1,500 and 10% of pre-tax salary to purchase shares out of their salary. The Board may also decide to award
matching shares. The shares are held in trust on behalf of the employee. If shares are removed from trust within
three years, any allocation of matching shares may be lost. Shares can be transferred tax-free to employees after
a period of five years. Matching shares were awarded in 2006 and 2007.
The cost of the matching shares is being spread over the three year vesting period of the scheme.
Details of the number of matching shares held in trust during the year are as follows:
2007* 2006*

Employee Share Option Scheme
The ESOS scheme is open to all employees. Share options are awarded to employees at the discretion of the
Board. The current intention of the Board is to issue options with an exercise price equal to the market value of a
share at grant date. Options will normally vest after 3 years if an employee remains in service and if EPS growth
targets are met. For options granted during the years ended 30 September 2006 and 2007 options will only vest
in full if the average compound annual percentage growth in adjusted EPS between the grant date and the third
anniversary of the grant date is 8.33%. Options may normally only be exercised during the period of 7 years
commencing on the third anniversary of the date of grant of the option. Options will usually be settled by issuing
ordinary shares held by the Employee Benefit Trust.
Details of the share options outstanding during the year are as follows:

Savings-Related Share Option Scheme
The SAYE scheme is open to executive directors and employees at the discretion of the Board. Participants
contract to save a fixed amount each month with a savings institution for a period of five or seven years. At the
end of the savings term, participants are given the option to purchase shares at a price set before the savings
began. The option price will be not less than 80% of the market value of a share on the date that participants are
invited to take part in the scheme, or the nominal value of a share if lower. Options will usually be settled using
ordinary shares held by Enterprise Inns Quest Trustees Ltd (an employee benefit trust) and will usually be
exercisable for six months after the fifth or seventh anniversary of the commencement of the savings contract.

Directors pay £1 to exercise awards granted under the STIP and LTIP. This is a one-off charge. All of the shares
outstanding at 30 September are not yet exercisable.
† The share price at which the number of shares granted under the STIP scheme is calculated is not confirmed
until after the date of the approval of the accounts. The number of STIP shares granted during the year is
therefore estimated using the closing share price on 30 September 2007. The number of shares granted in
2006 has been amended to show the actual number granted in 2006.
‡ Included in the 2006 balance are 81,882* LTIP shares which have not been accounted for under IFRS 2 as they
were granted before 7 November 2002. Such shares are not accounted for under IFRS 2 in line with the
transitional provisions of this standard and of IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption of IFRS’. Awards will only vest in full if
certain performance criteria are met.
The weighted average fair value of shares granted during the year under the STIP was £5.32 (2006 — £4.75*) and
under the LTIP was £5.08 (2006 — £2.95*).
The weighted average share price on exercise of shares and share options under all schemes during the year was

Fair value of share schemes
The fair value of equity-settled share options and share awards granted is estimated at the date of grant using
share option valuation models. The ESOS, SAYE and STIP schemes are valued using the Black-Scholes model. The
element of the LTIP scheme that relates to non-market conditions is valued using the Black-Scholes model. The
element of the LTIP that includes market conditions is valued using the Monte Carlo Simulation Model.
The following tables list the inputs to the models for options and shares granted during the year:
ESOS SAYE
Weighted average: 2007 2006* 2007 2006*
Share price (£) 6.18 4.45 5.84 4.43
Exercise price (£) 6.18 4.45 4.67 3.54

Risk-free interest rate 4.86% 4.31% 4.9% 4.2%
Expected life of option (years) 2–4§4 3–5‡ 3—5‡
Expected share price volatility is based on historic volatility over the same period of time as the vesting period of
the option. The expected life of an option is based on historical data.
The LTIP will only vest in full if a TSR target is met. This is a market condition and the TSR performance criteria
has therefore been taken into account when calculating the fair value of the options granted under the LTIP. These
conditions have been incorporated into the Monte Carlo Simulation model which is used to fair value the TSR
element of the scheme.
* Restated for the sub-division of shares from 5 pence to 2.5 pence per share on 17 January 2007.
§ Two STIP schemes are in place. One vests equally after 2 and 3 years and the other vests after 4 years.
‡ The LTIP vests in three equal tranches after 3, 4 and 5 years.

which comprise the Group Income Statement, the Group Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, the
Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 31. These Group financial
statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent company financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year
ended 30 September 2007 and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as
having been audited.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an Auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the Group financial statements in accordance
with applicable United Kingdom law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group financial statements give a true and fair view and whether
the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the financial statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not received all the information and explanations we
require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is
not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the 2003 Combined Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services
Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
Group financial statements. The other information comprises only the Financial Highlights, the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review (incorporating the Business Review), the Corporate Responsibility
Report, Directors and Advisers and the Corporate Governance Statement. We consider the implications for our
report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group financial
statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the Group financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates
and judgements made by the directors in the preparation of the Group financial statements, and of whether the
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Group financial
statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming

Notes to the Company Accounts
at 30 September 2007
1. Accounting Policies
The financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended 30 September 2007 were authorised for issue by
the Board on 19 November 2007. Enterprise Inns plc is a public limited company incorporated and registered in
England. The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
The accounts are prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union.
This is the first year in which the Company has prepared its financial statements under IFRS and the comparatives
have been restated from UK GAAP accordingly. Detailed reconciliations from UK GAAP to IFRS of the 2006 Income
Statement and Balance Sheet are included in note 21 along with a narrative explanation of the adjustments made.
The Company has taken advantage of the provisions of the exemption provided under section 230 of the
Companies Act 1985 not to publish its individual income statement and related notes.
These accounts are for the Company and are not consolidated financial statements. Separate consolidated financial
statements for the Group are prepared under IFRS and are published separately within this document.
Property, plant and equipment
Licensed land and buildings are held at their fair value and landlords’ fixtures and fittings and other assets are held
at cost. The Company’s licensed land and buildings, except for those non-current assets held for sale, are revalued
each year by professionally qualified external valuers and employees who are professionally qualified to carry out
such valuations. Surpluses arising from the revaluation exercise are taken directly to the revaluation reserve except
where they reverse a revaluation decrease relating to the same asset which has previously been recognised as an
expense in the Income Statement. Any deficit arising from the revaluation exercise is taken directly to the
revaluation reserve to the extent that there is a surplus in place relating to the same asset. Any further decrease in
value is recognised in the Income Statement as an expense.
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated so as to write off the difference between their
carrying value and residual value over their useful economic life of 50 years. Residual value is reviewed at least at
each financial year end and there is no depreciable amount if residual value is the same as, or exceeds, book value.
Landlords’ fixtures and fittings are held at cost less accumulated depreciation. The useful economic life of additions
to landlords’ fixtures and fittings has been calculated at 30 years. Depreciation is charged on a straight-line basis
to write off the total cost less residual value over their useful economic life.
Properties held under finance leases are depreciated on a straight-line basis over the lower of the remaining lease
term and their useful economic life of 50 years.
Depreciation is provided on other categories of property, plant and equipment over 3 to 50 years on a straight-line
basis to residual value.
Profits or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are calculated as the difference between the net
sales proceeds and the carrying amount of the asset at the date of disposal.
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed annually for indications of impairment. Where any indications are
identified, assets are assessed fully for impairment. Impairment occurs where the recoverable amount of the asset
is less than its carrying amount. Recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and
value in use. Any impairment loss is treated as a revaluation decrease to the extent that a surplus exists for the
same asset, and thereafter as an expense in the Income Statement.

1. Accounting Policies (continued)
Leases
Leases where the Company assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance
leases. Pubs acquired under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of their fair value and the present value of
future minimum lease payments. The corresponding liability is included in the balance sheet as a finance lease
liability. Pubs held under finance leases are revalued along with the freehold estate on an annual basis. Lease
payments are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the lease payable so as to obtain a constant
rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged as an expense to the Income
Statement.
Leases where substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor are classified as
operating leases. Rentals paid under operating leases are charged on a straight-line basis to the Income Statement
over the lease term. The fair value attributed to pubs acquired as part of business combinations that are held as
operating leases are classified in the balance sheet as ‘intangible assets: operating lease premiums’ within non-
current assets and are amortised over the lease term.
Non-current assets held for sale
Non-current assets held for sale are held at the lower of their carrying value and expected sale proceeds, net of
selling costs. Pubs and operating lease intangibles are classified as held for sale when they have been identified for
disposal by the Company. They must be available for immediate sale in their present condition and the sale should
be highly probable. These conditions are met when management are committed to the sale, the pub or lease is
actively marketed and the sale is expected to occur within one year. Pubs held for sale are not depreciated and
operating lease intangibles held for sale are not amortised.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are initially recognised at fair value and then held at this value subject to an annual
impairment test.
Current assets held for sale
Current assets held for sale comprises tenants’ fixtures and fittings and are held at the lower of cost and net
realisable value. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs expected to be incurred
on disposal.
Financial instruments
i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash comprises cash at bank and in hand. Any short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three months
or less are classified as cash equivalents.
ii) Borrowings
Borrowings which include bank borrowings, syndicated debt finance and debentures are initially recognised at fair
value and are subsequently measured at amortised cost. This method is used to ensure that the interest charge
associated with the debt, combined with the amortisation of the issue costs, premiums and discounts, represents a
constant percentage of the borrowings across the life of the instrument.
iii) Derivative financial instruments
The Company uses interest rate swaps to manage the exposure to changes in interest rates and these are classified as
derivative financial instruments. Interest rate swaps are initially measured at fair value on acquisition and are
subsequently restated to fair value at each reporting date. Any change in the fair value of the instruments is
recognised in the Income Statement unless hedge accounting has been adopted. Hedge accounting is only adopted
where, at the inception of the hedge, there is formal designation documentation of the hedging relationship and it
meets the Company’s risk management strategy for undertaking the hedge, and it is expected to be highly effective.

1. Accounting Policies (continued)
The portion of any change in the fair value of the hedging instrument used in a cash flow hedge which meets the
conditions for hedge accounting and is determined to be an effective hedge, is recognised directly in equity.
Changes in fair value relating to any ineffective portions are recognised in the Income Statement. Hedge
accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer
qualifies for hedge accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gains or losses arising from changes in the fair
value of the hedging instrument recognised in equity are kept in equity until the forecast transaction occurs. In the
case of interest rate swaps, the ‘forecast transaction’ is the payment of interest.
iv) Equity instruments
Equity instruments, being ordinary shares issued by the Company, are recorded at the fair value of the proceeds
received, net of any direct issue costs. The nominal value of shares issued is recorded in Share Capital and the
balance of the net proceeds is recorded in Share Premium.
Taxation
The income tax expense comprises both the income tax payable based on taxable profits for the year and deferred
tax. Deferred tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences between
the carrying value of assets and liabilities for accounting and tax purposes. Deferred tax assets are recognised to
the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can be utilised. No
deferred tax is recognised if the taxable temporary difference arises from goodwill or the initial recognition of an
asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects
neither the accounting profit nor taxable profit or loss.
Current tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to set off the recognised
amounts and the intention is to either settle on a net basis or realise the asset and liability simultaneously.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets
and liabilities and the assets and liabilities relate to taxes levied by the same tax authority which are intended to
be settled net or simultaneously.
Both current and deferred tax are recognised in the Income Statement except when it relates to items recognised
directly in equity, in which case the corresponding tax is also recognised in equity. Tax is calculated using tax rates
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Company has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past
events, it is probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be
reliably estimated. If the effect is material, the amount of the provision is discounted using a pre-tax rate that
reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the liability. The amount
of the provision would therefore represent the present value of the expenditure expected to be required to settle
the obligation.
Pension obligations
The Company has both defined contribution and defined benefit pension arrangements.
The cost of defined contribution payments made to employees’ own pension plans is charged to the Income
Statement as incurred.
The defined benefit scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual of benefits. The net amount
recognised in the balance sheet comprises the difference between the present value of the scheme’s liabilities and
the fair value of the scheme’s assets. This is determined annually by qualified actuaries using the projected unit
credit method. Current service cost and past service cost are charged to operating profit. The net of the expected
return on scheme assets and interest on scheme liabilities is recognised within finance income or finance costs.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur in the Statement of Recognised
Income and Expense.

1. Accounting Policies (continued)
Treasury shares
The cost of own shares held in employee benefit trusts and in treasury is deducted from shareholders’ equity until
the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Any proceeds received are also taken to shareholders’ equity. No
gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of own shares held.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable for goods and services provided in the normal course of business, net of
discounts and VAT. Revenue is measured as the fair value of consideration received or receivable. Sales of
beverages are recognised when these goods are delivered to our customers. Rents receivable are recognised on a
straight-line basis over the life of the lease. Amusement machine royalties are recognised in the accounting period
to which the income relates.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the transitional provisions of IFRS 2 ‘Share Based Payments’ and applied its requirements
to those awards granted after 7 November 2002 that were not vested at 1 January 2005.
The Company operates a number of equity-settled share-based payment schemes for employees. Share-based
payments are measured at fair value at the date of award and this value is subsequently updated at each balance
sheet date for management’s best estimate of the effect of non-market based vesting conditions on the number of
equity instruments that will ultimately vest. The fair value is recognised as an expense over the vesting period by
calculating the cumulative expense and recognising the movement in the cumulative expense in the Income
Statement. A corresponding entry is made to equity. The fair value of share options is measured using valuation
models.
Dividends
Final dividends are recognised as a liability when they have been approved by shareholders at the Annual General
Meeting. Interim dividends are recognised when they are paid.
New standards and interpretations
The Company has elected to adopt early IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure’ which is not yet mandatory for
adoption.
During the year, a number of other new standards and interpretations were issued with an effective date after the
date of these financial statements. The following standards which are relevant to the Company are not expected to
have a material impact on the financial statements although the Amendment to IAS 1 may require some additional
disclosure. The effective dates below represent the latest date that the Company will be required to implement the
standard:
 Amendment to IAS 1 — Capital Disclosures — effective from 1 October 2007
 Amendment to IAS 23 — Borrowing Costs — effective from 1 January 2009
 IFRIC 11 — Group and Treasury Share Transactions — effective from 1 October 2007
 IFRS 8 — Operating Segments — effective from 1 January 2009
 IFRIC 14 — The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction —
effective 1 October 2008
Use of accounting estimates and judgements
The Company makes estimates and assumptions during the preparation of the financial statements. Actual results
may differ from these estimates under different assumptions and conditions. The estimates and assumptions that
have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements are discussed below:

Notes to the Company Accounts
at 30 September 2007
1. Accounting Policies (continued)
a) Property, Plant and Equipment
Properties are valued annually at open market value in accordance with the Appraisal and Valuation Manual
published by the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors (‘RICS’). The valuation is based on market observations
and estimates the amount that would be paid by a willing buyer to a willing seller in an arm’s length transaction
after proper marketing. Non-current assets held for sale are valued at the lower of their carrying value and their
market value less any costs that may be incurred to sell the pub. Further information about the valuation of the
pub estate is provided in note 4 of these accounts.
The Company estimates the useful economic life and residual value of property, plant and equipment (PPE) and
these estimates influence the depreciation charged each year. For details of these estimates, see the detailed
accounting policy for PPE.
b) Valuation of interest rate swaps
The Company measures interest rate swaps at fair value at each balance sheet date. The swap valuation rates are
derived from the mid point of the zero coupon prevailing at the close of business on the balance sheet date. The
fair value represents the net present value of the difference between the projected cash flows at the swap contract
rate and the valuation rate for the period from the balance sheet date to the contracted expiry date. The calculation
therefore uses estimates of present values and future interest rates.
c) Taxation
Judgement is required when determining the provision for taxes as the tax treatment of some transactions cannot
be finally determined until a formal resolution has been reached with the tax authorities. Tax benefits are not
recognised unless it is probable that the benefit will be obtained. Tax provisions are made if it is expected that a
liability will arise. The Company reviews each significant tax liability or benefit to assess the appropriate
accounting treatment.
d) Other
The Group also makes estimations and judgements in the valuation of share-based payments and the pension
liability. However, the value of these items is such that any variation in the estimates used is unlikely to have a
significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements.
Share buy-backs in close period
In accordance with IAS 32 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation’ a financial liability has been
recognised as the Company has entered into a contingent agreement with a third party which required the
Company to purchase shares acquired during the close period.
At 30 September 2006 a financial liability of £74 million was estimated to have existed. This has been recognised
in the balance sheet and has resulted in a decrease in shareholders’ funds of £74 million. There was no effect on
the income statement for the year ended 30 September 2006.

4. Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Revaluation of property, plant and equipment
With the exception of properties identified for disposal, the Company’s licensed land and buildings were revalued
as at 30 September 2007 by Humberts Leisure Limited, independent Chartered Surveyors, and by the internal
Head of Estates, Simon Millar MRICS, Chartered Surveyor.
The land and buildings were valued at market value (as defined within RICS Appraisal and Valuation Standards
‘Red Book’), reflecting the current and future rent and other income streams which are expected to be generated
by each property capitalised at an appropriate yield. The valuation also takes account of the terms of the leases
or tenancies under which the properties are let. Market value is influenced by factors such as income, location,
pub quality and tenure. The valuations are made by reference to market transactions within the UK pub sector.
The pubs used as security for the secured bonds and debenture in Enterprise Inns plc have been valued by
Humberts Leisure Limited. The balance of the estate held in Enterprise Inns plc have been valued by the Head of
Estates. The results of this internal valuation have been compared to that of the external valuers. This review
ensured that the results are consistent.
Pubs identified for disposal which are classified in the balance sheet as ‘non-current assets held for sale’ are held
at the lower of carrying amount and fair value less costs to sell. This fair value is based on the estimated net
realisable disposal proceeds (ERV) which are provided by third party property agents who have been engaged to
sell the properties.
If licensed land and buildings had been measured using the cost model, the carrying amounts would be as
follows:
Licensed land

The carrying value of property held under finance leases at 30 September 2007 was £113m (2006 — £105
million). Additions during the year include £4 million of property held under finance leases (2006 — £2 million).
At 30 September 2007, the Company had entered into contractual commitments to purchase £20 million (2006
— £6 million) of property, plant and equipment.

Fair values
Bank borrowings, the debenture, bonds and interest rate swaps were valued at fair value as at 30 September by J C Rathbone,
independent valuers. Fair value is calculated by discounting future cash flows using prevailing interest rates. The finance lease payables
are valued by calculating the present value of the future minimum lease payments.
The book and fair values of financial assets and liabilities have been analysed into categories as below:

amortised cost. Interest rate swaps are held at fair value and finance lease payables represents the present value of future minimum
lease payments. The liability for close-period share buy-back contracts represents an estimate of the amount that may be incurred on
share buy-backs during the period from 1 October to the date of the preliminary announcement of results. There is no difference
between the book value and the fair value of this provision. Other categories of financial instruments include trade receivables and
trade payables; however, there is no difference between the book value and fair value of these items.

Interest rate swaps
On 29 September 2006 the Company designated the £350 million swap that expires in September 2011 as an
effective cash flow hedge under IAS 39. This cash flow hedge is hedging future movements in interest rates until
September 2011. As a result, changes in the fair value of the effective portion of this swap are recognised directly
in equity instead of in the Income Statement. Changes in the fair value of the ineffective portion of the hedge are
recognised in the Income Statement.
Both of the Company’s swaps are in place to hedge cash payments made on floating rate debt.
The movement in the fair value of interest rate swaps has been accounted for as follows:

Financial instruments and risk
The Company’s financial instruments, other than derivatives, comprise overdrafts, bank loans, a debenture,
secured bonds and cash. The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Company’s
operations. The Company also enters into derivative transactions, specifically interest rate swaps and contracts to
purchase shares in a close period. The purpose of such transactions is to manage the interest rate risk arising
from the Company’s sources of finance and meet the objective of the Company’s share buy-back strategy.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. There is
no currency exposure as all transactions are in sterling. The Board reviews and agrees policies for managing each
of these risks and they are summarised as follows.
Liquidity risk
The Company has exposure to liquidity risk, being the risk that payments cannot be made when they fall due. The
Company’s objective is to maintain a balance between the continuity of funding and flexibility through the use of
overdrafts, bank loans and debentures.
This objective is achieved through the following processes:
 Regular cash flow forecasting and reporting through the treasury function
 Regular review of the Company debt portfolio including maturities and repayment profile
 Maintenance of undrawn committed borrowings
 Management of share buy-back programme

9. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
At 30 September 2007, the nominal value of the Company’s borrowings (excluding interest rate swaps, liability
for share buy-back contracts, finance lease payables and amounts owed by and to subsidiary undertakings)
comprised:
2007 2006
Overdraft —% 1%
Syndicated and other bank borrowings 47% 26%
Corporate bonds 53% 73%
The maturity of the Company’s debt, including interest rate swap liabilities, is set out below:

In one year or less or on demand 42 20
2,227 1,643
The table above shows the contractual, undiscounted cash flows due in future periods to settle the Company’s
debt. The book value of Company debt includes the fair value of the interest rate swaps which is based on
discounted cash flow, this means that the total amount payable shown above in 2006 differs from the total book
value of Company debt. The undiscounted value of swaps due in each period nets to the same number as the
discounted value in 2007 and this anomaly therefore does not occur in 2007. The contractual maturity of trade
and other payables is within one year. An analysis of minimum lease payments due under finance leases is set
out in note 10. The liability for close-period share buy-backs will be reversed within one year.
The Company's bank borrowings, secured bonds and securitised bonds are repayable as follows:

9. Financial assets and liabilities (continued)
Interest rate risk
The Company borrows its debenture and bonds at a fixed rate. Bank debt is borrowed at, and cash balances
attract interest at, a floating rate. The Company’s objective is to manage exposure to changes in interest rates.
This exposure is managed using interest rate swaps acquired with Group companies. At 30 September 2007, the
Company’s borrowings were 82% fixed (after including the impact of interest rate swaps) with an average interest
rate of 6.5% for 10 years (2006 — 100% fixed at an average rate of 6.5% for 12 years).
Cash flows associated with cash deposits, debt and interest rate swaps and the fair value of these instruments
fluctuates with changes in interest rates. The effect on the profit for the year would have been as follows if
interest rates had been 50 basis points higher or lower during the period.

Credit risk
There are no significant concentrations of credit risk within the Company. The Company is exposed to a small
amount of credit risk that is primarily attributable to trade receivables and cash balances. The Company’s
objective is to minimise this risk by dealing with third parties with high credit ratings and carrying out credit
checks where appropriate. The amount of trade and other receivables included in the Balance Sheet are net of a
bad debt provision which has been estimated by management following a review of individual receivable
accounts and is based on prior experience and known factors at the balance sheet date after taking into account
collateral held in the form of cash deposits. Receivables are written off against the bad debt provision when
management considers that the debt is no longer recoverable. At 30 September 2007 the value of collateral is
£25 million (2006 — £24 million). This balance is held on the balance sheet in ‘other payables’.
An analysis of the provision held against trade receivables is set out below. This provision relates to trade
receivables which are primarily represented by licensees.

Allowance as at 1 October 3 4
Increase in provision during the year 2 3

Allowance as at 30 September 1 3
There are no trade receivables that are past due at the balance sheet date that have not been provided against.
There are no indications as at 30 September 2007 that debtors will not meet their payment obligations in respect
of the amount of trade receivables recognised in the balance sheet that are neither past due nor impaired. The
maximum amount of exposure to credit risk is the carrying value of trade receivables and the fair value of interest
rate swaps classified as financial assets. The Company’s credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the
Company only invests with banks and financial institutions with high credit ratings.

21. Transition to IFRS
These are the first financial statements that the Company has prepared using IFRS. Comparatives for the year to
30 September 2006 have been restated from UK GAAP into IFRS to allow proper comparison. Reconciliations of the
opening equity at 1 October 2005 and of equity and profit for the year ending 30 September 2006 are shown
below along with details of the significant decisions made by the Company on transition to IFRS.
IFRS 1 – First-time adoption decisions
IFRS 1 ‘First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards’ provides certain exemptions on
transition to IFRS. The significant decisions made by the Company under IFRS 1 are set out below:
Valuation of properties
IFRS 1 provides the option to use a previous revaluation of property, plant and equipment as ‘deemed cost’ at the
date of transition to IFRS. The Company has decided not to take this option and will also continue to revalue
properties under IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’. This treatment is consistent with that adopted under UK
GAAP. The Board considers it is appropriate to continue to adopt this treatment under IFRS to enable the accounts
to reflect an up-to-date valuation of the pub estate.
Employee benefits
The Company has elected to recognise all cumulative actuarial gains and losses in relation to its defined benefit
pension scheme on transition to IFRS. Actuarial gains and losses arising after the date of transition will also be
recognised in full in accordance with the Amendment to IAS 19 ‘Employee Benefits’. This treatment is consistent
with that adopted under UK GAAP (FRS 17). This scheme is now closed to new members and for the future accrual
of benefits.
Share-based payment transactions
The Company has elected to apply IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’ to awards granted after 7 November 2002 but
not vested at 1 October 2005.
Adjustments made to Profit
1. Depreciation (IAS 16)
Under UK GAAP, no depreciation was charged on any element of the pub estate on the grounds of materiality.
Instead an annual impairment test was carried out on the estate. IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’ (‘PPE’)
contains no provision allowing non-depreciation on the grounds of materiality. Each part of PPE that has a cost that
is significant in relation to the total cost must be depreciated separately.
The Company has concluded that a depreciation charge should be incurred under IAS 16 in relation to landlords’
fixtures and fittings and certain improvements made to buildings. No depreciation is charged on land. Freehold
buildings are depreciated to write off the difference between their carrying value and residual value over their
useful economic life of 50 years. However, no depreciation charge arises in respect of 2005/06 as the residual
value of freehold properties is at least equal to their carrying value.

21. Transition to IFRS (continued)
2. Pub revaluations (IAS 16/IFRS 5)
Under UK GAAP, all revaluation uplifts were credited to the revaluation reserve. If a pub fell in value the
revaluation deficit was debited to the revaluation reserve to the extent that there was a revaluation credit in
relation to that pub and thereafter if it could be shown that the value in use exceeded the valuation.
Under IAS 16, any revaluation that causes the book value of a pub to fall below historic cost will lead to a charge
in the Income Statement. The charge will represent the amount by which the pub falls below depreciated historic
cost. If this same pub later recovers in value so that its book value exceeds depreciated historic cost, the increase
in value is credited to the Income Statement to the extent that a debit was previously recognised in the Income
Statement.
Under UK GAAP, pubs held for disposal were valued at the lower of their carrying value and expected sales
proceeds net of selling costs. The amount of any write-down was recognised in the profit and loss account as a
‘provision for loss on sale’ and shown within ‘net profit on disposal of tangible fixed assets’.
Under IFRS, when pubs are classified as held for sale under IFRS 5 ‘Non-current Assets Held for Sale and
Discontinued Operations’, they are valued at the lower of book value and fair value less costs to sell. Any write-
down in value as a result of this treatment is first recognised in the Revaluation Reserve to the extent of any
existing surplus for that asset. It is then recognised in the Income Statement. The amount of any write-down
recognised in the Income Statement is also shown in the line ‘movements from revaluation of pub estate’.
3. Dividends
IAS 27 ‘Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements’ requires that, when investments are recognised at cost,
any dividends paid from pre-acquisition profits are used to reduce the carrying amount of the investment and not
recognised as revenue in the Income Statement. Therefore, dividends that had been paid to Enterprise Inns plc
from the pre-acquisition profits of subsidiaries have been removed from profit reported under UK GAAP and
instead have been credited to the cost of investment. The same amount has been recognised as a realisation of
the capital reserve created on transition to IFRS and transferred to distributable profits.
Adjustments made to the equity
1. Deferred tax on revaluations and rolled over gains (IAS 12)
Under UK GAAP, no deferred tax was recognised in respect of the unrealised surplus on the revaluation of tangible
fixed assets unless there was a binding commitment to sell the properties at the balance sheet date. In addition,
no provision was included for capital gains on the disposal of properties where the gain was deferred through the
application of capital gains rollover relief as no liability was expected to crystallise.
IAS 12 ‘Income Taxes’ states that deferred tax must be provided on all temporary differences between the tax
base cost and carrying value of assets except to the extent that the difference arises from the initial recognition
of goodwill or the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which is not a business combination
and does not affect accounting profit or loss. As a result, a deferred tax liability has been recognised, subject to
these exemptions, relating to the revaluation of the pub estate and gains previously rolled over, or due to be
rolled over, into other assets. It should be noted that this liability is not expected to crystallise in the foreseeable
future.
2. Leases (IAS 17)
The Company leases a number of pubs from landlords. Under UK GAAP, the Company accounted for all leases as
operating leases and rent was charged to the Profit and Loss Account as incurred. Leasehold assets were held on
the balance sheet within tangible fixed assets at valuation.
Under IAS 17 ‘Leases’, most leases have been reclassified as finance leases. The finance lease payable,
representing the present value of future minimum lease payments, has been reclassified and is shown on the
balance sheet under ‘financial liabilities’. The book value of these properties has been increased by the same
amount so that they are now held at fair value.
The remaining leasehold pubs have been classified as held under operating leases. The amount held on the
balance sheet in relation to these pubs has been reclassified from tangible fixed assets to intangible assets:
operating lease premiums. The revaluation surplus relating to these properties has been reversed as IAS 17 does
not permit the revaluation of assets held under operating leases.

Notes to the Company Accounts

21. Transition to IFRS (continued)
3. Investments (IAS 27)
Under UK GAAP, the Company had applied s131 of the Companies Act and recorded the cost of investment as the
nominal value of shares issued plus costs in respect on one acquisition, that of Century Inns Limited. In addition,
the Company had accounted for the acquisition of a subsidiary company following a Group reorganisation at book
value. Under IAS 27, investments in subsidiaries have been initially recorded at fair value. A corresponding
adjustment has been made to ‘other reserves’ to recognise this change. Investments are not subsequently revalued.
This has resulted in an increase in the cost of investments.
IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements, requires that, when investments are recognised at cost,
any dividends paid from pre-acquisition profits are used to reduce the carrying amount of the investment and not
recognised as revenue in the Income Statement. Therefore, dividends that had been paid to Enterprise Inns plc
from the pre-acquisition profits of subsidiaries have been removed from profit reported under UK GAAP and instead
have been credited to the cost of investment. The same amount has been recognised as a realisation of the capital
reserve created on transition to IFRS and transferred to distributable profits.
4. Tax (IAS 12)
An adjustment is made to reflect the tax impact of the other IFRS adjustments where relevant.

Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2007 111
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and
fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In
preparing those financial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures
disclosed and explained in the financial statements;
 prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that
the Company will continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at
any time the financial position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.

Independent Auditors’ Report to the
Members of Enterprise Inns plc
We have audited the parent company financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended
30 September 2007 which comprise the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense, the Balance Sheet, the
Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 21. These parent Company financial statements have been
prepared under the accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Enterprise Inns plc for the year ended
30 September 2007.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members, as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the parent
Company financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and International Financial
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view
and whether the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether
in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company financial
statements.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have
not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law
regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited
parent company financial statements. The other information comprises only the Financial Highlights, the
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review (incorporating the Business Review), the Corporate
Responsibility Report, Directors and Advisers and the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report. We
consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material
inconsistencies with the parent company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the
Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts
and disclosures in the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors
in the preparation of the parent company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the parent company
financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated
14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:38  Page 112 14414 06/12/2007 Proof 6
the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent company financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
 the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted
by the European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985, of the
state of the Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2007;
 the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
 the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the parent company financial
statements.

may be acquired is 76,145,817;
(ii) the minimum price per ordinary share that may
be paid for any such share (excluding
expenses) is 2½ pence; and
(iii) the maximum price (exclusive of expenses)
which may be paid for each ordinary share
shall not be more than the higher of:
(A) 105% of the average of the market values
of such ordinary shares (as derived from the
Daily Official List of the London Stock
Exchange) for the five business days
immediately preceding the date on which
the purchase is made; and
(B) that stipulated by Article 5 (1) of the Buy-
back and Stabilisation Regulation (EC

This authority shall expire, unless previously
renewed, revoked or varied by the Company in
general meeting, 15 months after the date of the
passing of this resolution or, if earlier, at the
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the
Company in 2009, except that the Company may,
at any time before the expiry of this authority,
enter into a contract or contracts to purchase
ordinary shares which would or might be
completed wholly or partly after such expiry and
purchase ordinary shares in accordance with such
contract as if the authority conferred by this
resolution had not expired.
13. THAT the Articles of Association of the Company
contained in the document produced to the
Meeting and signed by the Chairman for the
purposes of identification be approved and
adopted as the new Articles of Association of the
Company in substitution for, and to the exclusion
of, the existing Articles of Association, with effect
from the conclusion of the 2008 Annual General
Meeting.
The directors believe that the proposals in
resolutions 1 to 13 are in the best interests of
shareholders as a whole and they unanimously
recommend that you vote in favour of all the
resolutions.

Notes
1. A shareholder of the Company who is entitled to
attend and vote at the Annual General Meeting
may appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak
and vote instead of him. A proxy does not need to
be a shareholder of the Company. You may appoint
more than one proxy provided each proxy is
appointed to exercise rights attached to different
shares. You may not appoint more than one proxy
to exercise rights attached to any one share. To
appoint more than one proxy, you will need to
complete a separate proxy form in relation to each
appointment. To request additional proxy forms,
please contact the Company’s registrars. You will
need to state clearly on each proxy form the
number of shares in relation to which the proxy is
appointed. A failure to specify the number of
shares each proxy appointment relates to or
specifying a number of shares in excess of those
held by the member will result in the proxy
appointment being invalid.
2. A personalised form of proxy for use in connection
with the Annual General Meeting is enclosed with
the document of which this notice forms part. If
you do not have a personalised form of proxy and
believe that you should, please contact the
Company’s registrars, Computershare Investor
Services PLC, on 0870 889 4080 or at
Computershare Investor Services PLC, PO Box 82,
The Pavilions, Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS13 8FB.
Completion and return of a form of proxy will not
preclude a shareholder from attending and voting
at the Annual General Meeting. Addresses
(including electronic addresses) in this document
are included strictly for the purposes specified and
not for any other purpose.
3. To appoint a proxy or proxies shareholders must
complete: (a) a form of proxy, sign it and return it,
together with the power of attorney or other
authority (if any) under which it is signed, or a
notarially certified copy of such authority, to the
Company’s registrars, Computershare Investor
Services PLC, PO Box 1075, The Pavilions,
Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS13 8FB; or (b) a CREST
Proxy Instruction (as set out in paragraph 4 below);
or (c) an online proxy appointment at
www.computershare.com/uk/voting/etp (you will
need your unique PIN and Shareholder Reference
Number printed on your personalised form of
proxy), in each case so that it is received no later
than 11.00 a.m. on 15 January 2008.
4. CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or
proxies through the CREST electronic proxy
appointment service may do so for the Annual
General Meeting and any adjournment(s) of the
meeting by using the procedures described in the
CREST Manual. CREST personal members or other
CREST sponsored members and those CREST
members who have appointed any voting service
provider(s) should refer to their CREST sponsor or
voting service provider(s), who will be able to take
the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction
made using the CREST service to be valid, the
appropriate CREST message (a “CREST Proxy
Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in
accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited’s
specifications and must contain the information
required for such instructions, as described in the
CREST Manual. The message, regardless of
whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy
or an amendment to the instruction given to a
previously appointed proxy must, in order to be
valid, be transmitted so as to be received by the
Company’s agent (ID 3RA50) by the latest time for
receipt of proxy appointments set out in paragraph
3 above. For this purpose, the time of receipt will
be taken to be the time (as determined by the
timestamp applied to the message by the CREST
Applications Host) from which the Company’s
agent is able to retrieve the message by enquiry to
CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After
this time any change of instructions to proxies
appointed through CREST should be
communicated to the appointee through other
means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their
CREST sponsors or voting service providers should
note that Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not
make available special procedures in CREST for
any particular messages. Normal system timings
and limitations will therefore apply in relation to
the input of CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to
take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal
member or sponsored member or has appointed
any voting service provider(s), to procure that his
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s))

such action as is necessary to ensure that a
message is transmitted by means of the CREST
system by any particular time. In this connection,
CREST members and, where applicable, their
CREST sponsors or voting service providers are
referred, in particular, to those sections of the
CREST Manual concerning practical limitations of
the CREST system and timings.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy
Instruction in the circumstances set out in
Regulation 35(5)(a) of the Uncertificated Securities
Regulations 2001.
5. Pursuant to regulation 41 of the Uncertificated
Securities Regulations 2001, the Company gives
notice that only those shareholders included in the
register of members of the Company at 6.00 p.m.
on 15 January 2007 or, if the meeting is
adjourned, in the register of members at 6.00 p.m.
on the day which is two days before the day of any
adjourned meeting, will be entitled to attend and
to vote at the Annual General Meeting in respect
of the number of shares registered in their names
at that time. Changes to entries on the share
register after 6.00 p.m. on 15 January 2007 or, if
the meeting is adjourned, in the register of
members at 6.00 p.m. on the day which is two
days before the day of any adjourned meeting, will
be disregarded in determining the rights of any
person to attend or vote at the Annual General
Meeting.
6. In the case of joint holders, where more than one
of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy,
only the appointment submitted by the most
senior holder will be accepted. Seniority is
determined by the order in which the names of the
joint holders appear in the Company’s register of
members in respect of the joint holding (the first-
named being the most senior).
7. Arrangements will be put in place at the meeting
so that, on a poll, if more than one corporate
representative for the same shareholder inputs
instructions into an electronic voting handset or
completes a poll card then one of those corporate
representatives is treated as the designated
corporate representative to cast (or withhold) votes
on the poll and the other corporate representatives
for that member give directions to that designated
corporate representative as to how the votes are to
be cast (or withheld).
8. Copies of the directors’ service contracts or letters
of appointment and of the directors’ remuneration
report are available for inspection at the
Company’s registered office during normal
business hours on any weekday (excluding
Saturdays, Sundays and public holidays) until the
end of the Annual General Meeting and will also
be available for inspection at the place of the
Annual General Meeting for at least 15 minutes
before and during the Annual General Meeting.
9. If you have sold or otherwise transferred all your
ordinary shares in the Company, please forward
this document to the purchaser or transferee or to
the stockbroker, bank or other person through
whom the sale or transfer was effected for
transmission to the purchaser or transferee.
10. As at 9.00 a.m. on 30 November 2007, the
Company’s issued share capital comprised
557,977,435 ordinary shares of 2½ pence each.
Each ordinary share carries the right to one vote at
a general meeting of the Company and, therefore,
the total number of voting rights in the Company
as at 9.00 a.m. on 30 November 2007 is
557,977,435.
Notice of Annual General Meeting
14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:38  Page 119 144
The notice of the Annual General Meeting of the
Company to be held on Thursday, 17 January
2008 is set out on pages 116 to 119 of the
annual report and accounts. The following notes
provide an explanation as to why the resolutions
set out in the notice are to be put to
shareholders.
Resolutions 1 to 10 are ordinary resolutions.
These resolutions will be passed if more than 50%
of the votes cast for or against are in favour.
Resolution 1 — Laying of Accounts
The directors are required by the Companies Act 1985
(the “1985 Act”) to present to the shareholders of the
Company at a general meeting the reports of the
directors and auditors, and the audited accounts of the
Company, for the year ended 30 September 2007. The
report of the directors and the audited accounts have
been approved by the directors, and the report of the
auditors has been approved by the auditors, and a
copy of each of these documents may be found in the
annual report and accounts, starting at page 1.
Resolution 2 — Remuneration Report
The 1985 Act requires the Company to seek
shareholder approval for the Directors’ Remuneration
Report at the general meeting before which the
Company’s annual accounts are laid. The Directors’
Remuneration Report is included in the annual report
and accounts, starting at page 30. If shareholders vote
against the report the directors will still be paid, but
the Remuneration Committee will reconsider its
policy.
Resolution 3 — Declaration of a Final Dividend
An interim dividend of 5.2 pence (net) has already
been paid in respect of the 2006/2007 financial year.
The directors are recommending a final dividend of
10.4 pence (net) per ordinary share of 2½ pence,
payable on 21 January 2008 to holders on the register
as at 6.00 p.m. on 28 December 2007. The final
dividend will not be paid without shareholder approval
and its amount may not exceed the amount
recommended by the directors.
Resolutions 4, 5, 6 and 7 — Reappointment of
Mr G E Tuppen, Mr D C George, Mr A J Stewart
and Mrs S E Murray
The Company’s articles of association require that any
director who was not appointed or reappointed at
either of the last two annual general meetings before
this meeting must retire, although they may offer
themselves for reappointment. Mr G E Tuppen, Mr D C
George, Mr A J Stewart and Mrs S E Murray are retiring
and seeking reappointment. Biographical information
for Mr G E Tuppen, Mr D C George, Mr A J Stewart and
Mrs S E Murray is shown on pages 13 and 14 of the
annual report and accounts. Details of why the Board
believes they should be re-elected are included in the
directors’ report in the annual report and accounts,
starting at page 15.
Resolution 8 — Auditors’ appointment
The 1985 Act requires that auditors be appointed at
each general meeting at which accounts are laid, to
hold office until the next such meeting. The resolution
seeks shareholder approval for the reappointment of
Ernst & Young LLP. The Audit Committee keeps under
review the independence and objectivity of the
external auditors, further information on which can be
found in the annual report and accounts on page 24.
After considering relevant information the Audit
Committee recommended to the Board of directors
that Ernst & Young LLP be reappointed.
Resolution 9 — Auditors’ remuneration
This resolution gives the directors the authority to
determine the remuneration of the auditors for the
audit work to be carried out by them in the next
financial year. The amount of the remuneration paid to
the auditors for the next financial year will be
disclosed in the next audited accounts of the
Company.
Resolution 10 — Authority to the directors to
allot shares
Under the 1985 Act the directors may only allot
shares if authorised by shareholders to do so. If
passed, this resolution will authorise the directors to
allot and issue new shares up to an aggregate
nominal value of £4,232,721.98 (up to 169,308,879
new ordinary shares of 2½ pence each), which is equal
to approximately one-third (33.33%) of the issued
share capital of the Company (excluding treasury
shares) as at 30 November 2007, being the latest
practicable date prior to the publication of the notice.
The authority will expire 15 months after the date of
passing of the resolution or, if earlier, at the
conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the
Company in 2009.
Passing this resolution will continue the directors’
flexibility to act in the best interests of shareholders,
when opportunities arise, by issuing new shares. The
directors currently have no intention of issuing new
shares.

As at 30 November 2007, the latest practicable date
prior to the publication of the notice, the Company
had 557,977,435 ordinary shares of 2½ pence each in
issue and held 50,000,000 treasury shares, which is
equal to approximately 9.84% of the issued share
capital of the Company (excluding treasury shares) as
at that date.
Resolutions 11, 12, and 13 are special
resolutions. These resolutions will be passed if
not less than 75% of the votes cast for and
against are in favour.
Resolution 11 — Disapplication of statutory
pre-emption rights
If the Company issues new shares for cash it must first
offer them to existing shareholders in proportion to
their current holdings, in compliance with their
statutory pre-emption rights. If passed, this resolution
will authorise the directors to modify these rights to
deal with legal, regulatory or practical problems that
may arise on a rights or other pre-emptive offer or
issue.
The resolution also seeks shareholder authority to
issue a limited number of shares for cash and/or sell
treasury shares without offering them to shareholders
first. The authority is for an aggregate nominal amount
of up to 5% of the aggregate nominal value of
the issued share capital of the Company as at
30 November 2007, the latest practicable date prior to
the publication of the notice (up to 27,898,871 new
ordinary shares of 2½ pence). The resolution complies
with investor protection guidelines, which limit any
issue to 5% of issued share capital in any one year.
The authority will expire at the same time as the
authority to allot shares given pursuant to resolution
10.
The directors consider this authority necessary in order
to give them flexibility to deal with opportunities as
they arise, subject to the restrictions contained in the
resolution.
Resolution 12 — Purchase of own shares by the
Company
If passed, this resolution will grant the Company
authority for a period of up to 15 months after the
date of passing of the resolution to buy its own shares
in the market. The resolution limits the number of
shares that may be purchased to 14.99% of the
Company’s issued share capital (excluding treasury
shares) as at 30 November 2007, the latest
practicable date prior to the publication of the notice.
The price per ordinary share that the Company may
pay is set at a minimum amount (excluding expenses)
of 2½ pence per ordinary share and a maximum
amount (excluding expenses) of the higher of: (i) 5%
over the average of the previous five days’ middle
market prices; and (ii) the higher of the price of the
last independent trade and the highest current
independent bid on the trading venue where the
purchase is carried out. This authority will only be
exercised if market conditions make it advantageous
to do so.
On 20 November 2007 the Company announced its
intention to continue its rolling share buy-back
programme. The directors intend to use the authority
granted pursuant to this resolution in pursuance of the
share buy-back programme. Further details of the
share buy-back programme are set out in the
Chairman’s Statement and the Chief Executive’s
Review in the annual report and accounts, starting
at page 2.
The directors’ present intention is that shares
purchased pursuant to this authority will be cancelled
immediately on purchase. Alternatively, the shares
may be held in treasury (provided any treasury shares
held do not exceed 10% of the Company’s issued
share capital), sold for cash or (provided Listing Rule
requirements are met) transferred to an employee
share scheme. The effect of any cancellation would be
to reduce the number of shares in issue. For most
purposes, while held in treasury shares are treated as
if they have been cancelled (for example, they carry
no voting rights and do not rank for dividends). The
directors will only make purchases under this
authority (whether or not under the rolling share buy-
back programme) if they believe that to do so would
result in an increased earnings per share and would be
in the interests of shareholders generally.
As at 30 November 2007, the latest practicable date
prior to the publication of the notice, options were
outstanding over 8,876,496 ordinary shares of 2½
pence each in the Company, representing
approximately 1.75% of the issued share capital of the
Company (excluding treasury shares) at that date. If
the proposed market purchase authority were used in
full, shares over which options were outstanding
would, as at that date, represent approximately 2.06%
of the Company’s issued share capital (excluding
treasury shares).

Resolution 13 — Adoption of new Articles
It is proposed in resolution 13 to adopt new articles of
association (the “New Articles”) in order to update the
Company’s current articles of association (the “Current
Articles”), primarily to take account of changes in
English company law brought about by the Companies
Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”).
The principal changes introduced in the New Articles
are summarised below. Other changes, which are of a
minor, technical or clarifying nature, and also some
more minor changes which merely reflect changes
made by the 2006 Act, have not been noted below.
A copy of the Current and New Articles will be
available for inspection during normal business hours
on Monday to Friday (public holidays excepted) at the
registered office of the Company from the date of
posting of this document up to and including the date
of the Annual General Meeting, and will also be
available at the place of the Annual General Meeting
for at least 15 minutes before, and during, the
meeting.
The New Articles will permit the Company to use
electronic communications for all notices, documents
and information to be sent to shareholders, in
accordance with individual shareholder preference. In
addition, the New Articles will enable the Company to
use website communication with shareholders as the
default position.
In order to take advantage of these changes
introduced by the 2006 Act, and subject to the
passing of this resolution at the Annual General
Meeting, the Company is asking each individual
shareholder for their consent to receive
communications from the Company via the
Company’s website. We have enclosed with this
document a Shareholder Communications Election
Form, which outlines the options available to you with
regard to receiving further communications from the
Company. Please read the notes on the Shareholder
Communications Election Form carefully before
deciding which option to choose.
A shareholder who has received a document
electronically will be able to ask for a hard copy at
any time and shareholders will be able to revoke their
consent to receive electronic communications at
any time.
Electronic Shareholder Communications
If you wish to continue receiving the Company’s
shareholder information (e.g. Annual Report, Annual
Review, Notice of Meeting, Form of Proxy and
Circulars) in hard copy, please complete the
Shareholder Communications Election Form by
selecting option B. This Form should be returned to
the registrars in the envelope provided by no later
than 28 February 2008. Please read the notes on the
Form carefully before deciding which option to
choose. If you do not return your Form by this date
then, subject to the passing of resolution 13, you will
be deemed to have consented to receive such
information via the Company’s website and you will
be notified by post (or,
where you have previously registered online at
www.computershare.com/investor, electronically)
whenever documentation is available. If you
would prefer to be notified electronically (and
you have not previously registered online at
www.computershare.com/investor) please read
option A on the Shareholder Communications
Election Form and register online at
www.computershare.com/investor and we shall send
you an email notifying you whenever a document has
been made available on the website.
Shareholders may amend their instructions or provide
new instructions at any time by notice in writing to
Computershare Investors Services PLC, The Pavilions,
Bridgwater Road, Bristol, BS13 8FB.
Summary of Principal Changes to the Current
Articles
1. Articles which duplicate statutory provisions
Provisions in the Current Articles that replicate
provisions contained in the 2006 Act are in the
main to be amended to bring them into line with
the 2006 Act. Certain examples of such provisions
include provisions as to the form of resolutions,
the variation of class rights, the requirement to
keep accounting records and provisions regarding
the period of notice required to convene general
meetings. The main changes made to reflect this
approach are detailed below.
2. Form of resolution
The Current Articles contain a provision that,
where for any purpose an ordinary resolution is
required, a special or extraordinary resolution is
also effective and that, where an extraordinary
resolution is required, a special resolution is also
Explanatory Notes to the
Notice of Annual General Meeting
14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:38  Page 122 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2007 123
14414 06/12/2007 Proof 6
effective. This provision is being amended, as the
concept of extraordinary resolutions has not been
retained under the 2006 Act.
The Current Articles enable members to act by
written resolution. Under the 2006 Act public
companies can no longer pass written resolutions.
These provisions have therefore been removed in
the New Articles.
3. Change of name
Currently, a company can only change its name by
special resolution. Under the 2006 Act a company
will be able to change its name by other means
provided for by its articles. To take advantage of
this provision, the New Articles will enable the
directors to pass a resolution to change the
Company’s name once the relevant provisions in
the 2006 Act are in force.
4. Redeemable shares and consolidation, division
or sub-division
At present, if a company wishes to issue
redeemable shares it must include in its articles
the terms and manner of redemption. The 2006
Act will enable directors to determine such
matters instead provided they are so authorised by
the articles. The New Articles contain such an
authorisation that will take effect once the
relevant provisions in the 2006 Act are in force.
The Company has no plans to issue redeemable
shares but if it did so the directors would need
shareholders’ authority to issue new shares in the
usual way. In addition, the New Articles permit the
Company to retain for its own benefit the net
proceeds up to £5 of selling fractional
entitlements arising on a consolidation, division or
sub-division of its shares. The increase from £3
reflects the relevant Listing Rule.
5. Convening extraordinary and annual general
meetings
The provisions in the Current Articles dealing with
the convening of general meetings and the length
of notice required to convene general meetings
are being removed in the New Articles because
the relevant matters are provided for in the 2006
Act. In particular, an extraordinary general meeting
to consider a special resolution can be convened
on 14 days’ notice whereas previously 21 days’
notice was required and the chairman of a general
meeting no longer has a casting vote.
6. Votes of members
Under the 2006 Act proxies are entitled to vote on
a show of hands whereas under the Current
Articles proxies are only entitled to vote on a poll.
Multiple proxies may be appointed provided that
each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights
attached to a different share held by the
shareholder. The New Articles reflect these new
provisions.
7. Age of directors on appointment
The Current Articles contain a provision requiring a
director’s age to be disclosed if he has attained
the age of 70 years or more in the notice
convening a meeting at which the director is
proposed to be elected or re-elected. Such
provision could now fall foul of the Employment
Equality (Age) Regulations 2006 and so has been
removed from the New Articles.
8. Directors’ interests
The 2006 Act sets out directors’ general duties.
The provisions largely codify the existing law, but
with some changes. Under provisions in the 2006
Act, that are not yet in force, a director will have
to avoid a situation where he has, or can have, a
direct or indirect interest that conflicts, or possibly
may conflict, with the company’s interests. The
requirement is very broad and could apply, for
example, if a director becomes a director of
another company or a trustee of another
organisation. The 2006 Act will allow directors of
public companies to authorise conflicts and
potential conflicts where the articles of association
contain a provision to this effect. The 2006 Act
will also allow the articles to contain other
provisions for dealing with directors’ conflicts of
interest to avoid a breach of duty. The New Articles
will include provisions authorising the directors to
approve such situations, and other provisions
allowing conflicts of interest to be dealt with in a
similar way to the current position, once the
relevant provisions in the 2006 Act are in force.
There are safeguards which will apply when
directors decide whether to authorise a conflict or
potential conflict. First, only independent directors
(i.e. those who have no interest in the matter
being considered) will be able to take the relevant
decision, and secondly, in taking the decision the
directors must act in a way they consider, in good
faith, will be most likely to promote the
Explanatory Notes to the
Notice of Annual General Meeting
14414ENTERPRI:12997ENTERPRI  13/12/07  11:38  Page 123 124 Enterprise Inns plc Annual Report 2007
14414 06/12/2007 Proof 6
Company’s success. The directors will be able to
impose limits or conditions when giving
authorisation if they think this is appropriate.
The New Articles also contain provisions relating
to confidential information, attendance at Board
meetings and availability of Board papers to
protect a director being in breach of duty if a
conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest
arises. These provisions will take effect when the
new conflicts provisions of the 2006 Act come
into force and will only apply where the position
giving rise to the potential conflict has previously
been authorised by the directors.
It is not clear what best practice will be when the
new conflicts provisions in the 2006 Act do come
into force. The directors have decided that the
New Articles should contain the provisions
outlined above in case the 2006 Act provisions
come into force before the next opportunity to
amend the New Articles. The directors believe that
these provisions will not prevent them from
complying with best practice as it emerges in
relation to the authorisation of conflicts of interest
which is what they intend to do.
9. Electronic and web communications
Provisions of the 2006 Act which came into force
in 2007 enable companies to communicate with
members by electronic and/or website
communications. The New Articles continue to
allow communications to members in electronic
form and, in addition, they also permit the
Company to take advantage of the new provisions
relating to website communications. Before the
Company can communicate with a member by
means of website communication, the relevant
member must be asked individually by the
Company to agree that the Company may send or
supply documents or information to him by means
of a website, and the Company must either have

10.Directors’ indemnities and loans to fund
expenditure
The existing exemption allowing a company to
provide money for the purpose of funding a
director’s defence in court proceedings has been
widened to cover regulatory proceedings and
applies also to associated companies.
The existing authority to indemnify the Company’s
auditor has been deleted and accordingly the
directors will not approve the granting of any such
indemnity by the Company.

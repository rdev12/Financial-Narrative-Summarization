Trading
The sales growth of 29% in the year under 
review has been led primarily by the increase 
in sales of the Group’s touch sensor products, 
which have grown by almost 47% and 
constitute 58% of the Group’s total sales.
Exports	now	account	for	over	79%	of	total	
sales with the fastest area of geographical 
growth being the Far East where sales 
have doubled. The split is as follows:

UK  3.0  4.1
Americas   3.3		 2.6

it is the area of gaming which has shown 
the	fastest	growth,	where	first	year	sales	
in this market have reached almost £1m. 
The Group has a number of projects 
awaiting approval in the areas of self‑service, 
information systems, kiosks, digital displays, 
music centres and industrial control systems 
and there is likely to be further growth in the 
gaming sector.
our Zypos product is winning most of its 
new business in the gaming, self‑service and 
information markets and sales of Zypos touch 
sensors in the year ended 30 september 2008 
have grown by 83% over the prior year. 
Cash 
The 	 cashflows 	 resulting 	 from 	 this 	 year’s 	
earnings	before	interest,	tax,	depreciation	
and amortisation (“EBITDA”) of £2.7m 
(2007: £1.5m) have enabled the Group 
to reduce the net gearing ratio to 11% 
(2007: 20%) after taking account of net cash 
b a l a n c e s 	 o f 	 £ 6 5 1 , 0 0 0 	 ( 2 0 0 7 : 	 £ 1 4 0 , 0 0 0 ) .

arisen 	 despite 	 additions 	 to 	 fixed 	 assets 	
of £918,000, including completing the 
investment in the new manufacturing 
facilities, which have cost £3.2m, over the 
last three years. The Directors anticipate 
only	modest	capital	expenditure	on	new	
plant and equipment will be necessary to 
further	expand	the	new	facilities’	capacity	
when required.
At 30 september 2008, the Group had cash 
balances and unused banking facilities at 
its disposal of £4.1m.
Technology
The continuing growth of ZyToUCH 
products, together with the growth of the 
newly introduced Zypos products, which 
have a lower cost base and consequently a 
lower selling price, has clearly demonstrated 
the market acceptance of Zytronic’s underlying 
projective capacitive technology.
Throughout 2008 the R&D team has 
initiated several programmes to continue 
the development and advancement of 
the electronics associated with Zytronic’s 
principal technology and also to evaluate 
new sensing materials. 
All of the programmes are still on‑going and 
will draw to their conclusions in 2009, at which 
point they will aid further reductions in the cost 
of manufacture as volumes increase.
Dividend
The Directors are pleased to recommend 
a	final	dividend	of	3.0p	per	share	payable	
on 9 March 2009 to shareholders on the 
Register of Members on 20 February 2009. 
Following a dividend of 1.0p per share paid 
on 27 June 2008, this will bring the total 
dividend for the year to 4.0p per share 
(2007: 3.0p per share).

A number of new customer programmes, 
where Zytronic’s products are on field trial 
or awaiting final approval, together with 
the strength of the order book over the 
first quarter of the new financial year, 
lead the Directors to be confident of the 
prospects of the Group going forward. 
Management
In my statement in May, in the interim results, 
I reported that Mark Cambridge had been 
appointed 	 to 	 the 	 position 	 of 	 Chief 	 Executive	
of the Group on 21 January 2008. Mark’s 
depth of knowledge of the Group and, 
in particular, our technology and the markets, 
is clearly standing him in good stead as 
evidenced by these results. The Directors 
a r e 	 c o n fi d e n t 	 t h a t 	 t h e 	 s t r o n g 	 m a n a g e m e n t	
team will continue to be very successful 
in the coming years.
Outlook
The	financial	crisis	which	is	affecting	all	
countries in the world and which, in the past 
few months, has begun to impact on the wider 
economy is clearly of serious concern to 
everyone. However, the Zytronic Group has 
unique patented technology, a wide industrial 
and geographical base of customers and 
a number of new technical development 
programmes, to be introduced in 2009, which 
will further reduce the cost base of the touch 
sensor products. These factors, combined 
with strong operating cash generation 
and a low level of gearing, are important, 
if not essential, for any sME to weather the 
d i f fi c u l t i e s 	 t h a t 	 m a y 	 b e 	 e n c o u n t e r e d 	 i n 	 2 0 0 9 .

Touch screens
The manufacturing technology, pCT , 
employed for its touch sensors is unique 
to	Zytronic	and	offers	significant	benefits	
to traditional users of resistive, capacitive 
and surface Acoustic Wave (“sAW”) 
technologies. Unlike the other touch 
technologies, the active component 
of Zytronic’s technology is embedded 
for protection, providing a true safety 
laminated, pure glass fronted construction.
PCT	offers	significant	benefits	to	
electronic display manufacturers. 
The touch sensing layer consists of 
an	array	of	microfine	wires	that	are	not	
visible on a powered display. Zytronic 
has now introduced a family of glass‑based 
touch sensors using its patented pCT , 
marketed as ZyToUCH, Zypos, ZyBRID
®
 
and ZysWITCH
®
 touch sensors, and two 
plastic‑based touch sensors ZyFILM
® 
and ZypRoFILM
®
, to meet customers’ 
differing requirements.
Optical filters and displays
Zytronic 	 optical 	 filters 	 are 	 used 	 to 	
enhance the readability of all types of 
electronic displays by controlling light 
transmission,	reflection	and	absorption.	
T h e 	 fi l t e r s 	 c a n 	 a l s o 	 p r o v i d e 	 p r o t e c t i o n	
of the display from abrasion and impact 
damage	thereby	extending	the	life	of	
the display.
Both monolithic and multi‑ layer 
composites in glass or polycarbonate 
or acrylic are available. The optical 
laminations are manufactured by 
bonding together, under carefully 
controlled conditions, two or more 
glass or plastic materials using 
proprietary bonding techniques. 
Zytronic produces a wide range of 
o p t i c a l 	 fi l t e r s 	 w h i c h 	 a r e 	 d e s i g n e d 	 t o	
meet	specific	customer	requirements	
for viewability of display systems in 
different environments.
EMI/RFI shielded filters 
Electromagnetic Interference (“EMI”) 
can be described as any form of 
electrical disturbance, signal or noise 
which interferes with the ability of 
electrical or electronic equipment 
to function correctly.
This interference is also referred to 
as Radio Frequency Interference (“RFI”) 
and is active throughout the environment. 
Its effects vary from impaired TV or 
radio reception to severe disruption 
of communications, data processing 
and medical and defence activities. 
Its sources are both natural and 
man‑made. It is also necessary to 
contain emitted signals from computer 
and data handling equipment to prevent 
electronic	eavesdropping	for	example.
Zytronic has its own specialist plating 
plant to enable it to manufacture such 
filters 	 to 	 customers’ 	 exacting 	 specifications.

Zytronic plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 www.zytronic.co.uk
Laminated products 
Laminated glass is produced by bonding 
two or more layers of glass together by 
means of a special plasticised interlayer, 
polyvinyl butyral (“pVB”).
This interlayer, after processing under 
controlled heat and pressure conditions, 
assumes	a	similar	refractive	index	to	the	
glass – consequently having no adverse 
effects upon light transmission – and 
at the same time, absorbing over 99% 
of the harmful ultraviolet rays found in 
natural	sunlight.	The	excellent	bond	
strength of the pVB to glass serves 
to maintain the integrity of the laminate 
in the event of deliberate or accidental 
damage, whilst also preventing penetration 
through the assembly.
Ballistic visors 
Zytronic is a manufacturer of specialist glass 
and plastic composites for ballistic security 
and specialised display applications.
Zytronic has developed a fully laminated 
ballistic face visor combining the properties 
of pMMA and polycarbonate bonded 
together using a proprietary TpU 
sheet interlayer.
The unique process involved in bonding 
these	two	materials	results	in	the	finished	
visor offering supreme optical quality, 
minimal distortion and the highest light 
transmission when compared to the 
traditional air‑spaced option.

2008 sales
As reported in the Chairman’s statement, 
the Group’s sales for 2008 were £14.7m, 
(2007: 	 £11.4m), 	 reflecting 	 an 	 increase 	
of 29% over the previous year. 79% of sales 
were	exports	reflecting	the	increasing	global	
efforts of our sales team, distributors and 
representatives. The increase in the sales 
performance	has	been	significantly	driven	
by the sales of our projected capacitive 
technology (“pCT™”) touch sensor products 
as we continue to roll them out globally and 
increase the application appeal through 
the uptake of the Zypos product line. 
Key features in the growth of the Group 
are set out below. 
Continued growth of touch sensor sales 
The total growth in the Group’s touch 
product sales compared with 2007 
was 47% (2008: £8.5m, 2007: £5.8m). 
These products accounted for 58% of 
the total Group sales, compared with 
51% in 2007. 
The sales value of our ultra robust 
ZyToUCH touch sensor product grew 
by 34% (2008: £5.9m, 2007: £4.4m). 
The increased growth was attributable 
to a return of more normal, and growing 
sales levels throughout 2008 to our ATM 
customers, as discussed overleaf, and 
by	n e w 	 p r o j e c t 	 o p p o r t u n i t i e s 	 i n 	 e x t e r n a l	
self‑service ticket machine deployments.
sales of our Zypos products 
demonstrated good growth at 85% 
(2008:	£2.5m,	2007:	£1.4m),	reflecting	
substantial design and supply wins 
predominantly with gaming and wagering 
terminal manufacturers, plus self‑service 
and information system manufacturers. 
We have continued to see increasing 
geographical sales in our touch sensor 
products,	where	we	have	exported	over	
87% of our total touch sales, of which 
half	were	exports	of	ZYTOUCH	to	our	
ATM customers. The table below shows 
the percentages of 2008 touch sensor 
export	sales	(excluding	those	to	our	
ATM customers), the corresponding 
percentages for 2007 and the relative

ApAC  15%  23%  110%
Americas 28%  19%  (9)%
The	decline	in	growth	exhibited	in	the

fulfilment 	 of 	 the 	 deployment 	 project 	
f o r 	 t h e 	 N e w 	 Y o r k 	 t a x i 	 c a b 	 c u s t o m e r	
infotainment units.
As mentioned in the research and 
development review in the 2007 results, 
we initiated in 2008 the market introduction 
of a number of plastic‑ based pCT touch 
sensor products, developed for the growing 
interactive shop window advertisement 
markets. We have called these products 
ZyFILM and ZypRoFILM. sales in 2008 
were a modest £52,000, up from £8,000 
in 2007.
Although contributing a small level of 
turnover, these products, coupled with the 
previously released ZysWITCH
®
 product, 
are considered important to ensuring 
that Zytronic maintains its leading global 
position as the total product solution 
provider for all large form factor projected 
capacitive sensing display applications.
The net result of the improved Zypos sales 
and non‑ATM based ZyToUCH sales, plus 
the modest introduction of the other sensor 
variants, contributed to an overall growth in 
sales	of	touch	sensor	products,	excluding	
those to our ATM customers, of 38% over 
that of 2007.

The ATM customers’ touch sensor 
and display sales
Having undertaken their planned restructuring 
and/or implemented the use of their Vendor 
Managed Inventory (“VMI”) programmes, 
during 2007, I am pleased to report that 
sales of products into our ATM customers 
returned to more normal operating levels. 
Sales	increased	to	6%	above	the	previous	
peak	achieved	in	FY2006.	
Along with providing actual usage data on 
the	customer ,	an	added	benefit	of	the	VMI	
programmes is the smoothing effects that 
they facilitate in production scheduling as, 
once initiated, replenishment cycling of the 
stocks is matched to the customer’s draw 
down cycles. This therefore alleviates 
the traditional ‘stop/start’ type of supply 
previously 	 experienced.
sales to our customers in the ATM market 
are now mainly concentrated on three 
manufacturing countries being, in order 
of increasing sales value, China, the UsA 
and Hungary, in all of which we have active 
VMI programmes. As the distribution of 
global manufacturing centres increases we 
are now also making sales, albeit presently 
at much lower levels, to facilities in both 
Brazil and India.
sales in 2008 to our ATM customers have 
increased by 43% compared with 2007 
and	by	6%	compared	with	2006.	
Sales of our ZYPOS products 
demonstrated good growth at 85% 
(2008: £2.5m, 2007: £1.4m), reflecting 
substantial design and supply wins 
predominantly with gaming and wagering 
terminal manufacturers, plus self-service 
and information system manufacturers.  10

Trading results (continued)
2008 sales (continued)
sales of non‑ATM display products
sales of other non‑ATM display products 
such as RFI/EMI shielding and anti‑vandal 
panels for the emerging large form factor 
digital display markets etc, remained stable 
during 2008 (2008: £1.5m, 2007: £1.5m). 
This relative stability was maintained despite 
the natural conclusion of one customer’s 
project	which	had	contributed	£262,000	
of sales in 2007, and whose volume 
was effectively replaced by sales to other, 
and new, customers.
Research & Development (“R&D”)
Throughout 2008 the R&D team has 
focused increasingly on the development 
of the capabilities of the electronic controllers 
used in our pCT products and has also 
initiated several programmes to evaluate 
new sensing materials.
In particular, two major development 
programmes were initiated during the 
year to improve the control electronics 
associated with pCT touch sensing. 
The 	 first 	 programme 	 was 	 to 	 move, 	
and ultimately improve, the digital signal 
processing capabilities associated 
with the technology towards industry 
standardisation of an ARM
®
 based 
architecture processor. 
The second programme was to look at 
the analogue based componentary and 
circuitry associated with the Zytronic pCT 
sensing system and to develop a single 
application	specific	integrated	circuit	
‘AsIC’ chip as a replacement. 
The combination of both programmes 
is a very powerful tool in the future growth 
of Zytronic pCT sensing products, allowing 
for a substantial footprint reduction of 
the controller card. It also increases the 
probability of supplying sensor and chip 
only solutions to prospective large volume 
customers, enabling them to integrate the 
solution directly into their own products’ 
motherboards, where required.
The R&D team has also initiated several 
programmes to evaluate new sensing 
material for use in the sensor designs to aid 
improvements in manufacturing processing 
and facilitate product improvements. 
All of the above programmes are on‑going 
and will be completed in 2009.
Production
The manufacturing stability provided 
by the VMI programmes, coupled with 
the increasing production, through the 
new manufacturing facility, allowed for 
a consistent monthly manufacturing 
schedule during 2008. subsequently 
the production department was able to 
maintain stable employee numbers, with 
an	average	workforce	of	167	(2007:	153).	
Manufacture of the Zypos product was fully 
transferred from an intermediate production 
facility to the new manufacturing facility in 
the	first	quarter	of	2008	fiscal.	It	was	not	until	
the end of January 2008 that the new facility 
was fully operational with all of the original 
design	specification	equipment	in-situ.
In	addition	to	the	2008	capital	expenditure	
on the new facility, only two other major 
items of plant and equipment were purchased 
during 	 2008. 	 The 	 first 	 was 	 an 	 additional 	
CNC edge grinding machine, introduced 
during December, to meet the increasing 
demand in glass preparation. The second 
was the enhancement/replacement of the 
air conditioning plant for the oldest of 
the cleanroom suites, the work being 
undertaken during August.
Chief Executive’s review
continued
Zytronic’s ZYBRID sensor has enabled Fiscal Systems to 
create an integrated travel centre and convenience store 
for filling-station forecourt applications, tough enough for 
outdoor use in unsupervised areas.
Laminated shielded windows and doors are manufactured 
by Zytronic to stop interference from the flow of radio and 
electromagnetic waves (RFI/EMI). These shielded doors 
are being used in ABB telephone racks. 11

Personnel
During the year, the Group maintained a 
consistent	staff	profile.	Three	appointments	
were made during the year to replace leavers. 
The opportunity was taken to improve 
capabilities and the structure of the 
Company to assist future growth. 
We have continued with the development 
of 	 our 	 employees 	 through 	 a 	 mixture 	 of	
on 	 the 	 job 	 training 	 and 	 external 	 courses.	
At the end of september we had over 
2 0 0 	 e m p l o y e e s 	 a n d 	 w e 	 e x p e c t 	 t o 	 s e e	
that number steadily grow in 2009. 
The Directors were pleased to offer our 
employees the opportunity to participate 
in our second sAyE sharesave scheme. 
I was delighted that so many joined,

employees for their good work during 2008 
and for their continuing contribution to the 
success and development of the Group.

IFRs for the year ending 30 september 2008. 
We issued our transitional document 
in May 2008, just before we issued our 
interim	results.	As	expected	there	were	no	
significant	changes	to	the	Group’s	results	
arising from the changes in accounting 
policies and the impact on the reported 
results	was	not	significant.	
The move to IFRs accounting has not 
changed how the Group is managed and 
does 	 not 	 have 	 an 	 impact 	 on 	 cashflow . 	
Trading results 
A summary of the results over the last 
three years shows the strong recovery from 
2007, the growth in sales, the continuing 
increase	in	the	gross	profit	percentage	and	
the	improving	profitability	(profit	before	tax)	
of the business: 
 2008	 2007	 2006 
 £’000 £’000 £’000

Profit 	 before 	 tax	 1,740	 683	 1,273
Sales revenue 
In 	 the 	 Chief 	 Executive’s 	 review , 	 Mark 	 Cambridge	
has	explained	the	key	developments	in	our	
markets, products and sales.
Gross profit 
The	profit	before	tax	of	£1.7m	has	increased	
by over £1.1m (155%) on the prior year. 
The gross margin percentage continued 
to increase this year, from 30% to 32%, 
building on the progress seen since 2002.
T o ensure that we continue to improve 
the gross margin percentage, we review 
regularly the sources and costs of raw 
material supplies, the design of our 
products and the processes that we are 
using in their manufacture as well as our 
number and use of staff. o ur average 
staff 	 numbers 	 passed 	 200 	 for 	 the 	 first 	
time this year, increasing to 205 from 192.
Administrative overheads 
We have continued to keep these costs 
under tight control during the year. The 
net increase was only £119,000 (£2.7m 
a g a i n s t 	 £ 2 . 6 m ) , 	 a n 	 i n c r e a s e 	 o f 	 l e s s 	 t h a n 	 5 % .	
As salary costs remain the largest single 
item in administrative overheads (over 50%), 
we review them annually in comparison 
to market rates and the developing roles 
of our employees. Despite the continuing 
growth in global sales, both travel and 
marketing costs remained at similar levels 
to the prior year.
R&D
The 	 Group 	 has 	 continued 	 to 	 invest 	 significant 	
amounts in developing its electronics and 
materials technologies during the year. 
The Directors have capitalised development 
expenditure	of	£173,000	(2007:	£152,000)	
and	expenditure	on	trademarks	of	£46,000	
(2007:	£50,000).	£224,000	was	expensed	
to	trading	profit	(2007:	£219,000)	in	respect	
of R&D costs. There is a commentary on 
R&D	in	the	Chief	Executive’s	review .
The Directors have continued to take 
advantage of the Government’s incentives 
for	R&D	through	the	HMRC’s	R&D	tax	credit	
scheme. Under this scheme, the Group can 
c l a i m 	 a n 	 a d d i t i o n a l 	 t a x 	 c r e d i t 	 o f 	 7 5 % 	 o n

Taxation 
In July 2008, the Finance Act 2008 enacted 
the abolition of IBAs and, as a consequence, 
in these accounts, we have incurred a 
o n e - o f f 	 d e f e r r e d 	 t a x 	 c h a r g e 	 o f 	 £ 1 7 4 , 0 0 0 .	
As	a	consequence,	the	G r o u p ’ s 	 t a x a t i o n	
c h a r g e 	 i n c r e a s e d 	 t h i s 	 year	to	£677,000	
(39%) from £149,000 (22%). The factors 
w h i c h 	 a f f e c t 	 t h e 	 G r o u p ’ s 	 taxation	charge	
are	outlined	further	in	note	6.
EPS and dividends 
Reported	basic	EPS	of	7.3p	(2007:	3.6p)	
reflects 	 the 	 significant 	 improvement 	 in 	
p r o fi t a b i l i t y . 	 T h e 	 n u m b e r 	 o f 	 s h a r e s 	 i n 	 i s s u e	
increased during the year by 11,944 to

two options as outlined in note 21a. 
After	adjusting	for	the	one-off	deferred	tax	
charge our “adjusted” Eps increased by 
140% to 8.4p (2007: 3.5p).
There were grants of new share options 
during	the	financial	year	for	384,392	shares,	
including 83,892 shares granted under the 
employee sharesave scheme. The total 
number of share options outstanding at 
30	September	2008	was	692,668.	
An incentive scheme was put in place 
for	the	Chief	Executive	during	the	year ,	
under which he can be awarded a total 
number of shares, up to 200,000, 
at 25p each, wholly dependent on the 
achievement	of	specified	EPS	ranges	
i n 	 t h e 	 fi v e 	 y e a r s 	 e n d i n g 	 3 0 	 S e p t e m b e r 	 2 0 0 9	
to 30 september 2013. 
The	dilutive	effect	of	existing	options	and	
this incentive scheme on the Eps is less 
than 5%. 
The Group paid an interim dividend of 
1.0p on 27 June 2008. With the improving 
profitability	seen	in	this	financial	year ,	the	
Group intends to continue its progressive 
dividend policy. A resolution to approve the 
payment 	 of 	 a 	 final 	 dividend 	 for 	 the 	 year 	 ended 	
30 september 2008 of 3.0p is included 
in the Notice of Annual General Meeting. 
This will bring the total dividend for the 
year to 4.0p (2007: 3.0p). 
Cashflow and working capital 
The Group has continued to generate

statement (page 30) and this has 
increased again with the growth in 
profitability .	It	amounted	to	just	under	
£2.0m this year in comparison to 
£1.3m in 2007.
As	expected,	our	working	capital	has	
increased, by £804,000 (2007: £184,000), with 
the growth in the Group’s business. stocks 
increased 	 by 	 £668,000 	 to 	 £2.5m. 	 This 	 reflects 	
increases in raw material stocks, to ensure that 
we 	 have 	 sufficient 	 quantities 	 on 	 hand 	 to 	 meet 	
the growth in sales and the ever‑shortening 
delivery	times	being	expected	by	our	
customers, and also the implementation 
of the Vendor Managed Inventory (“VMI”) 
systems operated by some larger customers, 
referred to in last year’s accounts. 
Trade and other receivables have increased 
by £272,000 (note 12a). Trade debtors have 
remained at a similar level to last year, despite 
the	growth	in	turnover ,	particularly	exports,	
and the lengthening of the credit periods 
given to many of our overseas customers. 
other receivables and prepayments, most 
notably VAT , have increased by £249,000. 
A summary of the results over the 
last three years shows the strong 
recovery from 2007, the growth in sales, 
the continuing increase in the gross 
profit percentage and the improving 
profitability (profit before tax) of 
the business.

Capital expenditure on fixed assets
As noted in the Chairman’s statement, 
the	Group	has	completed	its	significant	
investment in the development of the 
new	manufacturing	facilities.	The	final	
plant and machinery was installed during 
the	first	half	of	the	year	and	the	production	
facilities became fully operational during 
January 2008. The total new investment 
this	year	in	tangible	fixed	assets	has	been	
£672,000	(2007:	£1.9m).
Capital 	 additions 	 to 	 intangible 	 fixed 	 assets 	
were	£246,000	(2007:	£287,000).	This	
consists of £27,000 spent on software relating 
t o 	 m a n u f a c t u r i n g 	 c o m p u t e r 	 s y s t e m s , 	 £ 4 6 , 0 0 0

as noted in R&D on page 12.
Funding and gearing
During	the	first	half	of	the	financial	year ,	
Zytronic Displays Limited took out four 
further Hp agreements to fund plant and 
equipment to complete the equipping of 
the new manufacturing facilities. The Group 
has continued with the repayments on its 
ten year property mortgage, its three year 
bank loan and the Hp agreements taken 
out in Fy2007. T otal repayments in the year 
amounted	to	£561,000	(2007:	£212,000).
T o ensure that the Group has adequate 
longer term funding to provide cover for 
future working capital requirements and 
capital	expenditure	needs,	the	Group	has	
in place further loan facilities. In particular, 
the Group has an unused £2.0m three year 
revolving credit facility with Lloyds TsB Bank, 
expiring	in	June	2010.	The	Group	has	an	
overdraft facility of £1.5m with Lloyds TsB 
Bank,	of	which	only	£601,000	was	in	use	
at the year end, and has been progressively 
building up its net cash balances. At the 
year end, cash balances were £1.3m.
At 30 september 2008, therefore, 
the 	 net 	 cash 	 balances 	 were 	 £651,000	
(2007: £140,000), medium term borrowings 
were £1.7m (2007: £1.8m) and the total net 
debt	was	£1.0m	(2007:	£1.6m).	The	gross	
gearing level (all borrowings and overdrafts 
divided by net assets) at 30 september 2008 
was 25% (2007: 24%), while the net gearing 
level (all borrowings less positive cash 
balances divided by net assets) was 
11% (2007: 20%).

Directors’ report
The Directors present their report and financial statements for the year ended 30 September 2008.
Business review
Details of developments and the progress of the Group are contained within this Business review as well as in the Chairman’s statement, 
Chief Executive’s review and Financial review.
Principal activities
Zytronic is the developer and manufacturer of a unique range of internationally award-winning touch sensor products. These products 
employ an embedded sensing element and are based on projected capacitive technology (“PCT™”). PCT offers significant durability, 
environmental stability and optical enhancement benefits to system designers of integrated electronic displays, beyond that which 
was previously attainable.
Zytronic is also an industry leader in the development and manufacture of customised optical filters to enhance electronic display 
performance and an innovator in the production of specialised and transparent laminates for niche markets.
Competitive advantages
The Group’s competitive advantages are based upon both the patented technology relating to the operation of the touch sensors 
and the lamination techniques and processes, built up over 40 years of operations, which are a feature of all the Group’s products. 
These advantages allow the Group to produce products which have optical clarity and ruggedness, and can be customised to include 
individual features for customers, including privacy filters and anti-reflective and anti-glare properties. In the case of touch sensors, 
these advantages also result in the significant ability for them to be used by bare fingers and gloved hands and result in them not 
experiencing positional drift and therefore not requiring periodic re-calibration.
The growth of the Group and its future prospects come from the exploitation of this relatively new touch sensor technology. Differing 
adaptations of this patented technology have resulted in four different product groups being developed: ZYTOUCH touch sensors 
and keypads; ZYPOS, and its derivative ZYBRID, touch sensors; ZYSWITCH touch-switch sensors; and ZYFILM and ZYPROFILM 
plastic-based touch sensors. ZYTOUCH, ZYPOS and ZYBRID touch sensors are designed to work in front of LCDs or other electronic 
devices where optical clarity is paramount. Conversely, the technology has been adapted to produce ZYTOUCH keypads and 
ZYSWITCH touch-switch sensors which are not required to be transparent.
The Group’s Intellectual Property Rights include confidential operations and processes, technology covered by patents and licensed 
technology, trademarks and copyrights. Over recent years the Group has taken significant steps to register its trademarks. 
The Group will continue to identify further opportunities for the development of new product groups and expends a considerable 
amount on R&D. By continually developing and adapting its technologies the Group has been able to expand the applications of 
the touch sensors into a widening range of applications and new sectors of business and to promote the Group’s products on a 
global basis. At present nearly 80% of all products are directly exported from the UK, with a large proportion of UK sales eventually 
being exported as well.
The Group has continued the expansion of its worldwide selling operations, expanding its direct salesforce, based at the Group’s head office 
at Blaydon-on-Tyne. It has recently appointed a distributor in the Netherlands, one in Turkey, and a second in Japan. Management is 
continuing to look for suitable appointees to expand the Group’s presence worldwide.
Business risks
The main risk to the Group’s business is that of advances in competing technology, whereby a new, better touch sensor technology is 
created. Management is conscious of this and monitors competitors’ developments and changes within the whole industry. By continually 
developing and evolving its own technologies, the Group expects to build upon its competitive strengths and thereby keep its technology 
ahead of its competitors.
Another competitive risk arises from downward price pressures from competing technologies. This is most prevalent in the lower valued 
touch sensor sector dominated by resistive, capacitive and surface acoustic wave touchscreens, as new Asian manufacturers continue 
to take advantage of the demise of the patents on those technologies. However, price pressure in those markets does have a knock-on 
effect on prices throughout the industry. 
Management has successfully met these challenges to date by re-designing and re-engineering the ZYTOUCH touch sensor in 
developing the ZYPOS touch sensor. This has enabled the Group to reduce the cost of manufacture and therefore the sales price 
for ZYPOS touch sensors and is allowing the Group to get into markets that were previously closed to it on price grounds. 
Management is also continually reviewing the sources and costs of raw material supplies, the design of the Group’s products and the 
operational processes that are used in the manufacture of all of the Group’s products.
A further risk, which is directly within the control of management, is that of managing increases in the overhead base to coincide with 
the growth in turnover, thereby maintaining the growth in profitability. This is not straightforward when the business is developing new 
products and manufacturing processes. 18

Business review (continued)
Business risks (continued)
A fourth risk is that, as a growing proportion of the Group’s sales are denominated in US$ and Euros, the Group is subject to risks 
associated with currency movements. It is the Group’s policy to manage these risks and provide a degree of certainty for cashflows 
into the UK. Note 20 sets out details of the Group’s financial risk management policy and financial instruments, including its management 
of its foreign exchange risk. 
Natural hedging is adopted where possible to manage currency risk, whereby goods and services are sourced from Europe and the USA 
and the liability arises in the respective currencies. This is especially relevant with specialised glass, some electronic components and 
certain other raw materials. 
Throughout the year under review the Board continued to consider the use of forward foreign exchange contracts, having last 
used them in 2003/2004. Since the year end, in October 2008, management has taken out two US$ forward exchange contracts. 
Some currency is un-hedged, being dealt with at the spot rate when required. The Group’s exposure to foreign exchange movements 
may also be reduced in the future by undertaking some borrowing in overseas currencies, especially where plant and machinery is 
sourced from abroad.
The Group does not hold speculative positions against movements in foreign currencies or interest rates.
Key performance indicators (“KPIs”)
The KPIs for the business, at this stage of its development, are primarily financial. 
The current KPIs consist of setting targets for and monitoring the level and growth of sales; improving the gross profit margin; and 
controlling the level of overheads. The Directors set targets for operating management in terms of sales growth and margin improvement. 
The actual performance of the Group against each of these KPIs is set out in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review and 
Financial review. 
In addition, the Directors review an “activity monitor” which the sales team uses to record significant sales opportunities, the key dates 
in the development of each sales prospect with the customer, volumes and values of the opportunities and expected production 
commencement dates. 
The Directors have not developed KPIs relating to environmental matters; the Group’s employees; or social and community issues. 
The Directors maintain a close watch on the level and competitiveness of wages paid to factory staff and the market level of staff salaries, 
to ensure that the Group is not at a disadvantage when seeking to recruit staff or to retain them. The Group also uses share option schemes 
to incentivise employees. The Remuneration report summarises the policies relating to executive management.
Results and dividends
The consolidated income statement is set out on page 28. The Group profit after taxation amounted to £1.06m (2007: £534,000). 
The Directors propose the payment of a final dividend of 3.0p per share (2007: 2.0p). Following the dividend of 1.0p per share paid 
in June 2007, this will bring the total dividend for the year to 4.0p per share (2007: 3.0p).
Directors
The Directors of the Company are shown on page 15. Mark Cambridge, who was appointed to the Board of Zytronic plc with effect 
from 1 June 2007, was promoted to the role of Chief Executive on 21 January 2008. All of the Directors were Directors for the whole 
of the year. The emoluments and interests of the Directors in the shares of the Company are set out in the Remuneration report.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities in relation to the Group financial statements
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and those International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) as adopted by the European Union.
The Directors are required to prepare Group financial statements for each financial year which present fairly the financial position of 
the Group and the financial performance and cashflows of the Group for that period. In preparing those Group financial statements 
the Directors are required to:
I  select suitable accounting policies in accordance with IAS 8 Accounting Policies, Changes in Accounting Estimates and Errors 
and then apply them consistently;
I  present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
I  provide additional disclosures when compliance with specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and financial performance; and
I state that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Group and enable them to ensure that the Group financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of 
fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from 
legislation in other jurisdictions.

Zytronic plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 www.zytronic.co.uk
Disclosure of information to auditors
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. Each Director 
has taken all the steps that he ought to have taken as a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Significant interests in shares
On 12 December 2008, the following had interests in the ordinary shares of the Company:

Creditor payment policy and practice
It is the Group’s policy that payments to suppliers are made in accordance with those terms and conditions agreed between the Group 
and its suppliers, provided that all trading terms and conditions have been complied with. At 30 September 2008, the Company had an 
average of 30 days (2007: 30 days) purchases outstanding in trade creditors. 
Political and charitable contributions
The Group did not make any political or charitable contributions during the year (2007: £Nil). 
Special business
A resolution will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting to renew the existing authority of the Directors, last conferred 
by a resolution passed at the Annual General Meeting held in 2008, to allot unissued ordinary shares of the Company. The authority 
(special resolution 1 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting) will extend until the Annual General Meeting held in 2010 and is in 
respect of one-third of the Company’s issued share capital.
The Directors consider it advisable that they continue to have power to make allotments of ordinary shares of the Company for cash 
without reference to the statutory pre-emption rights, up to a maximum of 1,467,412 ordinary shares, being 10% of the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company at 30 September 2008. The authority (special resolution 2 in the Notice of Annual General Meeting) will 
extend until the Annual General Meeting held in 2010 and also would enable the Directors to implement a rights issue.
In addition, the Directors consider it advisable that the Company has the authority to make market purchases of its own shares up to a 
maximum of 1,467,412 ordinary shares of the Company, being 10% of the issued ordinary share capital. The authority (special resolution 3 
in the Notice of Annual General Meeting) will extend until the Annual General Meeting held in 2010. The power conferred by this authority 
would only be used after careful consideration by the Directors, having taken into account market conditions prevailing at the time, 
the investment needs of the Company, its opportunities for expansion and its overall financial position. The authority would only 
be exercised by the Directors if they considered it to be in the best interests of shareholders generally and if the purchase(s) could 
be expected to result in an increase in earnings per share. 
Auditors
A resolution to re-appoint Ernst & Young LLP as the Company’s auditors will be put to the shareholders at the forthcoming 
Annual General Meeting.
By order of the Board

Zytronic plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 www.zytronic.co.uk
As an AIM listed company, Zytronic is not obliged to comply with the revised Combined Code published in June 2006 (the “Combined Code”) 
but instead uses its provisions as a guide, but only as considered appropriate to the circumstances of the Company.
The Company is committed to high standards of corporate governance. The Directors consider that, except for the matters noted below, 
the Company has, throughout the year, been in full compliance with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code. During 
the year under review, the Company introduced changes to comply with the requirements of A2.1 (segregation of the roles of Chairman 
and Chief Executive), B2.1 (the remuneration committee should be chaired by a Non-executive Director), and C3.4 (the Company 
should have a formal whistle-blowing procedure).
I A4.1  –  For reasons explained below, the Company does not have a separate nominations committee.
I A6  –   The Board has not undertaken a formal evaluation of its own performance and that of its committees and 
individual members.
I A7.2  –   The Non-executive Directors have not been appointed for a specific term, but their contracts are terminable 
with six months’ notice.
In view of the size and structure of the Group, the Board does not believe that these exceptions had any detrimental effect on the 
control environment and corporate governance.
The workings of the Board and its committees
The Board
Throughout the year, John M Kennair MBE, the Chairman, Mark Cambridge, the Chief Executive, Denis Mullan, the Finance Director, 
T udor Davies and Sir David Chapman, Bt., the two Independent Non-executive Directors and David Banks, a Non-executive Director 
and Deputy Chairman were members of the Board. David Banks is not considered to be independent because he was the 
Finance Director of the Group until August 2003. 
John M Kennair MBE stepped down from his position as Chief Executive on 21 January 2008, following the appointment to that role 
of Mark Cambridge on that date. John M Kennair MBE is also the Chairman of Romag Holdings plc, another AIM company. As this is 
his only other business commitment, the Board considers that he is able to devote sufficient time to his responsibilities within the Group.
The Non-executive Directors demonstrate a range of experience and sufficient calibre to bring independent judgement on issues 
of strategy, performance, resources and standards of conduct which are vital to the success of the Group.
The Board normally meets at least five times per year. Its direct responsibilities include setting annual budgets, reviewing trading 
performance, approving significant capital expenditure, ensuring adequate funding, setting and monitoring strategy, examining major 
acquisition possibilities and reporting to shareholders. Between meetings there is regular informal discussion between the Chairman, 
Chief Executive, Finance Director and individual Non-executive Directors. The Non-executive Directors have a particular responsibility 
to ensure that the strategies proposed by the Executive Directors are fully considered. 
T o enable the Board to discharge its duties, all Directors receive appropriate and timely information. Briefing papers are distributed 
by the Company Secretary to all Directors in advance of Board meetings. The Chairman ensures that the Directors are able to take 
independent professional advice as required, at the Company’s expense.
The standing committees established by the Board are the remuneration committee and audit committee, each of which operates 
within defined terms of reference.
A nominations committee has not been established as the Board is small. The nominations process prior to Board appointments 
takes into account the views of all existing Board members and some advisers. Any Director appointed to the Board since the last 
Annual General Meeting is required to seek re-election at the subsequent Annual General Meeting. All Directors are subject to 
re-election at least once every three years. 
The number of meetings of the Board, and the attendance of Directors, was as follows:
     Number of   
Directors      meetings Attendance
John M Kennair MBE     5 5
Mark Cambridge     5 5
Denis Mullan     5 5
Tudor Davies     5 3

The workings of the Board and its committees (continued)
Remuneration committee
The remuneration committee is chaired by Sir David Chapman, Bt., an Independent Non-executive Director. Of the other three members, 
Tudor Davies is the Senior Independent Non-executive Director, David Banks is a Non-independent Non-executive Director and 
John M Kennair MBE is the Non-executive Chairman. The committee is responsible for making recommendations to the Board, within 
agreed terms of reference, on the Company’s framework of executive remuneration and its cost, including the remuneration of subsidiary 
Directors. The committee determines the contract terms, remuneration and other benefits for each of the Executive Directors, including 
performance related bonus schemes, pension rights and compensation payments. Further details of the Company’s policies on 
remuneration, service contracts and compensation payments are given in the Remuneration report. The Chairman’s remuneration 
is determined by a sub-committee comprising only the two Independent Non-executive Directors. 
The number of meetings of the committee, and the attendance of members, was as follows:
     Number of  
Committee members      meetings Attendance
Sir David Chapman, Bt.      1 1
Tudor Davies     1 1
John M Kennair MBE     1 1
David Banks     1 1
Audit committee
The audit committee is chaired by T udor Davies. He and the other member, Sir David Chapman, Bt., are both Independent 
Non-executive Directors. Meetings are also attended, by invitation, by the other Directors. The committee meets at least twice 
a year. The committee provides a forum for reporting by the Group’s external auditors.
The audit committee is responsible for reviewing a wide range of matters including the half year and annual financial statements 
before their submission to the Board and monitoring the controls which are in force to ensure the integrity of the information reported 
to the shareholders. The audit committee advises the Board on the appointment of external auditors and on their remuneration both 
for audit and non-audit work, and discusses the nature, scope and results of the audit with the auditors.
The audit committee keeps under review the cost effectiveness of the auditors. It also reviews the extent of the non-audit services 
provided by the auditors and reviews with them their independence and objectivity. The Chairman of the audit committee reports 
the outcome of audit committee meetings to the Board and the Board receives minutes of the meetings.
The number of meetings of the committee, and the attendance of members, was as follows:
     Number of   
Committee members     meetings Attendance
Tudor Davies     4 3
Sir David Chapman, Bt.     4 4
Relations with shareholders
Communication with shareholders is given high priority. There is regular dialogue with major and/or institutional shareholders including 
presentations after the Company’s announcements of the half year and full year results in May and December respectively. Presentations 
are also made to analysts and journalists at those times to present the Group’s results and report on developments. This assists with 
the promotion of knowledge of the Group in the investment marketplace and with shareholders. The financial statements include a 
review of the business and future developments. These financial statements and other information relating to the Group are also 
available on the Group’s website www.zytronic.co.uk.
Following the half year and year-end presentations of results, the Executive Directors report to the Board on the feedback received 
from journalists, analysts and shareholders. In addition, the Company’s financial PR advisers also produce a feedback report from 
those meetings which is made available to all Directors. The Executive Directors also report to the Board on any meetings with 
shareholders or institutional investors that may take place at other times of the year.
The Board uses both the annual report and financial statements and the Annual General Meeting to communicate directly with 
private and institutional investors and welcomes their participation. The Chairman aims to ensure that the chairmen of the audit and 
remuneration committees are available at the Annual General Meeting to answer questions. Details of resolutions to be proposed 
at the Annual General Meeting on 19 February 2009 can be found in the Notice of Annual General Meeting on pages 67 and 68.
In addition, the Senior Independent Director is available to shareholders if they have any concerns which contact through the normal 
channels of the Chairman, Chief Executive or the Finance Director has failed to resolve or for which such contact is inappropriate. 22
Zytronic plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 www.zytronic.co.uk
Internal control
The Board is responsible for establishing and maintaining the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
The system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the Group’s strategic objectives and can only 
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss. As an AIM listed company, the Company 
does not need to comply with Code provision C2.1 regarding the Directors giving a summary of the process applied by the Board 
in reviewing the effectiveness of the system of internal control. Instead, the Directors set out below some of the key aspects of the 
Group’s internal control procedures.
An ongoing process, in accordance with the guidance of the T urnbull Committee on internal control, has been established for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by the Group. The process has been in place for the full year under 
review and up to the date of approval of the annual report and financial statements. The Board regularly reviews this process as part 
of its review of such risks within Board meetings. Where any weaknesses are identified, an action plan is prepared to address the 
issues and is then implemented.
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group and there is a formal schedule of matters specifically reserved for decision by the 
Board. Authority to operate the trading subsidiary, Zytronic Displays Limited, is delegated to its Board of Directors and through them 
it is run by its management within limits set by the Board. The appointment of Executives to the most senior positions within the 
Group requires the approval of the Board.
Each year the Board approves the annual budget. Key risk areas are identified, reviewed and monitored. Performance is monitored 
against budget, relevant action is taken throughout the year and updated forecasts are prepared as appropriate. The reports reviewed 
by the Board include reports on operational as well as financial issues.
Capital and development expenditure is regulated by a budgetary process and authorisation levels. For expenditure beyond specified 
levels, detailed written proposals have to be submitted to the Board for approval. Reviews are carried out after the purchase is complete. 
The Board requires management to explain any major deviations from authorised capital proposals and to seek further sanction from 
the Board.
Due diligence work is carried out if a business is to be acquired.
The Board has reviewed the need for an internal audit function and concluded that this is not currently necessary in view of the small 
size of the Group and the close supervision by senior management of its day-to-day operations. The Board will continue to keep this 
under review.
During the year, the Board introduced a whistle-blowing policy and put in place procedures to encourage staff to contact the 
Deputy Chairman if they needed to raise matters of concerns other than via the Executive Directors and senior management.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.
Corporate governance
continued 23
Zytronic plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 www.zytronic.co.uk
As an AIM listed company, Zytronic makes the following disclosures voluntarily and they are not intended to, and indeed do not, comply 
with the requirements of Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985.
The remuneration committee is responsible for determining the remuneration and other terms of employment for the Executive Directors of 
Zytronic plc and its trading subsidiary, Zytronic Displays Limited. The committee is composed of the two Independent Non-executive Directors, 
the Non-independent Non-executive Director and the Chairman. In determining remuneration for the year, the committee has given full 
consideration to the requirements of the Combined Code.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration of Executive Directors is determined by the committee, and the remuneration of Non-executive Directors is approved 
by the full Board of Directors. The remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the two Independent Non-executive Directors.
The key objectives of the committee in determining the remuneration packages of Executive Directors are:
I the recruitment, retention and incentivisation of executive management of the right calibre; and
I the alignment of executive management and shareholder interests.
The remuneration packages of Executive Directors comprise the following elements:
Basic salary and benefits
Basic salaries for Executive Directors are reviewed annually having regard to individual performance and market practice. In most 
cases benefits provided to Executive Directors comprise the provision of a company car, or appropriate allowance, health insurance 
and contributions to a Group personal pension scheme. Details of emoluments for the Directors of Zytronic plc are set out on page 24.
Annual bonus
A discretionary bonus may be awarded by the remuneration committee to reward exceptional individual performance.
Share options and incentive schemes
The Company believes that share ownership by Executive Directors and employees strengthens the link between their personal interests 
and those of the Company and the shareholders.
The Company has executive share option and incentive schemes, which are designed to promote long term improvement in the 
performance of the Group, sustained increase in shareholder value and clear linkage between executive reward and the Group’s 
performance. The share options and incentive schemes of the Directors of Zytronic plc are set out on page 25.
It will normally be the case that, on the option holder ceasing employment with the Group, the options will be terminated. In some 
circumstances, the Board may have discretion to waive this where the past contribution to the business by the option holder justifies it.
The Company also has a Sharesave option scheme. Membership is open to all eligible employees, including Directors, who have more 
than three months’ employment with the Group at the time options are offered under a scheme. In compliance with the Combined Code 
the Board has agreed that it will not grant share options to Non-executive Directors.
Service contracts
John M Kennair MBE, Denis Mullan and Mark Cambridge all have a service contract with a notice entitlement of six months.
The committee considers the Directors’ notice entitlements to be appropriate as they are in line with the market and take account 
of the Directors’ knowledge and experience. There are no special provisions for predetermined compensation in the event of loss 
of office.
Non-executive Directors
The fees of the Non-executive Directors are determined by the full Board within the limits set out in the Memorandum and Articles of Association. 
The Non-executive Directors are not eligible for bonuses, pension benefits or share options.

Director’s share incentive scheme 
Share incentive scheme for Mark Cambridge, Chief Executive 
The remuneration committee agreed an incentive award scheme for Mark Cambridge, Chief Executive, to offer him up to 200,000 shares 
at a price of 25p per share to vest based on specified performance criteria.
These are measured by an EPS, calculated on the audited pre-tax profit and a standard 28% tax charge. The EPS criteria are shown below:

Director’s share incentive scheme (continued)
Share incentive scheme for Mark Cambridge, Chief Executive (continued)
Vesting is:
I the entitlement to buy, which doesn’t disappear once earned;
I pro rata between the upper and lower limits;
I timed on signature of audited accounts with a clean audit report; and
I  cumulative, e.g. 200,000 shares can vest in year 3 if the upper limit is reached, even if the lower limits have not been achieved 
in the previous years.
If the 24.5p EPS criteria is not achieved in year 3, there will still be an opportunity for shares to vest in year 4 (to 30 September 2012) 
or year 5 (to 30 September 2013) on the achievement of 24.5p EPS on the basis that, on achievement, the maximum total entitlement 
reduces to 125,000 shares or 50,000 shares respectively, or the number of shares already vested if that is greater.
Vesting will also take place in the event of a successful takeover and will be based on the takeover price, with full vesting at a share price 
of 500p and pro rata vesting down to a price of 300p as follows:
I 1,000 shares for each 1p above 300p up to 500p until 30 September 2011, reduced for any shares which have already vested;
I  625 shares for each 1p above 300p up to 500p between 1 October 2011 and 30 September 2012, reduced for any shares which 
have already vested; and
I  250 shares for each 1p above 300p up to 500p between 1 October 2012 and 30 September 2013, reduced for any shares which 
have already vested.
During the year to 30 September 2008, the highest share price was 245.0p and the lowest share price was 157.5p. The market price 
of the shares at 30 September 2008 was 157.5p.
Directors’ interests in material contracts
As noted above, the Company has paid Directors’ fees to David Banks Associates, a partnership in which David Banks is a partner. 
At 30 September 2008 the amount due to David Banks Associates was £3,231 (2007: £3,231).
With this exception, no Director was materially interested either at the year end or during the year in any contract of significance to the 
Group other than their employment or service contract.

1. Accounting policies
(a) Statement of compliance
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted for use in the European Union and 
as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 1985. The Directors consider the following accounting policies 
to be relevant in relation to the Group’s financial statements.
(b) Judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted accounting principles requires the Directors to make 
judgements and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities and disclosures at the date of the financial statements 
and the reported income and expense during the year. Although these judgements and assumptions are based on the Directors’ best 
knowledge of the amount, events or actions, actual results may differ from those estimates.
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, the Directors have made the following judgements, apart from those 
involving estimations, which have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in the financial statements:
Impairment of non-financial assets
The Group assesses whether there are any indicators of impairment as at the transition date and thereafter for all non-financial assets at 
each reporting date. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and at other times when such indicators exist. Other non-financial assets 
are tested for impairment when there are indicators that the carrying amounts may not be recoverable.
When value in use calculations are undertaken, management must estimate the expected future cashflows from the asset or 
cash generating unit and choose a suitable discount rate in order to calculate the present value of those cashflows.
Development costs
Development costs are capitalised in accordance with the accounting policy given below. Initial capitalisation of costs is based on 
management’s judgement that technological and economical feasibility is confirmed, usually when a product development project 
has reached a defined milestone.
(c) Basis of consolidation and goodwill
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Zytronic plc and its subsidiaries as at 30 September 
each year. They are presented in Sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest thousand pounds (£’000) except where 
otherwise indicated.
All intra-group balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from them, are eliminated. 
Subsidiaries are consolidated from the date of their acquisition, being the date on which the Group obtains control, and continue 
to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases.
Acquisitions are accounted for using the purchase method. Goodwill arising on acquisitions is initially measured at cost, being the 
excess of the cost of the acquisition over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities, is capitalised and classified as an asset on the balance sheet, and is not amortised. After initial recognition, goodwill is stated 
at cost less any accumulated impairment losses, with the carrying value being reviewed for impairment, at least on an annual basis 
and whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may be impaired. This requires an estimation of 
the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the goodwill is allocated.
When subsidiaries are sold, the difference between the selling price and the net assets plus unimpaired goodwill is recognised 
in the consolidated income statement. 
Goodwill recognised as an asset as at 30 September 2006 is recorded at its carrying amount under UK GAAP and is subject 
to impairment review but is not amortised. 
(d) Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and presentation currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are initially recorded in the functional currency at the rate ruling at the date of transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of exchange ruling 
at the balance sheet date. All differences are taken to the income statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions. 
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 30 September 2008 32
Zytronic plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 www.zytronic.co.uk
1. Accounting policies (continued)
(e) Property , plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment charges. Such costs include those 
directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended and the cost of replacing significant parts of such plant and 
equipment when that cost is incurred, if the recognition criteria are met. Depreciation is provided on all property, plant and equipment, 
other than freehold land, at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset evenly over its expected 
useful life, as follows:
Freehold property – 50 years 
Short leasehold property – over the term of the lease 
Plant and machinery – varying rates between 5% and 25% per annum
Any gain or loss arising on disposal of an asset (calculated as the difference between the net disposal proceeds and the carrying amount 
of the asset) is included in the income statement in the year the asset is derecognised. 
The assets’ residual values, useful lives and methods of depreciation are reviewed at each financial year end and adjusted, if appropriate. 
The Group assesses at each reporting date whether there is an indication that an asset may be impaired. If any such indication exists 
the Group makes an estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount. An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of the asset’s fair value, 
or the cash-generating unit’s fair value of which it forms part, less costs to sell and its value in use and is determined for an individual 
asset, unless the asset does not generate cash inflows that are largely independent of those from other assets or groups of assets. 
Where the carrying amount of an asset exceeds its recoverable amount, the asset is considered impaired and is written down to its 
recoverable amount. Impairment losses of continuing operations are recognised in the income statement in those expense categories 
consistent with the function of the impaired asset.
(f) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial recognition at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business 
combination is deemed to be their fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at 
cost less any accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. Other than capitalised development costs, internally 
generated intangible assets are not capitalised.
Intangible assets are amortised on a straight line basis over their useful economic lives and reviewed for impairment at each financial 
year end. The amortisation expense on intangible assets is recognised in the income statement in the expense category consistent 
with the function of the intangible asset. The estimated useful lives are as follows:
Licences – period of licensing agreements (10 and 17 years) 
Capitalised development expenditure – 4 to 10 years
(g) Research and development costs
Research expenditure is written off as incurred. An intangible asset arising from development expenditure on an individual project is 
recognised only when the Group can demonstrate the technical feasibility of completing the intangible asset so that it will be available 
for use or sale, its intention to complete and its ability to use or sell the asset, how the asset will generate future economic benefits, 
the availability of resources to complete the asset and the ability to measure reliably the expenditure during the development. 
During the period of development, the asset is tested annually for impairment. Following the initial recognition of the development 
expenditure, the cost model (as defined in IFRS) is applied, requiring the asset to be carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation 
and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation of the asset begins when development is complete and the asset is available for 
use. It is amortised over the period of expected future sales.
(h) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Costs incurred in bringing each product to its present location 
and condition are accounted for as follows:
Raw materials and consumables – purchase cost on a first-in, first-out basis; and 
Finished goods and work in progress –  cost of direct materials and labour and a proportion of manufacturing overheads based 
on normal operating capacity but excluding borrowing costs.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business, less estimated costs of completion and the 
estimated costs necessary to make the sale.
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 30 September 2008 continued 33
Zytronic plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 www.zytronic.co.uk
1. Accounting policies (continued)
(i) Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original amount less an allowance for any uncollectable amounts. An estimate 
for doubtful debts is made when collection of the full amount is no longer probable. Bad debts are written off when identified. 
Trade and other receivables do not carry interest.
(j) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an initial maturity 
of three months or less. Bank overdrafts are shown within financial liabilities, in current liabilities on the balance sheet. For the purpose 
of the cashflow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise these balances, net of outstanding bank overdrafts.
(k) Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received less directly attributable transaction costs. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the income statement when the liabilities are derecognised, as well as through the amortisation process.
Borrowing costs are recognised as an expense when incurred.
(l) Derecognition of financial assets and liabilities
A financial asset or financial liability is derecognised when the contract that gives rise to it is discharged, sold, cancelled or expires.
Where an existing financial liability is replaced by another from the same lender on substantially different terms, or the terms of 
an existing liability are substantially modified, such an exchange or modification is treated as a de-recognition of the original liability 
and the recognition of a new liability, and the difference in the respective carrying amounts is recognised in the income statement.
(m) Pension scheme
The Group operates a group personal pension scheme, which is a defined contribution scheme, for its employees. Contributions 
are recognised in the income statement as they become payable in accordance with the rules of the scheme.
(n) Leases
Group as a lessee
Finance leases, which transfer to the Group substantially all the risks and benefits incidental to ownership of the leased item, 
are capitalised at the inception of the lease at the fair value of the leased asset or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum 
lease payments. Lease payments are apportioned between the finance charges and reduction of the lease liability so as to achieve 
a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly against income. Assets 
held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the asset and the lease term.
The same policy is adopted for assets acquired under HP arrangements.
Leases where the lessor retains a significant portion of the risks and benefits of ownership of the asset are classified as operating 
leases and payments are recognised as an expense in the income statement on a straight line basis over the lease term.
(o) Share-based payment transactions
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are granted 
and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become fully entitled 
to the award. Fair value is determined using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken 
of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions).
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market condition, 
which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other performance conditions 
are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest, or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting. The movement 
in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry 
in equity. 34
Zytronic plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 www.zytronic.co.uk
1. Accounting policies (continued)
(o) Share-based payment transactions (continued)
Equity-settled transactions (continued)
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, 
the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is 
recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference 
between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. 
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised 
in the income statement for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the cancellation 
or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the income statement.
IFRS 2 Share-based Payments has only been applied to grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested at 
1 October 2006. For awards granted before 7 November 2002, the Group recognises only the intrinsic value or cost of these potential 
awards as an expense. This is accrued over the performance period of each plan based on the intrinsic value of the equity-settled awards.
(p) Revenue recognition
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods have passed to 
the buyer. This is when the goods have been dispatched or made available to the customer, an invoice has been raised for them 
and the Group’s obligations to the customer have been met. There is not usually any significant delay between the occurrence 
of these three events.
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, excluding discounts, rebates, and other sales taxes. Appropriate 
provisions for known returns are deducted from revenue.
(q) Government grants
Government grants are recognised where there is reasonable assurance that the grant will be received and all attaching conditions 
will be complied with, normally when a grant claim has been approved by the Government authority and the grant monies have been 
received. The fair value of grants is credited to a deferred income account and released to the income statement over the life of the 
projects to which they relate.
(r) Royalty payments
Under the terms of its patent licence, Zytronic Displays Limited pays royalties to the patent owner on the value of the touch sensors which 
it sells. An agreed annual payment is made by monthly instalment under the licence.
In the event that the actual quarterly royalties due from Zytronic Displays Limited exceed the payments on account for that quarter, 
Zytronic Displays Limited pays the balance to the patent owner.
In the event that the payments on account for that quarter exceed the actual royalties due to that date, the excess payment is treated 
by Zytronic Displays Limited as a prepayment of royalties that will become due in the future. Similarly, should the annual agreed 
payment be in excess of the royalties due for the year, the difference is rolled over and deducted from future years’ royalty calculations.
Management reviews its forecasts of future sales to determine whether any impairment has occurred which might affect the carrying 
value of the prepayment.
From 1 January 2008, and for each subsequent calendar year, the annual payment will increase either by the greater of RPI or to the 
level of the previous year’s actual royalties.
(s) Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences arising between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their 
carrying amounts in the financial statements, with the following exceptions:
I  where the temporary difference arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not 
a business combination that at the time of the transaction affects neither accounting nor taxable profit or loss;
I  in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, where the 
timing of the reversal of the temporary differences can be controlled and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future; and
I  deferred taxation assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be 
suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the related asset 
or liability is settled, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.

IFRIC 16 Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign Operation    1 October 2008

IAS 23 has been revised to require capitalisation of borrowing costs when such costs relate to a qualifying asset. A qualifying asset is 
an asset that necessarily takes a substantial period of time to get ready for its intended use or sale. In accordance with the transitional 
provisions in the standard, the Group will adopt this as a prospective change. Accordingly, borrowing costs will be capitalised on 
qualifying assets with a commencement date of 1 January 2009. No changes will be made for borrowing costs incurred prior to this 
date that have been expensed.
Whilst the revised IAS 1 will have no impact on the measurement of the Group’s results or net assets, it is likely to result in certain 
changes in the presentation of the Group’s financial statements from 2009 onwards.
IFRS 8 requires disclosure based on information presented to the Board. Whilst this is not expected to change the business segments 
about which information is given, the secondary segment information will be replaced by group-wide analysis of revenues and 
non-current assets by major geographic area.
There is no significant impact from the standards not applied.  36

2. Group revenue and segmental analysis
Revenue represents the invoiced amount of goods sold and services provided, stated net of value added tax.
The primary segment reporting format is determined to be this single business segment as the Group’s risks and rates of return are 
affected predominantly by differences in the products and services provided.
The Group has one reportable business segment comprising the development and manufacture of customised optical filters 
to enhance electronic display performance. Products in this reportable segment include touch sensors, filters and other laminated 
products as described on pages 6 and 7. All revenue, profits or losses before tax and net assets are attributable to this reportable 
business segment.
Secondary segment information is reported geographically. All manufacturing takes place in the UK and accordingly all segment assets 
are located in the UK. The analysis of segment revenue by geographical area based on the location of customers is given below.

It is not uncommon for global customers to alter the geographic destination of goods from one year to the next. In FY2007, for example, 
one customer announced the closure of its North American operations and the scaling back of its UK operations in favour of shifting 
more production to Hungary and China. The reduction in sales in the UK in FY2008 largely arises from this type of customer re-allocation. 
It does not reflect a loss of customers.

6. Taxation (continued)
Factors that may affect future tax charges
Under current tax legislation, some of the amortisation of licences will continue to be non-deductible for tax purposes.
Under HMRC’s R&D tax credit scheme, the Group will receive an annual uplift of 75% on qualifying R&D expenditure for tax purposes. 
Until the financial year 2006, where R&D expenditure has been capitalised, the benefit of this uplift is only recognised as the asset is 
amortised. The unrecognised element, relating to the year ended 30 September 2005 and prior, at 30 September 2008 was £100,000 
(2007: £90,000). Following changes to HMRC’s rules which took effect for financial year 2006, the uplift on expenditure which has been 
capitalised in any year is recognised in that year.
The “gain” on the exercise of share options, being the difference between the grant/exercise price and the market value at the time of 
exercise, is allowable as a taxable deduction from profits although it is not reflected within the income statement. These gains will arise 
in future years but their timing and amount is uncertain. 
There are tax losses carried forward at 30 September 2008 of £Nil (2007: £145,000).
7. Dividends
The Directors propose the payment of a final dividend of 3.0p per share (2007: 2.0p), payable on 9 March 2009 to shareholders on the 
Register on 20 February 2009. This dividend has not been accrued in these financial statements. The dividend payment will amount to 
some £440,000.

8. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share (“EPS”) is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to ordinary equity holders of the Company by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. All activities are continuing operations and therefore there 
is no difference between EPS arising from total operations and EPS arising from continuing operations.

As from the date of transition to IFRS, goodwill is no longer amortised but is now subject to an annual impairment test.
Impairment of goodwill
The goodwill of £235,000 relates to the operations of Intasolve Limited which were merged into the business of Zytronic Displays Limited 
on 1 September 2002. 
Zytronic Displays Limited operates in one continuing area of activity, which is the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored for internal 
purposes. That activity has demonstrated underlying growth in sales revenues, gross profit margins, profitability before tax and cash 
generation over recent years. 
The recoverable amount of goodwill has been determined based on a value in use calculation for the cash-generating unit, using 
cashflow projections based on financial budgets and forecasts approved by senior management covering a three-year period. 
Growth has been extrapolated forward from the end of the forecasts, using a growth rate of 3% which reflects the Directors’ view 
of the long-term growth rate in the business.
The cashflows for all cash-generating units have been discounted using a discount rate of 10%, based on the Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital.
The calculation of value in use is most sensitive to the forecast operating cashflows, the discount rate and the growth rate used 
to extrapolate cashfiows beyond the budget period. The operating cashflows are based on assumptions of revenue, cost of sales 
and general overheads. These assumptions are influenced by several factors both internally and externally.
The Directors consider the assumptions used to be consistent with the historical performance and to be realistically achievable in light 
of economic and industry measures and forecasts. It is believed that any reasonably possible movement on assumptions will not lead 
to an impairment and we have therefore not presented any sensitivity analysis.

17. Bank loans
(a) Chattel mortgage
On 28 September 2004, Zytronic Displays Limited entered into a term loan with Yorkshire Bank which is secured by a chattel mortgage over 
certain items of plant and machinery. Interest is payable at 1% above that bank’s base rate. The loan has been guaranteed by Zytronic plc. 
The original loan of £250,000, repayable in 36 equal monthly instalments, was paid off in November 2007. On 23 November 2007 an additional 
amount of £100,000 was borrowed under the terms of this same chattel mortgage, again repayable by 36 equal monthly instalments.
(b) Property mortgage
On 13 January 2006, Zytronic plc drew down funds under a ten year mortgage with Lloyds TSB Bank plc under which it borrowed 
£750,000, repayable by monthly instalments. The loan is secured against its freehold interest in Britannia Court, the adjoining factory 
premises which it acquired in January 2006. Interest is payable at 1.25% above that bank’s base rate.
(c) HP agreements
In September 2007, Zytronic Displays Limited put in place six HP agreements with Yorkshire Bank. These agreements provide 
longer term funding for some of the significant capital expenditure incurred in the refurbishment of Britannia Court and its equipping 
as a manufacturing facility for ZYPOS, and other touch sensors. The net amounts advanced under those HP agreements total 
£1.123m and the term of each is three years. In the year ended 30 September 2008, a further four HP agreements were put in place 
with Yorkshire Bank to provide the final funding for equipping the new manufacturing facility. These agreements total £0.338m and 
are also repayable over three years. All of these HP agreements are guaranteed by Zytronic plc.

20. Financial risk management policy and financial instruments
The Group’s principal financial instruments comprise two secured bank loans, ten HP agreements, an overdraft facility and cash. 
The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group has various other 
financial instruments, such as trade debtors and trade creditors that arise directly from its operations.
The main risks associated with the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are set out below:
Credit risk
The risk of financial loss due to a counterparty’s failure to honour its obligations arises principally in relation to transactions where the 
Group provides goods on deferred terms. 
Group policies are aimed at minimising such losses, and require that deferred terms are granted only to customers who demonstrate 
an appropriate payment history and/or satisfy credit worthiness procedures. Individual exposures are monitored with customers subject 
to credit limits to ensure that the Group’s exposure to bad debts is not significant. Goods may be sold on a cash-with-order basis to 
mitigate credit risk. 
Management’s assessment of the maximum credit risk exposure relating to financial assets is represented by carrying value as at the 
balance sheet date.
Liquidity risk
The Company aims to mitigate liquidity risk by managing cash generated by its operations. Capital expenditure is approved at Group level. 
Flexibility is maintained by retaining surplus cash in readily accessible bank accounts.
The Group has an unsecured overdraft facility of £1.5m arranged with its principal banker, Lloyds TSB Bank plc. This facility extends 
until 31 March 2009 and is to provide funding for working capital. On 25 October 2007, the Group entered into an additional facility with 
Lloyds TSB Bank plc, being a revolving credit facility for £2.0m, which extends until 30 June 2010. This facility is to provide additional 
working capital and funding for further capital expenditure, should it be required.
Foreign exchange risk 
The Group’s policy is that no trading in financial instruments should be undertaken. Spot contracts and forward currency contracts may 
be used to sell surplus US Dollars and Euros, generated from sales less purchases in those currencies. However the Group uses natural 
hedging as the main basis of minimising its exposure to these currencies. 47
Zytronic plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 www.zytronic.co.uk
20. Financial risk management policy and financial instruments (continued)
Interest rate risk
The Group has not sought to tie itself into fixed rate debt but has instead accepted a degree of interest rate risk from having only floating 
rate debt. This is because the Group has positive net cash balances, a relatively low level of borrowings and estimates that an increase 
of 1% in interest rates would not have a material effect on the Group’s pre-tax profits.
The current pressures within the financial markets have been well documented and the ‘credit crunch’ has resulted in reduced 
availability of certain types of finance and a significant increase in the cost of corporate debt. It is not clear how long current difficult 
market conditions will persist. However, as the Group has sufficient funding in place into 2010, the effects on the Group are minimal.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are as follows:
I foreign currency risk – the magnitude of this risk that has arisen over the period is detailed below; and
I  interest rate risk on floating rate financial liabilities to the extent not covered by interest rate benefit on floating rate financial assets 
– details of floating rate financial liabilities and assets are below.
The following table demonstrates the sensitivity to a reasonably possible change in interest rates, with all other variables held constant, 
of the Group’s profit before tax (through the impact on floating rate borrowings). There is no impact on the Group’s equity.

     – 100 48
The floating rate financial assets comprise cash. The benchmarks for floating rates on both liabilities and assets is LIBOR and 
Bank of England base rate.
Currency exposures
The table below shows the Group’s currency exposures; in other words, those transactional exposures that give rise to the net currency 
gains and losses recognised in the income statement. Such exposures comprise the monetary assets and monetary liabilities of the 
Group that are not denominated in the operating currency of the Group.
These currency exposures were:

30 September 2008    67 235 302
30 September 2007     245 7 252
The year-end net foreign currency monetary assets comprise cash and trade debtor balances less trade creditor balances. These 
are the inherent constituents of the natural hedging policy whereby foreign currency sales are turned into cash for the settlement of 
purchases of goods denominated in those foreign currencies. Cash at a month end is held to settle creditors’ payments due in the 
next two months and to meet future anticipated capital expenditure in those currencies. 48

(b) Share-based payments
Senior Executive Plan
Share options are granted to senior executives at the discretion of the remuneration committee. The exercise price of the options 
is equal to the market price of the shares at the date of grant. The options vest three years from the date of grant. The contractual 
life of each option granted is ten years. There are no cash settlement alternatives.
All Employee Share-option Plan, the Sharesave Scheme
Periodically the Board of Directors will agree to the setting up of a new Sharesave Scheme for all employees under the SAYE regulations. 
All employees are entitled to apply for a grant of options once they have been in service for three months. The options will vest if the 
employee remains in service for a period of three or five years from the date of grant. The exercise price of the options is equal to the 
market price of the shares less a discount decided by the Board of Directors on the date of grant. The contractual life of the options is 
three or five years with a six month exercise period.
Income statement expense for year ended 30 September 2008 
The expense recognised for share-based payments in respect of employee services received during the year to 30 September 2008 
is £34,000 (2007: £46,000).
The following table illustrates the number and weighted average exercise prices (“WAEP”) of, and movements in, share options during 
the year:

1.  Included within this balance are options over 136,363 (2007: 136,363) shares that have not been recognised in accordance with IFRS 2 as the options had vested before 
1 October 2006. These options have not been subsequently modified and therefore do not need to be accounted for in accordance with IFRS 2.
2. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised is 193.5p.
3. The weighted average share price at the date of exercise for the options exercised is 163.0p.
For the share options outstanding as at 30 September 2008, the weighted average remaining contractual life is 6 years (2007: 7 years).
There were four grants of options during the year, as shown in note 21(a). The weighted average fair value of options granted during 
the year was 49.5p (2007: Nil). The range of exercise prices for options outstanding at the end of the year was 70.0p to 274.5p 
(2007: 44.0p to 274.5p).
The fair value of equity-settled share options granted is estimated as at the date of grant using a model designed by the 
Quoted Company Alliance (based on a Black-Scholes-Merton model), taking into account the terms and conditions upon which 
the options were granted. The following table lists the inputs to the model used for the years ended 30 September 2008 and 
30 September 2007:
     2008 2007
Dividend yield (%)     2.1% 2.1%
Expected share price volatility (%)     30.0% 20.0%
Risk-free interest rate (%)     4.3% 4.3%
Expected life of option (years)     3.5 to 5.0 3.5 to 5.0
The expected life of the options is based on historical data and is not necessarily indicative of exercise patterns that may occur. 
The expected volatility reflects the assumption that the historical volatility is indicative of future trends, which may also not necessarily 
be the actual outcome.
No other features of options grant were incorporated into the measurement of fair value. 51

21. Share capital and share-based payments (continued)
(c) Director’s share incentive scheme 
Share incentive scheme for Mark Cambridge, Chief Executive 
The remuneration committee agreed an incentive award scheme for Mark Cambridge, Chief Executive, to offer him up to 200,000 shares 
at a price of 25p per share to vest based on specified performance criteria.
These are measured by an EPS calculated on the audited pre-tax profit and a standard 28% tax charge. The EPS criteria are shown below:
 Performance criteria
 Lower limit  Upper limit
   EPS Shares EPS Shares 
   pence to vest pence to vest
Year to 30 September 2009 (year 1)   13.5 80,000 15.0 100,000
Year to 30 September 2010 (year 2)   18.3 60,000 22.0 80,000
Year to 30 September 2011 (year 3)   24.5 60,000 24.5 20,000
Vesting is:
I the entitlement to buy, which doesn’t disappear once earned;
I pro rata between the upper and lower limits;
I timed on signature of audited accounts with a clean audit report; and
I  cumulative, e.g. 200,000 shares can vest in year 3 if the upper limit is reached, even if the lower limits have not been achieved 
in the previous years.
If the 24.5p EPS criteria is not achieved in year 3, there will still be an opportunity for shares to vest in year 4 (to 30 September 2012) 
or year 5 (to 30 September 2013) on the achievement of 24.5p EPS on the basis that, on achievement, the maximum total entitlement 
reduces to 125,000 shares or 50,000 shares respectively, or the number of shares already vested if that is greater.
Vesting will also take place in the event of a successful takeover and will be based on the takeover price, with full vesting at a share price 
of 500p and pro rata vesting down to a price of 300p as follows:
I 1,000 shares for each 1p above 300p up to 500p until 30 September 2011, reduced for any shares which have already vested;
I  625 shares for each 1p above 300p up to 500p between 1 October 2011 and 30 September 2012, reduced for any shares which 
have already vested; and
I  250 shares for each 1p above 300p up to 500p between 1 October 2012 and 30 September 2013, reduced for any shares which 
have already vested. 52

28. Transition to IFRS (continued)
(d) Explanation of key UK GAAP to IFRS differences
(i) First time adoption (IFRS 1)
In accordance with the requirements of IFRS 1 First-time adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards, the Group is subject to 
a number of voluntary and mandatory exemptions from full restatement to the requirements of IFRS, which have been applied as follows:
I  IFRS 2 Share-based Payments has only been applied to grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that had not vested 
at 1 October 2006; and
I  the Group has taken the option not to apply IFRS 3 Business Combinations retrospectively to acquisitions that occurred prior 
to 1 October 2006.
(ii) IAS 38 Intangible Assets
Under IAS 16 some items of software, which do not meet the criteria for recognition as plant and equipment have been reclassified 
as intangible assets. The adjustment was £142,000 at 30 September 2007 and £94,000 at 30 September 2006.
(iii) IFRS 3 Business Combinations
IFRS 3 does not permit the annual amortisation of goodwill, but does require an annual impairment review of carrying values. Under 
UK GAAP goodwill was amortised over the anticipated useful economic life of the transaction giving rise to the goodwill. Goodwill 
amortisation of £21,000 has been reversed in the year ended 30 September 2007.
(iv) IAS 19 Employee Benefits
IAS 19 requires an entity to recognise a liability when an employee has provided service in exchange for benefits that arise in the future. 
Holiday pay provisions for salaried employees were not accounted for under UK GAAP but now give rise to an adjustment under IFRS. 
The value of this adjustment in the financial statements is £18,000 at 30 September 2007 and £39,000 at 30 September 2006. In accordance 
with IAS 12 below, a deferred tax asset of £5,000 and £12,000 has been recognised respectively at each of these balance sheet dates. 
(v) IAS 12 Income T axes
Under UK tax legislation relating to share-based payments, corporation tax is recovered on the excess of the value of the shares on 
the date of exercise over the option price paid. Under IFRS 2, the cumulative expense recognised is based on the grant date fair value 
of those options. Accordingly under IAS 12, a temporary difference exists to the extent that the exercise price on outstanding options as 
at the balance sheet date differs from their grant date fair value. The requirement to recognise such a temporary difference applies even 
in cases where (because the options vested before 1 October 2006) no charge has been made under IFRS 2. As a result an additional 
deferred tax asset of £87,000 has been recognised as at 30 September 2006. Movements after that date giving rise to an additional 
asset of £11,000 as at 30 September 2007 have been taken to the income statement as equity, in accordance with IAS 12.
The deferred tax temporary difference on industrial buildings under IAS 12 gives rise to an increase of £18,000 in the deferred tax liability 
at 30 September 2007 (£Nil at 30 September 2006) compared to the timing difference under UK GAAP .
(vi) IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements
IAS 1 requires the split between current and non-current assets and liabilities on the face of the balance sheet. As a result the reconciliations 
set out include adjustments to reclassify assets and liabilities where required.
Cash balances have been reclassified to gross up for negative balances on various bank accounts, which had been netted off in the 
UK GAAP financial statements.
The layout and presentation of the cashflow statement in the 2008 annual report has been amended in accordance with IAS 7, which 
shows cashflows analysed between operating, investing and finance activities. The transition from UK GAAP to IFRS has no effect on 
the reported cashflows generated by the Group.

The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors have elected 
to prepare the financial statements in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards and applicable law). These financial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for that period. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
I select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
I make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
I  state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained 
in the financial statements; and
I  prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue 
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial 
position of the Company and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are 
also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
The Directors confirm that the financial statements comply with the above requirements.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of Zytronic plc
We have audited the Parent Company financial statements of Zytronic plc for the year ended 30 September 2008 which comprise 
the Company balance sheet and the related notes 1 to 13. These Parent Company financial statements have been prepared under 
the accounting policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the Group financial statements of Zytronic plc for the year ended 30 September 2008.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. 
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to 
them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility 
to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and Parent Company financial statements in accordance with applicable 
United Kingdom law and Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the Statement 
of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Parent Company financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ report is consistent with the Parent Company financial statements. The information given in the Directors’ report includes 
that specific information presented in the Chairman’s statement, Chief Executive’s review and Financial review that is cross referred 
from the Business review section of the Directors’ report.
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the 
information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other 
transactions is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited Parent Company 
financial statements. The other information comprises the Corporate statement; Highlights; Our markets, at a glance; What we do, 
at a glance; Directors; Corporate information; Corporate governance; Remuneration report; Five year summaries; and Notice of 
Annual General Meeting. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the Parent Company financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information. 
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices 
Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Parent Company 
financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the 
preparation of the Parent Company financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to 
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the Parent Company financial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of 
the presentation of information in the Parent Company financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
I  the Parent Company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as at 30 September 2008;
I the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and 
I the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the Parent Company financial statements.

1. Accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements of Zytronic plc were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 19 December 2008. The financial statements 
are prepared under the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985 and the Company 
has taken the exemptions under IFRS 1 to not present a cashflow statement.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption available to parent companies under FRS 29 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 
so as not to provide the information otherwise required by the standard, as the Group’s consolidated financial statements, in which the 
Company is included, provide equivalent disclosures under IFRS 7 Financial Instruments and Disclosure.
(b) Revenue recognition
Rental income from tenants is recognised in the profit and loss account on a straight line basis over the term of the lease.
(c) Share-based payments
Equity-settled transactions
The cost of equity-settled transactions with employees is measured by reference to the fair value at the date at which they are 
granted and is recognised as an expense over the vesting period, which ends on the date on which the relevant employees become 
fully entitled to the award. Fair value is determined using an appropriate pricing model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account 
is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of the Company (market conditions).
No expense is recognised for awards that do not ultimately vest, except for awards where vesting is conditional upon a market 
condition, which are treated as vesting irrespective of whether or not the market condition is satisfied, provided that all other 
performance conditions are satisfied.
At each balance sheet date before vesting, the cumulative expense is calculated, representing the extent to which the vesting period 
has expired and management’s best estimate of the achievement or otherwise of non-market conditions and the number of equity 
instruments that will ultimately vest, or in the case of an instrument subject to a market condition, be treated as vesting as described 
above. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a 
corresponding entry in equity.
Where the terms of an equity-settled award are modified or a new award is designated as replacing a cancelled or settled award, 
the cost based on the original award terms continues to be recognised over the original vesting period. In addition, an expense is 
recognised over the remainder of the new vesting period for the incremental fair value of any modification, based on the difference 
between the fair value of the original award and the fair value of the modified award, both as measured on the date of the modification. 
No reduction is recognised if this difference is negative.
Where an equity-settled award is cancelled, it is treated as if it had vested on the date of cancellation, and any cost not yet recognised 
in the profit and loss account for the award is expensed immediately. Any compensation paid up to the fair value of the award at the 
cancellation or settlement date is deducted from equity, with any excess over fair value being treated as an expense in the profit and 
loss account.
The Company has taken advantage of the transitional provisions of FRS 20 in respect of equity-settled awards so as to apply FRS 20 
only to those equity-settled awards granted after 7 November 2002 that had not vested before 1 October 2006.
For awards granted before 7 November 2002, the Company recognises only the intrinsic value or cost of these potential awards 
as an expense. This is accrued over the performance period of each plan based on the intrinsic value of the equity-settled awards.
(d) Property , plant and machinery
Property, plant and machinery is stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and accumulated impairment losses. Such cost includes 
costs directly attributable to making the asset capable of operating as intended. Borrowing costs attributable to assets under 
construction are recognised as an expense when incurred.
Depreciation is provided on all tangible fixed assets, at rates calculated to write off the costs, less estimated residual value, of each 
asset evenly over its expected useful life, as follows:
Freehold land – Nil 
Freehold property – 50 years 
Short leasehold property – over the term of the lease 
Plant and machinery – varying rates between 5% and 25% per annum
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying 
value may not be recoverable. The expected useful lives of assets are reviewed annually. 
Notes to the Parent Company financial statements
for the year ended 30 September 2008 63
Zytronic plc Annual report and financial statements 2008 www.zytronic.co.uk
1. Accounting policies (continued)
(e) Deferred taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the profit for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing differences between 
the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet 
date, with the exception of deferred tax assets which are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely 
than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which timing 
differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
(f) Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
All interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at net proceeds, being fair value of the consideration received net 
of issue costs associated with the borrowings. Finance costs (including issue costs) are taken to the profit and loss account over the 
term of the debt at a constant rate on the balance sheet carrying amount. The carrying amount is increased by the finance charges 
amortised and reduced by payments made in respect of the accounting period. 
(g) Pensions
The Company is a member of a group personal pension scheme which is a defined contribution scheme. Contributions are charged

On 28 September 2004, Zytronic Displays Limited entered into a term loan with Yorkshire Bank which is secured by a chattel mortgage 
over certain items of plant and machinery. Interest is payable at 1% above that bank’s base rate. The original loan of £250,000, repayable 
in 36 equal monthly instalments was paid off in November 2007. On 23 November 2007, an additional amount of £100,000 was 
borrowed under the terms of the same chattel mortgage, again repayable by 36 equal monthly instalments.
(b) HP agreements
In September 2007, Zytronic Displays Limited put in place six HP agreements with Yorkshire Bank. These agreements provide 
longer term funding for some of the significant capital expenditure incurred in the refurbishment of Britannia Court and its equipping 
as a manufacturing facility for ZYPOS, and other, touch sensors. The net amounts advanced under those HP agreements total 
£1.123m and the term of each is three years. In the year ended 30 September 2008, a further four HP agreements were put in place 
with Yorkshire Bank to provide the final funding for equipping the new manufacturing facility. These agreements total £0.338m and 
are also repayable over three years.
(c) Borrowing facilities
The Group has an unsecured overdraft facility of £1.5m arranged with its principal banker, Lloyds TSB Bank plc. This facility extends 
until 31 March 2009. This facility is to provide funding for working capital. On 25 October 2007, the Group entered into an additional 
facility with Lloyds TSB Bank plc, being a revolving credit facility for £2.0m, which extends until 30 June 2010. This facility is to provide 
additional working capital and funding for capital expenditure, should it be required. Annual report and financial statements 2008 www.zytronic.co.uk

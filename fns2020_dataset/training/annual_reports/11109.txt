STRATEGIC REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
The year to January 2014 was a great year for NEXT.  Underlying earnings per share grew by 23% to 366p and we 
propose to increase our full year ordinary dividends by 23% to 129p in total.  This is the fifth consecutive year that 
our earnings per share and ordinary dividend have grown by over 15%.  In addition, in February we paid a special 
dividend of 50p a share and have announced a further special dividend of 50p to be paid in May.  
Sales for NEXT Directory, our online and catalogue business, grew by 12.4% narrowing the gap with NEXT Retail, 
which grew by 1.7%.  The two businesses are complementary and support each other in an effective and  
efficient way.  Operating margins in both businesses increased during the year.  The Group’s underlying profit  
before tax rose 11.8% to £695m.
Cash flow was again strong and we continued our share buybacks, purchasing 6.2 million shares at an average 
price of £47.40 and reducing our shares in issue by 3.8%.  During the year we returned £461m to shareholders 
through share buybacks and dividends.
Our share price again performed well, rising by 55% to £62.80.  As a result of the increase, we stopped buying  
back our own shares at the end of October and have instead started to return surplus cash to shareholders 
through special dividends.  We will reconsider buybacks when to do so would give an effective 8% return on the 
cash invested.
During the year there have been a number of changes to the Board.  Andrew Varley, who had been a director for  
23 years, retired from the Board in May 2013.  Andrew has been with NEXT for 29 years, serving in various  
senior roles.  On behalf of the Board I would like to thank him for all he has done for NEXT, particularly as our  
Group Property Director.
Christine Cross, who has made a much valued and active contribution to the Group as a Non-Executive 
Director, has served for 9 years and will step down from the Board at the AGM in May.  We are currently  
searching for a new non-executive and will make an announcement in due course.  Jonathan Dawson,  
our Senior Independent Director who has also served 9 years, has agreed to stay on the Board for one further year.
I am delighted to welcome onto the Board Michael Law, our Group Operations Director, and Jane Shields, our 
Group Sales and Marketing Director.  Both joined the Board last July.
The strength of our Group is built on the hard work and productivity of our management team and all the 
people who work for NEXT.  I would like to thank them all for their contribution during the year and especially for  
the excellent performance through the busy Christmas period.
That performance gives us a solid platform for 2014.  Our strategy remains the same, focused on our products,  
our profitability and returning cash to our shareholders.  Notwithstanding the continued pressure on the UK 
consumer, we anticipate another year of growth for NEXT.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
OVERVIEW
NEXT has had another good year, achieving 5.4% growth in sales and 11.8% growth in underlying profit before tax.  
Strong cash generation enabled us to buy back 3.8% of shares outstanding without increasing financial leverage 
which, along with a lower tax rate, resulted in earnings per share (EPS) growing much faster than profits.
In the year to January 2014, underlying post-tax EPS grew by 23%.  Our full year dividend is being increased in 
line with EPS, to 129p in total.  We have announced two special dividends, each of 50p per share.  The first was  
paid on 3 February and the second is payable on 1 May.

STRAIGHTFORWARD OBJECTIVES
NEXT’s Operating Objectives
The Company has five operational objectives, as set out in the table below.  These aims remain broadly  
unchanged from those given in this report last year.  The only significant change is the addition of  
improving customer service as a goal for the year ahead.
Develop the NEXT 
Brand
Develop, improve and expand our product ranges, with particular emphasis on 
improving design across all our ranges.
Invest in online 
growth
Invest in growth from our online business, through improving UK delivery services, 
developing new overseas markets and expanding our online product offer.   
Invest in profitable 
new space
Open profitable new retail space, maintaining the Company’s strict payback and 
profitability hurdles of 15% net store profit (before central overheads) and payback on 
net capital invested in 24 months.   
Improve service Improve the quality of our service to customers provided by staff, both in stores and in 
our call centres.
Control costs Control costs through constantly developing more efficient ways of operating.  This must 
be done without detracting from the quality of our products and services.

NEXT’S Financial Objective
For the last ten years NEXT has had one clear financial objective: to deliver long term, sustainable growth in 
earnings per share (EPS).  This objective is grounded in the belief that, over time, share price growth will follow 
growth in EPS.  The graph below shows how our share price has indeed tracked EPS over the last 15 years,  
albeit that some patience has been required.

The graph also demonstrates the historically high rating the shares currently enjoy.  In our Annual Report last 
year we set out the criteria by which we would decide the maximum price we would pay to buy back shares.  
We introduced the concept of Equivalent Rate of Return (ERR).  ERR is the return required from an alternative  
investment, if that investment were to produce the same level of earnings enhancement as the proposed buyback.
We set the minimum ERR at 8%, which we consider a reasonable target for a return on equity investments.  In 
November last year, as our shares continued to rise, the ERR on share buybacks fell below the 8% threshold.  
As a result, we introduced rolling special dividends in place of buybacks.  We intend to continue distributing  
surplus cash through special dividends, paid on a quarterly basis, until such time as the ERR rises above 8%.  
Whilst the underlying financial objective of the Group remains unchanged in principle, the introduction of special 
dividends mean that our financial goal is now better expressed as the delivery of long term sustainable growth 
in Total Shareholder Returns; where Total Shareholder Returns are defined as growth in EPS added to the total 
annual dividend yield.

STRATEGIC REPORT
PRODUCT AND THE NEXT BRAND
Unlike many high street retailers, NEXT designs and directly sources the vast majority of its products.  We can  
do more to leverage our design resources and sourcing base to produce better quality fabrics, print designs, 
trim detailing and make up.  In particular we will continue to push our design teams to adopt new trends in  
depth and with conviction.  This approach of taking greater fashion risks may sound counter-intuitive but, in today’s 
fast moving fashion environment, to fall back on “safe” historical ranges would merely guarantee failure.  On  
the whole, our experience is that where we have been braver in buying into new trends, we have been successful.
We have also adjusted our buying cycle to reflect the continuing trend for consumers to buy closer to the point 
at which they need the clothing.  Our aim is to increase the availability of cold weather clothing in January, 
February and March and warm weather clothing in August and September.  Going forward we will move  
away from a two season buying cycle to a four season cycle and our customers will see a bigger change from 
spring into summer (in April) and autumn into winter (in October).
Over the last 6 years we have made significant progress in developing our Home business.  Trading space has  
more than doubled to 1.7 million square feet and Home sales now account for 18% of our total turnover.  Over  
the next few years we intend to grow Home further by adding retail space and improving our online functionality.
RETAIL
RETAIL SALES
Total Retail sales were 1.7% ahead of last year, of which new space contributed 3.1%.
Full price sales grew by 2.9%.  Markdown sales were 11% down as a result of stock for Sale being 15% lower than 
last year.  This unusually low level of markdown came as a result of a last minute sales surge immediately before the 
summer and winter Sales.  In the year ahead we expect markdown levels to return to more normal levels.
RETAIL SPACE EXPANSION
Space added in the year
Trading space increased by 280,000 square feet over the year, taking us to 7 million, as shown below.

Portfolio Shape and Profitability
Whilst our space increased by 4%, the number of stores barely changed.  Much of our new space has come 
from extending and re-locating in existing trading locations.  Stores in new locations have been offset by the 
closure of smaller less profitable shops.  As a result of this active management of our less profitable stores,  
our Mainline portfolio remains highly profitable despite continuing negative like for like sales in many locations.  
More than 90% of our sales come from stores which deliver more than 15% profit contribution on sales.

Rental inflation remains very low, with most stores experiencing little or no increase at rent review.  In the vast 
majority of cases, when stores reach the end of their lease, we have been able to reduce rents.
Returns on Capital and Profitability
Profitability of stores opened in the last 12 months is forecast to average 22% and payback on the net capital 
invested is expected to be 19 months.  Both figures are within Company investment hurdles of 15% store profitability 
and 24 months capital payback.

Retail Space – Pipeline 
We continue to look for opportunities to profitably increase UK selling space.  For the coming year we expect  
to add 360,000 square feet (net of closures).  We expect 113,000 of this to come from three large Home  
format out-of-town stores.  For two of these shops (Maidstone, Kent and Hedge End, near Southampton) they  
are being built from the ground up to our own design, enabling us to ensure that the architecture of the building 
reflects the aspirations of our Brand.
RETAIL SERVICE
If our customers were to be asked to rate NEXT’s service we believe many would say it was generally good 
but not consistently exceptional.  We think that we have an opportunity to improve both the consistency and  
quality of our retail customer service.  During the last six months we have changed our recruitment processes,  
appraisal systems, training materials, man-hour planning systems and monthly bonus scheme with a view 
to focussing our store teams on providing better service.  Initial results have been encouraging but there is a  
way to go.  
In addition, we aim to improve the levels of staff experience in the business by increasing the average weekly 
contract worked by our staff.  This change will take time and will be achieved through natural staff turnover.  So 
that as and when staff leave the business some of their hours will be re-allocated to existing team members  
who want the extra work.

DIRECTORY DEVELOPMENT – UK
Service Improvements
In October of this year we introduced free, next-day delivery to stores for customers who ordered before 10pm.   
This service is now available in 341 stores, which account for 74% of our retail turnover.  As a result the  
percentage of orders made from home and delivered to store has risen from 30% to around 45%.  In the  
year ahead we intend to extend this service to stores accounting for 99% of our retail turnover.
Going forward we will increase focus on improving the reliability of our Directory services.  We fail to deliver  
around 2% of our parcels at the promised time, but know that there is an opportunity to improve this reliability.  
However, whatever improvements we make, there will always be a small number of errors.  How our staff handle 
these rare events is central to developing our reputation.  A Company’s ability to rectify mistakes is, for many  
customers, the litmus test of great service.  We can do much to respond better to these occasions through  
improved recruitment, staff training and systems.  
Directory Product Offer 
Our retail stores receive injections of new lines roughly every six weeks, with the year being divided into nine 
Retail phases.  Directory has been reliant on the publication of four big catalogues and has missed out on some  
of the newest Retail stock.  In future we will be adding stock to our website to coincide with our Retail  
phases, this stock will be supported by a number of “New-In” brochures.
For some years now NEXT has sold non-competing non-NEXT brands through the NEXT Directory.  This year  
we are further expanding the branded offer in the Directory itself and, more importantly, trialling a standalone 
publication devoted exclusively to third party brands.  This publication, which is currently called LABEL,  
has been distributed to 400,000 customers.
DIRECTORY DEVELOPMENT – INTERNATIONAL
We continue to make good progress developing our internet business overseas.  International online sales grew by 
86% and contributed 3.9% to Directory growth.  However, with a turnover of just over £100m, it is still relatively small 
and it would be a mistake to over-emphasise its importance.  All overseas sales are currently serviced from our UK 
warehouses through third party distribution networks.
Sales Initiatives
Growth has been driven through a combination of improved pricing, site translations, the acceptance of new 
domestic currencies and the development of new territories.  Of these factors, permanent price reductions  
have been by far the most important.  The table below sets out the international growth drivers for last  
year and those planned for the year ahead.  In addition to the initiatives listed in the table, we will be investigating 
ways to improve our delivery service in key territories.

Online Overseas Profitability and the Year Ahead
Net margins on our overseas business fell from 19% to 18%, reflecting keener prices and some marketing initiatives.  
We expect net margins in the year ahead to remain at 18%.  
Going forward we expect growth rates to ease a little, as the price adjustments made in 2013 begin to 
annualise.  We are currently forecasting for International online sales to grow by 50% to £150m.  The table

COST INFLATION AND COST CONTROL
This year we have more than offset cost increases with cost savings.  The tables below outline the main  
contributors to cost increases and cost savings over the last year.  Cost control remains at the heart of the  
business and we remain determined that cost savings must come through innovation and efficiency rather than 
any compromise to our product quality or services.

Freight, fabric and stock loss 15
Directory operating efficiencies 15
Retail manpower efficiencies and other cost savings 13

Other 4
Total Cost Savings 72
In the year ahead we expect cost increases of around £44m.  Anticipated wage increases account for £27m  
of this rise, the majority of which comes from our annual cost of living award.  We expect these cost  
increases to be more than offset by cost savings.
Head Office, Warehouse and Systems Projects 2014/15
The rapid growth of our Online and Home businesses means that we have an unusual number of big systems 
and warehousing projects starting in the current year.   These projects will give some operational benefits but are  
mainly required to facilitate continued growth or replace obsolete systems.  Most systems development costs

OTHER GROUP BUSINESSES
NEXT SOURCING
NEXT Sourcing (NS) had a good year, increasing sales and achieving a profit of £34m.  NS competes for  
business against the many other suppliers to NEXT Retail and NEXT Directory, it continued to provide more than 
40% of NEXT Brand stock.  Each of its in-country offices operates in a very competitive environment, both against  
external suppliers and other NS offices.

We are forecasting NEXT Sourcing profits of £36m in the year ahead.
INTERNATIONAL RETAIL AND FRANCHISE STORES
Our franchise business, with partners operating 173 stores in 35 countries, continued to grow both sales and 
profits.  The number of directly owned stores has been reduced to 16 and they broke even for the first time.  
Our 11 stores in Central Europe made a small profit, offset by a small loss in China.  We do not aim to expand  
our directly owned international stores.  Revenue and profit are set out below.

We are budgeting for International Retail to make a profit of £14m in the year ahead.
LIPSY
Full year sales of £63m and operating profit of £5m, before amortisation and profit share of £2m, was the best 
performance in our five years of ownership.  Lipsy’s retail sales were £20m, taken from 49 stores trading 57,000 
square feet, and sales to wholesale customers were £22m.  Online sales, through Lipsy’s own site and the NEXT 
Directory were £21m.  We expect further sales and profit growth from Lipsy in the years ahead.

UNREALISED FOREIGN EXCHANGE IAS 39
The £6m loss for the year compares with a £3m gain in the prior year.  At this time it is not possible to predict the 
year ahead, so group profit guidance assumes no IAS 39 gain or loss.
INTEREST AND TAXATION
The interest charge was £28m, £1m less than last year.  For the coming year we expect net debt to  
again range between £500m and £750m.  This will result in an interest charge of £30m due to the higher  
level of bond debt and low interest rates available on cash deposits.
Our tax rate reduced as expected to 20.4%, due to the reduction in headline UK corporation tax rates and 
agreement of prior year items with HMRC.  We expect our effective rate will be no higher than 21% in each  
of the next two years.
BALANCE SHEET AND ORDINARY DIVIDENDS
The balance sheet remains strong, with year end net debt of £517m and forecast peak borrowing requirements 
being very securely financed by our bonds and committed bank facilities of £1,088m.  During the last six  
months we repaid the 2013 bond, issued a new 12 year bond and extended our bank facility, all as set out below.

FINAL DIVIDEND
We have proposed raising our final dividend to 93p, taking the total dividend for the year to 129p.  The increase  
of 23% is in line with growth in underlying EPS.  Dividend cover remains at 2.8 times.

STRATEGIC REPORT
CASH GENERATION, SHARE BUYBACKS AND SPECIAL DIVIDENDS
CASH GENERATION
Over the last year we generated £326m of surplus cash after capex, interest, dividends and tax, of which £26m 
was used to maintain our ESOT.  The balancing £300m was returned to shareholders through share buybacks and 
permanently increasing the level of cover in our ESOT (which enhances EPS by as much as a buyback).  
We expect to generate around the same amount of free cash in the year ahead and are again budgeting 
to return £300m of cash to shareholders during the year.  We paid a £75m special dividend in February and 
have committed to a further £75m special dividend which will be paid in May.  Assuming the share price  
remains at its current level and our profit expectations remain unchanged, it is our intention to carry on paying 
quarterly special dividends for the remainder of the current year.  
SHARE BUYBACK PRICE LIMIT GOING FORWARD
In the Chief Executive’s Review last year we set out the criteria by which we would decide the maximum price 
the Company would pay to buy back shares.  We introduced the concept of Equivalent Rate of Return (ERR).   
ERR is the return required from an alternative investment, if that investment were to produce the same level 
of earnings enhancement as the proposed buyback.  We set the minimum ERR at 8%, which we consider  
a reasonable target for a return on equity investments.
Over the course of the year we have discussed this concept with our shareholders.  Most agree that the 8%  
limit is reasonable but many have commented that it would be more logical to use the Company’s guidance for 
forward profits as a basis for calculating the 8% ERR, rather than historic profits.  We agree with this point and, going  
forward, will set our price limit on the basis of the mid-point of our forward guidance.
For year ending January 2015 the mid-point of our guidance is for profit before tax to be £750m (see below).   
On this basis a buyback of £300m at £62.45 would give an ERR of 8% and this figure now represents our upper 
limit for share buybacks.  For clarity, in order for us to revert back to a buyback programme we would need  
to be convinced that any share price move below our target was likely to be sustained and that our profit 
expectations had not changed.

OUTLOOK FOR 2014
THE CONSUMER ECONOMY
The consumer economy has steadily improved over the course of the last year.  This modest improvement  
looks set to continue.  However, conditions are likely to remain far from buoyant and there are real risks  
to the sustainability of the current recovery. 
Employment Remains Strong
The most positive aspect of the economy remains employment, which continues to rise to record highs.

Consumer credit has been steadily flowing back into the market.  The graph below shows the reversal of  
credit flows back into the market during 2013, with positive flows of around £7bn during the year (which equates 
to around 1% of UK earnings).  Mortgage approvals are also growing strongly and housing transactions are

Real Earnings Pressure Easing but Still Negative
Throughout 2013, growth in earnings began to close the gap with inflation.  Encouragingly, in January there was 
little or no decline in real earnings.  If this trend continues, and real earnings move into growth, it will be good  
news for the UK consumer environment.  It would be the first time we have seen growth in real earnings for  
over five years.

Nonetheless, it is worth noting that last year’s increase in spending appears to have been driven through 
increased credit (see above).  If anything has been learnt from the last ten years it is that credit cannot  
continue to grow faster than wages forever.  Until we see significant increase in the supply side of the 
economy (profitable investment and improved productivity), we cannot bank on a return to sustained growth.   
Consequently we remain cautious in our budgeting for the year ahead.
OUTLOOK FOR NEXT BRAND SALES 2014
We are budgeting for total NEXT Brand sales growth of between 4% and 8% in the year ahead, this compares 
to the 1% to 4% estimate we gave at this time last year.  It reflects the underlying improvement in the economy  
and the fact that we are opening 1% more new space than last year.
Some might argue that our sales range is conservative when compared to the 5.5% growth we achieved last 
year.  However, last year’s total was significantly enhanced by the exceptional last quarter.  In the year ahead we  
expect the fourth quarter to provide tough comparatives and it will be hard to beat.  Accordingly we are  
budgeting very cautiously for the final quarter.  The chart below illustrates the anomalous performance in Q4.

STRATEGIC REPORT
BUSINESS MODEL
NEXT is a UK based multi-channel retailer offering exciting, beautifully designed, excellent quality clothing, footwear, 
accessories and home products.  NEXT is one of the largest clothing and home products retailers in the UK by sales, 
and a member of the FTSE-100 index.  The Group is primarily comprised of:
 ❚ NEXT Retail, a chain of more than 500 stores in the UK and Eire.
The majority of our stores sell clothing, footwear, accessories and home products; we also operate over 50 large Home Standalone and 
department style stores.  The predominantly leased store portfolio is actively managed, with openings and closures based on store profitability 
and cash payback.  Around 60% of group sales are from NEXT Retail.
 ❚ NEXT Directory, an online and catalogue shopping business with almost 4 million active customers and 
international websites serving approximately 70 countries.
By embracing the internet, providing exceptional customer service and developing overseas opportunities, over the last ten years NEXT 
Directory’s sales have grown by more than 150% and now represent over one third of group sales.
There are strong synergies between NEXT Retail and NEXT Directory: through efficient stock management and customer service opportunities 
(such as handling Directory collections and returns in-store) the Group has been able to successfully develop both parts of the business.
 ❚ NEXT International Retail, with almost 200 mainly franchised stores around the world.
NEXT’s franchise partners operate over 170 stores in 35 countries; there are also a small number of stores which NEXT operates directly.  
International Retail accounts for around 2% of Group sales.
 ❚ NEXT Sourcing, which designs, sources and buys NEXT branded products.
Last year, over 40% of the Group’s products were procured or produced by NEXT Sourcing.  Further information on the Group’s supply chain and 
NEXT’s commitment to ethical trading can be found on page 23.
 ❚ Lipsy, which designs and sells Lipsy branded younger women’s fashion products.
Lipsy trades from around 50 stores, online, and through wholesale and franchise channels.  Lipsy contributes around 2% of Group sales.
Further detail on the performance and development of the Group’ s businesses can be found in the Chief Executive’ s 
Review on pages 3 to 17, which forms part of this Strategic Report along with Key Performance Indicators (page 
19), Risks & Uncertainties (page 20), Employees (page 22), Social, Community and Human Rights (page 23) and 
Environmental Matters (page 24).
Business strategies and objectives
The primary financial objective of the Group is to deliver long term returns to shareholders through a combination 
of sustainable growth in earnings per share (“EPS”) and payment of cash dividends.  Underlying EPS increased 
by 23% from last year.  Over the last ten years EPS has increased by almost 300%, and the share price has  
increased by almost 400%.  This long term value has been created through the consistent pursuit of the  
following strategies:
 ❚ Improving and developing NEXT product ranges, success in which is measured by sales performance.
 ❚ Profitably increasing retail selling space.  New store appraisals must meet demanding financial criteria before 
the investment is made, and success is measured by achieved profit contribution and return on capital against 
appraised targets.
 ❚ Increasing the number of profitable NEXT Directory customers and their spend, both in the UK and through 
international online sales.
 ❚ Managing gross and net margins through efficient product sourcing, stock management and cost control.
 ❚ Maintaining the Group’s financial strength through an efficient balance sheet and secure financing structure.
 ❚ Generating and returning surplus cash to shareholders by way of share buybacks or, more recently, special 
dividends.  Further information on the criteria we use to determine the method by which surplus cash is returned 
can be found in the Chief Executive’s Review.

NEXT defines like for like stores as those that have traded for at least one full year and have not benefited from significant capital expenditure.  Sales 
from these stores for the current year are then compared with the same period in the previous year to calculate like for like sales figures.  Underlying 
like for like sales applies the same calculation but excludes stores impacted by new store openings.

Increase in store occupancy – 0.7% – 0.4%
Increase/decrease in other costs – 0.2% + 0.2%
Net operating margin this year 15.6% 15.1%
Gross margin is the difference between the cost of stock and the initial selling price; achieved gross margin is after markdown and stock related 
costs.  Net operating margin is profit after deducting markdowns and all direct and indirect trading costs.  All are expressed as a percentage of 
achieved VAT exclusive sales.

STRATEGIC REPORT
RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES
The Board has a policy of continuous identification and review of key business risks and oversees the development 
of processes to ensure that these risks are managed appropriately.  Executive directors and operational  
management are delegated with the task of implementing these processes and reporting to the Board  
on their outcomes.  The key risks identified by the Board are summarised below:
 ❚ Business strategy development & implementation  
If the Board adopts the wrong business strategy or does not implement its strategies effectively, the business 
may suffer.  The Board needs to understand and properly manage strategic risk in order to deliver long 
term growth for the benefit of NEXT’s stakeholders.  The Board reviews business strategy on a regular basis to  
determine how sales and profit budgets can be achieved or bettered and business operations made more efficient.   
This process involves the setting of annual budgets and longer term financial objectives to identify ways in which 
to increase shareholder value.  Critical to these processes are the consideration of wider economic and industry 
specific trends that affect the Group’s businesses, the competitive position of its product offer and the financial 
structure of the Group.
 ❚ Liquidity & credit risk
The Group has adequate medium and long term financing in place to support its business operations.  The Board 
continues to assess its exposure to counterparty risk in the light of the prevailing economic climate both in the 
UK and globally and its treasury policy is amended as necessary to manage counterparties with which deposits, 
investments and other transactions may be made.  
NEXT is exposed to credit risk in respect of its Directory and other business customers.  Rigorous procedures are 
in place with regard to the Group’s credit customers and these are regularly reviewed and updated as required.  
Key suppliers whose services are essential to the successful running of the business also face credit risk.  These 
include the production of the Directory, provision of IT systems and certain systems and suppliers to the Group’s 
warehouse and distribution network.  The Group’s risk assessment procedures for key suppliers identify alternatives 
and develop contingency plans in the event any of these suppliers fail.
 ❚ Management team
The success of NEXT relies on the continued service of its senior management and technical personnel and on its 
ability to continue to attract, motivate and retain highly qualified employees.  The retail sector is very competitive and 
NEXT staff are frequently targeted by other companies.  The Remuneration Committee identifies senior personnel, 
reviews remuneration at least annually and formulates packages to retain and motivate these employees.  In 
addition, the Board considers the development of senior managers to ensure adequate career development 
opportunities for key personnel, with orderly succession and promotion to important management positions.  
 ❚ Product design & selection
The success of NEXT depends on providing exciting, beautifully designed, excellent quality clothing and homeware.  
Success also depends upon its ability to anticipate and respond to changing consumer preferences and trends.  
Many of NEXT’s products represent discretionary purchases and demand for these products can decline in periods 
of weaker consumer confidence.  As a consequence, NEXT may be faced with surplus stocks that cannot be sold 
at full price and have to be disposed of at a loss.  Executive directors and senior management continually review 
the design and selection of NEXT’s product ranges.  This ensures, so far as possible, that there is a well-balanced 
product mix that is good value for money, and available in sufficient quantities and at the right time to meet 
customer demand.
 ❚ Key suppliers & supply chain management
NEXT relies on its supplier base to deliver products on time and to the quality standards it specifies.  It continually 
seeks ways to develop its supplier base so as to reduce over-reliance on individual suppliers of product and 
services, and to improve the competitiveness of its product offer.  If input costs rise, for example raw materials or 
labour costs, NEXT will work with existing suppliers to mitigate the inflationary impact.  New sources of supply will be 
developed in conjunction with NEXT Sourcing, external agents and direct suppliers.  
Non-compliance by suppliers with the NEXT Code of Practice may increase reputational risk.  NEXT carries out 
regular inspections of its suppliers’ operations to ensure compliance with the standards set out in this code, 
covering production methods, employee working conditions, quality control and inspection processes.  Further 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2014
20 23158.04 - Proof 2 - 14/03/2014
details can be found on page 23.  NEXT also monitors and reviews the financial, political and geographical 
aspects of its supplier base to identify any factors that may affect the continuity or quality of supply of its products.
 ❚ Retail store network 
Growth of NEXT Retail is dependent upon developing the trading space within its store network and customers 
spending more.  NEXT will continue to invest in new stores where its financial criteria are met and refurbish its 
existing portfolio when appropriate.  New store appraisals estimate the effects of sales deflection from existing 
stores, although the performance of new stores and sales deflection may differ from estimates.
Successful development of new stores is dependent upon a number of factors including the identification of suitable 
properties, obtaining planning permissions and the negotiation of acceptable lease terms.  Notwithstanding there 
have been a number of retail failures in recent years, prime sites will generally remain in demand, and increased 
competition can result in higher future rents.
 ❚ Directory customer base
Growth of the NEXT Directory depends upon the recruitment and retention of customers and increasing the 
average spend per customer.  NEXT will continue to recruit new credit customers where they satisfy its credit score 
requirements.  However, there can be no assurance that new customers will result in higher sales per customer or 
lower incidence of bad debts, compared with the existing customer base.
In addition, NEXT requires its internet website to attract new customers and encourage existing customers to 
continue ordering from the Directory.  Management continually review the configuration, content and functionality 
of the website to ensure it provides a positive customer shopping experience.  Service levels and response times 
are monitored to ensure that the website is both resilient and secure at all times.
 ❚ Warehousing & distribution
NEXT regularly reviews the warehousing and distribution operations that support the business.  Risks include 
business interruption due to physical damage, access restrictions, breakdowns, capacity shortages, inefficient 
processes and delivery service failures.  Planning processes are in place to ensure there is sufficient warehouse 
handling capacity for expected future business volumes over the short and longer terms.  In addition, service levels, 
warehouse handling and delivery costs are monitored continuously to ensure goods are delivered to Retail stores, 
Directory customers and third party clients in a timely and cost-efficient manner.  
 ❚ IT systems, business continuity & cyber risk
NEXT is dependent upon the continued availability and integrity of its IT systems, which must record and process 
a substantial volume of data and conduct inventory management accurately and quickly.  The Group expects 
that its systems will require continuous enhancement and investment to prevent obsolescence and maintain 
responsiveness.  The threat of unauthorised or malicious attack is an on-going risk, the nature of which is constantly 
evolving.  Systems penetration testing, business continuity plans and back up facilities are in place and are tested 
regularly to ensure that business interruptions are minimised and data is protected from corruption or unauthorised 
access or use.
 ❚ Call centre capacity & service levels
NEXT is dependent on the efficient operation of its own and third party call centres to receive and respond to 
customer orders and enquiries.  Insufficient manpower, supplier failures and interruption in the availability of 
telephony systems to meet customer service requirements are the principal risks.  The Group continuously monitors 
call centre operations that support the business to ensure that there is sufficient capacity to handle call volumes.  
Capacity forecasting is used to manage peak demands and growth in business volumes, and customer satisfaction 
is measured on a regular basis.  Business continuity plans minimise the risk of business interruption.  
 ❚ Treasury & financial risk management
The main financial risks are the availability of funds to meet business needs, default by counterparties to financial 
transactions (see Liquidity & credit risk), and fluctuations in interest and foreign exchange rates.  In addition, 
business expansion and share buybacks may necessitate the raising of additional finance, which can in turn 
increase interest costs and give rise to fluctuations in profit.  Higher debt could also increase the proportion of 
cash flow required to service debt and potentially increase exposure to interest rate fluctuations.  NEXT operates a 
centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing its liquidity, interest and foreign currency risks.  The 
Additional information Parent Company accounts Governance Consolidated accounts Business reports

STRATEGIC REPORT
Group’s treasury policy allows the use of derivative instruments provided they are not entered into for speculative 
purposes.  Further details of the Group’s treasury operations are given in Note 27 to the financial statements.
In addition, NEXT has to fund its defined benefit pension scheme and ensure that sufficient contributions are made 
to meet outstanding liabilities as they fall due.  If NEXT fails to provide sufficient and timely funding, action may be 
taken by the pension scheme trustees, or the Pensions Regulator, which could result in an acceleration and/or 
an increase in overall contributions towards any deficit.  Management meets regularly with the trustees to assess 
fund performance, as well as to agree future contribution levels and any necessary changes to members’ future 
benefits.
EMPLOYEES
NEXT’s employees are key to achieving business objectives.  NEXT has established policies for recruitment, training 
and development of personnel and is committed to achieving excellence in the areas of health, safety, welfare 
and protection of employees and their working environment.
Equal opportunities and diversity
NEXT is an equal opportunities employer and will continue to ensure it offers career opportunities without 
discrimination.  Full consideration is given to applications for employment from disabled persons, having regard to 
their particular aptitudes and abilities.  The Group has continued the employment wherever possible of any person 
who becomes disabled during their employment.  Opportunities for training, career development and promotion 
do not operate to the detriment of disabled employees.  The following table shows the gender mix of the Group’s 
employees at the end of the financial year:

possible.  It makes significant investment in the training and development of staff and in training and education 
programmes which contribute to the promotion prospects of employees.
Employee communication
NEXT has a policy of providing employees with financial and other information about the business and ensures 
that the suggestions and views of employees are taken into account.  NEXT has an employee forum made up of 
elected representatives from throughout the business who attend meetings at least twice a year with directors and 
senior managers.  This forum enables and encourages open discussion on key business issues, policies and the 
working environment.
Employee share ownership
Approximately 9,800 employees held options over 7.4 million shares in NEXT at January 2014, being 4.8% of the total 
shares in issue.  Its employee share ownership trust (“ESOT”) purchases shares for issue to employees when their 
options are exercised.  At the year end the ESOT held 6.2 million shares, the voting rights of which are exercisable 
by the Trustee.
Pension provision
NEXT offers valuable pension benefits to participating employees, details of which are set out in the Remuneration 
Report and in Note 21 to the financial statements.  At January 2014, there were 1,169 (2013: 1,242) active members 
in the Defined Benefit Section of the Next Group Pension Plan and 2,775 (2013: 2,375) UK employees with Defined 
Contribution arrangements.

SOCIAL, COMMUNITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS
NEXT is committed to the principles of responsible business.  This means addressing key business related social, 
ethical and environmental matters in a way that aims to bring value to all of its stakeholders, including customers 
and shareholders.  Continuous improvement lies at the heart of NEXT’s approach and is achieved by acting 
in an ethical manner, developing positive relationships with suppliers, recruiting and retaining successful and 
responsible employees, taking responsibility for our impact on the environment and through contributions to 
charities and community organisations.
NEXT has a Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) forum of 15 senior managers and directors representing key areas 
of the business to develop and implement strategy.  The forum identifies potential issues and opportunities and 
evaluates the success of NEXT’s response.  The CR Manager holds regular updates with the executive director 
responsible for CR.
A third party provides independent assurance on the Group’s CR report which is published on the Company’s 
website each year.  Commitment to CR matters is recognised externally by its membership of the FTSE4Good Index 
Series.
Suppliers
In common with other retailers, NEXT’s product supply chain is both diverse and dynamic.  Last year, NEXT used 
over 500 third party suppliers with products manufactured across some 40 countries.  The challenge of trading 
ethically and acting responsibly towards the workers within our own and our suppliers’ factories is a key priority.  
NEXT is a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative and operates its Code of Practice (“COP”), an established set of 
ethical trading standards, as an integral part of its operations.  The NEXT COP has ten key principles that stipulate 
the minimum standards with which suppliers are required to comply in relation to workers’ rights and conditions 
of work including working hours, minimum age of employment, health, safety, welfare and environmental issues.  
NEXT seeks to ensure all products bearing the NEXT brand are produced in a clean and safe environment and in 
accordance with all relevant laws.
NEXT is committed to its supplier audit and management programme and has a COP audit team of 45 staff 
(2013: 44) which carried out more than 1,500 factory audits last year.  The COP team works directly with suppliers 
to identify and address causes of non-compliance.  Each audited factory is measured against the COP’s six tier 
rating system and the supplier is made aware of its rating and what is required to improve via a corrective action 
plan.  This direct approach allows NEXT to build knowledge and understanding in local communities and monitor 
suppliers through its auditing process.
Human Rights
NEXT is committed to upholding all basic human rights and welcomes the implementation of the United Nations’ 
Guiding Principles of Business and Human Rights.  Our supplier COP reflects relevant international labour 
conventions.  Where NEXT employees are based in countries with recognised concerns over human and labour 
rights, as determined by the FTSE4Good Index, all employees are specifically required to uphold the Declaration of 
Human Rights and the ILO Core Conventions and receive annual training to ensure their understanding of those 
principles.
Customers
NEXT is committed to offering stylish, excellent quality products to its customers, which are well made, functional, 
safe and are sourced in a responsible manner.  NEXT works closely with buyers, designers and suppliers to ensure 
NEXT products comply with all relevant legislation and its own internal standards where these are higher.  The 
expertise of independent safety specialists for clothing, footwear, accessories, beauty and home products is used 
where required.
NEXT endeavours to provide a high quality service to its customers, whether they are shopping through its stores, 
catalogues or website.  These different ways of shopping must be easily accessible for all customers and be 
responsive to their needs.
NEXT Customer Services interacts with Retail and Directory customers to resolve enquiries and issues.  Findings are 
recorded and the information is used by other areas of the business to review how a product or service can be 
improved.

Methodology
The methodology used to calculate our emissions is in compliance with the ‘Environmental Reporting Guidelines: 
Including mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting guidance’ and the UK Government’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting (June 2013) issued by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
(DEFRA).  We report our emissions data using an operational control approach to define our organisational 
boundary which meets the definitional requirements of the Regulations in respect of those emissions for which we 
are responsible, following the guidelines and principles of the WBCSD/WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
NEXT remains committed to reducing its carbon footprint by reducing energy consumption throughout its operations, 
minimising and recycling waste, cutting transport emissions and reducing the packaging in our products.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Disclosures required under the 2013 amendment to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 in respect of employee matters (including the employment, training 
and advancement of disabled persons), political donations and greenhouse gas emissions are given in the 
Strategic Report.  
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING & OTHER MATTERS
Notice of the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) is on pages 113 to 119 and includes the following business:
Dividends
The Directors recommend that a final dividend of 93p per share be paid on 1 August 2014 to shareholders on 
the register of members at close of business on 11 July 2014.  This resolution relates only to the final dividend.  As 
described in the Chief Executive’s Review on page 14 the directors may in future decide to pay special dividends 
as long as NEXT’s share price remains consistently above the Board’s buyback price limit.  This arrangement will 
ensure the Company continues to return surplus cash to shareholders, whilst maintaining the flexibility to return to 
buying back shares if and when the share price returns to levels commensurate with the required Equivalent Rate 
of Return.  Any such special dividends will be declared by the directors as interim dividends.  The announcement 
of any dividend will clearly indicate whether it is an interim or final dividend and whether it is a special dividend 
or not.
The Trustee of the NEXT Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) has waived dividends paid in the year on the 
shares held by it, see Note 26.
Directors 
Michael Law (Group Operations Director) and Jane Shields (Group Sales and Marketing Director) were appointed 
executive directors on 1 July 2013.  Jane joined NEXT Retail in 1985 as a Sales Assistant in one of our London stores.  
Jane worked her way through Store Management to be appointed Sales Director in 2000, responsible for all store 
operations and training.  In 2006 Jane took additional responsibility for Retail Marketing and in 2010 was appointed 
Group Sales and Marketing Director, adding Directory and online marketing to her portfolio.  Michael Law joined 
the Group in 1995 as Call Centre Manager for the NEXT Directory.  Michael was appointed Call Centre Director in 
2003.  In 2006 Michael took responsibility for Group IT and in 2010 was appointed Group Operations Director, adding 
Warehousing and Logistics to his portfolio.  Michael is now responsible for all Systems, Warehousing, Logistics and 
Call Centres within the Group.
Jonathan Dawson and Christine Cross are the longest serving non-executive directors, having both been first 
elected at the 2005 AGM; the ninth anniversary of their first election is therefore May 2014.  In order to manage their 
succession, Christine Cross will not stand for re-election at the 2014 AGM, and a replacement will be announced 
in due course.  It is intended that Jonathan Dawson will stand down in 2015, and a replacement non-executive 
will be appointed.
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that all directors of FTSE companies stand for election every 
year, and all members of the Board other than Christine Cross will do so at this year’s AGM.  Directors’ biographies 
are set out on page 32.  
Each of the directors standing for election has undergone a performance evaluation and has demonstrated that 
they remain committed to the role and continue to be an effective and valuable member of the Board.  The Board 
is satisfied that each non-executive director offering themselves for re-election, including Jonathan Dawson, are 
independent in both character and judgement, and their knowledge and other business interests continue to 
enable them to contribute significantly to the work and balance of the Board.  
The interests of the directors who held office at 25 January 2014 and their families are shown in the Remuneration 
Report on page 60.

Auditor
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office and their reappointment will be proposed 
at the AGM.  
Disclosure of information to the auditor
In accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”), each of the persons 
who is a director at the date of approval of this report confirms that:
 ❚ so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; 
and
 ❚ each director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Authority to allot shares
Under the 2006 Act, the directors may only allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, 
shares if authorised to do so by shareholders in general meeting.  The authority conferred on the directors at last 
year’s AGM under section 551 of the 2006 Act expires on the date of the forthcoming AGM and ordinary resolution 
16 seeks a new authority to allow the directors to allot ordinary shares up to a maximum nominal amount of 
£5,100,000, representing approximately one third of the Company’s existing issued share capital as at 19 March 
2014.  In accordance with institutional guidelines, resolution 16 will also allow directors to allot further ordinary 
shares, in connection with a pre-emptive offer by way of a rights issue, up to a total maximum nominal amount of 
£10,200,000, representing approximately two thirds of the Company’s existing issued share capital as at that date.  
As at 19 March 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document) the Company’s 
issued share capital amounted to £15,503,232, comprising 155,032,317 ordinary shares of 10 pence each, none of 
which are held in treasury.  The directors have no present intention of exercising this authority which will expire at 
the conclusion of the AGM in 2015 or, if earlier, 1 August 2015.
Authority to disapply pre-emption rights
Special resolution 17 will, if passed, renew the directors’ authority pursuant to sections 570 to 573 of the 2006 Act to 
allot equity securities for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings.  This 
resolution limits the aggregate nominal value of ordinary shares which may be issued by the directors on a non 
pre-emptive basis to £775,000, being less than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital as at 19 March 2014.  This 
authority also allows the directors, within the same aggregate limit, to sell for cash, shares that may be held by the 
Company in treasury.  The directors do not have any present intention of exercising this authority which will expire 
at the AGM in 2015 or, if earlier, 1 August 2015.  In accordance with the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles, 
the directors do not intend to issue more than 7.5% of the issued share capital of the Company for cash under this 
or previous authorities in any rolling three year period without prior consultation with shareholders.
On-market purchase of own shares
NEXT has been returning capital to its shareholders by share repurchases as well as dividends since March 2000 
as part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in earnings per share.  Over this period, and up 
to 19 March 2014, NEXT has returned over £3.1bn to shareholders by way of share buybacks and almost £1.6bn in 
dividends, of which £74m comprised special dividends.  This buyback activity has enhanced earnings per share, 
given shareholders the opportunity for capital returns (as well as dividends) and has been transparent to the 
financial markets.  Share buybacks have not been made at the expense of investment in the business.  Over the 
last five years, NEXT has invested over £550m in capital expenditure to support and grow the business.
Special resolution 18 will renew the authority for the Company to make market purchases (as defined in Section 
693 of the 2006 Act) of its ordinary shares of 10p each provided that:
(a) the aggregate number of ordinary shares authorised to be purchased shall be the lesser of 23,239,000 ordinary 
shares of 10p each (being less than 15% of the issued share capital at 19 March 2014) and no more than 
14.99% of the issued ordinary share capital outstanding at the date of the AGM, such limits to be reduced by 
the number of any shares to be purchased pursuant to ordinary resolution 19: Off-market purchases of own 
shares, see below;
Additional information Parent Company accounts Governance Consolidated accounts Business reports
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2014
27 23158.04 - Proof 2 - 14/03/2014
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
(b) the payment per ordinary share is not less than 10p and not more than 105% of the average of the middle 
market price according to the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five business days 
immediately preceding the date of purchase or, if higher, the amount stipulated by Article 5(1) of the Buy-
back and Stabilisation Regulation 2003; and
(c)  the renewed authority will expire at the AGM in 2015 or, if earlier, 1 August 2015.
The directors intend that this authority to purchase the Company’s shares will only be exercised if doing so will 
result in an increase in earnings per share and, being in the interests of shareholders generally, it is considered to 
promote the success of the Company.  The directors will also give careful consideration to financial gearing levels 
of the Company and its general financial position.  The purchase price would be paid out of distributable profits.  
It is the directors’ present intention to cancel any shares purchased under this authority.  
The repurchase of ordinary shares would give rise to a stamp duty liability of the Company at the rate of 0.5% of 
the consideration paid.
The total number of employee share options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 19 March 2014 was 7,242,592.  
This represents 4.7% of the issued share capital at that date.  If the Company were to buy back the maximum 
number of shares permitted pursuant to both the existing authority granted at the 2013 AGM (which will expire at 
the 2014 AGM) and the authority sought by this resolution, then the total number of options to subscribe for shares 
outstanding at 19 March 2014 would represent 6.4% of the reduced issued share capital.
Off-market purchases of own shares
The directors consider that share buybacks are an important means of returning value to shareholders and 
maximising sustainable long term growth in EPS.  Contingent contracts for off-market share purchases are an 
integral part of the Company’s buyback strategy and offer a number of additional benefits compared to on-
market share purchases:
 ❚ Contingent contracts allow the Company to purchase shares at a discount to the market price prevailing at 
the date each contract is entered into.  Pursuant to the authority granted at the 2013 AGM, and up to 19 March 
2014, the Company bought back 50,000 shares for cancellation under such contracts at a discount of 5.0%.
 ❚ Low share liquidity can often prevent the Company from purchasing sufficient numbers of shares on a single day 
without risk of affecting the prevailing market price.  Contingent contracts enable the Company to purchase 
shares over time without risk of distorting the prevailing share price, and also spread the cash outflow.
 ❚ Contingent contracts entered into prior to any close period allow the Company to take delivery of shares during 
these periods.  
 ❚ Competitive tendering involving up to five banks is used which minimises the risk of hidden purchase costs.  The 
pricing mechanism ensures the Company retains the benefit of declared and forecast dividends.
 ❚ In future, the Company would also have the option to set a suspension price in individual contracts whereby 
they would automatically terminate if the Company’s share price was to fall.
As with any share buyback decision, the directors would use this authority only after careful consideration, taking 
into account market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities and the overall financial 
position of the Company.  The directors will only purchase shares using such contracts if, based on the contract 
discounted price (rather than any future price), it is earnings enhancing and promotes the success of the Company 
for the benefit of its shareholders generally.  It is the directors’ present intention to cancel any shares purchased 
under this authority.  
Ordinary resolution 19 will give the Company authority to enter into contingent purchase contracts with any of 
Goldman Sachs International, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Bank plc and Barclays Bank plc under which 
shares may be purchased off-market at a discount to the market price prevailing at the date each contract is 
entered into.  The maximum which the Company would be permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority would 
be the lower of 4,000,000 shares or a total cost of £200 million.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2014
28 23158.04 - Proof 2 - 14/03/2014
The principal features of the contracts are set out in Appendix 1 to the Notice of the AGM.  Copies of the agreements 
the Company proposes to enter into with any of the banks (the “Programme Agreements”) will be available for 
inspection at the registered office of the Company, and at the offices of Pinsent Masons, 30 Crown Place, Earl Street, 
London EC2A 4ES during normal working hours from the date of the Notice of the AGM up to the date of the AGM 
and at the Meeting itself.
Notice of General Meetings
The notice period required by the 2006 Act for general meetings of the Company is 21 days unless shareholders 
approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be less than 14 clear days.  However, the Company’s AGM 
must always be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.  At the AGM of the Company held in 2013, shareholders 
authorised the calling of general meetings other than an AGM on not less than 14 clear days’ notice and it is 
proposed that this authority be renewed.  The authority granted by special resolution 20, if passed, will be effective 
until the Company’s AGM in 2015.  In order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, 
the Company will make electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.  The flexibility offered by 
this resolution will not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings, but only where the directors consider it 
appropriate, taking account of the business to be considered at the meeting and the interests of the Company 
and its shareholders as a whole.
Recommendation
Your Board are of the opinion that all resolutions which are to be proposed at the 2014 AGM will promote the 
success of the Company and are in the best interests of its shareholders as a whole and, accordingly, unanimously 
recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions.  
Share capital and major shareholders
Details of the Company’s share capital are shown in Note 23 to the financial statements.
The Company was authorised by its shareholders at the 2013 AGM to purchase its own shares.  During the year 
the Company purchased and cancelled 6,201,920 ordinary shares with a nominal value of £620,192 (of which 
50,000 were purchased off-market), at a cost of £295.8m, representing 3.8% of its issued share capital at the start 
of the year.
On 25 January 2014 the Company had 155,032,317 shares in issue, which remained the same as at 19 March 
2014.

ADDITIONAL INFORMATION
Shareholder and voting rights
All members who hold ordinary shares are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM.  On a show of hands at a 
general meeting every member present in person and every duly appointed proxy shall have one vote and on a 
poll, every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share held or represented.  
It is intended that voting at the 2014 AGM will be on a poll.  The Notice of Meeting on pages 113 to 119 specifies 
deadlines for exercising voting rights.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of securities and voting rights.  There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other 
than certain restrictions imposed by laws and regulations (such as insider trading laws and market requirements 
relating to close periods) and requirements of the Listing Rules whereby directors and certain employees of the 
Company require Board approval to deal in the Company’s securities.
The Company’s articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting.  
Directors are elected or re-elected by ordinary resolution at a general meeting; the Board may appoint a director 
but anyone so appointed must be elected by ordinary resolution at the next general meeting.  Under the articles 
of association, directors retire and may offer themselves for re-election at a general meeting at least every three 
years.  However, in line with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors will stand for election 
at the 2014 AGM other than Christine Cross who is retiring from the Board.  
Change of control
The Company is not party to any significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate solely upon a change 
of control of the Company following a takeover bid.  However, in the event of a change of control, the Company’s 
medium term borrowing facilities may be subject to early repayment if a majority of the lending banks give written 
notice to the Company within 30 days of the change of control.  In addition, should a change of control cause a 
downgrading in the credit rating of the Company’s corporate bonds to sub-investment grade which is not rectified 
within 120 days after the change in control, holders of the bonds have the option to call for redemption of the 
bonds by the Company at their nominal value together with accrued interest.  
The Company’s share option plans, and its long term incentive and share matching plans, contain provisions 
regarding a change of control.  Outstanding options and awards may vest on a change of control, subject to the 
satisfaction of any relevant performance conditions.
Directors’ service contracts are terminable by the Company on giving one year’s notice.  There are no agreements 
between the Company and its directors or employees providing for additional compensation for loss of office or 
employment (whether through resignation, redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.

DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES
The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
As a listed company within the European Union, the directors are required to prepare the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU.  The 
directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with Companies Act 
2006 and UK Accounting Standard FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period.  In preparing the Group financial statements, the directors are required to:
 ❚ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 ❚ make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 ❚ present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
 ❚ in respect of the Group financial statements, to provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements of IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and performance; and
 ❚ to state that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the financial statements.
 ❚ in respect of the parent company financial statements, to state whether applicable UK accounting standards 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
and
 ❚ prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, unless they consider that to be inappropriate.  
The directors confirm that the financial statements comply with the above requirements.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
Responsibilities Statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
a) the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU,

Chairman’s introduction
Effective corporate governance is essential to the success of our business.
As Chairman, my role is to manage the Board, ensuring it operates effectively and contains the right balance of 
skills and experience to successfully execute the strategy.  The Board is collectively responsible for the long term 
success of the Company and for setting and executing the strategy.
Over many years, NEXT has successfully grown its business and created significant shareholder value against the 
backdrop of a challenging and changing external environment.  This is the ultimate measure of our success and 
reflects our strong corporate governance structure and the stable, effective management team we have in place.  
We remain committed to the robust approach to governance which has served the business well.
Code compliance
The Group complied throughout the year under review with the provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance 
Code and the UK FCA Disclosure and Transparency Rules.  Disclosures required by DTR7.2.6 with regard to share 
capital are presented in the ‘Share capital and major shareholders’ and ‘Additional information’ sections of the 
Directors’ Report.
Board composition and succession
The Board includes five independent non-executive directors and the Chairman who bring considerable knowledge, 
judgement and experience to the Group.  The Board has a good record of recruiting new non-executive directors 
at regular intervals to achieve appropriate rotation and continuity.  The UK Corporate Governance Code states that 
Boards should pay particular attention to the independence of non-executives if they have served on the Board 
for more than nine years from the date of their first election.  Jonathan Dawson and Christine Cross are the longest 
serving non-executive directors, having both been first elected at the AGM in 2005; the ninth anniversary of their first 
election is therefore May 2014.  In order to manage their succession in an orderly way, it is intended that Christine 
Cross will not stand for re-election at the 2014 AGM, and an announcement on her replacement will be made in 
due course.  It is also intended that Jonathan Dawson will stand down in 2015, again to be replaced by a new non-
executive appointment at that time.  Notwithstanding this, the Board considers that all of its non-executive directors 
remain independent in character and judgement, and their knowledge, experience and other business interests 
continue to enable them to contribute significantly to the work of the Board.  Terms and conditions of appointment of 
non-executive directors are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours.
NEXT has a successful history of promoting internal candidates to most senior management and executive Board 
positions through career development, as demonstrated by the Board appointments in 2013 of Jane Shields and 
Michael Law.  It is expected that most future appointees will come from within the Group.
The Company’s Articles of Association require directors to submit themselves for re-election by shareholders at 
least once every three years, however the Board has determined that all directors will stand for election at each 
AGM in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Board responsibilities
The Board is responsible for major policy decisions whilst delegating more detailed matters to its committees 
and officers including the Chief Executive.  The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and 
for monitoring implementation of its policies by the Chief Executive.  The system of internal control is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board holds regular meetings where it approves major decisions, including significant items of capital 
expenditure, investments, treasury and dividend policy.  Board papers including reports from the Chief Executive 
and other executive directors are circulated in advance of each Board meeting.  The Board is responsible for 
approving semi-annual group budgets.  Performance against budget is reported to the Board monthly and any 
substantial variances are explained.  Forecasts for each half year are revised and reviewed monthly.  Certain other 
important matters are subject to weekly or monthly reporting to the Board or Board Committee, including sales, 
treasury operations and capital expenditure.  There is a regular flow of written and verbal information between all 
directors irrespective of the timing of meetings.
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2014
33 23158.04 - Proof 2 - 14/03/2014
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
All new directors receive a personalised induction programme, tailored to their experience, background and 
understanding of the Group’s operations.  Individual training needs are reviewed regularly and training is provided 
where a need is identified or requested.  All directors receive frequent updates on a variety of issues relevant to the 
group’s business, including regulatory and governance issues.
Meetings of the non-executive directors without the executive directors being present are held at least annually, 
both with and without the Chairman.  The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings and is responsible for 
advising the Board on corporate governance matters and facilitating the flow of information within the Board.
The Board has appointed committees to carry out certain of its duties, three of which are detailed below.  Each of 
these is chaired by a different director and has written terms of reference which are available for inspection on the 
Company’s website (www.nextplc.co.uk) or on request.  
Attendance at meetings
The Board held nine formal meetings during the year and these were fully attended with the exception that 
Christine Cross, Jane Shields and Jonathan Dawson each missed one meeting.  The Audit Committee held four 
meetings which were fully attended with the exception of one meeting which Jonathan Dawson did not attend.  
The Remuneration Committee held six meetings which were fully attended with the exception that Jonathan 
Dawson and Christine Cross each missed one meeting.  The Nomination Committee held two meetings which 
were fully attended with the exception of one meeting which Christine Cross did not attend.
Audit Committee and external audit
The Committee consists of the five independent non-executive directors including the senior non-executive director 
and at least one member (Steve Barber, the Committee Chairman) with recent and relevant financial experience.
The Committee holds regular, structured meetings and consults with external auditors and senior management, 
including internal audit, where appropriate.  The Committee frequently requests that executive directors and senior 
managers attend meetings in order to reinforce a strong culture of risk management.  The Chairman and Group 
Finance Director have attended all of this year’s meetings.
The Committee’ s review of the interim and full year financial statements focused on the following areas of significance:
a) Directory receivables and related provisions for doubtful debts.  These, at £682m, represent the largest asset class 
on the Group’s balance sheet.  The Committee reviewed the basis and level of provisions with management and 
the external auditor and was satisfied that the judgments taken were reasonable, consistent and appropriate.  
b) Pension scheme funding, accounting and actuarial reports.  Prepared in accordance with International 
Accounting Standards, the Group’s balance sheet shows a net surplus of £70m, comprised of £668m assets 
and £597m liabilities.  The assumptions underlying the calculations are highly sensitive to small changes, 
particularly in respect of discount rates (see Note 21 to the accounts), and are not intended to reflect the full 
cost of a fully funded pension buyout.
c) Foreign currency hedging.  Forward contracts and options are used to manage the Sterling cost of future 
product purchases; this enables selling prices and gross margins to be set.  The systems and processes in 
relation to the valuation and accounting treatment of such contracts are regularly reviewed.
d) Judgmental accounting areas.  There is a requirement for industry specific and general accounting estimates, 
including those in respect of stock valuation, product returns rates, onerous leases, gift card redemptions, 
taxation and share schemes.  The Committee satisfied itself as to the reasonableness and consistency of these 
estimates through discussions with management and the external auditor.
These items were also addressed at the planning stage of the external audit and there were no significant 
differences between management and external auditor conclusions.
The Committee received reports and presentations from senior management on significant activities of the Group, 
including NEXT Sourcing, Directory International, Franchise, Legal, Treasury, Pensions, Corporate Responsibility and 
Code of Practice (ethical and responsible sourcing).  The Group’s internal control functions in areas such as 
Finance, IT, Cyber Security and Product are regularly reviewed by the Committee.  Frequent briefings are received 
on Health and Safety, Risk Management, Business Continuity, Whistleblowing and Corporate Governance generally.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2014

Additional information Parent Company accounts Consolidated accounts Governance Business reports
The Committee had discussions with the external auditor (EY) on audit planning, fees, accounting policies, audit 
findings and internal control.  EY also reported to the Committee on the extraction of financial information and 
changes in financial position in respect of the £250m 2026 bond issued during the year.  Meetings were held 
with the auditor without management present and the independence of the auditor has been assessed.  The 
effectiveness of the audit is assessed through the review of audit plans, reports and conclusions, and discussions 
with management.  During the year, the Audit Quality Review team of the Financial Reporting Council (FRC) 
reviewed EY’s January 2013 audit of the Group.  The FRC has given us a copy of their confidential report which has 
been reviewed and discussed by the Committee and separately with the external auditor, and the Committee is 
satisfied that the matters raised do not give it concerns over the quality, objectivity or independence of the audit 
and have been appropriately addressed by EY in this year’s audit.  
The Committee is aware of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) proposal for bringing all leases 
on to the balance sheet.  The Chairman of the Committee and Group Finance Director have had meetings with 
representatives of accounting standard setters, and other interested parties, to express the Group’s opposition to 
the current proposals.  Implementation of the IASB proposal would fundamentally change the Group’s balance 
sheet by bringing on some £1.8bn (undiscounted) of theoretical “right to use” assets, together with broadly 
matching lease liabilities.  The proposals would have no impact on the Group’s cash flows and minimal impact on 
reported profits; but would add volatility to the balance sheet as the Group actively manages the 500+ properties 
from which it trades or leases, as well as adding compliance costs.
The Audit Committee is responsible for recommending the appointment, re-appointment and removal of the 
external auditor.  Consideration is given each year to an audit tender process, however, a tender was not considered 
necessary during the current year.  EY, or its predecessor firms, have been the Group’s auditor for over 20 years.  
There has been regular partner rotation, most recently in 2012.  The Committee is satisfied that EY continues to 
possess the skills and experience required to fulfill its duties effectively and efficiently.  The appointment of the 
external auditor will continue to be reviewed annually and a tendering process will be undertaken to coincide with 
the rotation of the current audit partner in 2017, or earlier if the Committee considers it appropriate.
EY have reported to the Committee that, in their professional judgement, they are independent within the meaning 
of regulatory and professional requirements and the objectivity of the audit engagement partner and audit staff 
is not impaired.  The Audit Committee has reviewed this statement and concurs with its conclusion.
In order to ensure the continued independence and objectivity of the Group’s external auditor, the Board has strict 
policies regarding the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor.  The Audit Committee’s approval is 
required in advance for any non-audit services to be provided where the fees exceed £100,000 for an individual 
assignment or £150,000 in aggregate for the year.  The Committee reviews audit and non-audit fees twice a year.  
Proposed assignments of non-audit services with anticipated fees in excess of £50,000 are generally subject to 
competitive tender and decisions on the award of work are made on the basis of competence, cost-effectiveness 
and legislation.  A tender process may not be undertaken where existing knowledge of the Group enables the 
auditor to provide the relevant services more cost-effectively than other parties, for example in connection with 
bond issues or overseas taxation compliance services.  The Group’s external auditor is prohibited from providing 
any services that would conflict with their statutory responsibilities.  During the year, EY’s audit fee amounted to 
£0.5m and EY’s non-audit fees were £0.1m in total.  
The Committee has reviewed its Terms of Reference and composition, and believes that both are appropriate.
Remuneration Committee
The Committee consists of the Chairman and five independent non-executive directors.  The Committee, which is 
chaired by the senior non-executive director, determines the remuneration of the executive directors in accordance 
with the Remuneration Policy and reviews the remuneration of senior management.  The Remuneration Report on 
page 68 summarises the activities of the Committee.  
Nomination Committee
The Committee consists of the Chairman and five independent non-executive directors, including the senior non-
executive director.  The Committee meets whenever necessary to consider succession planning for directors and 
other senior executives, to ensure that requisite skills and expertise are available to the Board to address future 
challenges and opportunities.
External consultants may be used to assist in identifying suitable external Board candidates, based on a written 
specification for each appointment.  The Chairman is responsible for providing a shortlist of candidates for 
consideration by the Committee which then makes its recommendation for final approval by the Board.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2014

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Appointments to the Board, as with other positions within the Group, are made on merit according to the balance 
of skills and experience offered by prospective candidates.  Whilst acknowledging the benefits of diversity, individual 
appointments are made irrespective of personal characteristics such as race, religion or gender.  The number of 
directors, senior managers and employees by gender is given in the Strategic Report.
Chairman
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive, which is set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board.  The Chairman manages the Board to ensure; that the Group has appropriate 
objectives and an effective strategy, that there is a high calibre Chief Executive with a team of executive directors 
able to implement the strategy, that there are procedures in place to inform the Board of performance against 
objectives, and that the Group is operating in accordance with a high standard of corporate governance.
The current Chairman became a member of the Board in 2002 and was an independent non-executive director 
of the Company prior to his appointment as Chairman on 17 May 2006.  His other significant commitments are 
noted on page 32, and the Board considers that these are not a constraint on his agreed time commitment to 
the Company.
Chief Executive
The Board sets objectives and annual targets for the Chief Executive to achieve.  The Board is responsible for 
general policy on how these objectives are achieved and delegates the implementation of that policy to the Chief 
Executive.  The Chief Executive is required to report at each Board meeting all material matters affecting the Group 
and its performance.
Management delegation
The Chief Executive has delegated authority for the day to day management of the business to operational 
management drawn from executive directors and other senior management who have responsibility for the 
respective areas.  The most important management meetings are the weekly NEXT Brand trading and capital 
expenditure meetings which consider the performance and development of the NEXT Brand through its different 
distribution channels.  These meetings cover risk management of all business areas in respect of the NEXT Brand 
including product, sales, property, warehousing, systems and personnel.  Key performance indicators are monitored 
daily and weekly.  
Directors’ conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board has a formal system in place for directors to 
declare situational conflicts to be considered for authorisation by those directors who have no interest in the matter 
being considered.  In deciding whether to authorise a situational conflict, the non-conflicted directors consider 
the situation in conjunction with their general duties under the Companies Act 2006.  They may impose limits 
or conditions when giving an authorisation or subsequently if considered appropriate.  Any situational conflicts 
considered by the Board, and any authorisations given, are recorded in the Board minutes and in a register of 
conflicts which is reviewed annually by the Board.  
Performance evaluation
The senior independent non-executive director appraises the performance of the Chairman through discussions 
with all the directors individually and, together with the Chairman, appraises the performance of the Chief 
Executive.  The performance of the executive directors is monitored throughout the year by the Chief Executive 
and the Chairman.  The Chairman also monitors the performance of the non-executive directors.
An externally facilitated review was carried out in 2013 by PricewaterhouseCoopers; this concluded that there were 
no significant weaknesses or risks that required attention.  The Board intends to conduct an externally facilitated 
review every three years in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code.
Risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management process and has delegated responsibility for its 
implementation to the Chief Executive and senior management best qualified in each area of the business.  
The Board sets guidance on the general level of risk which is acceptable and has a considered approach to 
evaluating risk and reward.
The Board confirms that it has carried out a review of the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control 
including financial, operational, compliance and risk management.  This includes identifying and evaluating key 
risks, determining control strategies and considering how they may impact on the achievement of the business 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2014

objectives.  The risk management process has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report.
Risk management and internal control is a continuous process and has been considered by the Board on a 
regular basis during the year.  The Board promotes the development of a strong control culture within the business.  
During the year the Board addressed the business risks which had been identified as key, taking into account any 
changes in circumstances over the period.  The Audit Committee has reviewed the level of internal audit resource 
available within the Group and believes that it is adequate for the size, structure and business risks of the Group 
and is supplemented with appropriate external resources where needed.
The Board considers that the Group’s management structure and continuous monitoring of key performance 
indicators provide the ability to identify promptly any material areas of concern.  Business continuity plans, 
procedures manuals and codes of conduct are maintained in respect of specific major risk areas and business 
processes.  Through these measures the management of business risk is an integral part of Group policy and the 
Board will continue to develop risk management and internal controls where necessary.
The use of a Group accounting manual and prescribed reporting requirements for finance teams throughout the 
Group ensures that the Group’s accounting policies are clearly established and consistently applied.  Information 
is appropriately reviewed and reconciled as part of the reporting process and the use of a standard reporting 
package by all entities in the Group ensures that information is presented consistently to facilitate the production 
of the consolidated financial statements.
Personal use of company assets
The Board carried out a review during the year and confirmed that there has been no improper personal use of 
company assets by directors.  Policies are in place to ensure approval procedures are applied to expense claims 
and that these are in accordance with service agreements.  The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the level 
of benefits in kind provided to executive directors.
Relations with shareholders
The Board’s primary role is to promote the success of the Company and the interests of shareholders.  The Board is 
accountable to shareholders for the performance and activities of the Group.
The Board communicates with its shareholders in respect of the Group’ s business activities through its Annual Report, 
yearly and half yearly announcements, interim management statements and other regular trading statements.  
Full year, interim and other public announcements are presented in a consistent format with a particular focus on 
making the presentations as meaningful, understandable and comparable as possible.  This information is also 
made publicly available via the Company’s website.  
All shareholders have an opportunity to ask questions or represent their views to the Board at the Annual General 
Meeting.  The Company’s largest shareholders are invited to the annual and interim results presentations, at which 
executive and non-executive directors are present.  Non-executive directors attend other meetings with shareholders 
if requested.  Shareholder views are also communicated to the Board through the inclusion in Board reports of 
shareholder feedback and statements made by representative associations.  Whilst the Board recognises that it is 
primarily accountable to the Company’s shareholders, the views of other providers of capital are also considered.
The Board takes care not to disseminate information of a share price sensitive nature which is not available to the 
market as a whole.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Strategic Report.  The Strategic Report also describes the Group’s financial position, cash 
flows and borrowing facilities, further information on which is detailed in the financial statements.  Information on 
the Group’s financial management objectives, and how derivative instruments are used to hedge its capital, credit 
and liquidity risks is provided in Note 27 of the financial statements.
The Directors report that, having reviewed current performance and forecasts, they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue its operations for the foreseeable future.  For this reason, they 
have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

REMUNERATION REPORT
This report sets out the remuneration of NEXT’s directors for the year to January 2014 and is in three parts: (1) 
Remuneration Committee Chairman’s statement, (2) directors’ remuneration policy, and (3) annual report on 
remuneration, each prepared in accordance with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and 
Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (“the new regulations”), UK Listing Rules and UK 
Corporate Governance Code.  
Separate resolutions to approve the directors’ remuneration policy and to approve the directors’ remuneration 
report (excluding the directors’ remuneration policy) will be proposed at the 2014 AGM.  
PART 1: REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
This year’s Remuneration Report for NEXT is the first prepared in accordance with the new regulations.  Whilst 
its format has changed to reflect the greater complexity of the regulations, the approach of the Remuneration 
Committee has remained consistent with previous years. 
We seek to avoid significant increases in base salaries and associated costs and prefer to offer annual and 
longer term incentives which reward strong business and financial performance, measured against challenging 
benchmarks and reflecting the experience of shareholders.  During the year NEXT has achieved record pre-
tax profits of £695m and EPS of 366.1p, representing annual growth of 11.8% and 23% respectively; over the 
past 3 years EPS have grown by a compound annual average of 18.2%.  We consider that this consistently 
strong EPS performance fully justifies the bonuses and long term incentives earned by the executive directors 
and other senior executives during the year.  This performance has also been aligned with shareholders as  
dividends have grown by a compound annual average of 18% and the share price has risen 215% from £19.94 to 
£62.80 over the past 3 financial years.
The Committee has addressed the following areas over the past year:
Annual bonus and base salaries
At the start of the year, the Committee set targets for EPS growth, details of which are shown on page 43. 
This year’s strong growth in EPS resulted in a maximum pay-out under the annual bonus for executive directors.  
Base salaries for executive directors were increased by 2% in February 2014 (having increased by 2.5% in 2012 and 
2.0% in 2013), in line with wider company cost of living awards and our general approach of restraint.
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) 
Since 2008 NEXT has granted smaller awards twice a year, rather than annually, and accordingly this year the 
Committee approved two further grants.  In addition, two awards matured.  Over the performance periods  
for these awards, i.e.  between August 2010 to January 2014, NEXT’s share price rose from £21.50 to £62.80 
and its market capitalisation grew from £4.0 billion to £9.7 billion.  £492m was paid in dividends and a further  
£894m was returned to shareholders through share buybacks.  The LTIP for the three year performance  
period to July 2013  vested  100% when NEXT’s TSR ranked  fourth  out of 21 companies in the comparator 
group and 100% of the LTIP for the three year performance period to January 2014 has also vested as NEXT’s 
TSR ranked third in the comparator group.  
The estimated total value of these two LTIPs is substantial (see the Single Total Figure of Remuneration table 
on page 56).  However, as there was no change in the basis of grant, this is largely due to the 192% rise in  
share price over the performance periods.  In 2011 we decided that the maximum value of LTIPs vesting for 
any participant in any one year, irrespective of the underlying strength of performance or share price growth, 
would be capped at £2.5m.  The cap will be applied again this year and as a result Lord Wolfson’s and  
Christos Angelides’ LTIP payments are expected to be reduced by an estimated £1,097k and £762k respectively 
(based on the calculation method prescribed by the new regulations).  
In recognition of wider investor concern over the complexity of some annual and long term incentive plans, 
the Committee decided that executive directors should only participate in the LTIP and will not be granted 
any further awards under the NEXT Share Matching Plan.  Instead, the maximum value of LTIP awards  
granted to executive directors each year will now be 200% of base salary (previously 200% for Lord Wolfson and 
150% for other executive directors), thereby consolidating the maximum value of awards that may otherwise be  
received if executive directors continued to participate in both plans.  The combined level of awards for each 
executive director falls in consequence.

To further align the interests of executive directors with shareholders, the Committee determined that any LTIP 
awards granted to executive directors after January 2014 will be subject to the condition that any vesting on 
maturity will only be settled in shares and that, after payment of tax and NIC, the net shares received should 
ordinarily be retained for a period of two further years.  Executive directors will retain dividend and voting  
rights during this holding period.  
In light of the changes noted above, the Committee reviewed the cap on the maximum value of LTIPs vesting 
for any participant in any one year and decided it is appropriate to remove the cap for LTIP awards granted 
to executive directors after January 2014.  The £2.5m cap will remain in force for LTIPs with performance  
periods ending in the financial years to January 2015 and 2016.
Share Matching Plan (“SMP”)
Although the Committee decided that executive directors should no longer participate in the SMP , the Committee 
considers that the SMP still continues to meet its objectives for other members of the senior management team 
and intends to invite senior executives below Board level to participate in 2014.  We closely monitor the level of 
pay-outs under the SMP and over the past 2 years we have made a number of changes to the original SMP which 
have reduced the amounts that can be invested as well as the maximum level of matching award.  
The 2011 SMP will vest in full in April 2014, subject to the continued employment of participants.  Lord Wolfson 
has waived his potential entitlement under the 2011 SMP (as he also did last year with his 2010 SMP) on the 
understanding that all NEXT employees who have been employed since April 2011 will share an equivalent amount 
by way of a special bonus in May 2014, pro rata to their annual salary.  The estimated value of the amount waived 
by Lord Wolfson (based on the average NEXT share price over the last 2013/14 financial quarter of £56.47) is £3.8m.
EPS and performance measurement
The Committee reviews each year the basis and performance measures used for the annual bonus, LTIP and SMP .  
The performance measures for both the annual bonus and the SMP have hitherto been based solely on growth in 
EPS – pre-tax EPS for the annual bonus and fully diluted post-tax EPS for the SMP .
The principal reasons for using the EPS measure have been set out in previous Remuneration Reports.  They are:
 ❚ it is consistent and transparent to participants and shareholders;
 ❚ NEXT is predominantly a single business selling products through a number of channels under the NEXT brand.  
No significant earnings are derived from uncorrelated businesses and therefore a group metric such as EPS is 
logical and consistent with strategy;
 ❚ EPS continues to be the core financial measure by which the Board assesses overall performance; and
 ❚ the use of EPS is complemented by the application of TSR and consideration of the general economic underpin 
condition for the LTIP . 
As explained in previous years, we consider it right that the impact of share buybacks on EPS should be included 
in performance measurement as, for more than a decade, share buybacks have been one of NEXT’s primary 
strategies in generating value for shareholders.  Share buybacks are regularly considered by the Board  
and are subject to prior approval as to timing, price and volume.  Shares are only bought after the Board  
is fully satisfied that the ability to invest in the business and to continue to grow the regular dividend would 
not be impaired.  Following the Board’s decision to set a minimum required return from any share buybacks  
(as described in detail in the Chief Executive’s Review) and to make special dividend payments where the 
return cannot be met, the Committee felt that some changes were needed to the performance measure for the  
annual bonus.  The Committee concluded that the basis of calculation for this purpose should incorporate  
an appropriate adjustment to reflect the benefit to shareholders from any special dividends paid in the period.  
This is in order to ensure that there is no unintentional reward or penalty for management arising from one means 
or another of returning value to shareholders.  The Board will maintain the same robust discipline over the level  
of special dividends as it does with regard to share buybacks.

REMUNERATION REPORT
The policy vote
As referred to earlier, this report is split between a remuneration policy section and an annual report which 
sets out actual remuneration.  Each section will be subject to a separate vote at the AGM.  If approved, the  
policy section will become binding on the Board which means that payments outside the policy would be 
unauthorised.  We believe that our policy, as set out in this report, strikes a balance between having the legal 
authority to make payments which we consider to be in shareholders’ interests, whilst limiting the Committee’s 
discretion appropriately.  Our policy therefore focuses on our actual approach to pay but includes the required 
formal caps at higher levels than we envisage needing, so as to preserve some flexibility.  The Committee  
believes that it has demonstrated an appropriately conservative approach to pay decisions over many years and 
I wish to reassure shareholders that we will continue to do so.
Recommendation
Each year the Committee carefully reviews the level of performance-related remuneration earned by the 
executive directors.  The Committee considers that the remuneration earned is a reflection of NEXT’s strong  
operating and financial performance over the past three years.  Moreover, we  believe that NEXT’s  
remuneration strategy, and the structures implementing that strategy, have contributed positively to  
maintaining the stable and highly motivated management team at NEXT who have continued to  
deliver consistently strong performances for shareholders. 
We pay close attention to ensuring that there is an appropriate balance in the remuneration structure between 
annual and long term rewards, as well as between cash and share-based payments, to ensure that the way NEXT 
remunerates its senior executives drives the right behaviours and rewards the right outcomes.  We believe that 
the present weighting towards rewarding sustainable long term performance is well aligned with shareholders’ 
interests.  This is evident from the high proportion of directors’ performance-related pay in the year that  
derived from growth in EPS and share price.
I hope very much that shareholders will support the Committee’s continuing overall approach to remuneration 
and, on behalf of the Committee, I commend both the policy and our report to you.

PART 2: REMUNERATION POLICY
It is the Company’s intention that the directors’ remuneration policy as set out in this part of the report should 
apply from the date of the Company’s 2014 Annual General Meeting, subject to its approval by shareholders at 
that meeting.  
Background
The Committee’s objective is to ensure that the remuneration paid to senior executives is appropriate in both 
amount and structure, is directly linked to the Company’s annual and long term performance and aligned 
with the interests of shareholders.  We believe that stable and transparent remuneration structures are key  
elements in a fair system for rewarding personal and collective contribution across the business.  There are  
bonus structures throughout the Company, including Head Office, stores, call centres and warehouses.
The focus is on ensuring that a competitive and appropriate base salary is paid to directors and senior managers, 
together with incentive arrangements that are:
 ❚ appropriate in both amount and structure;
 ❚ directly linked to the Company’s annual and long term performance;
 ❚ in alignment with the interests of shareholders and our long term strategy; and
 ❚ stable and transparent.
Pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group are considered to ensure that differences for directors 
are justified.  Remuneration policy does not conflict with the Company’s approach to environmental, social  
and corporate governance matters and we believe the current arrangements do not encourage directors to take 
undue business risks.
The table below summarises the Company’s policies with regard to each of the elements of remuneration for 
existing directors and the approach to payments on external recruitment and termination.

Salary
To provide a satisfactory 
base salary within a total 
package comprising 
salary and performance-
related pay .
Performance-related 
components and certain 
benefits are calculated 
by reference to base 
salary.  The level of salary 
broadly reflects the value 
of the individual, their role, 
skills and experience.  
Reviewed annually, generally effective 1 February. The 
Committee focuses particularly on ensuring that an 
appropriate base salary is paid to directors and senior 
managers. The Committee considers salaries in the 
context of overall packages with reference to market 
data, individual experience and performance, and the 
level and structure of remuneration for other employees 
and the external environment.  External benchmarking 
analysis is only occasionally undertaken and the 
Committee has not adopted a prescribed objective of 
setting salaries by reference to a particular percentile 
or benchmark.
There is no guaranteed annual increase.  The Committee 
considers it important that base salary increases are 
kept under tight control given the multiplier effect of 
such increases on future costs.  In recent years, increases 
in executive directors’ salaries have been in line with the 
wider company cost of living awards.  
Under the new regulations the Company is required to 
specify a maximum potential value for each component 
of pay.  Accordingly, for the period of this policy no salary 
paid to an executive director in any year will exceed 
the median base salary of FTSE 100 Chief Executives 
as confirmed by independent advisers.  Currently this is 
circa £850,000 per annum.
Not applicable. Base salaries of the executive directors increased by 2% in February 
2014, in line with the wider company cost of living awards.
Base salaries for the executive directors from February 2014 are:
£’000
Lord Wolfson 743
Christos Angelides 539
David Keens 496
Michael Law 306
Jane Shields 306
Annual bonus
To incentivise delivery 
of stretching annual 
financial goals.  
To provide focus on 
the Company’s key 
financial objectives.
To provide a retention 
element in the case 
of the Chief Executive 
as any annual bonus 
in excess of 100% of 
base salary is payable 
in shares, deferred for a 
period of two years and 
subject to forfeiture if 
he voluntarily resigns 
prior to the end of that 
period.
Performance measures and related performance 
targets are set at the commencement of each financial 
year by the Committee.  Company policy is to set 
such measures by reference to pre-tax EPS but the 
Committee retains flexibility to use different performance 
measures during the period of this policy if it considers it 
appropriate to do so.
At the threshold level of performance, 20% of the 
maximum bonus may be earned.  A straight sliding 
scale of payments operates for performance between 
the minimum and maximum levels.  There is no in-line 
target level although, for the purposes of the scenario 
charts on pages 52 and 53, 50% of maximum bonus 
has been assumed because it is the mid-point.
At present Company policy is to provide a maximum 
bonus of 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% 
of salary for other executive directors.
Although the Committee has no current plan to make 
any changes, for the period of this policy the Committee 
reserves flexibility to:
 ❚ increase maximum bonus levels for executive 
directors in any financial year to 200% of salary.  
This flexibility would be used only in exceptional 
circumstances and where the Committee considered 
any such increase to be in the best interests of 
shareholders and after appropriate consultation with 
key shareholders;
 ❚ lessen the current differentials in bonus maximums 
which exist between the Chief Executive and other 
executive directors; and 
 ❚ introduce or extend an element of compulsory 
deferral of bonus outcomes if considered appropriate 
by the Committee. 
While the Committee reserves flexibility to apply different performance 
measures, it currently uses stretching pre-tax EPS growth targets set 
annually, which take account of factors including the Company’s 
budgets and the wider background of the UK economy.  Pre-tax EPS 
has been chosen as the basic metric to avoid executives benefitting 
from external factors such as reductions in the rate of corporation 
tax.  There has to be growth in EPS before any bonus is payable to 
executive directors.  By contrast the threshold for staff bonuses is set 
at a lower level than for directors.  The Committee reserves flexibility 
to apply discretion in the interests of fairness to shareholders and 
executives by making adjustments it considers appropriate.  
As noted in the Committee Chairman’s Statement on page 39, the 
basis of performance measurement is changing to incorporate 
an appropriate adjustment to EPS growth to reflect the benefit to 
shareholders from special dividends paid in any period.
For the year to January 2014, performance targets were set 
requiring pre-tax EPS of 408p before any bonus became payable, 
being growth of 4.3% on the prior year.  Maximum bonus of 150% 
and 100% of salary for the Chief Executive and the other executive 
directors respectively was payable if pre-tax EPS exceeded 446p, 
being growth of 14%.
Actual pre-tax EPS achieved was 460p, growth of 17.6%.  Accordingly , 
a bonus of 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% for the 
other executive directors was earned.  
Bonus performance targets for the year ahead have been set but 
are not disclosed in advance for reasons of commercial sensitivity.  
The targets and performance will be disclosed in next year’s 
Remuneration Report.
LTIP
To incentivise manage-
ment to deliver superior 
total shareholder 
returns (“TSR”) over 
three year performance 
periods relative to a 
selected group of retail 
companies.
Retention of key 
employees over three-
year performance 
periods.
A variable percentage of a pre-determined maximum 
number of shares can vest, depending on relative 
TSR performance against the comparator group the 
Committee selects at grant (current practice is to 
select a comparator group of retail companies (shown 
on page 64)).
The maximum number of shares that may be awarded 
to each director is a percentage of each director’s 
base salary at the date of each grant, divided by 
NEXT’s average share price over the three months prior 
to the start of the performance period.
LTIP awards are made twice a year to reduce the 
volatility inherent in the TSR performance measure and 
to enhance the portfolio effect for participants of more 
frequent, but smaller, grants.
The Company has the option to settle vested LTIP 
awards in cash.
The LTIP does not credit participants with additional 
value in respect of dividends paid over any vesting 
period (except that the Committee has discretion to 
award such credit for special dividends).
Since 2008, the maximum aggregate annual award 
allowed under the current plan rules has been over 
shares worth 200% of base salary (and up to 300% in 
exceptional circumstances).  With effect from 2012, 
the maximum value of any LTIP awards that vest for a 
participant in a year has been capped at £2.5m.
Within this maximum, the Chief Executive and other 
executive directors receive grants equal to 100% and 
75% of annual salary respectively every six months.  The 
Committee reserves the right to vary these levels within 
the overall annual limits described above.
For 2014 onwards, the Committee has decided that the 
maximum possible aggregate value of awards granted 
to all executive directors will be 200% of annual salary 
(i.e.  100% every six months).  The Committee reserves 
the right to vary these levels within the overall annual 
limits described above.  In addition, awards granted to 
executive directors which vest must be taken in shares 
and the net shares (after payment of tax and NIC) 
must be held for a minimum period of two further years.  
The Committee reserves the right to lengthen (but not 
reduce) the performance period and to introduce a 
retention period or to further increase this holding period.
In light of the cessation of further grants under the SMP 
(see below), the Committee has reviewed the cap on 
the maximum value of LTIPs vesting for any participant 
in any one year and has decided it is appropriate to 
remove the cap for LTIP awards granted to executive 
directors after January 2014.  The £2.5m cap will remain 
in force for vesting LTIPs with three year performance 
periods ending in financial years to January 2015 and 
January 2016.
Performance is measured over periods of three years, which 
commence in February and August, by measuring NEXT’s TSR against 
a group (currently 20 other UK listed retail companies) which are, 
in the view of the Committee, most comparable with NEXT in size or 
nature of their business.  Comparison against such a group is more 
likely to reflect the Company’s relative performance against its peers, 
thereby resulting in grants being made on an appropriate basis.
Relative performance Percentage vesting
Below median 0%
Median 20%
Upper quintile 100%
If no entitlement has been earned at the end of a three year 
performance period then that award will lapse; there is no retesting.
Before any of the awards vest, the Committee must have regard to the 
performance of the Company in the light of underlying economic and 
other circumstances, including EPS performance of the Company and 
of other UK retailers over the period.  Whilst not disclosed in advance, 
the factors taken into account for these purposes are disclosed in the 
relevant year’s Remuneration Report.
The Committee reserves flexibility to apply different performance 
measures and targets in respect of new grants for the period of this 
policy.
The grant that matured in July 2013 vested 100% as the TSR 
ranked fourth out of 21 in the comparator group.  The Committee 
also assessed the performance of NEXT during the performance 
period and determined that the economic underpin performance 
condition had been satisfied.
The grant that matured in January 2014 also vested at 100% as the 
TSR ranked third out of 21 in the comparator group.  The Committee 
also determined that the economic underpin performance 
condition had been satisfied.

SMP
To encourage greater 
ownership of NEXT 
shares by senior 
executives, excluding 
executive directors, 
and thereby further 
align their interests 
with shareholders.  
Participants who invest a proportion of any annual 
cash bonus in NEXT shares can receive up to a 
maximum of two times the original number of shares 
they purchase with their bonus.  Any matching is 
conditional upon achieving performance measures 
over the following three years.  
The Committee’s policy is to set such performance 
measures by reference to fully diluted post-tax 
earnings per share but the Committee retains flexibility 
to use different measures during the period of this 
policy if it considers it appropriate to do so, including 
adjustments to reflect the benefit to shareholders from 
special dividends.  
As noted in the Committee Chairman’s statement, 
executive directors will no longer be granted awards 
under the SMP after January 2014 and participation 
will be restricted to senior executives below Board 
level, although the Committee reserves flexibility to re-
introduce executive director participation within the 
period of this policy if it considers it appropriate to do 
so.
The SMP does not credit participants with additional 
value in respect of dividends paid over any vesting 
period (except that the Committee has discretion to 
award such credit for special dividends).
The maximum matching ratio available under SMP is 3:1, 
matching the pre-tax equivalent of the amount invested 
in shares.  
Within this maximum matching ratio, a match of up to 2:1 
based on the actual number of investment shares has 
been offered in practice, although the Company retains 
flexibility within the period of this policy to offer a different 
matching ratio within the scope of the maximum ratio 
set out above.
Although the Company reserves flexibility to apply different 
performance measures, the Committee currently uses measures 
based on stretching fully diluted post-tax EPS targets.
The targets for awards in each year will be detailed in the report and 
accounts.
Participants (i.e.  senior executives below Board level only) can 
invest all of their post-tax bonus in the SMP in 2014.  In 2013 the 
Chief Executive was allowed to invest £200,000 and other executive 
directors £150,000.  The matching award remains at a maximum of 
two times the number of shares purchased by the participants.
The minimum match of 0.5 of a share requires fully diluted EPS 
growth of 12% and the maximum match of two times requires 
growth of 30% over the three year performance period
Pension
To provide for 
retirement through 
Company sponsored 
schemes or a cash 
alternative for personal 
pension planning.
All executive directors are deferred members of the 
defined benefit (“DB”) section of the 2013 NEXT Group 
Pension Plan (“the Plan”).  
In addition to being deferred members of the 
DB section of the Plan, Lord Wolfson and Christos 
Angelides are members of the unfunded, unapproved 
supplementary pension arrangement (“SPA”), 
described on page 59.  Their future pensions will be 
calculated by reference to their October 2012 salaries, 
rather than final earnings, and future salary changes 
will have no effect.  
Jane Shields and David Keens ceased to contribute 
to the Plan in 2011 and Michael Law in 2012.  Their 
pensions are no longer linked to salary and will 
increase in line with statutory deferred revaluation only 
(i.e.  in line with CPI).  
Executive directors receive salary supplements of 15% 
in lieu of past changes to their pension arrangements, 
in line with other senior employee members of the DB 
benefit section of the Plan.  
New employees of the Group can join the defined 
contribution (“DC”) section of the NEXT Plan or the 
statutory Auto-Enrolment plan, described on page 59.
Bonuses are not taken into account in assessing 
pensionable earnings in the Plan.
Under the DB section and the SPA, the maximum 
potential pension is only achieved on completion of at 
least 20 years pensionable service at age 65, when two 
thirds of the executive director’s annual pensionable 
salary at October 2012 could become payable.  The 
lump sum payable on death is four times base salary.  
No DC contributions, or equivalent salary supplement 
payments, will be made to an executive director in any 
year that will exceed the median level of contributions 
or payments made to FTSE 100 Chief Executives as at 
the time the rate is set, as confirmed by independent 
advisers to the Committee.

Termination 
payments
Consistent with market 
practice, to ensure 
NEXT can recruit and 
retain key executives, 
whilst protecting the 
Company from making 
payments for failure.
The Committee will consider the need for and quantum 
of any termination payments having regard to all of 
the relevant facts and circumstances at that time.  
Future service contracts will take into account relevant 
published guidance.
Each of the executive directors has a rolling service 
contract which commenced on either 14 March 2013 
or, for Michael Law and Jane Shields, on 1 July 2013.  The 
contract is terminable by the Company on giving one 
year’s notice.  The Company has reserved the right to 
make a payment in lieu of notice on termination of an 
executive director’s contract equal to their base salary 
and contractual benefits (excluding performance-
related pay).  
If notice of termination is given immediately following a 
change of control of the Company, the executive director 
may request immediate termination of his contract and 
payment of liquidated damages equal to the value of his 
base salary and contractual benefits.  
In normal circumstances executives have no entitlement 
in respect of loss of performance bonuses and all share 
awards would lapse following resignation.  However, under 
certain circumstances (e.g.  ‘good leaver’ or change in 
control), and solely at the Committee’s discretion, annual 
bonus payments may be made and would ordinarily be 
calculated up to the date of termination only.  In addition, 
awards made under the LTIP and SMP would in those 
circumstances generally be time pro-rated and remain 
subject to the application of the performance conditions 
at the normal measurement date.  The Committee also 
has a standard discretion to vary the application of time 
pro-rating in such cases.  “Good leaver” treatments are 
applied in exceptional cases only.  
In the event of any termination payment being made 
to a director (including any performance-related 
pay elements), the Committee will take full account 
of that director’s duty to mitigate any loss and, where 
appropriate, may seek independent professional advice 
and consider the views of shareholders as expressed in 
published guidance prior to authorising such payment.
Consistent with market practice, in the event of removal 
from office of an executive director, the Company may 
pay a contribution towards the individual’s legal fees and 
fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated 
settlement and such other amounts as the Committee 
considers to be necessary, having taken legal advice, in 
settlement of potential claims.  Any such fees would be 
disclosed with all other termination arrangements.  The 
Committee reserves the right, if necessary, to authorise 
additional payments in respect of such professional fees if 
not ascertained at the time of reporting such termination 
arrangements up to a maximum of £10,000.  
A departing gift may be provided up to a value of £1,000 
(plus related taxes) per director
Not applicable. No compensation payments on termination of employment were 
made during the year.
Claw-back/
malus
To ensure the 
Company can recover 
any payments made 
or potentially due to 
executive directors 
under performance-
related remuneration 
structures.
Claw-back provisions are in service contracts of 
all executive directors and will be enforced where 
appropriate to recover performance-related 
remuneration which has been overpaid due to: a 
material misstatement of the Company’s accounts; 
errors made in the calculation of an award; or a 
director’s misconduct.  These provisions allow for the 
recovery of sums paid and/or withholding of sums to 
be paid.
Not applicable. Not applicable. No claw-back or malus adjustments made in period.
Chairman and 
non-executive 
director fees
To ensure fees paid 
to the Chairman and 
non-executive directors 
are competitive and 
comparable with 
other companies of 
equivalent size and 
complexity.
Remuneration of the non-executive directors is reviewed 
annually and determined by the Chairman and the 
executive directors.  The Chairman’s fee is determined 
by the Committee (excluding the Chairman).
Additional fees are paid to non-executive directors who 
chair the Remuneration and Audit Committees, and 
act as the Senior Independent Director.  The structure 
of fees may be amended within the overall limits.
External benchmarking is undertaken only occasionally 
and there is no prescribed policy regarding the 
benchmarks used or any objective of achieving a 
prescribed percentile level.
The total of fees paid to the Chairman and the non-
executive directors in any year will not exceed the 
maximum level for such fees from time to time prescribed 
by the Company’s articles of association (currently 
£750,000 per annum).
Non-executive directors receive staff discount on Group merchandise 
but do not participate in any of the Group’s bonus, pension, share 
option or other incentive schemes.
The fees of the Chairman and non-executive directors were 
increased by 2% in February 2014, in line with the wider company 
cost of living awards.  The Chairman will be paid an annual fee 
of £260,100 (2013/14: £255,000).  The basic non-executive director 
fee is £53,550 (2013/14: £52,500), with a further £10,710 (2013/14: 
£10,500) paid to the Chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration 
Committees, and to the Senior Independent Director.

REMUNERATION REPORT
The following principles will be applied on an internal appointment, or the recruitment of an external candidate, 
to the Board.
The policies as set out above would apply to the promotion of an existing group employee to the Board.  
For such appointments, and unless agreed otherwise with the new director, the Company will honour the 
contractual entitlements and other incentives (e.g.  options granted under the NEXT Management Share Option 
Plan) awarded prior to the board appointment.
For external recruits, the Committee will also aim to structure and agree a package which is in line with the 
same policies for existing executive directors as set out above.  However, consistent with the new regulations, the 
Committee reserves the right not to apply the caps contained within the policy for fixed pay, either on joining or 
for any subsequent review within the life of this policy, although the Committee would not envisage exceeding 
these caps in practice.  In addition, the Committee may offer cash or share-based incentives when considered 
to be necessary to secure a candidate and in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders.  It may be 
necessary to make such awards on more bespoke terms which differ from NEXT’s existing annual and share-based 
pay structures.  However, the Committee will not authorise the payment of more than it considers necessary and 
will abide by the caps for such elements within the general policy.
Additional awards may be made to compensate for forfeiture of incentive awards in the previous employer, and 
may not be subject to the caps applied to NEXT’s annual bonus plan or the LTIP.  All such awards for external 
appointments, whether made under the annual bonus plan, LTIP or otherwise, will be limited to the commercial 
value of the amounts forfeited and will take account of the nature, time periods and performance requirements 
of those awards.  In particular the Committee’s starting point will be that any forfeited awards which are subject 
to continued service or performance requirements are replaced by NEXT awards with broadly equivalent terms.  
However, the Committee may relax these requirements in exceptional circumstances and where the Committee 
considers it to be less expensive for shareholders, for example where service periods are materially complete and/
or the replacement awards are materially discounted to reflect the conditions on forfeited awards.  The Committee 
will only authorise guaranteed or non pro-rated awards under the annual bonus plan where the Committee 
considers it is necessary to secure a recruitment.
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may agree the Company will meet such relocation 
expenses it considers appropriate and/or make a contribution towards legal fees in agreeing employment terms.
The Company has not made an external appointment of an executive director for over 25 years and therefore 
no recruitment awards were made during the year.  All such appointments during this time have been through 
internal promotions, so it is challenging to set out principles for an event that has not occurred in practice.  Therefore 
the above principles, particularly for external appointments, represent guidelines considered reasonable by the 
Committee and the Committee will consider their application in practice, taking account when appropriate of 
evolving best practice.

Share ownership guidelines
Share ownership guidelines do not form part of directors’ remuneration but the Committee has determined that 
these should be observed by executive directors.
The Chief Executive’s minimum shareholding is 1.5 times salary and for other executive directors 1 times salary.  
An executive director has up to five years from date of appointment to acquire the minimum shareholding and 
only shares owned beneficially are counted.  All executive directors, including the new appointees, have met the 
minimum shareholding and Lord Wolfson, Christos Angelides and David Keens each hold numbers of NEXT shares 
with a value significantly in excess of the applicable guidelines.
Service contracts
Executive directors
The Company’s policy on notice periods and in relation to termination payments is set out above.  Apart from their 
service contracts, no director has had any material interest in any contract with the Company or its subsidiaries.
Non-executive directors
Letters of appointment for the Chairman and non-executive directors do not contain fixed term periods; however 
they are appointed in the expectation that they will serve for a minimum of six years, subject to satisfactory 
performance and re-election at Annual General Meetings.
Dates of appointment and notice periods for non-executive directors are set out below:

REMUNERATION REPORT
ILLUSTRATION OF APPLICATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee’s objective is to ensure that the remuneration paid to senior executives is appropriate in both 
amount and structure, is directly linked to the Company’s annual and longer term performance and aligned 
with the interests of shareholders.  Careful consideration is given to ensuring there is an appropriate balance in 
the remuneration structure between annual and long term rewards, as well as between cash and share-based 
payments.  The charts below indicate the level of remuneration that could be received by each executive director

January 2015) at different levels of performance.

NEXT EMPLOYMENT CONDITIONS GENERALLY 
The remuneration policy operates for the executive directors and senior management of the Group.  Pay structures 
and employment conditions for other Group employees are driven by market and role comparatives and are also 
considered by the Committee to ensure that any differences for directors are justified.  Salary increases for the 
wider employee group are taken into consideration when determining increases for executive directors and senior 
management.  For the last 3 years, the base salary increases for the executive directors have generally been in line 
with wider company awards.
In common with executive directors, all other employees are eligible to participate in annual bonus arrangements.  
The targets for these are linked to performance of the group, their operating function or personal performance.
These other employees are provided with a competitive package of benefits that includes the opportunity to 
participate in the Group’s pension arrangements and staff discount on Group merchandise.  In addition, the 
NEXT Management Share Option Plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten years 
following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees.  This plan is primarily aimed at middle management 
and senior store staff.  Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant, and are generally granted 
annually.  In order to encourage wider employee share ownership, the Company also operates all-employee 
Save as You Earn share schemes in the UK and Ireland, in which all permanent employees (including executive 
directors) are eligible to participate.  
The Company did not consult with employees when drawing up the directors’ remuneration policy.  The Committee 
does not generally use any formal internal comparison metrics when setting directors’ remuneration, other than 
the consideration of employee pay as described above, but has sought advice from FIT Remuneration Consultants 
LLP from time to time on the appropriateness and competitiveness of remuneration structures in place within the 
Company.  No formal benchmarking exercise was undertaken during the year.
CONSIDERATION OF SHAREHOLDER VIEWS
The Remuneration Committee has written to and consulted with major shareholders on a pro-active basis when 
any significant change in remuneration policy has been considered and has taken full account of their feedback.  
Shareholder views about remuneration are also communicated to the Committee on an on-going basis through 
inclusion in Board reports of shareholder feedback and statements made by representative associations.  In 
addition, the Committee Chairman and the Chairman of the Board have from time to time engaged directly 
with shareholders and representative bodies on any particular matters they may have raised.  Shareholders and 
representative bodies are able to contact the Committee Chairman directly if they have any concerns regarding 
remuneration.

Note 2: Pension 
Pension values are calculated using the method required by the new regulations, i.e. the total pension accrued at  
January 2014 less the total pension accrued at the end of the previous year, adjusted for inflation and multiplied by 
a factor of 20. It does not necessarily represent the economic value of the pension rights accrued and this benefit 
is not immediately available to the director.

1  Michael Law and Jane Shields were promoted to the Board on 1 July 2013.  As they were already employed by 
NEXT the transfer value disclosed above is calculated at the year start.
Years of pensionable service shown above may include bought-in service from the transfer of other pension 
entitlements into the Plan.  Directors’ pension arrangements are subject to the same actuarial reduction as other 
employees on termination or early retirement.
Note 3: Salary supplement in lieu of pension
Supplements of 15% of base salary are paid in lieu of pension provision after the directors became deferred 
members of the defined benefit section of the NEXT Group Pension Plan.  David Keens, Jane Shields and Andrew 
Varley received this supplement from 2011, Michael Law from April 2012 and Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides 
from November 2012.
Note 4: Annual bonus
The performance targets for the annual bonus are set out on page 43.  For the year to January 2014 actual pre-
tax EPS achieved was 460.0p, growth of 17.6%.  Accordingly, a bonus of 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and 
100% of salary for the other executive directors was earned.  
To provide a retention element in the case of the Chief Executive, any annual bonus in excess of 100% of base 
salary is payable in shares, deferred for a period of two years and subject to forfeiture if he voluntarily resigns prior 
to the end of that period.  
Note 5: LTIP
The performance targets for the LTIP are set out on page 43.  In April 2013, the Committee reviewed the Company’s 
financial performance for the three year performance period to January 2013 in light of underlying economic 
and other conditions (‘the economic underpin’).  During this period, the Company’s compound annual growth 
in underlying EPS and pre-tax profits was 16.5% and 7.1% respectively, well ahead of RPI (4.1%).  Dividends had 
also increased in line with EPS and some £736m was returned to shareholders through share buybacks.  As 
the Company’s performance also compared favourably against its principal retail competitors and FTSE100 
companies, the Committee confirmed that the economic underpin performance condition had been satisfied.  As 
a consequence, 98% of the award for this period vested.  
For the three year performance period to July 2013, TSR ranked fourth in the comparator group of 21 and 100% of 
the grant made in the second half of 2010 vested.  The Committee assessed the performance of the Company and 
noted that EPS compound annual growth of 16.2% and pre-tax profit compound annual growth of 6.4% over the 
three year period were significantly ahead of RPI (3.7%).  In addition, dividends had continued to increase in line 
with EPS and £768m had been returned to shareholders through buybacks.  The Committee also assessed earnings 
growth against selected comparable major UK retailers and concluded that NEXT had performed favourably.  
Taking these factors into account, the Committee determined that the economic underpin performance condition 
for the award had been satisfied.  The awards were cash settled for all executives.
For the performance period to January 2014, TSR ranked third against the comparator group of 21 which corresponds 
to an expected vesting of 100% of the maximum award made in January 2011.  In March 2014 the Remuneration 
Committee assessed the performance of the Company on the same basis as described above and noted that 
EPS compound annual growth of 18.2% and pre-tax profit compound growth of 8% over the three year period were 
significantly ahead of RPI (3.3%).  In addition, dividends had continued to increase in line with EPS and £827m had 
been returned to shareholders through buybacks.  The Committee also assessed earnings growth against selected 
comparable major UK retailers and concluded that NEXT had performed favourably.  Taking these factors into 
account, the Committee determined that the economic underpin performance condition for the award had been 
satisfied and it should vest in full.
LTIP values for the January 2014 single figure table comprise the actual value of awards that have vested and been 
paid for the performance period ending in July 2013, together with the estimated value of awards that will vest for the 
performance period ending in January 2014, based on the average NEXT share price over the last financial quarter of 
£56.47.  For January 2013 these are the actual values of the LTIP awards that vested in respect of performance periods 
ending in that financial year.
The maximum value of LTIP awards that vest for a participant in a year is capped at £2.5m.  This cap was applied 
to awards that vested in the year to January 2013 for Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides and payments to them 
were reduced by £397k and £75k respectively.  For the awards vesting in the year to January 2014 the cap will again 
be applied and payments to Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides will be reduced by an estimated £1,097k and 
£762k respectively.
Note 6: SMP
The SMP was introduced to encourage ownership of NEXT shares amongst executive directors and other senior 
executives and to act as a further retention incentive.  It also continues to support the Committee’s approach of 
ensuring close long term alignment of management’s interests with shareholders.  For the 2011 grant, which is 
due to vest in April 2014, some 25 senior executives were able to reinvest part, or all, of their annual cash bonus 
in NEXT shares.  
The performance targets for the SMP are set out on page 68.  SMP values for January 2014 assume a maximum 
vesting in April 2014 and are based on the average NEXT share price over the last financial quarter of £56.47.  The 
strong growth in EPS means the maximum performance target for the SMP has been exceeded and therefore the 
2011 SMP will vest in full in April 2014, subject to the continued employment of participants.
Executive directors will no longer be granted awards under the SMP after January 2014 and participation will be 
restricted to senior executives below Board level.
As noted below the Single Figure of Remuneration table, Lord Wolfson waived his entitlement to the April 2011 SMP 
award and to the June 2010 SMP award.  In respect of the SMP award which will vest in April 2014, the estimated 
total 2014 pre-tax value for the other executive directors is £6.2m, of which £3.7m (60%) derives from the growth in 
NEXT’s share price since investment in 2011.
The SMP values for January 2013 are actual values at the date of vesting.   23158.04 - Proof 2 - 14/03/2014
REMUNERATION REPORT
Executive directors’ external appointments
No current executive director holds any non-executive directorships outside the Group.  Andrew Varley, who 
stepped down from the Board in 2013, is a non-executive director of LondonMetric Property plc and the Committee 
approved his retention of the director’s fee of £50,000 per annum for this appointment.
PENSION ENTITLEMENTS (AUDITED) 
In October 2013 all active members of the NEXT Group Pension Plan (the “NEXT Plan”), were transferred to the 
new 2013 NEXT Group Pension Plan (the “2013 Plan”) so that pensioners of the NEXT Plan could be issued with 
individual policies with Aviva.  Most deferred pensioners and pensioners who had not previously been subject 
to a buy-in through Aviva were also transferred to the 2013 Plan.  Benefits within the 2013 Plan mirror those in the  
NEXT Plan.
Executive directors are now members of the 2013 Plan which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs and 
consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections.  
The trustee of both Plans is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited (the “Trustee”).  The Board of the 
Trustee includes members of the 2013 Plan, a pensioner member and a Chairman who is an independently 
appointed person with no other association with NEXT.  Two of the directors are member nominated directors and 
cannot be removed by NEXT; the other directors, including the independent director, are appointed by and can 
be removed by NEXT.  All directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are 
also employees of NEXT.  No director of the Company is a director of the Trustee.
The Plans’ investments are kept separate from the business of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in 
separate trusts.  Responsibility for investment of the Plans’ funds has been delegated to professional investment 
managers.
The Group operates a salary sacrifice scheme whereby members from either section can elect to receive a 
reduced gross salary in exchange for enhanced employer pension contributions.  The participation of members 
in the salary sacrifice scheme does not result in any overall increase in costs to the Group.
Defined contribution section
Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the 2013 Plan.  Members elect to pay either 
3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.  For death prior to retirement, a lump 
sum of three times the member’s base salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the 
member’s fund.

Defined benefit section
The defined benefit section was closed to new members in 2000.  In 2012 the Group reviewed this section for 
remaining employee members and following a consultation process the future accrual of pension benefits has 
been based on pensionable salary frozen at October 2012, rather than final earnings.  In addition, those employees 
can elect to receive up to a 15% salary supplement or additional contributions to the defined contribution section.  
The defined benefit section now provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth 
(depending on the member’s chosen contribution rate) of pensionable earnings at October 2012 for each year 
of pensionable service.  
Lord Wolfson, Christos Angelides and a small number of senior employees, on completion of at least 20 years’ 
pensionable service at age 65, receive a retirement benefit of two-thirds of pensionable earnings at October 
2012, which accrues uniformly throughout their pensionable service.  The deferred pensions for David Keens, Jane 
Shields and Michael Law are based on their pensionable earnings at the time they became deferred pensioners 
and accrued uniformly throughout their pensionable service.  
The defined benefit section provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependants’ pensions on death in 
service or following retirement.  Pensions are only payable to deceased members’ children after death in service.  
In the case of ill-health retirement, only the accrued pension is payable.  All benefits are subject to 2013 Plan limits.  
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post-1997 is 
subject to limited price indexation.  From 2006, sales and profit related bonuses were excluded from pensionable 
earnings and the normal retirement age under the Plan was increased from 60 to 65.  There are no additional 
benefits which become receivable by a director in the event of early retirement.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company currently makes contributions at the 
rate of 17.5%.  The last full triennial valuation of the NEXT Plan was carried out as at March 2013, and the first triennial 
valuation of the 2013 Plan was carried out as at October 2013.  As calculated in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards, the surplus in the 2013 Plan at January 2014 was £70.3m; further details are given 
in Note 21 to the financial statements.
Certain members (including Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides) whose accrued or projected pension fund 
value exceeds their personal lifetime allowance are provided with benefits through an unfunded, unapproved 
arrangement.  The relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by a 
payment of 5% on all pensionable earnings.  Since April 2011, where existing members have reached either the 
annual or lifetime pension contributions limits, the Company has offered those members the choice of leaving 
the defined benefit section and either joining the defined contribution section (with an enhanced Company 
contribution) or taking a salary supplement, in both cases equal to 10% or 15% of their salary (depending on their 
existing contributions and benefits).  
Auto-Enrolment
Following the introduction of Auto-Enrolment (A-E) in 2012, most employees now have the option of joining the 
2013 Plan, the statutory A-E plan or opting out of pension provision through the Company.  Contributions to A-E 
commenced in February 2013.

42 to 45.
3  Executive directors can participate in the Company’s Sharesave scheme (see details on page 46) and the amounts above are the options 
which will become exercisable at maturity.
4  As disclosed on page 39 Lord Wolfson has waived his potential entitlement under the 2011 SMP (67,098 options).  
5   Andrew Varley stepped down from the Board in May 2013.
The Company’s 2013 5.25% corporate bonds were redeemed during the year so David Keens no longer has a 
beneficial bond holding (2013: £83,000 nominal value).
Save for the waiver of Lord Wolfson’s 2011 SMP entitlement, there have been no other changes to directors’ interests 
in the shares of the Company from the end of the financial year to 19 March 2014.  Full details of directors’ interests 
in the shares and share options of the Company are contained in the Register of Directors’ Interests which is open 
to inspection.

1  As disclosed on page 39 Lord Wolfson has waived his potential entitlement under the 2011 SMP (options over 67,098 shares).
2  For LTIP awards, the date in this column is the end of the three year performance period.  Actual vesting will be the date on which the 
Committee determines whether any Performance Condition has been satisfied.
3  The market value of shares at the time the deferred bonus vested was £44.08.
4  For LTIP awards made prior to February 2014 the maximum value of LTIP awards that vest for a particular year is capped at £2.5m.  The cap was 
applied to the awards that vested in the year to January 2013 for Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides.  The impact of this cap was to reduce 
the shares vested by 9,196 and 1,735 respectively.  
5  See page 57 for details of the performance conditions and vesting levels applicable to the LTIP schemes vesting in the year.
6  The LTIP price at award date is NEXT’s average share price over the three months prior to the start of the performance period.
7  Christos Angelides, David Keens and Andrew Varley exercised their SMP options at the date of vesting when the market price for the shares was 
£45.58.
8  The market price for the shares at the date of Sharesave exercise was £54.00 for Lord Wolfson and Jane Shields and £54.95 for David Keens.
9  Within the above table, all awards are subject to pre-vesting performance conditions except for Sharesave options and Deferred Bonus Shares.

REMUNERATION REPORT
The LTIP performance periods which mature after January 2014 are not yet complete and no entitlement has yet 
been earned.  A charge of £26,845,000 for the year (2013: £23,368,000) has been made in the accounts in respect 
of these LTIP grants, of which approximately £10,962,000 (2013: £9,554,000) related to the executive directors.
For all LTIP participants, the total maximum shares receivable at January 2013 was 1,084,471 (January 2012: 
1,364,175).  During the year, grants over 385,956 shares vested (2013: 517,192), grants over 52,296 shares, including 
10,931 shares subject to the maximum cap, lapsed (2013: 57,545 in total, including 23,344 capped shares) 
and further grants over 217,087 shares were issued (2013: 295,033).  At January 2014 the total maximum shares 
receivable was 863,306 (excluding the impact of any cap on the total value which may apply) with an average 
remaining contractual life of 1.6 years (2013: 1.6 years).
The aggregate gains of directors arising from the exercise of options granted under the SMP and Sharesave 
scheme and LTIP awards that vested in the year totalled £14,150,000 (2013: £7,011,000).

REMUNERATION REPORT
Share Matching Plan
Vesting of awards is dependent solely on achieving the fully diluted post-tax EPS targets detailed below.  
Required fully diluted EPS (pence)
Date of grant For 0.5:1 match For 1:1 match For 2:1 match
April 2011 (for this award the matching 
ratio is after grossing up for income tax and 
employees’ national insurance)
231.3 240.2 258.1
April 2012 (for this award no grossing up  
was applied prior to the matching award) 
267.2 281.5 310.2
April 2013 (for this award no grossing up  
was applied prior to the matching award)
314.5 331.3 365.0
These targets require a minimum three year growth in EPS of 12% before any shares vest and a maximum award 
is only achieved if EPS growth reaches 25% (2011 award) and 30% (2012 and 2013 awards) over three years.  The 
effective matching ratio will be calculated on a straight line basis for EPS falling between each of the threshold 
points.  Details of the calculation of fully diluted EPS are provided in Note 9.  
Dilution of share capital by employee share plans
The Company monitors and has complied with dilution limits in its various share scheme rules and has not issued 
a significant number of new or treasury shares in satisfaction of share schemes in the last 10 years.  Share-based 
incentives are usually satisfied from shares purchased and held by the ESOT – see Note 26.  
CONSIDERATION OF MATTERS RELATING TO DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
Remuneration Committee
During the year the Committee comprised the following independent non-executive directors:
Jonathan Dawson (Committee Chairman) 
Steve Barber 
John Barton 
Christine Cross 
Francis Salway 
Caroline Goodall
The Committee met six times during the year under review.  All meetings were fully attended except that Christine 
Cross and Jonathan Dawson were each unable to attend one meeting.
Role of Remuneration Committee
The Committee determines the remuneration of the Group’s Chairman and executive directors, and reviews that of 
senior executives.  It is also responsible for determining the targets for performance-related pay schemes, approves 
any award of the Company’s shares under share option or incentive schemes to employees and oversees any 
major changes in employee benefit structures.  The Committee members have no conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships and no director is permitted to be involved in any decisions as to his or her own remuneration.  
The remuneration of non-executive directors is decided by the Chairman and executive directors of the Board.  The 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s website (www.nextplc.co.uk) or on request from 
the Company Secretary.

Assistance to the Committee
During the period the Committee received input from the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.  Aon Hewitt 
and FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP also provided independent external advice, mostly of a technical nature 
and related to share plans and the implementation of the new Directors’ Remuneration reporting regime.  These 
advisers have no other connection with the Company and were appointed by the Committee based on their 
expertise in the relevant areas of interest.  Based on the nature of the advice, the relatively small fees and no other 
connection existing with these advisers, the Committee was satisfied that the advice received was objective and 
independent.  PricewaterhouseCoopers provided independent verification services of total shareholder returns 
for NEXT and the comparator group of companies under the long term incentive plan.  Each of these firms is a 
member of the Remuneration Consultants Group, being the professional body for remuneration consultants and 
have confirmed to us that they adhere to its code of conduct.
During the year Aon Hewitt, FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers, were paid less than 
£20k each and their fees were charged at an hourly rate.
VOTING AT GENERAL MEETING
A resolution to approve the directors’ remuneration report was passed at the Company’s 2013 AGM.  Of the 
total votes cast (109m), 99.7% were voted for the resolution and 0.3% against; 1.8m votes were withheld which 
represented 1.1% of the total number of shares in issue at the date of the AGM.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF NEXT PLC
We have audited the Group financial statements of NEXT 
plc for the year ended 25 January 2014 which comprise the 
Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the 
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes 1 to 
32.  The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
their preparation is applicable law and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose.  To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do 
not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our 
audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.  
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 31, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  Our 
responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (ISAs) (UK and Ireland).  
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.  
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give 
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.  
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made 
by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial 
statements.  In addition, we read all the financial and non-
financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to 
identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, 
the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing 
the audit.  If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications 
for our report.  
Our assessment of risks of material 
misstatement
We consider that the following areas present the greatest 
risk of material misstatement in the financial statements and 
consequently have had the greatest impact on our audit strategy , 
the allocation of resources and, the efforts of the engagement 
team, including the more senior members of the team;
 ❚ The assessment of the directory debt provision; 
 ❚ The assessment of inventory provisions;
 ❚ The assessment of underlying risk and valuation of, financial 
instruments; and
 ❚ The risk of misstatement arising from management override 
of internal controls with regard to estimates and other 
provisions relevant to the retail environment.  
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning 
and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements.  
For the purposes of determining whether the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement we define 
materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that makes 
it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably 
knowledgeable person, relying on the financial statements, 
would be changed or influenced.
We also determine a lower level of performance materiality 
which we use to determine the extent of testing needed to 
reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the 
aggregate of uncorrected and undetected misstatements 
exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined 
a magnitude of uncorrected misstatements that we judged 
would be material for the financial statements as a whole.  We 
determined materiality for the Group to be £35 million, which is 
approximately 5% of pre-exceptional pre-tax profit.  
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our 
assessment of the Group’s overall control environment, our 
judgement is that performance materiality for the Group 
should be 50% of materiality, namely £17.5 million.  Our 
approach is designed to have a reasonable probability of 
ensuring that the total of uncorrected and undetected audit 
differences does not exceed our materiality for the financial 
statements as a whole.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to 
the Committee all audit differences in excess of £1.7 million, 
as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
An overview of the scope of our audit
The Retail and Directory business operations accounting 
for 95% of the Group’s revenue and 93% of total segment 
profit were subject to a full scope audit.  The overseas 
Group purchasing division, Lipsy and Property Management 
contribute 5% of total segment profit and were subject to 
specific scope audits in areas where we assessed there was a 
risk of material misstatement.  For the remaining components 
of the Group, we performed other procedures to confirm there 
were no significant risks of material misstatement in the Group 
financial statements.

In view of the nature of the main risk areas noted above, the 
Group audit team is supported by experts in auditing the 
financial instruments and their valuation.
The principal way in which we scoped our response to the risks 
noted above was as follows:
 ❚ We checked management’s categorisation of the debtor 
book based on payment in accordance with agreed 
terms.  We challenged the reasonableness of the key 
assumptions in determining management’s provision for 
future default, being the Group’s assumed default rates 
(which represent the likelihood of eventual default for 
debt within each category), and expected recovery rates 
on such debts, in combination with evidence of historical 
default and recovery rates, current performance, and any 
observed changes in debtor profile in the current period.  
We checked the arithmetical accuracy of the provision 
based on management’s assumptions and compared 
the underlying debtor book categorisation to the 
financial accounting system and the mapping of external 
affordability data.
 ❚ The adequacy of the inventory provision depends on the 
level of stock on hand which is expected to be sold below 
cost plus attributable selling costs.  We examined the 
Group’s historical trading patterns of stock sold at full price, 
stock marked down below full price in a sale period, and 
the element of inventory that is passed to clearance; along 
with the related margins achieved for each of these sales 
channels.  We then challenged the reasonableness of the 
inventory provision taking into account a combination of 
the evidence of these historical trading patterns and any 
observed changes to the current year buying cycle.
 ❚ We determined the different types of financial instruments 
held by the Group and the level of risk inherent in each 
of the transaction types.  We analysed the features of a 
selected sample of financial instruments by comparison to 
the originating contractual agreements.  With our experts 
we challenged the reasonableness of the valuation of the 
selected sample where the Group’s valuation was outside 
a reasonable tolerance of our own expectations.  
 ❚ We performed analytical procedures and journal entry 
testing in order to identify and test the risk of misstatement 
arising from management override of controls, which in 
addition to the risks disclosed above, focused on accruals 
and provisions of a judgemental nature capable of being 
manipulated by management.  These comprised of 
accruals for sales returns, gift card exposure, share based 
payments and LTIP arrangements; along with provisions 
for dilapidations, onerous leases and vacant leasehold 
properties.
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion the Group financial statements: 
 ❚ give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as 
at 25 January 2014 and of its profit for the year then ended; 
 ❚ have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as 
adopted by the European Union; and 
 ❚ have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies Act 2006 and Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
 ❚ the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
Group financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the ISAs (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion, information in the annual report is: 
 ❚ materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
financial statements; or 
 ❚ apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in 
the course of performing our audit; or 
 ❚ is otherwise misleading.  
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the directors’ statement 
that they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the annual report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit 
committee which we consider should have been disclosed.  
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to 
you if, in our opinion: 
 ❚ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specified by 
law are not made; or 
 ❚ we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.  
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
 ❚ the directors’ statement, set out on page 37, in relation to 
going concern; and 
 ❚ the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 
UK Corporate Governance Code specified for our review.  
Other matter 
We have reported separately on the parent company 
financial statements of NEXT plc for the year ended  
25 January 2014 and on the information in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.

Basis of preparation
The financial statements of NEXT plc and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) adopted for use in the European Union and in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.  The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except 
for certain financial instruments, pension assets and liabilities and share-based payment liabilities which are 
measured at fair value.  The financial statements are for the 52 weeks to 25 January 2014 (last year 52 weeks to  
26 January 2013).
Except for the immaterial effect of the amendment to IAS 19 (described on page 80), there have been no changes 
to our group accounting policies this year or last year and the principal policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of NEXT plc (“the Company”) and 
its subsidiary undertakings.  All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on 
consolidation.
The results of any subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal.  The results and net assets of 
associated undertakings are incorporated into these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.  The Group includes foreign entities whose functional currencies are not Sterling.  On 
consolidation, the assets and liabilities of those entities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance 
sheet date and income and expenses are translated at weighted average rates during the period.  Translation 
differences are recognised in equity.
Transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate on the 
transaction date, whilst assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Exchange 
differences are recognised in the income statement.
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services and is stated net of sales taxes 
and returns.  Sales of goods are recognised on delivery.  Directory service charge income is accrued on a time 
basis by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate.  Revenue from the sale of gift cards 
is deferred until their redemption.
Underlying profit and exceptional items
Exceptional items are significant items of an unusual or non-recurring nature which are shown separately in the 
income statement to provide a clearer understanding of the underlying financial performance during the year.  
Further details are given in Note 6.
Property, plant & equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Depreciation is charged so as to write down the cost of assets to their estimated residual values over their remaining 
useful lives on a straight line basis.  Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually and 
are summarised as follows:
Freehold and long leasehold property 50 years
Plant and fittings:
 Plant, machinery and building works 10 – 25 years
 Fixtures and fittings 6 – 15 years
 Vehicles, IT and other assets 2 – 6 years
 Leasehold improvements the period of the lease, or useful life if shorter

Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the acquisition cost over the Group’s interest in the assets 
and liabilities recognised.  Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever there is 
an indication of impairment.
Other intangible assets
Separately identifiable intangible assets obtained in a business acquisition are initially recognised at fair value, if 
this can be measured reliably and the asset arises from contractual or other legal rights.  Other intangible assets 
are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives as follows:
Lipsy brand names and trademarks 10 years
Lipsy customer relationships 4 years
Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary companies and equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active 
market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost, subject to review for impairment.
Impairment
The carrying values of non-financial assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment.  If any impairment loss arises, the asset value is adjusted to its estimated recoverable 
amount and the difference is recognised in the income statement.
Pension arrangements
The Group offers pension benefits which include both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements.  
Pension assets are held in separate trustee administered funds and the Group also provides other, unfunded, 
pension benefits to certain plan members.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit and unfunded arrangements are determined using the 
projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.  The net 
defined benefit pension asset or liability represents the fair value of the defined benefit plan assets less the present 
value of the defined benefit and unfunded liabilities.  A net pension asset is only recognised to the extent that it is 
expected to be recoverable in the future.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which 
they occur.  Other income and expenses are recognised in the income statement.  The accounting impact of an 
amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits is explained on page 80.
The cost of the defined contribution section is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Inventories 
Inventories (stocks) are valued at the lower of standard cost or net realisable value.  Net realisable value is based 
on estimated selling prices less further costs to be incurred to disposal.
Directory and other receivables
Directory customer receivables represent outstanding customer balances less any allowance for impairment 
which is based on objective evidence and recent default experience by customer account category.  Other trade 
receivables are stated at invoice value less any allowance for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short 
term deposits, less bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand.  Short term deposits are those with an original 
maturity of three months or less.

Additional information Parent Company accounts Governance Consolidated accounts Business reports
Corporate bonds and bank borrowings
Corporate bonds and bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently adjusted where 
hedge accounting applies (see interest rate derivatives below).  Accrued interest is included within other creditors 
and accruals.
Share-based payments
The fair value of employee share options is calculated when they are granted using a Black-Scholes model.  The 
resulting cost is charged in the income statement over the vesting period of the option, and is regularly reviewed 
and adjusted for the expected and actual number of options vesting.
For cash-settled share-based payments (including the long term incentive plan), the fair value of the liability is 
determined at each balance sheet date and the cost is recognised in the income statement over the vesting 
period.  
Taxation
Taxation, comprised of current and deferred tax, is charged or credited to the income statement unless it relates to 
items in other comprehensive income or directly in equity.  In such cases, the related tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid, based on tax rates and laws that are 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method and is calculated using rates of taxation 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the asset or 
liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.  Deferred tax assets are 
only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised.  Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of investments in subsidiaries and 
associates where the reversal of any taxable temporary differences can be controlled and are unlikely to reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
Other financial assets and liabilities: derivative financial instruments and hedge 
accounting
Derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates relating to the purchase of overseas sourced products and changes in interest rates relating to 
the Group’s debt.  In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not enter into derivatives for speculative 
purposes.  Foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are stated at their fair value, being the estimated amount 
that the Group would receive or pay to terminate them at the balance sheet date based on prevailing foreign 
currency and interest rates.
Foreign currency derivatives
Changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are designated and effective as hedges of future 
cash flows are recognised in equity in the fair value reserve, and subsequently transferred to the carrying amount of 
the hedged item or the income statement.  Realised gains or losses on cash flow hedges are therefore recognised 
in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or 
no longer qualifies for hedge accounting.  At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument 
previously recognised in equity is retained in equity until the hedged transaction occurs.  If the hedged transaction 
is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is then transferred to the 
income statement.
Changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are ineffective or do not meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting in IAS 39 are recognised in the income statement.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2014
79 23158.04 - Proof 2 - 14/03/2014
GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Interest rate derivatives
The Group uses interest rate derivatives to hedge part of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s 
corporate bonds.  The carrying values of the relevant bonds are adjusted only for changes in fair value attributable 
to the interest rate risk being hedged.  The adjustment is recognised in the income statement and is offset by 
movements in the fair value of the derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives which are ineffective or do not meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting in IAS 39 are recognised in the income statement.
Share buybacks
The Group has regularly returned surplus cash to shareholders through share buybacks.  Shares purchased for 
cancellation are deducted from retained earnings at the total consideration paid or payable.  The Company also 
uses contingent share purchase contracts and irrevocable closed period buyback programmes.  The obligation 
to purchase shares is recognised in full at the inception of the contract, even when that obligation is conditional 
on the share price.  Any subsequent reduction in the obligation caused by the expiry or termination of a contract 
is credited back to equity at that time.
Shares held by ESOT
The NEXT Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) provides for the issue of shares to Group employees, principally 
under share option schemes.  Shares in the Company held by the ESOT are included in the balance sheet at cost 
as a deduction from equity.  The ESOT may also use contingent share purchase contracts and irrevocable closed 
period share purchase programmes which are accounted for as described above.
Provisions
A provision is recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Leasing commitments
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the period of the 
lease.  Contingent rentals payable based on store revenues are accrued in line with the related sales.
Premiums payable, rent free periods and capital contributions receivable on entering an operating lease are 
released to income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
The Group does not have significant finance leases.
Significant areas of estimation and judgement
The preparation of the financial statements requires judgements, estimations and assumptions to be made that 
affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  The nature of estimation means that actual 
outcomes could differ from those estimates.  Significant areas of estimation for the Group include the expected 
future cash flows applied in measuring impairment of Directory customer receivables (Note 14), estimated selling 
prices applied in determining the net realisable values of inventories (Note 13 and inventories policy above) 
and the actuarial assumptions applied in calculating the net retirement benefit obligation (Note 21).  The Audit 
Committee section of the Corporate Governance Report (page 34) contains further information on the judgmental 
areas considered by the Committee during the year.  
Changes to accounting standards 
An amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits was published in June 2011 and became effective during the current 
year.  This affects the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes and has been applied this year.
If applied retrospectively, the effect of the amendment on last year would have been to increase pension costs in 
the income statement by £2.6 million and to increase actuarial gains in the statement of comprehensive income 
by an equivalent amount.  There is no impact on the balance sheet.  As the impact is not material, prior year figures 
have not been restated and remain as reported last year.
Various other new accounting standards and amendments were issued during the year, none of which have had 
or are expected to have any significant impact on the Group.

1. Segmental analysis
The Group’s operating segments under IFRS 8 have been determined based on management accounts reviewed 
by the Board.  The performance of operating segments is assessed on profits before interest and tax, excluding 
equity settled share option charges recognised under IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment and unrealised foreign 
exchange gains or losses on derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.  The activities, products and 
services of the operating segments are detailed in the Strategic Report on page 18.  The Property Management 
segment holds properties and property leases which are sub-let to other segments and external parties.

There were no exceptional items during the current year.  Last year’s exceptional items were as follows: 
a) The Group reviewed the operation of the defined benefit section of its pension plan.  From November 2012,  
the future accrual of benefits for remaining employee members is based on pensionable earnings at that time, 
rather than final earnings.  This change gave rise to a one-off accounting gain of £42.1m last year.
b) A tranche of pensions in payment were subject to a buy-in arrangement in 2012.  The contract also  
allows for the buy-in to be converted to a buy-out, and steps are being taken to proceed on this basis.   
Accordingly, the transaction was accounted for as a settlement, with the £6.3m accounting charge presented 
in the income statement as an exceptional item.
c) The Group sold its last remaining stock from its property development activities for £15.0m last year which 
had a book value of £5.9m.  The £9.1m gain was presented as an exceptional item because of its size and  
non-recurring nature.

Proposed final dividend for the year to January 2014 of 93p (2013: 74p) per share 139.2 111.4
The special interim dividend was announced on 3 January 2014 and shares in NEXT plc traded ex-dividend 
from 15 January.  The liability of £74.4m is recorded in the January 2014 balance sheet on the basis that it  
could not realistically have been cancelled after the ex-dividend date.  The special dividend was paid on 3 
February 2014.
The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not 
been included as a liability in these financial statements.  The Trustee of the ESOT has waived dividends paid in the 
year on the shares held by the ESOT.
9. Earnings per share
2014 2013
Basic earnings per share
Total 366.1p 320.1p
Underlying 366.1p 297.7p
Basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the parent company 
and the weighted average number of shares ranking for dividend less the weighted average number of shares 
held by the ESOT during the period.
Underlying earnings per share is based on profit before the exceptional items described in Note 6.
2014 2013
Diluted earnings per share
Total 355.6p 311.7p
Underlying 355.6p 289.9p
Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of 
basic earnings per share as increased by the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares.  Dilutive shares arise  
from employee share option schemes where the exercise price is less than the average market price of 
the Company’s ordinary shares during the period.  Their dilutive effect is calculated on the basis of the  
equivalent number of nil-cost options.  Where the option price is above the average market price, the option is 
not dilutive and is excluded from the diluted EPS calculation.  There were no such share options in the current year 
(2013: nil).

Goodwill is tested for impairment at the balance sheet date on the basis of value in use.  As this exceeded  
carrying value for each of the cash generating units concerned, no impairment loss was recognised (2013: £nil).
NEXT Sourcing
The key assumptions in the calculation are the future sourcing requirements of the Group and the ability of NEXT 
Sourcing to meet these requirements based on past experience.  In assessing value in use, the most recent  
financial results and internal budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four further years with no 
subsequent growth assumed, and discounted at 10% (2013: 10%).
Lipsy
In assessing the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangibles, the most recent financial results and internal 
budgets for next year were used and extrapolated for nine further years using a growth rate of 2% (2013: 2%) 
and discounted at 12% (2013: 15%).  The reduction in the discount rate is to reflect the increasing maturity 
of Lipsy’s business, and has no bearing on the outcome.  The key assumption is that Lipsy will continue to  
trade profitably through its different sales channels.
For both NEXT Sourcing and Lipsy, the calculated value in use significantly exceeded the carrying value of the 
goodwill and other intangible assets and no further sensitivity calculations were necessary to conclude that there 
was no impairment.

14. Customer and other receivables (continued)
The credit quality of customer receivables that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to 
the historical default rate for the preceding 365 days of approximately 1% (2013: 1%), although default rates over 
shorter periods may show significant variations.
Other debtors and prepayments do not include impaired assets.  The maximum exposure to credit risk

21. Pension benefits
The Group’s UK pension arrangements include defined benefit and defined contribution sections.  The 
Group also provides unfunded retirement benefits to some plan members whose benefits would otherwise 
be restricted by the lifetime allowance.  Pension assets are held in separate trustee administered funds  
which have equal pension rights with respect to members of either sex and comply with the Employment Equality 
Regulations (2006).  Further information on the Group’s pension arrangements is given in the Remuneration  
Report on pages 58 and 59.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members in 2000 and over recent years the Group has taken steps 
to manage the on-going risks associated with it:
 ❚ In 2010, most pensions in payment were subject to a buy-in contract with an insurance company.  This was 
followed up in 2012 by a further buy-in contract for pensions that had come into payment since 2010;
 ❚ From November 2012, the future accrual of benefits for remaining employee members is based on 
pensionable earnings frozen at that time, rather than final earnings.  Those employees receive either additional  
contributions to the defined contribution section, or a salary supplement.  This change resulted in an  
accounting gain last year of £42.1m which was included in the income statement as an exceptional item;
 ❚ To enable the conversion of the buy-in to buy-out, in 2013 a new Plan was established for existing employee 
members whose pensions are not insured through the buy-in contracts, and the associated assets and liabilities 
were transferred across.  It is intended that the pensions and matching insurance contracts held by the original 
Plan will be converted to buy-out, and the original Plan can then be dissolved.
The following table summarises the principal risks associated with the Group’s defined benefit arrangements:
Investment Risk The present value of defined benefit liabilities is calculated using a discount rate set by reference 
to high quality corporate bond yields.  To the extent that the return on plan assets is lower than 
the discount rate, the pension surplus may reduce and a deficit may emerge.
Interest Rate Risk A fall in bond yields would increase the value of the liabilities.  This would be only partially offset 
by an increase in the value of bond investments held.
Inflation Risk An increase in inflation would increase the value of pension liabilities.
Longevity Risk The present value of the defined benefit liabilities is calculated having regards to a best 
estimate of the mortality of plan members.  If members are expected to live longer, this will 
increase the liabilities.  
The buy-in contracts represent approximately 24% of the total pension liabilities and provide a partial hedge to the 
risks described above.
The components of the net benefit expense recognised in the consolidated income statement are as follows:

The most recent full actuarial valuation was undertaken as at March 2013.  The IAS 19 valuation of the  
defined benefit obligation was undertaken by an independent qualified actuary as at January 2014 using the 
projected unit credit method.  The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were as follows:

 Female 25.0 27.3 25.0 27.3
The key sensitivities in the calculation are the discount rate and the inflation assumption.  A decrease of 0.25%  
in the discount rates used would increase the gross liabilities by approximately £35m, which would be partly 
mitigated by an increase of approximately £4.8m on the insurance assets.  An increase of 0.25% in the inflation 
assumption would increase the gross liabilities by £24m, offset by an increase of approximately £2.4m on the 
insurance assets.
Members of the defined benefit section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings whilst the employer contribution 
rate is 17.5%.  Members of the defined contribution section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings which is 
matched by the employing company.  Contribution rates are expected to remain the same for the year ahead.
Total employer contributions of £32.5m (2013: £24.3m) were made during the year, including special contributions 
of £15.0m (2013: £11.0m), £9.1m (2013: £5.4m) in respect of the defined contribution section and £1.2m in respect 
of Automatic Enrolment contributions which commenced in February 2013.
An amendment to IAS 19 Employee Benefits was published in June 2011 and became effective during the current 
year.  This affects the accounting for defined benefit pension schemes and has been applied this year.  
The main change is that instead of using an assumed return on pension assets, the income statement charge 
is calculated by applying the discount rate to the net pension surplus or liability.  If applied retrospectively, the 
effect of the amendment on last year would have been to increase pension costs in the income statement by 
£2.6m and to increase actuarial gains in the statement of comprehensive income by an equivalent amount.  
There is no impact on the balance sheet.  As the impact is not material, prior year figures have not been  
restated and remain as reported last year.

25. Equity settled share-based payments
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes.  Details of the Long Term Incentive 
Plan (LTIP) and the Share Matching Plan (SMP) are set out in the Remuneration Report.  Other  
share-based payment schemes in operation are:
Management share options
The NEXT Management Share Option Plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten 
years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee.  
This plan is primarily aimed at middle management and senior store staff.  No options were granted to any  
directors or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review.  No employee is entitled to  
be granted options under the scheme and be included in NEXT’s LTIP or the SMP in the same year.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits and there are no cash 
settlement alternatives.  Options are set at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.  The maximum total 
market value of shares (i.e.  the acquisition price of shares) over which options may be granted to any person 
during any financial year of the Company is three times salary, excluding bonuses and benefits in kind.  This 
limit may be increased to five times salary in circumstances considered by the Committee to be exceptional, for 
example on the grant of options following recruitment.  Grants are generally made annually.  
Sharesave options
The Company’s Save As You Earn (Sharesave) scheme is open to all employees.  Invitations to participate are 
generally issued annually and the scheme is subject to HMRC rules which limited the maximum monthly savings 
for the schemes detailed below to £250.  Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of  
20% and are exercisable three, five or seven years from the date of grant.

The weighted average remaining contractual life of these options is 7.7 years (2013: 8.0 years).  These options  
were exercised at different times in the year and the weighted average share price during this period was 
£48.12.  No SMP options were exercised in the previous year.  12,338 options were exercisable at the end of the  
period (2013: nil).
Fair value calculation
The fair value of management, sharesave and share matching plan options granted is calculated at the date 
of grant using a Black-Scholes option pricing model.  Expected volatility was determined by calculating the  
historical volatility of the Company’s share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.  The 
expected life applied in the model is based on historical analyses of exercise patterns, taking into account any 
early exercises.  The following table lists the inputs to the model used for options granted in the years ended 25 
January 2014 and 26 January 2013 based on information at the date of grant:

26. Shares held by ESOT
The NEXT 2003 Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) has an independent professional trustee resident in 
Jersey and provides for the issue of shares to Group employees, including share issues under share options, at 
the discretion of the Trustee.  All management and sharesave options which were exercised during the year were 
satisfied by shares issued from the ESOT.
At 25 January 2014 the ESOT held 6,190,747 (2013: 6,531,837) ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company, the 
market value of which amounted to £388.8m (2013: £265.1m).  Details of outstanding share options are shown in 
Note 25.
The consideration paid for the ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company held by the ESOT at 25 January 2014 
and 26 January 2013 has been shown as an ESOT reserve and presented within equity for the Company and the 
Group.  All other assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOT have been incorporated into the accounts of the 
Company and the Group.

shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity of £38.4m (2013: £44.3m) is after the issue of nil-cost LTIP , SMP and 
Deferred Bonus shares.  The weighted average cost of shares issued by the ESOT was £74.0m (2013: £69.0m).
Of the £41.0m commitment at January 2013, £6.3m was fulfilled in the current year and £34.8m was not fulfilled 
and expired.
At 19 March 2014, employee share options over 106,334 shares had been exercised subsequent to the balance 
sheet date and had been satisfied by ordinary shares issued by the ESOT.
27. Financial instruments: risk management and hedging activities
NEXT operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign 
currency risks associated with the Group’s activities.  As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the 
Group uses derivative financial instruments.  In accordance with the Group’s treasury policy, derivative instruments 
are not entered into for speculative purposes.  Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies 
the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, 
instrument types and transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign 
currency risks.
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash and short term deposits, bank 
overdrafts and loans, and corporate bonds.  The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance 
for the Group’s operations.  In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade 
receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.

Liquidity risk
The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within 
risk parameters agreed by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the 
operating needs of its businesses.  The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure 
that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.

At January 2014 the Group had borrowing facilities of £300m (2013: £300m) in respect of which all conditions 
precedent have been met and which are committed to December 2016 (2013: December 2016).  None of this 
facility was drawn down at January 2014 (2013: £nil).  Subsequent to the year end date, the facility was extended 
to May 2019.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate corporate bonds and cash flow interest rate risk 
on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.  The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored 
regularly to assess the mix of fixed and variable rate debt, and the Group uses interest rate derivatives where 
appropriate to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates and the economic environment.  
Interest rates:  fair value hedges
The Group has interest rate swap agreements in place as fair value hedges of part of the interest rate risk associated 
with the Company’s corporate bonds.  Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same key features as the 
bonds, the Group receives a fixed rate of interest equivalent to the relevant coupon rate, and pays a variable rate.  
Details of the effective rates payable are given in Note 20.

Derivatives in designated fair value hedging relationships 16.8 34.0

Total interest rate derivatives 16.8 38.3
Other interest rate derivatives related to economic hedges of variable rate interest payments due under swaps 
relating to the 2013 corporate bond which were not able to be hedge accounted under IAS 39.
The fair values of derivatives have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing 
interest rates and are based on market prices at the balance sheet date.
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s principal foreign currency exposures arise from the purchase of overseas sourced products.  Group 
policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to 24 months ahead in order to fix the cost in Sterling.  This 
hedging activity involves, inter alia, the use of spot, forward and option contracts.
The market value of outstanding foreign exchange contracts is reported regularly at Board level, and reviewed 
in conjunction with percentage cover taken by season and current market conditions in order to assess and 
manage the Group’s ongoing exposure.
The Group does not have a material exposure to currency movements in relation to translation of overseas 
investments and consequently does not hedge any such exposure.  The Group’s net exposure to foreign currencies, 
taking hedging activities into account is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in Note 30.
Foreign currency: cash flow hedges

The Group also supplies its associated company, Cotton Traders, with US Dollars.  The notional value of contracts 
outstanding at January 2014 was £36.6m (2013: £28.0m).  
Credit risk
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks and companies 
which must fulfil credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board.  Concentrations of risk are mitigated 
by the use of various counterparties at any one time.  All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject 
to credit verification procedures.  Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts.  The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Directory customer base 
being large and diverse.  The Group’s outstanding receivables balances are detailed in Note 14.

Capital risk
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as analysed in Note 31, and equity attributable to the equity 
holders of the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.  The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities 
within the Group continue as going concerns while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of 
capital.  The Group is not restricted by any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in earnings per share, the Group has been 
returning capital to shareholders by way of share buybacks in addition to dividends (including, more recently, 
special dividends).  Share buybacks are transacted through both on-market purchases and contingent contracts 
for off-market share purchases.

The Group’s principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and the Euro.  The table below illustrates the 
hypothetical sensitivity of the Group’s reported profit and closing equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the 
US Dollar/Sterling and Euro/Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain 
unchanged.  The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the directors’ assessment of a reasonably possible change, 
based on historic volatility.
The analysis assumes that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective 
cash flow hedge relationship affect the fair value reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.   
For foreign exchange derivatives which are not designated hedges, movements in exchange rates impact the 
income statement.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.

Sterling weakens by 10%
US Dollar (0.8) (0.8) 44.7 36.5
Euro (1.2) (1.0) 3.5 1.9
Year end exchange rates applied in the above analysis are US Dollar 1.65 (2013: 1.58) and Euro 1.21 (2013: 1.17).  
Strengthening and weakening of Sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and 
nature of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Group’s reported profit and closing equity to a 0.5% 
increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged.  The sensitivity rate of 0.5% 
represents the directors’ assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historic volatility.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions:
 ❚ For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is 
assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
 ❚ Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the 
purpose of this analysis.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT – PARENT COMPANY
Independent auditor’s report to the 
members of NEXT plc
We have audited the parent company financial 
statements of NEXT plc (“the Company”) for the year 
ended 25 January 2014 which comprise the Balance 
Sheet, the Statement of Changes in Equity and 
the related notes C1 to C5.  The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting 
Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice), including Financial Reporting 
Standard 101 ‘Reduced Disclosure Framework’.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, 
as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of 
the Companies Act 2006.  Our audit work has been 
undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in 
an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’ s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.  
Respective responsibilities of directors 
and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 31, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the parent company 
financial statements and for being satisfied that they 
give a true and fair view.  Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the parent company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial 
statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the 
amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or error.  This includes an assessment 
of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of significant accounting estimates 
made by the directors; and the overall presentation of 
the financial statements.  In addition, we read all the 
financial and non-financial information in the Annual 
Report and Accounts to identify material inconsistencies 
with the audited financial statements and to identify 
any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.  
If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the 
implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the parent company financial statements:
 ❚ give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s 
affairs as at 25 January 2014;
 ❚ have been properly prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
 ❚ have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by 
the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 ❚ the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited has been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006; and
 ❚ the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the parent company financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to 
report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following 
matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to 
report to you if, in our opinion:
 ❚ adequate accounting records have not been kept 
by the parent company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
 ❚ the parent company financial statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited are not in agreement with the accounting 
records and returns; or
 ❚ certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration 
specified by law are not made; or
 ❚ we have not received all the information and 
explanations we require for our audit.
Other matter
We have reported separately on the group financial 
statements of NEXT plc for the year ended 25 January 
2014.

1.  The maintenance and integrity of the Next plc website is the responsibility of the

initially presented on the website. 
2.  Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination 
of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
C1. Accounting policies
The parent company financial statements of NEXT plc have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 and 
Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”), which was first applied this year after notifying 
shareholders of the proposed change last year.  FRS 101 enables the financial statements of the parent company to be prepared 
in accordance with EU-adopted IFRS but with certain disclosure exemptions.  The main areas of reduced disclosure are in 
respect of equity settled share based payments, financial instruments, the cash flow statement, and related party transactions 
with Group companies.  The Company’s reported profits and net assets were unaffected by the transition to FRS 101 and remain 
consistent with EU-adopted IFRS which was applied previously.  The accounting policies adopted for the parent company, NEXT 
plc, are otherwise consistent with those used for the Group which are set out on pages 77 to 80.  As permitted by Section 408 of 
the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the Company is not presented as part of the financial statements.  The profit 
after taxation dealt with in the accounts of the holding company was £478.8m (2013: profit of £478.7m).
C2. Investments

APPENDIX 1
FURTHER INFORMATION ON RESOLUTION 19: OFF MARKET PURCHASES OF OWN SHARES
As noted on pages 28 and 29 in the Directors’ Report, approval will be sought from shareholders to renew the 
Company’s authority to make off-market purchases of its shares.  
By virtue of special resolution number 17 passed at the Company’s 2013 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
shareholder authority was given to the Company to make on-market purchases of shares.  This authority was 
limited to a maximum of 24.169 million shares and expires on the earlier of the date of the AGM held in 2014 or  
1 August 2014.  At the same AGM, authority was granted to the Company to make off-market purchases of shares 
for cancellation under contingent purchase contracts to be entered into with any of Goldman Sachs International, 
UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Bank plc and Barclays Bank plc (the “Bank(s)”).  This authority was limited to 
a maximum of 5 million shares and expires on the earlier of the date of the AGM to be held in 2014 or 1 August 
2014.  Pursuant to those authorities and up to 19 March 2014, the Company has bought back 5,440,666 shares for 
cancellation, representing 3.4% of its issued share capital as at the date of the 2013 AGM, at a total cost of £263.4 
million.  Of these, 50,000 shares were bought back under contingent purchase contracts.
Under Sections 693 and 694 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”), the Company is not permitted to make 
off-market purchases or contingent purchases of its shares unless it obtains advance shareholder approval to the 
proposed contract terms.  Furthermore, under the rules of the UK Listing Authority (the “Listing Rules”) the Company 
may not purchase its shares at a time when any director is in receipt of unpublished price sensitive information 
about the Company.  Accordingly, no purchases of shares would normally be made in periods when the directors 
might be in receipt of unpublished price sensitive information (“Close Periods”).  Typically, these include the  
periods from the Company’s half year end up to the announcement of its interim results in September and from 
the January year end up to the announcement of the full year results in March each year.  These Close Periods 
inevitably reduce the number of shares the Company is able to purchase.
In order to achieve maximum flexibility in its share purchase activities, the Company is able to enter into 
irrevocable and non-discretionary programmes to allow it to buy shares during Close Periods.  Another method 
of providing flexibility and reducing the cost, is for the Company to enter into contingent forward purchase 
contracts outside of Close Periods.  As in previous years, the Company intends to enter into new agreements (the  
“Programme Agreements”), with each of the Banks, under which the Company may (although it is not obliged to) 
enter into contingent forward trades (“Contingent Forward Trades” or “CFT”) from time to time.  
The terms of a CFT will be agreed between the Company and the Bank before it is entered into.  The Company 
is committed to purchase shares under a CFT on the day it is executed subject to the terms of the Programme 
Agreement.  The terms of each CFT will provide for the Company to purchase a fixed number of shares each week 
over a period of between 20 to 30 weeks.  The maximum number of shares that can be purchased under each CFT 
is limited to 30,000 shares per week.  
Whether or not the Company purchases shares in a particular week during the term of a CFT is dependent upon 
the Company’s share price either not rising to, or above, a level (the “Upper Suspension Level”) or, if applicable, 
falling to or below a level (the “Lower Suspension Level”).  The Suspension Levels and duration are determined by 
the Company and are set at the time the CFT is entered into.  The Upper Suspension Level must be set between 
104% and 110% of the Company’s share price at the start of the CFT.  If the Company chooses to incorporate a 
Lower Suspension Level, it must be set between 80% and 95% of the price at the start of the CFT.  The inclusion of 
a Lower Suspension Level would help mitigate the Company’s financial commitment under a CFT if its share price 
was to fall below this level after the CFT had been executed.  If the Lower Suspension Level is not included, the level 
of discount to the market share price would be higher.
The price at which the Company may purchase shares during the term of a CFT (the “Forward Price”) shall also 
be fixed at the start of the CFT.  The Forward Price will be determined by the Bank with reference to the volume 
weighted average price for shares traded in NEXT on the day the CFT is entered into.  The Forward Price is subject 
to a maximum of 99% of the share price at the start of the contract and a minimum of 10 pence (the par value 
of an ordinary share).  The minimum and maximum amount of time between entering a CFT and shares being 
purchased is 5 days and 30 weeks respectively.  The Company will announce the details of each CFT on the 
day it is entered into and any subsequent termination via the UK Listing Authority’s Regulatory News Service.  This 
structure would allow the Company to purchase shares at a discount to the market price (as at the time each 
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2014
116 23158.04 - Proof 2 - 14/03/2014
Parent Company accounts Governance Consolidated accounts Additional information Business reports
CFT commences), for so long as the Suspension Levels are not reached, without breaching the Listing Rules.  If any 
Suspension Level is reached, the CFT would terminate automatically at that time and no further shares would be 
purchased under that contract.
Under the provisions of sections 693 and 694 of the 2006 Act, the Programme Agreements and Contingent Forward 
Trades are contingent purchase contracts to purchase shares by the Company off-market.  Accordingly resolution 
19, which will be proposed as an ordinary resolution, seeks shareholder approval to the terms of the Programme 
Agreements to be entered into between the Company and each of the Banks.  The Programme Agreements will 
have a duration of the shorter of the period to the date of the next AGM to be held in 2015 or 1 August 2015 and will 
incorporate the terms of an ISDA Master Agreement and Schedule.  The Programme Agreements will be entered 
into and each CFT will be effected outside a Close Period but shares may be purchased during a Close Period by 
the Company.  
Should shareholder approval be granted, any number of CFT may be effected with the Banks at any time, provided 
that: 
 ❚ the total maximum number of shares which the Company is permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority 
would be 4.0 million, representing circa 2.6% of its issued share capital at 19 March 2014;
 ❚ the total cost of shares that the Company would be permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority may not 
exceed £200 million (including costs);
 ❚ the Forward Price may not exceed the higher of 105% of the average middle market closing price of the 
Company’s shares as derived from the Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five days immediately 
preceding the day on which the CFT was effected and the amount stipulated by Article 5(1) of the Buy-back 
and Stabilisation Regulation 2003; 
 ❚ the Forward Price will be no more than 99% of the share price at the time the Contingent Forward Trade was 
effected;
 ❚ the minimum price that can be paid for any share is £0.10; and
 ❚ only one Contingent Forward Trade will be entered into on any particular day.  
Shares purchased under the Programme Agreements will reduce the number of shares that the Company may 
purchase under any authority granted at the AGM on 15 May 2014 for on-market purchases.  No shares will be 
purchased under that authority on the same day that a CFT is entered into.  The authority granted to the Company 
under this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the AGM of the Company held in 2015 or on 1 August 2015, 
whichever is the earlier, unless such authority is renewed prior to that time (except in relation to the purchase of 
shares under any CFT effected before the expiry of such authority and which might be completed wholly or partly 
after such expiry).  The purchase of shares under the Programme Agreements will always be physically settled by 
delivery of shares to the Company (except in the case of certain events of default or termination events).  
A copy of each of the Programme Agreements will be available at the AGM on 15 May 2014.  Copies will also be 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office at Desford Road, Enderby, Leicester LE19 4AT and at the 
offices of Pinsent Masons, 30 Crown Place, Earl Street, London EC2A 4ES during usual business hours until the date 
of the AGM and at the Meeting itself.
The total number of employee share options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 19 March 2014 was 7,242,592.  
This represents 4.7% of the issued share capital at that date.  If the Company were to buy back the maximum 
number of shares permitted pursuant to both the existing authority for off-market purchases granted at the 2013 
AGM (which will expire at the 2014 AGM) and the authority sought by this special resolution, then the total number 
of options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 19 March 2014 would represent 5.0% of the reduced issued share 
capital.

Attendance, Voting and Questions
All members who hold ordinary shares are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM.  A member who is entitled 
to attend and vote may appoint one or more proxies to attend and vote instead of him, provided that each 
proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or shares held by him.  A proxy need not 
also be a member.  A proxy may vote on any other business which may properly come before the meeting.   
If you do not intend being present at the meeting please either sign and return a hard copy form of proxy so as 
to reach the Company’s registrars at least 48 hours before the meeting or follow the instructions for electronic 
proxy appointment through CREST or through www.sharevote.co.uk, where full instructions are provided.   
The return by a member of a fully completed form of proxy will not preclude any such member from attending in 
person and voting at the meeting.
A person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the 2006 Act to enjoy 
information rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between them and the shareholder by 
whom they were nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the 
AGM.  If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, they may, under 
any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
The statements of the rights of members in relation to the appointment of proxies in the above paragraph and in 
the paragraphs headed “Electronic proxy appointment through CREST” and “Proxy card” below do not apply to a 
Nominated Person.  The rights described in these paragraphs can only be exercised by registered members of the 
Company.  Nominated persons are reminded that they should contact the registered holder of their shares (and 
not the Company) on matters relating to their investments in the Company.
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its 
behalf all of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the 
appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted, the senior holder being the first named of the 
joint holders to appear in the Company’s share register.
A member who appoints as their proxy someone other than the Chairman, is responsible for ensuring that the 
proxy attends the meeting and is aware of the voting intention of the member.  If no voting instruction is given, the 
proxy has discretion on whether and how to vote.
If a member submits more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time 
for the receipt of proxies will take precedence.  
The Company, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001 and its articles of 
association, specifies that only those shareholders registered in the register of members of the Company as at 
6pm on 13 May 2014 shall be entitled to attend or vote at the aforesaid general meeting in respect of the number 
of shares registered in their name at that time.  Changes to entries on the relevant register of securities after 6pm 
on 13 May 2014 (or 6pm on the day that is two days before any adjourned meeting) shall be disregarded in 
determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting.
All resolutions will be put to poll votes.  This means that the votes of all shareholders, including those who cannot 
attend the meeting but who validly appoint a proxy, are counted.  The procedures for the poll votes will be  
explained at the AGM.
In respect of resolution 19 on off-market share purchase contracts, the 2006 Act provides that this resolution will 
not be effective if any member of the Company holding shares to which it relates (i.e.  those which may be 
purchased pursuant to the Programme Agreements) exercised the voting rights carried by any of those shares in 
voting on the resolution and the resolution would not have been passed if they had not done so.  Therefore, NEXT 
intends to disregard any poll votes which are cast in favour of resolution 19 attaching to 4.0 million shares (being 
the total maximum number of shares which the Company is permitted to purchase pursuant to the Programme 
Agreements) from both the total number of votes cast in favour of this resolution and the total number of votes 
cast.

As at 19 March 2014 (being the latest practicable date prior to the publication of this Notice) the Company’s 
issued share capital consists of 155,032,317 ordinary shares.  All of the ordinary shares carry one vote each and 
there are no shares held in treasury.  
A member attending the meeting has the right to ask questions.  The Company must ensure any such question 
relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting is answered but no such answer need be given if (a) to do 
so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information, 
(b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable 
in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.
Electronic proxy appointment through CREST
CREST members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so for the AGM to be held on 15 May 2014 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures 
described in the CREST Manual.  CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those  
CREST members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST 
message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST 
Manual.  The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the 
instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received 
by the issuer’s agent (ID RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice 
of meeting.  For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp 
applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the 
message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST.  After this time any change of instructions to  
proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that 
Euroclear UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages.  
Normal system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions.  It is  
the responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member 
or sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means 
of the CREST system by any particular time.  In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings.  The CREST Manual is available at www.euroclear.com.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of 
the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
Documents available for inspection
The following documents will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company during usual 
business hours and will be available for fifteen minutes prior to and for the duration of the AGM:

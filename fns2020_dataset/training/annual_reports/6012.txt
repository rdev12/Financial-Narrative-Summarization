Income/(Expenditure)
The bread-making 
business has doubled 
in size in the last 
five years.
We took a small
step back to help
us take a much 
bigger step 
forward. 2
I am pleased to report that underlying operating profit from
continuing activities for the financial year ended June 2013
has risen to £7.4m from £7.2m. Debt and interest costs have
been substantially reduced and the Board has proposed a final
dividend of 0.5p, amounting to a total dividend of 0.75p for
the year.
Progress is founded on a combination of factors. Finsbury
Foods has continued to develop our licensed and retailer brand
portfolios providing bakery goods that are attractive and 
aﬀordable for consumers. We maintain first class relationships
with grocery multiples, focusing on the specialty brands that
remain appealing even in tough times.
In November 2012, a successful equity placing during the
first half of the year raised £3.8m to fund capital investment
projects in our core cake business. Th e placement attracted 
a welcome blend of new and existing institutional investors,
indicating a long awaited shift in market perception towards
Finsbury Foods.
In February 2013, our Free From business was sold to Genius
Foods for £21m on a debt-free, cash-free basis, with £18m up
front and a further £3m due to the Group in 2015. Although
the sale reduces the overall size of the business, the Board
viewed the disposal as a small step back that would allow 
us to take a much bigger step forward.
Th e net eﬀect of those transactions has been transformative.
Total Group debt has fallen from £33.9m in the previous period
to £7.4m, interest charges will also fall, with levels falling
beneath £1m for the next twelve months. Debt to EBITDA
multiples have responded in kind, registering a decline from
just under 5 in 2009 to below 1. 
Of course, consumer markets remain challenging. Weary
consumers have grown increasingly deal focused while 
commodity prices continue to rise. Finsbury Foods has 
responded to the value conscious environment with a series
of cost and product initiatives, reacting nimbly to the
changing needs of the marketplace.
Th e sale of Free From will enable the company to rebase, driving
forward organic growth. £6m has been set aside for new capital
investment projects in our core cake business this year, the scale
of investment demonstrating the depth of our ambition. 
Reinstating the dividend is another statement of intent. 
Returning to the dividend list for the first time since 2008 
is evidence of our ability to reward shareholders for their faith
in the company. Public markets often take a while to overcome
adverse sentiment and the recent rise in the share price 
is gratifying. 
Th e market is beginning to view our story afresh, assessing
the current management team on its own merits, recognising
the inherent value that lies in this business. Our attention 
is starting to turn outwards. It is always convenient, especially
for a Group with a track record of acquisitions, to return 
to M&A activity once the balance sheet has been restored. 
Seeking deals that oﬀer the right synergies and appropriate
benefits is clearly attractive. While this oﬀers a quick way of
progressing the size of the Group, nurturing existing businesses
remains the priority. Investment will build upon the foundations
we have created, bolt-on acquisitions driving long-term value
as and when opportunities arise.
I would like to take this opportunity to express my thanks
to Ian Farnsworth who has stepped down after 15 years of
distinguished service in the boardroom. A warm welcome 
is extended to Raymond Duignan who joined the Board as 
a Non-Executive Director in July and has assumed Ian’s duties
as Chair of the Audit and Remuneration Committee.
We have arrived at a moment of transition: Finsbury Foods has
attained a position of hard-earned stability, trading maturely,
paying down debt and generating cash. We have traded our
way through a diﬃcult market, regenerated all aspects of the
business and completed a strategic disposal that will allow
us to move forward. As we head into a new financial year,
I retain a deep-seated desire to build a business that we can
all be proud of. Excellence and innovation continue to signpost
the way forward, laying the foundations for further growth
and driven by the ultimate objective of creating value
for shareholders.
It was always going to take time. Turning around a Group the size 
of Finsbury Foods demanded a concerted and prolonged eﬀort by a
team with the skill, resolve and foresight to overcome adverse trading
conditions. Although significant challenges remain in our business, 
a degree of momentum has clearly become apparent.

Trading Performance
Results for the full 52-week period ending 29 June 2013 
are described in greater detail in the Business Review Section
but there are a number of key areas I would like to take this
opportunity to highlight:
• Underlying profit before tax from continuing operations 
rising 19.3% to £5.5m (2012: £4.6m) 
• Group revenue from continuing operations down 1.3% 
to £176.6m driven primarily by currency fluctuations 
in our overseas subsidiary
• 17% sales growth in bread driven by growth of licensed 
brands (Vogel’s, Cranks and Village Bakery)
• Net debt reduction from £33.9m to £7.4m
• Fully subscribed Equity placement in Nov 2012 raising 
£3.8m for capital investment projects 
• Sale of Free From business for £21m in February 2013
• Restructured balance sheet capable of funding further 
capital investment and M&A 
• Debt to EBITDA ratio down to below 1x 
(2009 peak was nearly 5)
• Dividend reinstatement (last paid in 2008)
• Bakery Awards supplier of the year 2013
Results in Perspective
It was a mixed year in our core UK Bakery division. Th e bread
business maintained long-term growth trends; the business
has doubled in size over the last five years, benefitting from 
an increased demand for artisan and organic products. 
Th e cake business endured tougher trading conditions. 
Sales in the UK were relatively flat while performance in
the Overseas division was adversely impacted by exchange
rate fluctuations. 
Elsewhere, growth was in evidence across the Group. 
Th ornton’s cake business registered a 20% jump in sales and
our Marvel Film franchise continues to thrive. Th e Me To
You licence came on stream in the second half of the year, 
a highly promising year-round gift proposition. We also
launched Disney Celebration cakes in Australia, a unique
product in that marketplace.
Closer to home, UK consumer behaviour presents a dichotomy.
Both ends of the grocery scale are exhibiting signs of expansion
but the middle is under stress. Consumers are buying treats
where they perceive uniqueness or real quality, shopping
across locations to obtain the optimum mix. 
It’s hard to keep growing at 17% if your major customers are
not but our coverage is reassuring. For example, Finsbury Foods’
speciality bread business is significantly weighted towards
Sainsbury’s and Waitrose; they are growing and we are growing
alongside them. We are working to retain a strong presence
where there is growth, resisting the temptation to chase 
volume where doing so would be imprudent.
Regrettably, the economic environment remains unhelpful with
promotional activity at unsustainable levels in most categories
of food. Commodity prices have settled down marginally, we
haven’t witnessed the huge fluctuations of recent years. Overall,
however, trends remain upwards with marked volatility in key
ingredients such as wheat, eggs and sugar.
One of the reasons for investing so significantly in the businesses
going forward is that the only way we can square the circle
of keeping prices keen for consumers and stimulating deals
is by being a low cost manufacturer. We’ve spent a lot of time
and eﬀort changing pack sizes, reformulating products and
becoming more eﬃcient. Our managers are pulling every
possible lever to try and make sure we get back to sensible
levels of return. 
One of those levers involved securing a long-term lease 
on the property adjacent to our Nicholas & Harris bakery.
Building into the space from our existing facility will add 60%
of extra production capacity. Securing the space is strategically
significant, an unambiguous signal of our intention to mature
into becoming a £50m speciality bread business.
Growth remains the priority. It is a significant achievement
to have guided the company through such a diﬃcult period
but further evolution is essential. 
We need to keep investing in first class machinery, presenting
consumers with fresh ideas and products while continuing
to develop the shareholder base. I have no doubt that Finsbury
Food Group will continue to achieve our growth objectives,
both organically and by acquisition. Th e signs may be propitious
but, in many respects, the real work has yet to begin.
Light at the end of the tunnel is always welcome. While the precise
length of the tunnel remains a matter of debate, it is pleasing to reflect
on a year in which the enduring efforts of senior management and
staﬀ at all levels of Finsbury Foods generated demonstrable progress. 
Chief Executive’s Report Growth remains the priority.It is a significant
achievement to have guided the company through
such a difficult period but further evolution 
is essential.

On 27 February 2013 the Group sold its Free From business for a total
value of approximately £21 million to focus on its core Cake and Bread
businesses. Th e Group will continue on its stated strategy of generating
returns for shareholders by building a crafted bakery group focused 
on premium, celebration and well-being that delivers for its customers
and the end consumer. 
Business Review
Strategy
We will continue to develop our licensed brand portfolio 
to complement our core retailer brand relationships. 
We are still a modest manufacturer in the total Bakery 
markets in which we operate and see exciting organic
growth opportunities in all our businesses.
Th e sale will allow the Group to further invest, pay down
debt, and take advantage of additional opportunities available
to us, with the ultimate goal of driving shareholder value.
Our Markets
Th e total annual UK ambient cake market (including 
pre-packed cake and in-store bakery) is valued at £1.05 billion
(source: Kantar Worldpanel). Th e past 12 months has seen
value of sales decline by 2.0% and unit sales decline by 2.5%.
We continue to be the second largest supplier of cake to the
UK’s multiple grocers and have maintained our leading
position in the niche areas on which we focus.
Annual bread and morning goods sales are in excess
of £3 billion (source: Kantar Worldpanel), although the
market remains flat. We are a small but fast-growing player 
in this market, focusing on speciality breads, where demand
remains strong despite the economic climate.
Our Business
Following the disposal of the Free From business, 
the Group consists broadly of the following businesses:
UK Bakery
Lightbody of Hamilton Ltd (‘Lightbody’), based in Hamilton,
employs around 1,100 people and is the UK’s largest supplier
of Celebration cake with Disney, Nestlé and Th orntons product
within its Licenced portfolio as well as Own Label Cake. 
It also produces a wide range of small cakes, slices and in store
bakery (ISB) bites, a number of which are under our licensed
brands including Th orntons, and WeightWatchers.
Memory Lane Cakes Ltd (‘Memory Lane’), based in Cardiﬀ,
employs around 700 people and is the leading manufacturer
of the UK retailers’ premium own label cake ranges. It also
produces under a number of brands notably Nestlé, 
WeightWatchers and Th orntons.  
Nicholas & Harris Ltd. (N&H), based in Salisbury, employs
around 300 people and produces a range of speciality breads,
rolls, hot cross buns and tea cakes to UK retailers. Its focus
is on ‘clean label’ breads, rolls and buns, from which it has seen
strong growth with its chosen own label customers. N&H’s
brand portfolio, which includes Vogel’s seeded bread, Cranks
Organic and Village Bakery Rye bread, continue to perform
well, significantly outgrowing the market by double-digits.
Management has now launched reduced carbohydrate bread
under its new brand Livlife, augmenting its branded range.
On 27 February 2013 the Group sold its Free From business
for a total value of approximately £21 million to focus on 
its core Cake and Bread businesses. Th e Free From business
consisted of two subsidiaries, Livwell Limited (“Livwell”) and
United Bakeries (Holdings) Limited (“UBH”) (the holding
company of United Central Bakeries Limited (“UCB”)). 
Th ese subsidiaries, which account for approximately 14% 
of Group full year revenues, have been sold to Genius Foods
Limited (“Genius”), on a debt-free, cash-free basis.
Brands and Licences
Th e Group remains primarily a retailer branded business with
sales of retailer own label products accounting for around 59%
of our total revenue compared to 58% a year ago. Th e balance
represents the strength of both licensed brands and own brands
under our control.
WeightWatchers
WeightWatchers is one of the largest food brands in the UK
and we hold the licence to manufacture and distribute low fat
cake to the UK and Ireland’s multiple grocers under this brand.
Since the acquisition of Anthony Alan in 2007, the brand has
been developed through utilisation of the broad production
capability within the Group and our skills in developing new
products that adhere to brand guidelines. Th e Low Fat cake
category continues to struggle in the face of recessionary
pressures on household budgets. However, this year 
WeightWatchers has again successfully grown its share of this
category. Th e summer of 2013 will see the WeightWatchers
Slices range move into new individually wrapped, snack pack
packaging. Th is significant investment will seek to develop
and grow the brand by opening up the important out of home
eating occasion.
We’ve set 
£6 million 
aside for 
new capital 
investment.
We’ve been awarded another
new WeightWatchers contract. 11 12 Business Review
Th orntons
Th e Group remains committed to developing its branded range
via its licensing arrangement with the Th orntons confectionery
business. A combination of new product development, 
pack formats and targeted promotional activity has seen the
Th orntons brand grow sales by 17% in the last year, making
it one of the fastest growing Cake brands in the market
(Source: Symphony IRI). Our best selling Th orntons Bites
range continues to dominate the pre-packed Bites market
with a 48% value share of this market (source: Symphony IRI).
Nestlé Confectionery
We continue to benefit from the rights to manufacture and
distribute cake products under Nestlé confectionery brands.
In addition to our existing range of Smarties and Funtastic
products we have this year added the Yorkie and Rowntrees
Randoms brands into our portfolio.
Disney
Our successful range of Disney Celebration cakes are 
continually evolving. Properties within the portfolio include,
Disney Princess, Cars, Fairies, Avengers, and Iron Man. 
Th e Disney portfolio is a key part of our overall Celebration
cake business and plays an important role in retaining our
position as the largest supplier of Celebration cake to the
UK’s multiple grocers. We currently have a 45% share 
of the UK Celebration cake market.
Other Celebration Cake Licences
Th ese four major brands are complemented by a range of other
licences which are particularly focused on driving Celebration
cake sales. Evergreen properties such as Peppa Pig, and Hello
Kitty have their own target market and oﬀer excellent additions
to the range. Th is year we have added the successful Me to Y ou
Celebration and gift cake to our portfolio. In addition the
Spiderman 4 range has proved very successful, delivering in
excess of £2m sales, making it the biggest selling Celebration
cake license in the market in the last year. Other notable
launches this year include Fireman Sam, Skylanders and
One Direction which together have added a further £2.5m
sales (Source Symphony IRI).
Speciality Bread Licences
Nicholas & Harris bakery has 3 brands which it markets under
long-term license agreements, all of which are distributed
across the UK in the major supermarkets. Vogel’s is a ‘no 
artificial additives’ seeded bread that has a unique nutty taste
and dense texture. Vogel’s has grown by over 11% in the last
year and now has over 26,000 followers on its Facebook page.
Vogel’s is licensed by Alan Stevns and co. who owns the brand
on a global basis. Crank’s is our ‘proper Organic Bread’ brand
and is ‘the bread you buy when you don’t have time to make
your own’. Cranks has grown by over 22% in the last year
and is owned by All About Foods ltd. Th e Village Bakery
Melmerby brand is licensed by Bell’s of Lazonby and is an
Organic Rye bread brand. Village Bakery has grown by 5%
and appeals to those trying to avoid wheat.
Livlife is a new brand launched in July 2013. It has half the
carbohydrates of regular bread and is aimed at the growing
number of consumers who are trying to cut and control the
amount of carbs they eat. Livlife is supported by a significant
PR, digital media and advertising campaign to build awareness.
Overseas
Th e Group’s 50% owned Company Lightbody Stretz Ltd,
supplies and distributes the Group’s UK manufactured
products and third party products primarily to Europe.
Principal Operating Risks 
Th e Group operates in an environment which is continually
changing and as a result the risks it faces will also change over
time. Th e assessment of risks and the development of strategies
for dealing with these risks are achieved on an ongoing basis
through the way in which the Group is controlled and managed
internally. A formal review of these risks is carried out by the
Group on an annual basis. Th e review process involves the
identification of risks, assessment to determine the relative
likelihood of them impacting the business and the potential
severity of the impact, and determination of what needs 
to be done to manage them eﬀectively.
Th e Directors have identified the following principal risks
and uncertainties that could have the most significant impact
on the Group’s value generation:
Competitive Environment and Customer Requirements
Th ere is currently over capacity in the market place and
competition is strong between manufacturers in the Bakery
sector. Th e monitoring of key performance indicators at 
customer level such as service levels and customer complaints
is part of the risk management process associated with this
specific risk. Strong customer service, quality products, low costs
and innovative new product development are areas of focus
to satisfy customer needs and remain strong in a competitive
environment. Th e Group has invested heavily in category
management, new product development and marketing skills.
Th is investment has helped create an insight into customers
and consumer demands. Continual monitoring of customer
KPI’s and production quality measures take place to ensure
customer requirements are being met and issues are identified
in a timely manner to limit their impact.
Product Quality
Product quality is a key strength of the Group and failure 
to maintain a high standard of food quality and safety 
would have a severe impact on service levels and customer 
relationships. Th e Group’s quality assurance procedures,
managed at site level, are reviewed continuously with 
improvements made as appropriate. Th e Group’s Technical
Director helps provide focus to ensure there is continuous
improvement across all sites to meet the increasingly high
expectations of our customers. Th e operating subsidiaries 
are subject to regular internal and independent food safety
and quality control audits including those carried out by, 
or on behalf of, our customers. Th e Group maintains product
recall insurance cover to mitigate the potential impact

14 15 Prices and Supply
Increases in the price and volatility of price of raw materials
along with increasing utility costs can impact the core 
profitability of the business and any related shortage in supply
of raw materials will impact the business’ ability to maintain
its service levels to customers – another of its key performance
indicators. Th e prices of certain key commodities (e.g. sugar)
are tied to the Euro – the relative strength of sterling and
future volatility within the Eurozone will, therefore, have 
an impact on the cost of these commodities. 
Aﬀordability for consumers is essential and the Group will
focus on internal efficiencies and productivity initiatives 
to lessen the rising commodity price impact on consumers. 
Th e Group maintains a high level of expertise in its buying
team and will consider long-term contracts where appropriate
to reduce uncertainty in input prices. Th e team also cultivates
strong relationships with its major suppliers to ensure continuity
of supply at competitive prices. Regular renovation and 
innovation in our product range can help to manage margin
pressures in an effective manner as far as the competitive
environment allows. Th e Group also purchases forward foreign
currency in order to minimise the fluctuation of input costs
linked to future currency conversion rates.
Economic Environment
Th e economic environment remains challenging, with 
promotional activity at unsustainable levels in most categories
of food. Th e Group will continue to focus on quality and value
for money in periods of reduced spending. Th e Group manages
margins through investing in site capabilities to increase 
eﬃciency, managing capacity, reformulating and developing
products that stand out from the crowd and maintaining
strong relationships with customers and licensors.

Trading Results
Group revenue from continuing operations for the 
52 week period to 29 June 2013 was £176.6 million 
(2012: £178.9 million).  
Gross margin for the financial year was 26.3% (2012: 25.6%).
Commodity prices have settled down marginally and we have
not witnessed the huge fluctuations of recent years. Th e outlook
is that marked volatility is expected in key ingredients such
as wheat, eggs and sugar.  
Administrative expenses on continuing activities have 
remained fairly stable year on year with continued focus 
on cost control. Inflationary increases and employee pay rises
have been oﬀset largely by operational improvements and
returns from capital investment.
Th e following analysis is included to show what the Directors
consider to be the underlying performance of the Group and
eliminates the impact of significant non-recurring items and
certain charges required by IFRS.

Non-Financial Key Performance Indicators
A range of non-financial key performance indicators are
monitored at site level covering, amongst others, customer
service, quality and health and safety. Th e Group Board 
receives an overview of these on a regular basis.
Disposals
On 27 February 2013 the Group sold its Free From business
for a total value of approximately £21 million of which 
£3 million is deferred to 27 February 2015.
Th e Free From business consisted of two subsidiaries, Livwell
Limited (“Livwell”) and United Bakeries (Holdings) Limited
(“UBH”) (the holding company of United Central Bakeries
Limited (“UCB”)). Th ese subsidiaries, which account for
approximately 14% of full year Group revenues, have been
sold to Genius Foods Limited (“Genius”), on a debt-free,
cash-free basis.
Acquisitions
Th ere were no acquisitions in the period. 
Note 24 details the deferred consideration paid during 
the year and the amount outstanding at the year end.
Cash Flow
Operating profit of £8.3 million together with a share placing
raising £3.8 million and a net cash inflow from the sale of the
Free From business of £17.1 million has transformed the
balance sheet with bank debt of £27.9 million being repaid
during the year. Th ere was a decrease in our working capital
requirement of £2.9 million compared to the last financial year
reflecting the disposal of Free From business and increased
focus on working capital levels. Corporation tax payments
made in the financial year totalled £1.8 million (2012: £2.2
million), the payments in the current year took account of 
the research and development tax relief due to the Group.
Capital expenditure in the year amounted to £4.2 million
(2012: £3.2 million).   
Earnings Per Share
EPS comparatives to the prior year can be distorted by significant non-recurring items and IFRS adjustments. Th e Board 
is focused on growing adjusted diluted EPS, which is calculated by eliminating the impact of the items highlighted above
and incorporates the dilutive eﬀect of share options. Continuing adjusted diluted EPS is 5.9p for the 52 week period
(2012: 5.0p).

Debt and Bank Facilities
Th e Group’s total net debt including deferred consideration
is £7.4 million (2012: £33.9 million) down £26.5 million
from prior year. 
The Group’s total net bank debt excluding deferred 
consideration after deducting cash balances as at 29 June 2013
was £7.2 million (2012: £32.6 million). Within this total net
bank debt, £2.8 million is due within one year, including cash
at bank, invoice finance and loan notes payable on demand
(2012: £13.9 million).  
Th e Group’s debt facility with HSBC Bank Plc totals
£32.0m, the key features of the facility are as follows:
• Overdraft (£3.0m)
• Confidential invoice discounting facility (£15.0m)
• Mortgage facility (£4.0m)
• Rolling asset finance facility (£2.0m)
• Revolving credit facility (£8.0m).
Note 20 gives details of the drawn amounts and maturity dates.
Discounted deferred consideration of £0.2m is outstanding
at the year end and is payable within the next year (2012:
£1.2m). Th is attracts an interest of 5.0% pa (2012: 5.2%). 
Th e Group is able to oﬀer strong asset backing to secure 
its borrowings. Th e Group owns freehold sites at Memory
Lane in Cardiﬀ, at Lightbody, and Campbells in Scotland.
In addition, the Group has a strong trade debtor book to
support the invoice discounting facility, made up primarily
of UK’s major multiple retailers. Th is debtor book stood at
£21.9 million (2012: £27.2 million) at the period end date.
Th e Group recognises the inherent risk from interest rate
rises. To mitigate these risks, the Group has three interest
rate swaps in place with a total coverage of £18.0 million
(2012: £20.0 million) equivalent to 250% (2012: 61%) of
year end net bank debt following the sale of the Free From
business at a weighted average rate of 4.0% (2012: 4.7%).
Th e cost of closing out swaps is prohibitive, in June 2014 
a £10 million swap will expire and a £6 million swap will
commence.  
Th e eﬀective interest rate for the Group at the year end, 
taking account of the interest rate swaps in place and deferred
consideration with base rate at 0.5% and LIBOR at 0.5%,
was 5.97% (2012: 5.21%). 
Financial Covenants
Th e Board reviews the Group’s cash flow forecasts and key
covenants on a regular basis to ensure that it has adequate
facilities to cover its trading and banking requirements with
an appropriate level of headroom. Th e forecasts are based 
on management’s best estimates of future trading. Th ere has
been no breach of covenants during the year. 
Interest cover (based on adjusted EBITDA) for the 52
weeks to 29 June 2013 was 6.3 (2012: 4.7). Net bank debt
to EBITDA (based on adjusted EBITDA) for the 52 weeks
to 29 June 2013 was 0.6 (2012: 2.6). 
Taxation
The Group taxation charge on continuing operations for 
the year was £1.4 million (2012: £1.3 million). Th is represents
an eﬀective rate of 21.5% (2012: 28.3%). 
Further details on the tax charge can be found in Note 9 
to the Group’s Financial Statements.
Environmental Matters
The Group continues to focus on packaging reduction
through innovation and has delivered further reductions
across the business. Th e Group continues to take the key
learning and successes from individual sites and applies
them across other areas of the business to deliver category
leading innovative solutions. 
Mandatory participation in the CRC Energy Eﬃciency
Scheme (formerly known as the Carbon Reduction 
Commitment) focuses the Group to reduce its carbon 
emissions. New production capability, which is in the
process of being installed in Hamilton, will further reduce 
the consumption of cardboard and reduce food waste.
Work with local universities on shelf life of product 
will lead to waste reduction over the coming years. 
Nicholas & Harris is now a ‘landfill-free’ site and 
all waste materials are recycled.
Employee Social and Community Issues
All manufacturing sites are active within their local community
supporting local community initiatives. The Group also 
supports local and national government initiatives such 
as the New Work programme.
We work closely with local universities business projects and
placements and plan to continue this partnership work further
in several areas of training, development and project work.
Th ey continue to invest in training and development of the
workforce supporting a programme of vocational qualifications. 
13 Bakers have qualified from the Nicholas & Harris
bakers’ apprenticeship scheme this year, with City and Guilds’ 
qualifications. Nicholas & Harris is one of the largest employers
in Salisbury and have continued in their support of the local
community, including sponsorship of the internationally
renowned Salisbury Arts Festival.
Technical Matters
All sites have performed well throughout the year and have
significantly improved operational performance by a real
focus on right first time. 
Group technical systems continue to be rolled out across 
all sites, giving a standardised approach and minimising 
duplication of eﬀort.  
The Group’s focus on operational improvement will be
instrumental in optimising process control, minimising waste
and improving quality consistency. All sites have maintained
solid BRC A grades.
We invest in people and
communities at local and 
national level. Our investment in new ways to improve
our productivity and profitability includes
chocolate decoration and snap pack
machines, ultrasonic cutting and robotic
picking, increased tub security and 
Autobake and auto filling lines. We also
added 60% of extra production capacity
at our Nicholas & Harris bakery, changed
pack sizes and reformulated products,
while our new production facility in
Hamilton will further reduce cardboard
consumption and food waste.

Presentation of Financial Statements
Basis of Preparation
Th ese accounts cover the 52 week period ended 29 June 2013 (prior financial year is the 52 week period ended 30 June 2012). Th e Group Financial
Statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).
Th e Group Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). Th e Company has elected to prepare its parent company Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP;
these are presented on pages 61 to 66.
It should be noted that current liabilities exceed current assets. Having reviewed the Group’s plans and available financial facilities, the Board has reasonable
expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Th e Group has stayed within its banking
facilities during the year, meeting covenant requirements. Th e Group has the continued support from its bank with renegotiated facilities of £32m. In addition,
the Group has a strong asset backing and strong trade debtor book. Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the
Financial Statements for both the Group and the parent company.
Th e Board reviews the Group’s cash flow forecasts and key covenants on a regular basis to ensure that it has adequate facilities to cover its trading and
banking requirements with an appropriate level of headroom. Th e forecasts are based on management’s best estimates of future trading. Th ere has been 
no breach of covenants during the year. All covenant tests were passed at the year end.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
Th e Group is required to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Th ese estimates and judgements are based on historical experience and
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Th e resulting accounting estimates will, 
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Accounting estimates and judgements have been required for the production of these Financial Statements. Th e following are those that are deemed 
to require the most complex judgements about matters that have the most significant eﬀect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.
• Impairment of goodwill can significantly impact the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income for the year. Th e Group estimates 
the recoverable amounts based on historical experience of margin, volumes and cost structure and expectations of future events. Th e Group’s weighted 
average cost of capital has been inflated to take account of the current market conditions and this has been applied as a pre-tax discount factor to obtain
a current value. Th e weighted average cost of capital is impacted by estimates of interest rates, equity returns and market specific risks. Refer to Note 
12 for further details.
• Th e Group has one defined benefit pension scheme. Th e net deficit or surplus is the diﬀerence between the plan assets and plan liabilities at the period 
end date. Th e valuation of the assets and liabilities is based on a number of judgements. Th e assets are based on market value at the period end date, 
the liabilities are based on actuarial assumptions such as discount, inflation and mortality rates. Th e assumptions applied are based on advice provided 
by the Scheme’s actuary, further detail can be found in Note 16.
• Th e Group recognises provisions where an obligation exists at the period end date and a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions for an onerous leases,
employee claims and pension augmentation have been recognised in these Financial Statements. Discussions on dilapidations on warehouses are ongoing. 
Estimates for employee claims are made based on the number of reported accidents and incidents and the number of expected claims yet to be reported
based on historical evidence, all accrued up to the maximum self insured amount of £10,000 per claim. Th e pension provision relates to a contractual 
liability for pension augmentation that has been valued by the pension scheme actuaries. See Note 23 for further detail. 
1 Significant Accounting Policies
Th e accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated Financial Statements, except as explained
in the basis of preparation, which addresses any changes in accounting policies resulting from new or revised standards.
Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating
policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are taken
into account. Th e Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences until 
the date that control ceases. Th e accounting policies of new subsidiaries are changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the Group.
Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated Financial Statements.
Lightbody Stretz Limited which is 50% owned by the Group has been consolidated into the Group accounts as a subsidiary with a corresponding non-controlling
interest on the basis that the Group has the controlling interest. Control arises by virtue of the fact that Lightbody Group, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Finsbury Food Group, has a majority of voting rights arising from an agreement between Lightbody Group Limited and Philippe Stretz.
30 1 Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Foreign Currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange
rate ruling at that date. 
Any exchange diﬀerences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates diﬀerent from those at which they were
initially recorded are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period in which they arise.
Th e assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s presentational
currency, Sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the period end date. Th e revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate
for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Th is revaluation is recognised through the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Th e Group has derivative financial instruments in respect of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange hedges. Th e Group does not hold derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. Th e existing interest rate swaps and foreign exchange hedges used by the Group do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting
set out by IAS 39 and have thus been treated as financial assets and liabilities which are carried at their fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position. Fair value is deemed to be market value, which is provided by the counterparty at the year end date. 
Changes in the market value of interest rate swaps have been recognised through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as finance income
or cost. Changes in the market value of foreign exchange hedges have been recognised through the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
within administrative costs.
Non-derivative Financial Instruments 
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans and
borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Trade and other Receivables
Th e value of trade and other receivables is the amount that would be received if the debt was cleared on the period end date.
Trade and other Payables
Th e value of trade and other payables is the value that would be payable to settle the liability at the period end date.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and which form an integral part of the Group’s cash
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Interest-bearing Borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest method, less any impairment losses.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Recognition and Measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost or fair value at the date of acquisition, less accumulated depreciation and impairment provisions.
Costs include expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Th e cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and
direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and
removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment 
is capitalised as part of that equipment.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write oﬀ the cost, less estimated residual value, of the property, plant and equipment by equal instalments over their estimated
useful economic lives to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have diﬀerent
useful lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Th e depreciation rates used are as follows:
Freehold buildings 2% – 20% Plant and equipment 10% – 33%
Leasehold property Up to the remaining life of the lease Assets under construction Nil
Fixtures and fittings 10% – 33% Motor vehicles 25% – 33%
Impairment reviews of fixed assets are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
31 1 Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Leased Assets
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition
the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial
recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Assets acquired by finance lease and hire purchase are depreciated over the lease term or their useful lives. 
Obligations under finance leases are included in liabilities net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. Th e finance element of the rental payment
is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as finance expense so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the net
obligations outstanding in each period.
Other leases are operating leases and the leased assets are not recognised on the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Operating Lease Payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Finance Lease Payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. Th e finance charge is allocated 
to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested
annually for impairment.
Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration for the business exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Where the excess is negative
(negative goodwill), the amount is taken to retained earnings. Goodwill is capitalised and subject to impairment reviews both annually and where there 
are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment
Th e carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed at each period end date to determine whether there is an indication 
of impairment. Intangible assets and goodwill are considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative
eﬀect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each period end date.
An impairment loss would be recognised whenever the carrying amount of an intangible asset, goodwill or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income.
Calculation of Recoverable Amount
Th e recoverable amount is the greater of the assets’ fair values less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing an asset’s value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the asset.
Deferred Consideration
Th e provision for deferred consideration is initially stated at the net present value of the expected future payment and the discount is accrued by increasing
the amount of the provision up to the expected payment date. Th e charge relating to the unwinding of the discount is recorded within finance costs.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the first-in first-out basis, and includes all direct costs incurred
and attributable production overheads. Net realisable value is based upon estimated selling price allowing for all further costs of completion and disposal.
Specific provisions are made against old and obsolete stock taking the value to zero or an estimated reduced value based on the most likely route for disposal
of each particular item of stock.
32 1 Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Employee Benefits
Defined Benefit Plans
Our wholly owned subsidiary Memory Lane Cakes Ltd operates a defined benefit pension scheme and the pension costs are charged to the Consolidated
Statement of Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS19, with current and past service cost being recognised as an administrative expense, expected
return on defined benefit pension plan assets net of interest on defined benefit pension plan liabilities is shown as finance income or a finance cost in the
Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. Th e actuarial gains or losses are recognised in full in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive
Income. Further details on the defined benefit pension scheme are given in Note 16 to the Financial Statements.
Defined Contribution Plans
Th e costs of contributing to defined contribution and personal pension schemes are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income 
as an administration cost in the period to which they relate.
Share-based Payment Transactions
Th e value, as at the grant date, of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period
in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. Th e fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model,
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Revenue
Revenue represents the amounts derived from the sale of bakery products. Revenue is the invoiced value of consideration received or receivable excluding
value added tax, trade discounts, transactions with or between subsidiaries and less the cost of price promotions and sales over-riders. Revenue is recognised
upon despatch of goods.
Segmental Reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues
and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. All segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s
Board of Directors. Th e Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered to be the Group FD and Group CEO who have been delegated decision
making responsibility from the PLC Board of Directors as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment 
of performance by segment. 
Licence Fees
Payments made for licence fee charges are recognised under cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income in the period to which
they relate. Any charges relating to future years are deferred and recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income under cost of sales
over the life of the contract.
Finance Income and Cost
Finance costs comprise loan interest payable, interest payable, finance charges on finance leases recognised using the eﬀective interest method, unwinding 
of the discount on provisions and deferred consideration and interest on defined benefit pension plan obligations.
Finance income comprise expected return on defined benefit pension plan funds invested and interest receivable on funds invested. Interest income 
is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as it accrues, using the eﬀective interest method.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income
except to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the period end date, 
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary diﬀerences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for taxation purposes. Th e following temporary diﬀerences are not provided for: 
• Th e initial recognition of goodwill;
• Th e initial recognition of assets or liabilities that aﬀect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and
• Th e diﬀerences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Th e amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the period end date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits
will be available against which the temporary diﬀerence can be utilised.
Research and Development Expenditure
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised 
in Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income as incurred.
33 2 Discontinued Operations
On 27 February 2013 the Group sold its Free From business for a total undiscounted value £21,257,000 and a pre-tax gain of £1,184,000 was recorded. 
Th e Free From business consisted of two subsidiaries, Livwell Limited (“Livwell”) and United Bakeries (Holdings) Limited (“UBH”) (the holding company
of United Central Bakeries Limited (“UCB”)).

34 3 Revenue and Segment Information 
Operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reporting and decision making. Th e Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered 
to be the Group Finance Director and Group Chief Executive Oﬃcer who have been delegated decision making responsibility from the PLC Board 
of Directors as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance by segment.
Th e Board uses adjusted operating profit, reviewed on a regular basis, as the key measure of the segments’ performance. Operating profit in this instance 
is defined as profit before the following:
• net financing expense
• share option charges
• non-recurring significant items
• fair value adjustments relating to acquisitions 
• pension charges or credits in relation to the diﬀerence between the expected return on pension assets and interest cost on pension liabilities and 
• revaluation of interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
On 27 February 2013 the Group sold its Free From business, allowing the Group to concentrate on its bakery business. Th is sale has created a shift in the
way in which the business is reviewed. Th e UK cake and bread business is viewed as one segment - UK Bakery, whilst the 50% owned business Lightbody
Stretz Limited is viewed as a separate segment - Overseas. Prior year comparatives have been restated accordingly.
Th e UK Bakery segment manufactures and sells bakery products to the UK’s multiple grocers. Th is segment primarily comprises the operations of Memory
Lane Cakes Ltd, Lightbody Group Ltd, Campbells Cake Company Ltd and Nicholas & Harris Ltd. Th ese subsidiaries are aggregated into a single segment
after considering the following criteria:
• the nature of the products – products are similar in nature and are classed as manufactured bakery products, the products sit side by side 
in the retailers’ bakery aisles
• the production process – the production processes have the same or similar characteristics
• the economic characteristics – the average gross margins are expected to be similar
• the customers – five customers account for approximately 70-75% of total revenue, these customers are common throughout the subsidiaries
• the distribution methods – the same methods of distribution apply to all subsidiaries.
Th e core operation of the Overseas segment is the distribution of the Group’s UK manufactured product along with the sale of third party products
primarily to Europe. 
Costs of Group operations plus a 10% premium have been allocated across the segments on the basis of their operating profit. Th e premium has been charged
to reflect the synergies achieved from obtaining resources centrally giving benefits across the operating segments. Operating profit levels have been chosen
as the basis, as this reflects the underlying performance of the segment and is also the return the Group expects from those segments.
A purchasing premium of 2% is charged from Group operations, and is calculated on materials and packaging spends at segmental level. Th is charge is based
on the rationale that Group operations, through its Group buyers, optimises the Group’s procurement spend through leveraging its purchasing power. 
Th is has resulted in an profit from continuing operations of £0.8m (2012: £1.2m) being presented within the Group operations segment.
Th e Group’s finance income and costs cannot be meaningfully allocated to the individual operating segments.

5 Non-Recurring Significant I   tems
Th e Group presents certain items as non-recurring and significant. Th ese relate to items which, in management’s judgement, need to be disclosed by virtue
of their size or incidence in order to obtain a more meaningful understanding of the financial information. 
Costs of £247,000 relate to due diligence and consultancy expenses associated with an aborted acquisition and £471,000 relates to the costs associated 
with the cancellation of unapproved share options and the issue of ordinary shares in exchange for this cancellation. Th e Group believes that the issuance 
of ordinary shares and settlement of taxes in return for cancellation of 1,1490,000 unapproved options is beneficial to the shareholders of the Company 
as it reduces dilution and removes a potential share overhang.
A pre-tax gain of £1,184,000 was recorded as non-recurring significant income under discontinued operations, this gain relates to the sale of the Free From
business on 27 February 2013.

*Other timing diﬀerences in the current year relate an increase in deferred tax asset during the year on unexercised share options as a result of increases 
in the market value of the Company’s shares.  9 Taxation (continued)
Reductions in the corporation tax rate from 26% to 24% (eﬀective from 1 April 2012) and to 23% (eﬀective 1 April 2013) were substantially enacted 
on 26 March 2012 and 3 July 2012 respectively. Further reductions to 21% (eﬀective from 1 April 2014) and 20% (eﬀective from 1 April 2015) were
substantially enacted on 2 July 2013. Th is will reduce the company’s future current tax charge accordingly. Th e deferred tax assets and liabilities 
at 29 June 2013 have been calculated based on the 23% rate as the 20% and 21% rates were enacted after the balance sheet date.
Th e impact of the reduction in the UK tax rate from 24% to 23% from April 2013 amounts to £77,000 lower charge in the year to 29 June 2013. Th e adjustment
for prior year in 2013 relates primarily to additional tax relief on qualifying R&D expenditure, for 2012 the prior year adjustment relates to utilisation of losses
brought forward £150,000 and additional tax relief on qualifying R&D expenditure for prior periods of £80,000.
Th e parent company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £219,995 (2012: £229,560). Th is asset has not been recognised in these Financial Statements
as suitable profits to utilise the underlying losses are not expected to arise in the future. 
10 Earnings Per Ordinary Share
Basic earnings per share for the period is calculated on the basis of profit for the year after tax, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue 
of 59,904,000 (2012: 53,374,000).  
Basic diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potential
dilutive ordinary shares. For 29 June 2013 the diluted weighted average number of shares is 65,653,000, (2012: 55,796,000). 
An adjusted earnings per share and an adjusted diluted earnings per share have also been calculated as in the opinion of the Board this will allow
shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the trading performance of the Group. Th ese adjusted earnings per share exclude:
• Reorganisation and other significant non-recurring costs
• IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ fair value adjustment relating to the Group’s interest rate swaps 
and foreign exchange contracts
• IAS 19 ‘Accounting for retirement benefits’ relating to the net income
• IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ discount charge relating to the deferred consideration payable payable and receivable
• Th e taxation eﬀect at the appropriate rate on the adjustments.

12 Intangibles
Intangible assets comprise licences and goodwill.
a) Licences
Th e value of the licensing agreements is calculated by reference to the additional cash flow they are expected to generate over unbranded sales. Th e period
over which the value is amortised varies between licences depending on their remaining life.
Th e licenses recognised were purchased as part of the acquisition of Goswell Enterprises Ltd in June 2009 and relate to the exclusive licensing agreements
for Cranks, Doves Farm breads and Vogels. Th e period over which the value is amortised is the life of the license which is five years to June 2014.

b) Goodwill
Goodwill has arisen on acquisitions and reflects the future economic benefits arising from assets that are not capable of being identified individually and
recognised as separate assets. Th e goodwill reflects the anticipated profitability and synergistic benefits arising from the utilisation of the Group’s existing
distribution channels and customer relationships in the bakery sector. Th e goodwill is the balance of the total consideration less fair value of assets acquired
and identified. Th e carrying value of the goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment.

Memory Lane Cakes 1,514 1,514
52,968 61,399 12 Intangibles (continued)
Th e Group tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired. Th e recoverable
amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. Th e key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount
rate used for future cash flows and the anticipated future changes in revenue, direct costs and indirect costs. Th e assumptions used reflect the past experience
of management and future expectations.
Th e Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates these forward for the next 
five years with a residual value at the end of the five years. Changes in revenue and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future
changes in the market.  
Th e revenue growth rate used for impairment tests at 29 June 2013 was nil (2012: nil) for Nicholas & Harris, Memory Lane Cakes and Lightbody of Hamilton.
Th is growth rate was applied to the 2014 budget and for the following 5 years, indirect costs are inflated over the same period by nil (2012: nil). Th is nil growth
rate has been taken as a prudent approach. Gross margins and distribution cost as a percentage of revenue are forecast to be in line with budget 2014. 
Th e five year cashflow is taken along with a residual value at the end of the five year period.
Growth rates do not reflect the ambitions of the Group and have been prepared in a conservative manner.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% (2012: 10%) has been used in these calculations. Th e Group has considered the impact of the deterioration in the economic
climate and higher level of return expected by equity holders due to the perceived risk in equity markets. Th e Group’s actual weighted average cost of capital
is significantly less than this at the period end date.
Th e discount rate used for each cash generating unit has been kept constant as the market risk is deemed not to be materially diﬀerent between the diﬀerent
segments of the bakery sector, nor over time.
Sensitivities have been carried out by the Directors and they are comfortable that at reasonable discount levels there are no indications of impairment.

Traders Limited (10.5% of the issued capital of that company). Th ere is no active market in these shares, therefore the fair value cannot be determined and 
the investments are held at cost.
Interest Rate Swaps at Fair Value
Th e Group has entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations:
£10.0m for four years from 1 June 2010 (fixed) at 4.9%
£5.0m for five years from 1 July 2011 (fixed) at 3.6%
£3.0m for four years from 22 May 2013 (fixed) at 1.7%
Th ere is one forward dated swap of £6.0m for three years from 2 June 2014 (fixed) at 1.9%.
In addition one five year interest rate swap of £5.0m (fixed) at 5.5% matured during the year in May 2013.
Th e total coverage at the year end of £18.0 million (2012: £20.0 million) is equivalent to 250% (2012: 61%) of total net bank debt at a weighted average 
rate of 4.0% (2012: 4.7%).
Changes in their fair value are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income resulting in a credit of £855,000 
(2012: credit £84,000) as indicated above.
Th ey are shown as liabilities as a result of the current low levels of base and LIBOR interest rates.
Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts at Fair Value
Th e Group has entered into a number of forward foreign exchange contracts to minimise the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates, changes in their 
fair value are recognised immediately in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income. A charge of £179,000 (2012: credit £152,000) is shown 
in administration expenses for the periods reflecting changes in their fair value. 
45 15 Deferred Consideration Receivable
On 27 February 2013 the Group sold its Free From business to Genius Foods for a total value of £21,257,000, £3,000,000 of which has been deferred 
and is payable 27 February 2015. Th is is shown as a non-current asset in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

16 Pension Schemes
A number of companies within the Group operate defined contribution pension schemes with one company also operating a defined benefit scheme. 
Defined Contribution Scheme
Th e Group made contributions in respect of its defined contribution pension arrangements of £648,000 (2012: £657,000). 
Defined Benefit Scheme
Th e Group’s defined benefit scheme is the Memory Lane Cakes Pension Scheme, which is a separately administered plan. At the financial year end 2013,
the scheme had no active members accruing benefits (2012: nil), 240 deferred pensioner members (2012: 260) and 189 pensioner members (2012: 171).
Th e scheme was closed to future accrual on 31 May 2010. Th e assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the company. Th e amounts in the
Financial Statements for the 52 weeks ended 29 June 2013 relating to defined benefit pension are based on a full actuarial valuation dated 31 May 2010,
which was updated at the end of the financial year 2013. Th e full valuation as at 31 December 2012 is ongoing, the results of which are not expected until 
after the publication of this Annual Report.
A £65,000 contribution was paid during the financial year 2013 from Memory Lane Cakes (2012: £65,000). Th e Group’s contribution has been agreed 
based on the outcome of the full actuarial valuation dated 31 May 2010. Th e valuation of the Scheme on an equity/bond basis and projected unit method,
showed that there was a deficit of £170,000 equivalent to a 1% deficit of liabilities over assets. Th e valuation was conducted by a qualified independent actuary.
Th is deficit is payable over a three year period at a rate of £65,000 pa. Th e full actuarial valuation diﬀers from the financial year end valuation deficit 
of £2,843,000 (2012: £3,075,000).

Cumulative amount at beginning of financial year (4,583) (2,226)
Recognised in the financial year (1,118) (2,357)
Cumulative amount at end of financial year  (5,701) (4,583)
 
Principal long-term actuarial assumptions at the year end were as follows:
2013 2012
CPI price inflation assumption 2.5% 2.1%
Increases to pensions in payment 2.5% 2.1%
Discount rate for liabilities 4.7% 4.6%
Expected rate of return for plan assets 4.7% 7.8%
Th e financial assumptions are based on market conditions as at the review date of 29 June 2013 with discount rates based on the yields on long-dated high
quality corporate bonds. Th e discount rate is higher than the discount rate used last year reflecting the increase in bond yields over this period. Th e expected
rate of return for plan assets for 2013 is the long term rate that reflects the yield on high quality corporate bonds as required under changes to IAS 19. 
A revised version of IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans will apply to accounting periods on or after 1 January 2013. Th e first year end for which the revised
standard will apply will therefore be 28 June 2014. However if the standard had been in force for the year end 29 June 2013 the main eﬀects would have been: 
• Th e expected rate of return on the assets over the year would have been equal to the discount rate of 4.6% pa (rather than 7.8% pa), which would have 
changed the expected return on assets figure from £1,401,000 to £826,000. Th is would then have had the following impacts:
• Th e income recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income would have reduced from £1,285,000 to £710,000
• Th e actuarial loss recognised directly in equity would have reduced from £1,118,000 to £543,000
• Additional disclosures about the risks posed by the Scheme.
Th e deficit recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position would be unchanged.
Salary inflation assumptions are as determined by the Board with regard to price inflation. Th e salary inflation from 31 May 2010 when the Scheme closed
to future accrual was assumed to be in line with inflation. 
Over 90% of the plan assets are held in a target return fund which targets three month LIBOR +3% pa (which is assumed long-term to be broadly
equivalent to RPI + 5%). Th e expected return on cash is based on the current Bank of England base rate rather than long term deposit rates.

Female currently at age 45 26.8 27.0
Male currently at age 65 22.4 21.8
Female currently at age 65 24.9 24.7
CPI Inflation is assumed to be at 2.5% (2012: 2.1%) per annum. Th e diﬀerential between the assumed rate of inflation and the discount rate for liabilities 
is 2.2% (2012: 2.5%). 
Changing the year end 2013 assumptions to those of 2012 year end listed above, the deficit would have been £2,307,000 compared to the reported deficit 
of £2,843,000.

53 26    Financial Risk Management 
Th e main purpose of the Group’s financial instruments which comprise of bank term loans, invoice discounting facility, hire purchase, finance leases, interest
rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, cash and liquid resources and various items arising directly from its operations, such as trade receivables and trade
payables, is to finance the Group’s operations. Th e main risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Th e Group’s
policies on the management of liquidity, credit, interest rate and foreign currency risks are set out below and also referred to in the Business Review.
a) Liquidity
Th e Group’s policy is to ensure that it has suﬃcient facilities to cover its future funding requirements. Short term flexibility is available through the existing
bank facilities and the netting oﬀ of surplus funds. Th e carrying amounts are the amounts due if settled at the period end date. Th e contractual undiscounted
cash flows include estimated interest payments over the life of these facilities. Th e estimated interest payments are based on interest rates prevailing at the 
29 June 2013.

Th e carrying amount relating to interest rate swaps is the fair value.
Th e information relating to the interest rate swaps shown in the tables above indicate the cash flows associated with these instruments. Th is also reflects 
the expected eﬀect on the future profit. Th ese amounts will change as interest rates change.
Short-term flexibility is available through existing bank facilities and the netting oﬀ of surplus funds.
54 26    Financial Risk Management (continued)
b) Credit
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises
principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. Th ese trading exposures are monitored and managed at operating level and are also monitored 
at Group level. At the period end date there were no significant concentrations of credit risk. Th e carrying amount of the financial assets represents 
the maximum credit exposure. Th erefore, the maximum exposure to credit risk for the trade receivables at the period end date was £21.9 million 
(2012: £27.2 million) and the ageing of trade receivables at the period end date was:  
2013 2012
£000 £000
Not past due 19,297 23,672
Past due 0 – 30 days 2,082 2,942
Past due 31 – 120 days 427 329
Past due more than 120 days 58 280
21,864 27,223
Th e above numbers are net of impairment. Group policy is to provide in full against all receivable balances whose full recovery is significantly in doubt. 
Th e provision is netted oﬀ the gross receivable.
Th e Group’s strategy is to focus on supplying UK multiple grocers, the nature of these customers is such that there is relatively low risk of them failing 
to meet their contractual obligations. Th ere is no impairment necessary to the value of trade receivables at the period end date over and above the specific
credit note provision and bad debt provision held at the year end. Th e balance of £0.5 million past due by more than 30 days is equivalent to less than 
1 day sales (2012: £0.6 million, equivalent to 1 day).
c) Market Risk
i) Interest Rate Risk
Th e Group’s interest rate risk exposure is primarily to changes in variable interest rates. Th e Group has entered into three interest rate swap arrangements 
in order to hedge its risks associated with any fluctuations. Details of swaps are given in Note 14.
Th e profile of the Group’s loans including deferred consideration and overdraft at the period end date were split as follows:
2013 2012
£000 £000
Fixed rate liabilities - 549
Variable rate liabilities 8,739 37,104
8,739 37,653
Swaps amounting to £18,000,000 (2012: £20,000,000) limit the risk associated with the variable rate liabilities, the weighted average interest rate 
at 29 June 2013 is 4.0% (2012: 4.7%).
Sensitivity
A 1% increase in the base rate or LIBOR would have the following impact on interest charges and associated net assets for the Group, this sensitivity 
relates to interest-bearing bank borrowings and interest rate swaps only and excludes possible changes in pension financing costs. 
2013 2012
£000 £000
Profit decrease 70 206
Decrease in net assets 70 206
A 1% decrease in the base rate or LIBOR would have an equal and opposite impact to those listed above. 
Th e above movement is not equal to 1% of interest-bearing loans because of interest rate swap cover that is in place. 
ii) Commodity Prices
Any rises in commodity prices can adversely impact the core profitability of the business. Th e Group will aim to pass on its increased costs to its customers 
as far as is reasonable in the circumstances whilst maintaining its tight control over overhead costs to mitigate the impact on consumers. Th e Group maintains
a high expertise in its buying team and will consider long-term contracts where appropriate to reduce uncertainty in commodity prices. Further information
on input prices and risks is contained in the Business Review.
55 26   Financial Risk Management (continued)
iii) Foreign Exchange Risk
Th e Group currently supplies UK manufactured products to Lightbody Stretz Ltd, its 50% owned selling and distribution business trading primarily 
in Europe. Th e Group also purchases some raw materials in foreign currency. Th e consequence of this is that the Group is exposed to movement in foreign
currency rates. Forward foreign exchanges contracts are used to manage the foreign exchange exposure.
d) Debt and Capital Management
Th e Group’s objective is to maximise the return on net invested capital while maintaining its ongoing ability to operate and guaranteeing adequate returns
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, within a sustainable financial structure. On 19 March 2013, the Board approved an interim dividend 
for the six months to 31st December 2012 of 0.25p per share paid on 26th April 2013 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 5th April 2013.
A final dividend of 0.5p per share has been proposed. It is the Company's intention, to resume paying dividends at an aﬀordable rate so that the Company
can continue to invest in the business in order to grow profits.
Th e Group manages its capital by monitoring its gearing ratio on a regular basis, there are also covenant tests which are monitored regularly and presented 
to the Group’s bank every 6 months. Th ere have been no breaches of covenant tests during the year and the gearing ratio has fallen during the year to 0.1
(2012: 0.7). Th e gearing ratio is calculated taking total net debt including deferred consideration over net assets.
Th e Group considers its capital to include share capital, share premium and capital redemption reserve.
Th e Group does not have any externally imposed capital requirements.
27    Capital and Reserves
Th e reconciliation of movement in capital and reserves is shown as a primary statement Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Within retained
earnings is the net exchange diﬀerence balance at the year end of £63,000 gain (2012: £6,000 loss). 
Equity comprises the following:
• Share capital representing the nominal value of equity shares
• Share premium representing the excess of the fair value of consideration received for the equity shares, net of expenses of the share issue over nominal 
value of the equity shares
• Capital redemption reserve representing the buyback and cancellation of shares at nominal value
• Retained earnings represent retained profits.

(2012: 4.8 years).
Th e Company has used the QCA-IRS option valuer TM (based on the Black-Scholes-Merton based option pricing model) to calculate the fair value 
of the outstanding options. Th is model was developed by Th e QCA partnered with Independent Remuneration Solutions (IRS) and City Group Plc. 
Th e development was led by Mr Edward Beale, a Director of the Group and Chief Executive of City Group Plc.
Th e inputs into the Black-Scholes-Merton based option pricing model to calculate the charge for share options granted in the financial year were as follows:
2013 2012
Expected life of option 3.0 years 3.1 – 5.3 years
Volatility of share price 43% 47%
Dividend yield 0% 0%
Risk-free interest rate 0.41% 2.18%
Share price at date of grant 22.1p 21.5p – 27.5p
Exercise price 25.0p 20.0p – 20.5p
Bid price discount 10% 10%
Estimated conversion rate 100% 100%
Fair value per option 5.6p 8.3p – 10.4p
Volatility is calculated on a consistent basis for each grant of options and is based on the historic annualised standard deviation of continuously compounded
rates of return.

35 Accounting Policies
Th e following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Financial Statements.
Basis of Preparation
Th e financial year was the 52 weeks ended 29 June 2013 (prior financial year 52 weeks ended 30 June 2012). Th e Financial Statements for the Company have
been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and under the historical cost accounting rules and in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP) and law.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own Profit and Loss Account. Th e profit or loss
for the year is set out in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders’ Funds.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that it is included
within the consolidated accounts.
Th e accounting policies of the Company are the same as for the Group except for the following:
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value. 
Taxation
Th e credit for taxation is based on the loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of timing diﬀerences between the treatment 
of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing diﬀerences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting
purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.

Directors’ Report 69
Payment of Suppliers
Th e Group does not follow any code or statement on payment practice but the policy of the Group is to abide by such payment terms as are agreed with
suppliers within the terms of supply. At the Consolidated Statement of financial position date there were 67 days’ purchases outstanding (2012: 67)
calculated on the ratio of trade creditors to total purchases.    
Legal Indemnity
Th e Company maintains a Directors and Oﬃcers liability insurance policy.
Financial Instruments
Th e Group’s financial instruments comprise mortgage, asset finance facilities, a confidential invoicing facility, revolving credit facility, cash and liquid resources,
and various items arising directly from its operations, such as trade creditors. Th e main purpose of these financial instruments is to finance the Group’s
acquisitions and operations, the Group’s policy that no trading in financial instruments shall be undertaken.
Th e main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Th e Board reviews and agrees policies for managing
these risks, which have remained substantially unchanged for the year under review. Th e policies are summarised below:
Interest Rate Risk
Th e Group finances its operations by retained profits and bank borrowings. A suite of borrowing facilities totalling £32 million is available. Th is includes an
overdraft facility of £3 million, undrawn invoice discounting facility of £11.7 million, undrawn revolving credit of £8 million and unused asset finance 
of £0.7 million. Th e interest rate risk is managed through three interest rate swap transactions. Th e total balance of these swaps was £18.0 million at the
period end date. Th e counterparty to these transactions is HSBC Bank Plc.
Liquidity Risk
Short-term flexibility is available through existing bank facilities and the netting oﬀ of surplus funds. Full details of the Group financial assets 
and liabilities are given in Note 26.
Employee Involvement
Th e Group aims to improve the performance of the organisation through the development of its employees. Th eir involvement is encouraged by means 
of team working, team briefings, consultative committees and working parties. 
Disabled Employees
Th e Group is committed to equality of employment and its policies reflect a disregard of factors such as disability in the selection and development 
of employees.  
Political and Charitable Contributions
During the year charitable donations amounting to £3,000 (2012: £3,000) were made, primarily to local charities.
Going Concern
On the basis of current financial projections and available funds and facilities, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue
in operation for the foreseeable future and, therefore, consider it appropriate to prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis. Refer to the
basis of preparation for further details.
Auditors
Our Auditor KPMG Audit Plc has instigated an orderly wind down of business. Th e Board has decided to put KPMG LLP forward to be appointed 
in accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution concerning their appointment will be put to the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
• So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the company’s auditor is unaware; and
• Th ey have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Special Business at the Annual General Meeting
In addition to the ordinary business to be transacted at the Annual General Meeting of the Company, referred to in resolutions 1 to 7 of the Notice 
of Meeting, the Directors propose certain special business as set out in Resolutions 8 to 10 for the purposes summarised below:
Authority to Allot Shares – Ordinary Resolution
Resolution 8 will renew the powers of the Board to allot, pursuant to section 551 of the Companies Act 2006, the unissued ordinary shares of the Company.
Th e authority sought by this resolution will replace the existing powers of the Directors which expire on the date of the Annual General Meeting and will
provide the Directors with the flexibility to issue further ordinary shares if they deem it appropriate to do so. 70
Pre-emption Rights – Special Resolution
Resolution 9 will, if passed, dis-apply shareholders’ pre-emption rights and grant authority to the Directors, without the need for further specific shareholder
approval, to make allotments of equity securities for cash by way of bonus, rights or similar issues. Th e Directors consider it desirable for shareholders to approve
this disapplication until the next Annual General Meeting, in order to permit the allotment of shares for cash in limited circumstances to persons other
than shareholders. Th is limited disapplication will be in respect of 6,484,350 shares equal to 10% of the issued share capital of the Company.
Th e Directors have no present intention of issuing any part of the unissued share capital and no issue will be made which would eﬀectively alter the control
of the Company without the approval of the shareholders in general meeting.
Purchase of Own Shares – Special Resolution
Resolution 10, if passed, will renew the current authority for the Directors to make limited market purchases of the Company’s ordinary shares, subject to the
constraints set out in the resolution. Th e Directors believe that in certain circumstances it may be in the interests of shareholders as a whole to buy in shares 
if the discount between the share price and net asset value is suﬃciently large. Any shares purchased may be held in Treasury and may be resold at any time. 71
Th e Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the group and parent company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent company Financial Statements for each financial year. As required by the AIM Rules 
of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the group Financial Statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable
law and have elected to prepare the parent company Financial Statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of aﬀairs
of the group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the group and parent company Financial Statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• For the group Financial Statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• For the parent company Financial Statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements; and
• Prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the group and the parent company 
will continue in business.
Th e Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are suﬃcient to show and explain the parent company's transactions and disclose
with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the parent company and enable them to ensure that its Financial Statements comply with the
Companies Act 2006. Th ey have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the group and to prevent
and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Th e Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the company's website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of Financial Statements may diﬀer from legislation in other jurisdictions.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities 
in Respect of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements   72
Report on Corporate Governance
Although not formally required to do so, the Directors have sought to embrace the principles contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code (2011),
applicable to fully listed companies, in formulating and applying the Group’s corporate governance policies. Th ese policies are monitored to ensure that
they are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and comply as far as possible with the provisions of the Code given the size of the Company.
Th e Board operates as an eﬀective board in directing the activities of the Group. Th e Board meets at least six times during the year and all the Directors
make every eﬀort to attend these meetings. Th e Board maintains a schedule of matters which are reserved to it for decision, including acquisition policy,
approval of major capital expenditure and approval of annual budgets.
Th e Board consists of the Non-Executive Chairman (Martin Lightbody), two full time Executive Directors ( John Duﬀy and Stephen Boyd), a part time
Executive Director (Crawford Currie) and four Non-Executive Directors (Paul Monk, David Marshall, Edward Beale, Ian Farnsworth who retired from
the Board with eﬀect 15 July 2013 and Raymond Duignan who joined the board as non-executive director with eﬀect 15 July 2013 and of whom the last
four are independent). Consideration is given to character, judgement and business relationships when considering the directors’ independence. 
Th e role of the Chairman and the Chief Executive Oﬃcer are separate. Th e Chairman is responsible for running the Board and he meets regularly 
and separately with the Chief Executive and the other Non-Executive Directors to discuss matters for the Board.
Edward Beale is the Chief Executive of City Group and David Marshall is a Director of City Group. City Group is a subsidiary of London Finance and
Investment Group Plc, a substantial shareholder in the Company. City Group provides a full set of company secretarial services to the Board on an outsourced
basis and its fees are set out in the related party note, Note 32. Th e Company is not yet large enough to justify the employment of a full time Company Secretary. 
Board Committees
Th e Board has separate Remuneration and Audit Committees which meet on a timely basis.
Th e Audit Committee was chaired by Ian Farnsworth during the year with Edward Beale as the other member. Edward Beale is a chartered accountant
and has been a member of the Accounting Council to August 2013. Raymond Duignan took over from Ian Farnsworth as chair eﬀective from 15 July 2013.
Further details are given in the Audit Committee Report on page 73.
Th e Remuneration Committee was chaired by Ian Farnsworth with Edward Beale as the other member during the year. Raymond Duignan has assumed
the role of chair eﬀect 15 July 2013.
Further details are given in the Remuneration Committee Report on page 74.
Internal Controls
Th e Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal controls to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets, as well as reviewing
its eﬀectiveness. Th e system of internal controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risks of failure to achieve the Group’s objectives and can only
provide reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance against material loss and mis-statement. Additional resource has been employed to review current policies
and procedures and to test the systems.
Dialogue with Shareholders
Th e Board maintains a general policy of keeping all interested parties informed by regular announcements and update statements.
In implementing this policy the Board keeps in mind the distribution of shareholders between direct, nominee and institutional shareholders.
Communications are then distributed between these groups accordingly.
Specific methods of communication are:
• Annual general and extraordinary meetings with shareholders
• Broker briefings
• Broker and analysts visits to operating sites
• Letters to shareholders when appropriate
• Corporate website (www.finsburyfoods.co.uk)
• One to one meetings with investors.
Care is taken to ensure that information is made available to all shareholders at the same time. 73
Responsibilities
Th e Audit Committee has delegated responsibility from the Board to monitor and review areas such as risk management, internal controls and financial
reporting. Th e Audit Committee is also responsible for maintaining an objective and professional relationship with the Group’s auditors, monitoring their
eﬀectiveness and agreeing their fees. It receives reports on these issues from the relevant Executive Directors and external advisers and reports back to the
Board on the action points within those reports and any recommendations arising. As part of these responsibilities it considers the requirement for an internal
audit function.
Th e full terms of reference of the Audit Committee are reviewed periodically by the Board and updated as necessary. A copy can be found on the Company’s
web site at www.finsburyfoods.co.uk.
Membership
Th e Audit Committee was chaired by Ian Farnsworth until his resignation on 15 July 2013. I took over the role of chairman from that date, the other member
being Edward Beale, a Non-Executive Director. Both of us are considered to be independent Directors. Edward Beale has been a member of the Accounting
Council for 6 years to August 2013 and is able to provide technical input to committee discussions.
Procedures
Th e Audit Committee has met three times in the year. Th e Group Finance Director is invited to attend Committee meetings and the external auditors 
are invited to attend any meetings involving Financial Statements. Time is set aside during at least one meeting each year for the Committee to hold discussions
in private with the external auditors in the absence of management and Executive Directors. A representative of City Group Plc attends Committee meetings
and prepares and circulates minutes of the meetings.
Risks and Controls
Group management prepare an annual report for the Audit Committee, identifying the risks to which the Group is exposed, the procedures in place to mitigate
the risks and the potential impact on the Group. Th e Audit Committee reviews this report and any concerns that it has over the adequacy of the controls
in place, or the level of risk accepted by the Group, are reported to the Board. Th e principal operating risks to which the Group is exposed are set out in the
Business Review on page 8.  
Th e committee reviews the need for an internal audit function on an annual basis. At present, due to the limited size of the Group and lack of complexity
in the business model, the Committee does not believe that a dedicated full time internal audit function is warranted. Additional resource has been recruited
to assist with the reporting of risks, policies and procedures. A programme of rolling internal control and risk reviews is in place.  
External Reporting
Th e Board delegates primary responsibility for the preparation of complete, balanced and accurate Financial Statements and disclosures, in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standards and regulations, to the Group Finance Director. Th e responsibility of the Audit Committee is to consider significant accounting
policies, any changes in policies and significant estimates and judgements, taking into account the external auditors’ view, and to report back to the Board
any concerns that it might have. Th e Audit Committee reviews and comments on the clarity and completeness of disclosures within the Financial Statements.
Ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the annual report and accounts and half yearly reports remains with the Board.
Th e Audit Committee also reviews and comments on related information presented with the Financial Statements, in particular the Business Review 
and the Report on Corporate Governance.
Key Agenda Items
During the year, the Committee specifically discussed issues arising from:
• Sale of subsidiaries 
• Interest rate and currency hedging
• Review of risks and appropriate level of internal controls
• Impairment reviews 
• Dividend policy
• Pension disclosures.
Certain tax, pension and other non-audit advice has been received from the Company’s auditor in the year. Th e use of the Company’s auditor was 
approved in advance by the Audit Committee chairman. Th is advice was of limited nature and we do not believe it compromises the independence 
of the Company’s auditor.
If any readers of these accounts have suggestions for improvement in the content or the presentation of the Financial Statements, please can they 
let me know by writing to info@finsburyfoods.co.uk.

Remuneration Committee Report
Responsibilities
Th e Remuneration Committee is constituted to provide advice and recommendations to the Board on the policy for remuneration of the Executive Directors
of the Company and other senior managers, to agree within that policy the salary and benefits packages for Executive Directors and Managing Directors
of subsidiaries, to agree business unit cash bonus schemes and equity related remuneration and incentive schemes. Th e Remuneration Committee is also
responsible for consideration of succession planning and when necessary for agreeing any termination benefits.
Th e full terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are reviewed periodically by the Board and updated as necessary. A copy can be found 
on the Company’s web site at www.finsburyfoods.co.uk.
Membership
Th e Remuneration Committee was chaired by Ian Farnsworth until his resignation on 15 July 2013. I took over the role of chairman from that date, the other
member being Edward Beale, a Non-Executive Director. Both of us are considered to be independent Directors.
Procedures
Th e Remuneration Committee met twice in the year. Th e Group Chief Executive is normally invited to attend Committee meetings.
Papers for Committee meetings are collated by a representative of City Group Plc and circulated to Committee members in advance of each meeting.  
A representative of City Group Plc attends Committee meetings and prepares and circulates minutes of those meetings.
Executive Directors
Th e remuneration packages for full time Executive Directors are structured to attract, motivate and retain Directors with the experience, capabilities 
and ambition required to achieve the Group’s strategic aims. 
Th e main elements of their remuneration packages are:
• Basic annual salary
• Annual cash bonus payments
• Pension contributions
• Share related incentives.
Th e salaries of Executive Directors are set by the Committee and reviewed annually, taking into account the performance of the Group, the individual 
and salary increases given to other Group employees.
Annual bonuses are paid to Executive Directors dependent upon Group profitability targets being achieved and individual objectives, as agreed with 
the Committee, being met. Bonus payments for the year to 29 June 2013 are disclosed in Note 7 to the Accounts.
Pension contributions for full time Executive Directors are set at up to 10% of basic annual salary excluding additional amounts arising from bonuses 
or salary sacrifice.
No Director has a service contract incorporating a notice period of more than 12 months.
Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors
Corporate Governance best practice is that Non-Executive Directors should not be rewarded with share options and so the Group’s share related incentive
plans are restricted to Executive Directors and senior managers of the Group. Non-Executive Directors receive a basic fee plus additional amounts relating
to time spent on committee meetings and in providing advice and support to Executive Directors and Senior Group Management. Th e remuneration of the
Chairman is determined by the Board and the remuneration of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive.
Annual Cash Bonus Schemes
Th e Remuneration Committee reviews and approves proposed annual cash bonus schemes within the Group. Th e main characteristics of these schemes 
are that payments to individuals depend on the profitability of the business unit relative to its budget and the achievement of relevant personal or departmental
performance conditions. Maximum payments under these schemes are set at levels that are meaningful, but not excessive, relative to individuals’ salaries.
Long-Term Incentive Scheme
Th e Company has a Long-Term Incentive Plan for Executive Directors. Th e Company announced on 16 July 2013 the cancellation of 1,149,000 unapproved
share options held and by Mr Duﬀy and the issue of 361,804 ordinary shares in exchange for this cancellation. Th e Group believes that the issuance of ordinary
shares and settlement of taxes in return for cancellation of the unapproved options is beneficial to the shareholders of the Company as it reduces dilution
and removes a potential share overhang.
Discussions were held during the year and are ongoing on the future structure of such incentive plans.

Our year at a glance
Chairman’s statement
In a year during which we actively broadened our trading strategy, 
we have made strong progress in growing our customer base 
and revenues in both our consumer and B2B businesses. 
As a result we reported revenue growth of over 4%* and saw 
an improvement in profitability which allowed us to grow the 
dividend by the 15% to which we committed. I am pleased to 
report, therefore, that for FY15 the Board has declared a final 
dividend of 9.2p that, in addition to our interim dividend of 
4.6p, gives a total pay-out for the year of 13.8p.
These are significant achievements that highlight the 
sustainable power of leveraging our network to deliver value 
for money products to consumers and businesses across 
the UK, while also creating value for shareholders. We are 
excited about the potential for the business to continue 
saving customers money and at the same time, growing 
against the background of a rapidly changing sector. It has 
been another year of significant change and challenge for 
our employees, and the Board and I would like to thank them 
for their efforts and for their continuing commitment to 
TalkTalk and to our customers.
* Statutory revenue after £5m exceptional VAT adjustment in FY14.
Sir Charles Dunstone
Chairman
We have delivered on our revenue growth 
guidance as planned, and have exited 
the year with our strongest ever quarterly 
revenue growth of 6%, and our lowest 
ever level of churn. British consumers 
and businesses increasingly appreciate 
TalkTalk’s value for money products, 
and we are focused on improving our 
customers’ experience still further and 
growing our already flourishing quad 
play business.“
– Dido Harding, CEO
Strategic report: Overview 02
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
Strategic report: Strategy
Our business model
Our network
Our business model is based on leveraging our extensive and cost-efficient next-generation network assets 
to offer consumers and businesses value for money products and services.
At the heart of our network is the state-of-the-art unbundling equipment 
(DSLAMs, MSANs and Ethernet switches) that we have installed in over 3,000 
BT exchanges – the largest such deployment in the UK. This allows us to take 
control of the copper line that connects customer premises to the exchange. 
The exchanges are connected via collector nodes and 10Gbps collector 
rings to our dark fibre core optical network – a high-speed, high-capacity 
all-IP national backbone that enables efficient and flexible routing of voice 
and data traffic. 
Access to the copper infrastructure that connects UK premises to BT’s 
nationwide exchange footprint is price regulated by Ofcom, while we lease 
the fibre backhaul (to connect exchanges to our core network) and dark fibre 
(that comprises our collector ring and core network) on long term contracts 
with very competitive terms from multiple providers. 
This combination of owned and leased assets confers a structural cost 
advantage that allows us to offer fixed line broadband and Ethernet 
connectivity at significantly lower retail prices than our competitors.
We have leveraged this cost advantage to build a sustainable broadband 
market share at the value end of the UK fixed line market and, since 2012, 
have further leveraged our network with fast-growing IPTV (for consumers) 
and Ethernet products (for businesses). The size and all-IP nature of our 
network also allows us to scale it very efficiently for growing usage. Over the 
next five years we plan to expand the bandwidth capacity on our network 
50–100 times at falling marginal operating costs. This will allow us to support 
growing customer demand for high speeds and greater data consumption, 
with longer term opportunities to build fibre to the premise (FTTP) and an 
inside-out mobile network using our in-home 4G spectrum and femtocells. 
Our network gives us a strong value for money advantage
We are able to offer our Consumer and Business customers services at 
significantly lower cost than our cable and incumbent competitors. This is 
because we operate the UK’s most extensive next-generation network (NGN), 
which is comprised of our own advanced, highly cost-effective equipment. 
It also means that TalkTalk is the only ISP that is committed to offering totally 
unlimited broadband across all its consumer packages.
Our NGN covers approximately 96% of UK homes, operating in over 3,000 
exchanges. These exchanges are connected via our own high-speed, 
high-capacity all-IP national network, enabling us to carry all of our customers’ 
voice and data traffic efficiently and cost effectively. Our customers benefit 
through optimised broadband speeds and quality, and access to our growing 
range of lower cost, value add products and services. For example, our all-IP 
Content Delivery Network, which runs over our NGN, puts content closer 
to the end user to increase the quality of experience for our TV customers.
Our network coverage
Over the past ten years, we have built one of the UK’s largest broadband and voice customer bases, attracting those looking for significant bill savings. 
FY15 saw us continue to grow significantly as we successfully delivered our quad-play strategy with strong growth in phone and broadband, TV and mobile. 
The breadth of our network coverage and product offer also enabled us to acquire phone and broadband bases from Virgin Media and Tesco, customers 
to whom we are now able to offer a far broader service than they were able to access previously.

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
Our customers
We are the UK’s leading value for money provider of fixed line broadband, voice telephony, television and mobile 
services. We serve four million residential and business customers under the TalkTalk and TalkTalk Business brands.
Services to consumers 
TalkTalk is strongly positioned as the leading value for money phone, broadband 
and TV provider for UK homes. We are differentiated by our clear and simple 
tariff structure, low prices, flexibility and our inclusion of valuable services, 
such as our ground-breaking HomeSafe™, our unique network-based security 
service, which is available free of charge for all customers on our network 
and protects the whole home from viruses and inappropriate content.
In 2012 we successfully launched our TV proposition, which included a free 
YouView set top box. TalkTalk is one of seven partners behind YouView including 
the BBC, ITV and BT. YouView is a broadband-based television service with 
differentiated catch-up and on-demand services and an open platform 
for future application-driven innovation. Our TV offering has enjoyed strong 
growth during FY15 as it represents a powerful proposition for mass market 
value seekers who want flexible access to premium content without the need 
to enter into costly long term subscriptions. In FY15 we acquired blinkbox, 
one of the UK’s leading providers of multi-device, multi-platform video 
content. This will enable us to accelerate the development of a number 
of key features for our TV products.
We also grew TalkTalk Mobile during FY15. Available exclusively to TalkTalk 
customers, TalkTalk Mobile offers simplicity, range and some of the most 
competitive prices in the market for both SIM-only and handsets. As a result, 
our mobile offering continues to gain strong traction amongst our base and, 
following the year end, we launched our All-In SIM that offers unlimited calls, 
texts and data for just £12 per month – the lowest price unlimited SIM in the UK. 
Services to businesses 
TalkTalk Business continues to drive innovation and competitive product 
development that leverages our NGN capability and is in fact one of the 
fastest growing B2B telecom businesses in the UK. We believe there is 
significant opportunity to use our network to grow all our Next Generation 
products within TalkTalk Business. 
In January 2013, we began offering an Ethernet over Fibre service that delivers 
high-speed symmetrical services at a significantly lower price point than 
traditional Ethernet technologies. We also launched an 80Mbps product with 
generous data allowances and network prioritisation targeted at small and 
medium-sized businesses. The year also saw us launch a very competitive 
Next Generation voice service for businesses requiring high performance data 
and voice services, which we have made widely available to channel partners. 
Market overview
Household internet access continued to rise in FY15, accompanied with an increase in the number of different types 
of internet-enabled devices. This is driving strong growth in people accessing the internet from mobile-enabled 
devices. Significant scope for growth remains, however, amongst specific demographic groups; nearly 20% of 
households remain offline, rising to nearly 50% of those aged 65–74 and two-thirds of those aged 75 and over. 
There are four key players in the UK broadband and TV market. BT Retail is 
the largest broadband service provider, followed by BSkyB. Virgin Media, the 
cable provider, is the third largest player followed by TalkTalk. TalkTalk is the 
largest unbundler.
Traditionally, BT Retail and Virgin Media are positioned at the premium end 
of the market, with significantly higher price points. They focus on speed and 
reliability of broadband connections. BSkyB’s focus is on content, cross-selling 
broadband and voice to its pay TV base, providing discounts to customers 
who take all three products with them. BT Retail also now competes with 
BSkyB on pay TV content rights, specifically sports, and has announced that 
it is to acquire EE, the UK’s largest mobile operator. 
Within this context, TalkTalk is clearly positioned as an asset light business, 
capable of delivering customers a value based package of voice, broadband, 
TV and mobile, without inherent conflict associated with defending historical 
asset investments or market share. We believe this reputation for value for 
money puts TalkTalk in a strong position that will only improve further as the 
UK market consolidates and converges.

UK telecoms regulation
The UK telecoms market is regulated by Ofcom, which sets the charges and other terms for wholesale access 
to infrastructure and associated services provided by BT Openreach (Openreach), where Openreach is deemed 
to enjoy ‘Significant Market Power’. Ofcom’s objective is to ensure that these wholesale products enable effective 
retail competition in the market, so that consumers and businesses benefit from a choice of services and retail 
service providers. TalkTalk’s compliance with regulation is monitored internally by the Regulatory Compliance 
Committee as detailed on page 18.

WLR:  Wholesale Line Rental
The areas regulated by Ofcom that are most material 
for TalkTalk are:
TalkTalk relies upon a number of wholesale products from Openreach to be 
able to offer services to its customers. The key wholesale products we buy are 
LLU (the copper connections into homes/businesses), GEA (access to BT’s 
Next Generation Access (NGA)/Fibre to the Cabinet (FTTC) network) and 
Ethernet (fibre links used to connect exchanges to our core network and also 
to connect some business customers). The price and terms of these are set 
by Ofcom though a triennial market review process which, particularly in the 
case of LLU, gives us reasonable certainty of costs going forward.
LLU Charge Control and service standards
In June 2014 Ofcom published its Fixed Access Market Review (FAMR), 
which included the new LLU Charge Control for the period to 31 March 2017. 
MPF charges will rise at CPI+0.3% up to March 2017. The FAMR also established 
new minimum standards on BT for provisioning and repair of copper access 
lines, as well as a new requirement for BT to report a range of key performance 
indicators. Ofcom is expected to begin consulting shortly on the next FAMR 
and LLU Charge Control which will be effective from April 2017.
Next Generation Access 
Openreach provides wholesale access to its NGA infrastructure (predominantly 
FTTC), on an equivalent basis to all communication providers. The current 
Openreach wholesale product is GEA. TalkTalk uses GEA to provide its fibre 
broadband products. Whilst the price of GEA is not regulated, TalkTalk had called 
for Ofcom to introduce margin squeeze regulation establishing the minimum 
margin between GEA and BT’s retail price. In March 2015 Ofcom confirmed 
that margin squeeze regulation would come into effect from April 2015, with 
the first compliance report published in June 2015. Ofcom’s next FAMR will 
consider regulation of GEA from April 2017.
Wholesale Must Offer for sports channels
Ofcom currently imposes a Wholesale Must Offer (WMO) obligation on Sky, 
requiring it to offer Sky Sports 1 and 2 on a wholesale basis to other retailers 
at regulated prices. Ofcom is reviewing whether the current WMO obligation 
is still appropriate in light of changes in the TV market, particularly BT’s entry 
into the premium sports market. Ofcom published a consultation on the issue 
in December 2014 and an additional consultation is expected later in 2015 
setting out Ofcom’s proposed approach and remedies. 
Ofcom strategic review of digital communications 
On 12 March 2015 Ofcom announced an overarching review of the UK’s digital 
communications markets. The review will examine competition, investment, 
innovation and the availability of products in the broadband, mobile and 
landline markets. Ofcom will publish a discussion document in summer 2015, 
with initial conclusions by the end of 2015. 
Several other areas of current or potential legislation 
are significant for TalkTalk:
Appeals framework
The new Government may consider whether to introduce changes to the 
framework of how Ofcom decisions can be appealed and, in particular, whether 
the current ‘merits-based’ standard should be changed. TalkTalk has supported 
reform of the appeals regime to enable more robust regulatory decisions.
European Commission Digital Single Market 
The EC is currently formulating a Digital Single Market strategy. On 25 March 2015 
the Commission set out areas for action. If implemented this could have 
a number of impacts on the mobile and fixed telecommunications market. 
The full strategy is expected in May 2015, with major changes unlikely to come 
into force before 2018.
Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act 
The Data Retention and Investigatory Powers Act (DRIPA) was introduced 
in July 2014 and governs the retention and sharing of communications data. 
DRIPA expires in 2016 and new legislation is expected to replace it. This is 
expected to maintain a clear legal framework for the system governing 
how ISPs store and share data. 
Illegal file sharing
TalkTalk, along with other major ISPs has voluntarily agreed to send educational 
notifications to customers whose accounts have been identified as being 
used for illegal Peer to Peer (P2P) filesharing. The first notifications are 
expected to be sent in 2016. At the moment, there are no plans to implement 
the Digital Economy Act, which could have imposed similar though more 
severe measures. Pursuant to various court orders, TalkTalk is required 
to block access to certain sites that are used for illegal file sharing.
Voluntary measures on parental controls
In June 2013, following a formal Government consultation into parental controls, 
the Prime Minister announced that the other three major ISPs would introduce 
whole home filtering systems – similar to TalkTalk’s HomeSafe™ service. He also 
announced that from December 2012 all providers had voluntarily agreed to 
ask every new customer if they want to use parental controls. This requirement 
was extended to include all existing customers by the end of December 2014. 
TalkTalk has delivered its commitment to the Government and along with the 
other major ISPs continues to support Internet Matters, a not-for-profit online 
child safety organisation. As a board member of the UK Council for Child 
Internet Safety, TalkTalk continues to engage actively with the Government 
about its policy for protecting children online. TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC

Strategic report: Strategy
Our strategy
Our corporate strategy revolves around six interlinking elements that combine leveraging our network to build 
scale in value for money products for consumers and businesses, systems and processes simplification, and 
disruptive innovation.
Our strategy revolves around six main principles
  Leveraging the TalkTalk Network
TalkTalk has the UK’s most extensive all-IP Next Generation Network (NGN), 
covering c.96% of all UK homes with advanced, proprietary equipment 
located in over 3,000 exchanges. By investing in next-generation switching 
and data transmission technology we have been able to further extend our 
network and cost advantage. The declining marginal cost of bandwidth allows 
substantial increases in capacity without compromising margins or capital 
expenditure limits. To accommodate expected future growth, we plan to 
expand network capacity by 50–100 times over the next five years and to 
increase resilience and flexibility whilst reducing network downtime. This 
investment will be within our long standing capex guideline of 6% of revenues.
  Value for money products
We have an established position as the UK’s leading value for money provider 
across phone and broadband (for consumers and businesses), TV and 
mobile products (for consumers). We also offer customers high-speed fibre 
to the cabinet through BT’s GEA product. In addition, our extensive Ethernet 
presence allows us to offer competitively priced data products to businesses 
across the UK. Our value for money positioning and growing product offer 
drives customer loyalty and sustainable revenue growth and positions us 
to take advantage of favourable usage and socio-demographic trends, with 
a growing number of older and smaller households in the UK, growing data 
usage and growing triple and quad-play penetration.
  Scale
Building on our large and established fixed line phone and broadband base, 
we are able to achieve significant scale benefits from offering our customers 
additional products such as pay TV, mobile, fibre and, for businesses, 
high-speed data connectivity.
 Simple systems and processes
To date, since the demerger, we have delivered over £100m of cost savings 
through integration and back-office simplification programmes. However, 
as a relatively young business that has grown very rapidly, we have a significant 
opportunity to further simplify our technology platform and customer 
processes. Our ‘Making TalkTalk Simpler’ programme comprises detailed 
initiatives to simplify tariffs and access methods, simplify and upgrade our 
systems, make better use of our data and drive increasing online self-service 
by customers. While lowering the costs of serving and acquiring customers, 
we also expect Making TalkTalk Simpler to lower customer churn by improving 
customer service and satisfaction.
  Disruptive innovation
We have a strong heritage of launching innovative and disruptive products 
that leverage our network scale and engineering expertise to save customers 
money. We were the first to offer free fixed line calls between customers, 
the first to launch free broadband, the first to offer unlimited downloads 
to broadband customers, the first to launch a free TV offer and the first to 
offer business broadband at under £5 per month. Our long term innovation 
agenda includes the potential to build the first 1Gbps FTTP network in the 
UK and an advanced fixed - mobile proposition incorporating femtocells 
and an in- home 4G network. 
 A brighter place for everyone
Our employees are key enablers in delivering our strategic priorities and we 
have implemented structures and policies that foster and develop a uniquely 
agile and collaborative culture.

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
Strategic report: Strategy
Chief Executive Officer’s statement
“TalkTalk is all about giving customers consistently the best value for money experience in the market.”
FY15 business review 
Summary
We delivered full year revenue growth of 4.2%*, in line with our 
guidance. Full year EBITDA of £245m grew by 15% (FY14: £213m) 
after increased SAC investment in growing broadband, mobile 
and fibre volumes, and absorbing the operating losses from 
our acquisition of blinkbox in Q4. Headline Earnings Per Share 
grew by over 20% and Dividend Per Share by 15%, in line with 
our commitment. 
Our strategic goal is to cement our position as the leading value 
for money, integrated fixed and mobile telecom and TV provider 
in the UK. In doing so, we will deliver our FY17 financial targets 
of 5% revenue CAGR (raised from 4%) and 25% EBITDA margin. 
Beyond FY17 we expect to continue to grow revenues by at least 
5% per annum, and deliver strong free cash flow growth. We will 
deliver these objectives by:
 ƥ Leveraging the scale of our network
 ƥ Scaling our integrated quad play products for consumers
 ƥ Doubling the market share of TalkTalk Business
 ƥ Making TalkTalk Simpler and transforming our 
customers’ experience
 ƥ Trialling and then rolling out an Ultrafast fibre network
 ƥ Building an Inside Out mobile network
We see significant long term opportunities to deliver growth 
and investor returns within this strategic framework, underpinned 
by an increasingly supportive regulatory background, changes 
in the structure of the UK market and growing demand from 
consumers and businesses for value for money quad play 
and data propositions.
We have made significant progress in each of these during FY15. 
* Statutory revenue after £5m exceptional VAT adjustment in FY14.
1. Leveraging the scale of our network
FY15 progress
The scale and breadth of our unbundled network has enabled us 
to increase network capacity at falling unit costs while holding capex 
at c.6% of revenues. These scale economics mean we are the only 
provider in the UK market to offer totally unlimited fixed line 
data products.
The economics of our network also enable us to grow the base of 
connected customers through acquisition. In November we announced 
the acquisition of Virgin Media’s off-net broadband base and migrated 
the bulk of this base onto our network through Q4, while at the same 
time offering these customers an expanded service (fibre and TV) 
and saving them money.
At the beginning of Q4 we announced the acquisition of Tesco’s phone, 
broadband and home phone bases, which will begin migration onto 
our network through the summer. These customers too will enjoy the 
opportunity to take an expanded set of services and save money on 
their total connectivity bills.
Outlook
We anticipate continued strong growth in bandwidth usage on our 
network as customers’ ownership of multiple devices grows and as 
they consume more video content, both from our own TV platform 
and from other OTT providers. We plan to scale the capacity on our 
network significantly over the next five years and to invest in resilience, 
all within our capex budget of 6% of revenue. This operating leverage 
sits at the core of the long term economics of our business.
2. Integrated quad play
FY15 progress
We delivered strong growth across all our products, driven by a 
compelling value for money pricing strategy and a re - balanced trading 
approach that contrasted with our strong focus on TV during FY14. 
The broader trading strategy also enabled us to invest additional 
SAC at lower costs per add than in FY14, driving broadband, fibre and 
mobile volumes during H2. As a result, we saw strong annual growth 
in revenue generating units (RGUs), with over 1m new RGUs added. 
We exited the year with 1.56 RGUs per customer, 16% higher than 
at the end of FY14. 
All our customer bases grew strongly during the year, with phone 
and broadband up 6%, TV up 54%, mobile up 63% and fibre up 131%. 
In addition to a rational pricing strategy with value for money at its 
heart, we continued to develop key propositions to allow our 
customers to save even more money.
TalkTalk is now firmly established as the No.3 pay TV platform in the 
UK, with 1.4m customers. We renewed our commitment to YouView 
during the year, ensuring another five years of access to the platform 
and its development pipeline. Customers who take TV generate 
significantly higher NPS and lower churn than dual play phone and 
broadband customers. Consequently triple play customers are 
significantly more valuable. We continued to develop our content 
offer on YouView during the year and built upon our existing 
wholesale relationship with Sky. 
We reached a new multi-year agreement to broaden and extend 
the distribution of Sky’s premium movies and sport content to 
our TV customers. In addition to the linear channels, this includes 
the right to offer customers catch up content for both Sky Movies 
and Sky Sports, access to Sky Sports 5 (Champions League and 
European football) and Sky Sports Box Office on a pay-per-view 
basis. This built on our existing relationship to offer Sky entertainment 
content and access to live sports on NOW TV on a day-pass basis. 
We launched Netflix to TalkTalk customers in January. The agreement 
with Netflix allows us to share in the revenues generated, further 
demonstrating the appeal of the TalkTalk platform to a growing 
number of content providers.  07
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
We also added 16 further new channels during the year, including 
Premier Sports, two Brazilian and eight African channels, and a 
number of unique TV boosts not available on any other UK Pay-TV 
platform, including TV Box (Universal Studios), and Collections from 
ITV (a boxset proposition offering a great range of comedy, drama 
and entertainment classics).
As a result of these developments in our content proposition, we saw 
material increases in the take-up of pay content boosts and TVOD 
volumes. Customers watching and purchasing Sky boosts grew 
particularly strongly during the year, with Sky Sports take-up growing 
46% year on year driven by the success of Sky Sports F1 and the 
introduction of Sky Sports 5; and Sky Movies Boost take-up growing 
49% year on year driven by the success of Sky Movies on Demand.
Overall content revenues showed strong progress with growth of over 
45% year on year.
In January we announced the acquisition of blinkbox from Tesco. 
blinkbox is one of the leading on-demand providers of pay content 
in the UK and works across multiple platforms and devices – both inside 
and outside the home. blinkbox’s established technical expertise 
in multi-platform, multi-device content delivery and incremental 
content relationships are highly complementary to our strategy 
of being the best value for money TV provider in the UK.
In mobile, we reached agreement with Telefonica for O2 to be our new 
MVNO partner and launched the first integrated quad play bundle 
in the UK in November, which allows Plus customers to take a mobile 
SIM as part of their package. As a result we grew our share of the SIM 
only market to 13% in March from 4.2% a year ago – a larger share 
of the market than either Tesco Mobile or Vodafone. Following the 
end of the year we launched our market-beating All-In SIM offering 
unlimited data, texts and minutes for just £12 a month, representing 
a saving of £270 in comparison to mobile operator Three’s equivalent 
package over 18 months. All our mobile products are available 
exclusively to TalkTalk broadband customers and therefore drive 
significantly improved NPS and churn.
Our fibre proposition saw the strongest growth of all products during 
the year, albeit from a modest base in FY14, driven by increasing 
requirements for higher bandwidth and an easier, self-install proposition. 
Outlook
The UK fixed line space remains an attractive and rational market 
in which we see multiple opportunities to continue scaling our value 
for money quad play propositions. For us, quad play is an offensive 
strategy. Our customers save money by taking additional products, 
driving increased penetration of TV, fibre and mobile. The next two 
years will see us continuing to scale our TV, mobile and fibre businesses 
within the framework of our existing wholesale relationships. 
37% of our fully unbundled customers currently take TV and we 
expect the continuing development of the platform will drive the vast 
majority of our customers to take TV over time. With the integration 
of blinkbox now substantially complete, we expect to accelerate the 
development of our TV to Go App, expand our range of pay per view 
content, drive greater engagement, higher content ARPU and lower 
churn. The first example of the benefits blinkbox will bring to TalkTalk 
is our recent agreement with HBO to make available Game of Thrones 
(seasons 1–4), one of the world’s most famous TV shows, to buy and 
own digitally from early June. Customers will also be able to stream 
their purchased episodes on TalkTalk’s TV2Go companion App.
In mobile, moving from our current thin MVNO with Vodafone to O2 
will initially deliver improved reseller economics that reflect the scale 
and growth of our mobile base. The access to 4G that we will have 
under the new MVNO will allow us to expand our range of mobile 
products and build on our competitive market position. Over the 
course of the next two years we will also be able to take full advantage 
of the unbundled economics (similar to fixed line LLU) that our 
agreement with O2 offers, by building our own core mobile network 
systems and taking full control of SIM sourcing, pricing and proposition. 
As a result, we see headroom to significantly grow penetration 
of mobile within our base from the current 12%.
We expect demand for high speed superfast broadband to continue 
to grow as the number of connected devices in our customers’ homes 
grows and more customers find their copper speeds insufficient and 
as a result are willing to pay for faster connections. We do not however, 
expect particularly strong growth unless or until the wholesale price 
of fibre to the cabinet comes down and we are able to pass on these 
cost savings to our customers. Whilst Ofcom’s margin squeeze test 
protects us from potential abuse from BT’s vertically integrated 
business model, and should drive prices down in the long term, 
we do not expect this imminently. 08

3. Scaling TalkTalk business
FY15 progress
TalkTalk Business (‘TTB’) has delivered another year of strong 
revenue performance with 40% growth in Data and 41% in Carrier 
more than offsetting the continuing decline in legacy voice (-13%). 
We connected 9,000 new Ethernet and EFM circuits in the year, 
taking our total base to over 26,000, a year on year increase of 
over 50%.
In addition we launched our first ever above-the-line marketing 
campaign for Business Broadband aimed at the SoHo and SME 
markets, highlighting our compelling price proposition versus BT 
(£10.50 per month for unlimited data and calls, including unlimited 
to mobile numbers, compared to £27 per month for the equivalent 
product from BT). We also launched a free voice app called Talk2Go 
which allows customers to use existing fixed line minutes on their 
mobile free of charge as well as free app to app calls, delivering 
even further value to our Business Broadband proposition. 
We have seen a strong response which underpins our confidence 
in the substantial opportunity for TTB to grow share in the 
Business Broadband market.
Outlook
Scaling TalkTalk Business is a key component of our longer term 
growth plan. The UK B2B market remains much more fragmented 
than the consumer market for telecoms services. TTB’s share in 
its key SME and data markets, whilst having grown strongly in the 
last two years, remains far below our c.18% share of the consumer 
market. We see an opportunity to double TTB’s market share over 
time, driven by continuing strong growth in its suite of Data products, 
further growth in the SME phone and broadband market, and 
deepening relationships in the partner channel for the provision 
of wholesale services.
The acquisition of tIPicall in April 2015, which will allow us to give 
increased value to our data customers through a converged voice 
offer, illustrates the potential TTB has to leverage its existing 
infrastructure in data products through complimentary investments. 
4. Making TalkTalk simpler and transforming 
the customer experience
We launched our Making TalkTalk Simpler (MTTS) programme in FY13. 
At the time we expected the combined initiatives under this programme 
to drive incremental savings of £30m to £50m over three–five years, 
by making TalkTalk simpler to operate, improving our customers’ 
experience and reducing our costs, through driving process and 
efficiency improvements. MTTS is driving transformational change 
in the way we operate and will deliver significant ongoing customer 
experience and financial benefits. 
FY15 progress
We made considerable progress in simplifying our tariffs during FY15, 
including the disposal of our off-net broadband base, rebranding AOL 
customers and eliminating over two-thirds of legacy tariffs in TTB. 
This has allowed us to begin simplifying the supporting infrastructure 
and operational systems including the decommissioning of third 
party systems and support. We introduced billing system upgrades 
and new fault diagnostic tools in Consumer and implemented a new 
CRM system in TTB.
We continued to expand our self-service provision during the year. 
Nearly 475,000 customers have downloaded our service centre App 
since launch, allowing them to view their package details and bills on 
the go, check their mobile allowance and diagnose faults remotely. 
Over 35% of our customers self-served during Q4 allowing them the 
convenience of managing their account online at a time and place 
that suits them. Our new online welcome centre, which helps new 
customers through the process of joining TalkTalk, has reduced early 
life calls and improved customer satisfaction.
MTTS delivered material improvements for customers evidenced 
by a reduction in churn and fall in complaints to Ofcom. However, 
call volumes fell by less than we had planned as we reprioritised 
some of our teams to focus on integration activities. We also 
redesigned a number of programmes such as our Consumer CRM 
system for which we changed suppliers in H2. As a result cost savings 
of £17m in the year were some £15m lower than we had planned. 
Outlook
While we are pleased with the progress we have made in improving 
customers’ experience and the resulting reduction in churn, there 
is much more to do to drive a step change in our customers’ 
experience and our brand reputation, and therefore to deliver 
materially higher savings. 
This will be our key priority over the next two years and requires 
ongoing systems transformation that will deliver material financial 
benefits in the form of significantly lower call volumes, lower leakage 
between sales and connection, lower bad debt from right first time 
bills and easier payment processes, lower operating costs from fewer 
engineer visits and router replacements, and lower retention and 
churn costs from happier customers. 
As a result we expect to deliver operating cost savings greater than 
the £30–50m we were originally targeting. Having delivered £15m 
and £17m of savings in FY14 and FY15 respectively we now expect 
an incremental £40m+ over the next two years with cumulative 
savings by FY17 now expected to be in excess of £70m.

5. Ultrafast fibre
The scale of our broadband base and the breadth of our network 
infrastructure (over 3,000 unbundled exchanges) underpin our 
ambition in fibre, which we are testing through our joint venture with 
Sky and CityFibre in York. Build costs of under £500 per premise 
passed and speed of take-up from our combined market share of 
30%–40% are the key variables that will determine the opportunity 
for a scale national roll-out of fibre to the premise. 
FY15 progress
We have made good progress on the groundworks for our York Fibre 
to the Premise (‘FTTP’) trial, with 1,200 homes passed in the first 
dig area, and are on track to launch our proposition soon and begin 
connecting customers in the autumn.
Early indications of build costs are proving to be in line with our target 
of under £500 per home passed. 
Outlook
Based on our experience to date, we remain confident about the 
potential to roll out FTTP in scale. At a build cost of under £500 per 
premise passed and 30%–40% take-up, we believe it will be possible 
to build a c.10 million household network across the UK. We see 
ultrafast as an opportunity to build a mass market, value for money 
proposition that delivers value for consumers and shareholders 
through keen pricing and rapid scaling.
Our preliminary discussions on financing such a scale roll out have 
been positive, underscoring our confidence in the opportunity for 
building an economically viable, alternative and superior fibre 
infrastructure to that available today.
6. Inside out mobile
FY15 progress
In Q3 we reached agreement with Telefonica UK to provide full MVNO 
services (including 4G) and we have begun the process of building 
a core network that will integrate with O2’s network. 
Outlook
Through the course of 2015 we shall transition customers onto the 
O2 network. This will allow us to offer 4G services, fully integrated 
quad play and deliver much improved economics compared to our 
current arrangement with Vodafone, under which we offer mobile 
primarily as an add-on. Over the course of the next two years, our 
economics will improve further as we integrate our core network 
with that of O2, and thereby also building our own mobile asset. 
We shall also begin deploying femtocells (through a router upgrade 
programme) which will allow us to offload mobile traffic onto our 
fixed line network via our in-home 4G network (delivering a superior 
in-home voice experience). This capacity to offload mobile traffic 
onto our fixed network will not only deliver significantly reduced 
costs, for both voice and data usage but also give customers 
much improved in home mobile reception.
The construction of ultrafast fibre and an inside out mobile network 
will enable us to offer a completely seamless, value for money 
consumer quad play and high speed business data service which 
will drive growth for the foreseeable future.
Guidance 
FY16
Revenue and EBITDA
We expect FY16 revenues to grow by at least 5%, driven by continuing 
growth in customer numbers and ARPU, and growth in TalkTalk 
Business revenues. We expect strong growth in EBITDA and free cash 
flow as we make progress towards our FY17 target, whilst reinvesting 
cost savings from Making TalkTalk Simpler (‘MTTS’).
Net debt
Capex to maintain and expand the network is expected to be within 
our guideline of 6%–6.5% of revenue. In addition we expect to spend 
an additional 1%–2% of revenues on capex to support our inside out 
mobile and fibre innovation projects. 
Cash exceptional items related to MTTS, the integration of acquisitions 
and mobile migration activity are expected to be c.£40m–£45m.
Dividend
We plan to grow the FY15 dividend by 15%.
FY15 – FY17
In November 2013, we raised our FY14-FY17 revenue CAGR target 
from 2% to 4% and set our medium term EBITDA margin target of 
25% to be achieved by FY17. With revenue momentum accelerating 
through FY15, we are now targeting CAGR in revenue of at least 5% 
over the next two years and remain on track to achieve our FY17 
EBITDA margin target of 25% in FY17.

Overview
We entered the year with a plan to grow revenue by 4% and TV net 
additions by a similar level to FY14. As the year progressed we broadened 
our trading strategy to align with market demand, investing further 
in fibre and mobile customer growth in H2. This supported ARPU 
acceleration during the year, driving Q4 to our ninth successive 
quarter of revenue growth at 6.0% and full-year revenue growth 
of 4.2%*, in line with our guidance.
In the second half of the year we leveraged our network through 
the acquisition of broadband bases from Virgin Media and Tesco. 
We also expanded our TV capability by acquiring blinkbox, one of 
the leading on-demand providers of pay content in the UK. These 
transactions will contribute to revenue growth in FY16 and beyond.
Gross profit increased by 2.3% supported by customer growth 
and the impact of price changes. This was partly offset by a change 
in mix from the continued reduction in consumer voice revenues 
and growth in fibre, TV content and the increased scale of our B2B 
wholesale business.
We continued to focus on Making TalkTalk Simpler (MTTS), including 
reducing the complexity which arose through past acquisitions and 
overall have delivered£17m of recurring benefits. This was partly 
offset by increased investment in the network, costs to serve and 
innovation. In H2 we agreed the sale of our off-net broadband base 
to Fleur Telecom, part of the Daisy Group, which will further simplify 
our tariffs and enable future systems savings.
SAC and marketing costs reduced by 2.8% year on year reflecting 
efficiencies in TV and broadband costs per add from lower unit costs 
and self-install and the decision to lower TV volumes. As announced 
at the interim results we increased our investment in driving higher 
customer volumes in the second half. 
Overall EBITDA margin increased to 14.6% in H2 from 12.6% in H1, 
giving an average for the year of 13.6% (FY14: 12.3%). 
EPS increased 21% to 8.2p (FY14: 6.8p) and the proposed dividend 
for the full year FY15 of 13.8p (FY14: 12.0p) represents growth of 15% 
in line with our commitment.
Operating cash flow improved from £76m in FY14 to £114m in FY15. 
Net debt increased to £589m primarily as a result of the investment 
in growth and acquisition activity during the year.
* Statutory revenue after £5m exceptional VAT adjustment in FY14.

Annual Report 2015
Revenue
Revenue grew 4.2%* to £1,795m (FY14: £1,722m*) with Q4 delivering 
a ninth successive quarter of revenue growth at 6.0%.
Over the last twelve months we have focused on diversifying our 
revenue and building scalable quad play, including introducing a free 
mobile SIM as part of the Plus TV bundle, and have increased RGUs 
by 16%. We have also implemented price changes, the impact of 
which has been partly offset by continued lower voice usage, mix 
and promotional investment. As a result, on-net revenue increased 
by 6.3%* to £1,333m (FY14: £1,254m*). 
Corporate revenues delivered another strong year of growth, 
increasing 10% to £375m (FY14: £340m). Data revenues grew 40% 
year on year. This has been driven by the continued growth in our 
EFM and Ethernet products with 9k net additions in FY15. Carrier 
revenue grew 41%, including higher usage of 118 numbers. Together, 
this growth more than offset the continued decline in legacy voice 
revenues driven by a move from premium rate numbers and the 
decrease in regulated call termination rates.
Off-net revenues continued to decline this year as expected, 
reducing by 32% to £87m (FY14: £128m) as a result of the continued 
decline in our voice-only and off-net broadband bases. 
* Statutory revenue after £5m exceptional VAT adjustment in FY14.
Gross profit
Gross profit increased by 2.3% to £980m (FY14: £958m) supported 
by customer growth and the impact of price changes. This was partly 
offset by a change in mix from the continued reduction in voice 
revenues, growth in fibre and TV content and increased scale 
of our B2B wholesale business.
Operating expenses
Our focus remains on MTTS and driving improved customer experience 
from our core network. We accelerated MTTS during the second half 
with a dedicated leadership resource for the project and investment 
in IT and system changes. As part of this we changed suppliers of our 
Consumer CRM system in H2. Overall we delivered£17m of benefits 
from MTTS in FY15 driving greater efficiency through our systems 
and supply chain including procurement savings and supplier rebates. 
These have been partly offset by costs from scaling the business 
including customer service, network capacity and resilience. We also 
invested in our innovation projects (ultrafast in York and mobile), and 
incurred incremental TV operating costs from the blinkbox acquisition. 
As a result total operating costs were £1m lower at £426m (FY14: £427m).
SAC and Marketing
We reduced the cost of acquiring broadband and TV customers 
through the year by increasing the proportion of customers who 
self-install their broadband and fibre (in March), and improving the 
channel mix to lower cost online channels. Churn also decreased 
from an average of 1.6% in FY14 to 1.4% in FY15 supported by 
improved customer service and the increased penetration of TV, 
mobile and fibre in the base. These efficiency savings were partly 
reinvested in driving higher mobile and fibre growth as part of our 
broader trading strategy with total SAC and marketing £9m lower 
to £309m (FY14: £318m).
EBITDA
EBITDA increased 15% to £245m (FY14: £213m) reflecting an EBITDA 
margin of 13.6% (FY14: 12.3%) driven by revenue growth and operating 
cost and SAC efficiencies.
Depreciation and amortisation
Depreciation and amortisation charges increased to £120m (FY14: £112m) 
as a result of continued capital investment in the network and IT systems.
Finance costs
Net finance costs of £22m (FY14: £20m) comprised the blended 
interest rate on debt of 3.00% (FY14: 3.39%), which benefited from 
new refinancing terms (see below) and the amortisation charges in 
relation to both the new and old facility fees of £3m (FY14: £3m).
Net interest paid in the year increased to £19m (FY14: £17m), 
principally driven by higher interest payments as a result of higher 
average net debt. 
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles 
and exceptional items
The amortisation and depreciation charge of £17m (FY14: £21m) 
includes £6m related to the amortisation of acquisition intangibles 
(FY14: £21m). The balance of £11m (FY14: nil) relates to the accelerated 
depreciation of legacy systems as we progress with MTTS and the 
planned migration of mobile customers.
The net exceptional charge in the year increased to £46m (FY14: £22m) 
of which £30m was cash (FY14: £23m):
 ƥ Making TalkTalk Simpler efficiency programme: £29m (FY14: £22m). 
 ƥ Migration, reorganisation and integration costs from the Virgin Media 
and Tesco customer base and blinkbox acquisitions: £14m (FY14: nil)
 ƥ Costs relating to the planned migration of mobile customers to the 
new 4G MVNO agreed with Telefonica in November: £8m (FY14: nil)
 ƥ The sale of our off-net broadband base to Fleur Telecom, part 
of the Daisy Group for a £5m (FY14: nil) benefit. 
 ƥ A net revenue impact of £nil (FY14: -£5m) from the treatment 
of prompt payment discounts and the settlement of certain 
discussions regarding historic termination charges with Mobile 
Network operators
The treatment of credits and charges as exceptional items involve 
judgements made by management as set out in note 1 to the 
financial statements. 
Profit before tax
Profit before tax increased £1m year on year to £32m (FY14: £31m), 
reflecting the increase in EBITDA and lower amortisation charges, 
offset by net exceptional charges.

Taxation
Our effective Headline tax rate for the year was 20% (FY14: 18%), 
representing a tax charge of £19m (FY14: £13m), broadly in line with 
the statutory rate of 21%.
The Group recognised tax credits of £40m (FY14: nil) including two 
exceptional tax credits comprising £29m in respect of VNL tax losses 
as the now well established TV business enables us to recognise losses 
over a longer time period and £16m for the resolution of legacy items.

Working capital
Working capital outflow of £19m (FY14: £30m) reflects the combined 
effect of the Group’s trading profile during the year and the ongoing 
reductions in the cost base.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure was once again focused on meeting the forecast 
demands for our network and on driving efficiency through MTTS. 
In FY15 we spent 6.2% of revenues on capex, in line with our long term 
trend of 6%. In FY16 we once again expect network related capex 
of c.6% of revenues but in addition expect to incur one-off capex 
of 1.0%–2.0% of revenues on our innovation projects (fibre to the 
premise and mobile).
Acquisitions
Acquisition expenditure in the year of £38m (FY14: £8m) represents 
£6m in respect of the YouView joint venture (FY14: £5m), £3m in respect 
of the York FTTP joint venture (FY14: £nil) and £29m in respect of the 
initial consideration for the Virgin Media off-net broadband base and 
the Tesco broadband base and blinkbox. 
Dividends
Our dividend policy is to return to shareholders 50% of basic Headline 
earnings per share in the form of ordinary dividends. With Headline 
results impacted by our investment in growth, we committed to 
dividend growth at a minimum of 15% for FY15.
Dividends of £116m paid in the year (FY14: £99m) comprised the final 
dividend for FY14 8.0p and the interim dividend for FY15 of 4.6p. 
The Board has declared a final dividend of 9.2p which will be paid 
on 3 August 2015, subject to approval at the AGM on 22 July 2015 for 
shareholders on the register on 10 July 2015 (ex-dividend 9 July 2015). 
The total declared dividend for the year was 13.8p, a year on year 
increase of 15%, with dividend cover improving to 0.59x (FY14: 0.57x). 
Funding, net debt and capital structure
Operations are financed with committed bank facilities, retained profits 
and equity. During the year we re-financed our banking facilities and 
were able to both extend the term and diversify our sources of finance 
by successfully accessing the US Private Placement market. We also 
renewed our revolving credit facility and term loans, enabling us to 
reduce our cost of funding.  14

Annual Report 2015
Strategic report: Performance
Chief Financial Officer’s statement continued
Funding 
At 31 March 2015, the Group’s sources of finance were:
 ƥ $185m US Private Placement Notes (USPP): in July 2014 The Group 
issued $185m of USPP notes maturing in three tranches. The USPP 
proceeds were swapped to £109m and the net debt includes 
retranslation of the USPP funds at the rates achieved where 
hedged by cross currency swaps.
 ƥ £560m revolving credit facility (RCF) and £50m bilateral 
agreement: the Group has a £560m RCF, which matures in July 2019. 
In addition to the RCF, the Group also has a £50m bilateral agreement 
which matures in July 2019. 
 ƥ £100m term loan: the Group has a committed term loan of 
£100m (2014: £75m), with a final maturity date of July 2019, 
this loan amortises during the term with repayments of £25m 
in January 2017 and £25m in January 2018. 
At 31 March 2015, the Group’s facilities total £819m. The Group was in 
compliance with its covenants throughout the current and prior year. 
At 31 March 2015 £599m (FY14: £490m) had been drawn down under 
these facilities with £220m of undrawn facilities.
Net debt and capital structure
Net debt in the year increased by £92m (FY14: increase of £104m) 
to £589m (FY14: £497m) driven by investment in growth and the 
acquisitions of blinkbox, Tesco phone and broadband Virgin Media 
broadband bases. As a result the net debt to EBITDA ratio increased 
modestly from 2.3x in FY14 to 2.4x in FY15. The Board regularly reviews 
the capital structure of the Group and we expect to return to below 
two times net debt to EBITDA in the medium term.
Accounting developments
The adoption of accounting standards in the year, as disclosed 
in note 1 to the financial statements, has had no material effect 
on the financial statements.
Going concern
The Directors have acknowledged the guidance ‘Going Concern 
and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009’, 
published by the FRC in October 2009.
Our business activities, together with the factors likely to affect our 
future development, performance and position are set out in the 
Business Review. Our financial position, cash and borrowing facilities 
are described within this Chief Financial Officer’s statement. 
The breadth of our base, our value for money proposition, continuing 
improvements in operating efficiency and the largest unbundled 
network in the UK means that the Directors are confident in our 
ability to continue to compete effectively in the UK telecoms sector.
We have £819m of committed credit facilities and as at 31 March 2015 
the headroom on these facilities was £220m. Our forecasts and 
projections, taking into account reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, indicate that there is sufficient cash and covenant 
headroom on our facilities and that this, together with our market 
positioning, means that we are well placed to manage our business 
risks successfully and have adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future. The Directors have 
therefore adopted the going concern basis of accounting preparing 
the financial statements. 15

Strategic report: Performance
We have an ambitious approach to engaging with our colleagues and continue to foster and develop our unique 
culture, founded on our mission to ‘make Britain better off’ through our values, the ‘Brighter Basics’.
Colleague engagement 
In 2015, we have seen an increase in our engagement levels for the 
fourth year in a row, a key contributor to our business success. 
Our annual engagement survey helps us to uncover how our people 
are feeling about working for TalkTalk, whether they are proud to work 
here and feel able to recommend us as a place to work. Last year, the 
feedback informed our Great Place to Work strategic priority and saw 
us commit to delivering improvements across four key areas: working 
environment, career development, our systems and processes and 
reward and recognition. Key deliverables have included: 
 ƥ working environment refreshes at a number of sites and the 
introduction of more collaborative working areas;
 ƥ a Careers Festival to help our people develop their skills at TalkTalk 
and explore new opportunities;
 ƥ the launch of Workday, our new HR information system, providing 
our colleagues with a consumer grade ‘one-stop shop’ where they 
can manage their lives at TalkTalk, and our People Managers with 
real-time people data that empowers them to make better 
management decisions; and
 ƥ launch of the TalkTalk Share Match Plan – TalkTalk’s first Share 
Incentive Plan (SIP).
In our 2015 survey, we have once again driven an increase in colleague 
engagement, from 73% up to 76%. We have now seen a 20 percentage 
point increase in engagement since our first survey in 2011 (56%) and 
remain committed to continuing this journey. Levels of participation 
also remain very high, with 92% of our people taking part.
Leadership development
The quality of our management is vital to our future success and we 
have continued to develop our leaders through our ongoing programme 
‘Leading a Brighter Business’. This year we evaluated the success of 
the programme so far and, of the 550+ employees who have completed 
all four parts of the modular programme, 86% report having made 
positive changes as a result of what they have learnt and 68% report 
having seen changes in our leaders. 
Colleague performance and development
In addition to our Careers Festival, we have continued to invest in 
our colleague development tools. In particular, this year we have 
made navigation improvements to TalkTalkU, our online learning hub. 
We also continue to offer our people mentoring and coaching sessions 
to support their development. Our annual performance management 
process provides a mechanism to drive achievement, with all colleagues 
participating in a performance related variable bonus pay scheme. 
Colleague benefits and share ownership
We continue to offer a comprehensive range of voluntary benefits, 
so colleagues can make choices to suit their lifestyle. We evaluate 
these on an annual basis to provide the best possible suite of options.
Share ownership remains an important part of our culture and a key 
indicator of employee engagement. Over 65% of our people currently 
participate in our Sharesave and Share Match Schemes, and this year 
we were very proud to win the ifs ProShare Annual Award for ‘Best 
overall performance in fostering employee share ownership for 
companies with 1,001 to 15,000 employees’, which recognises innovation 
and strength of communication in the design of company share 
programmes in the UK.
Having so many of our people as shareholders creates great 
engagement and alignment with the interests of our investors. 
We believe in our colleagues being advocates for our products and 
continue to offer free home phone, broadband, fibre and TV to all 
colleagues, as well as half-price mobile packages. 
Colleague consultation – One Voice forum 
One Voice is a consultation and information forum consisting 
of 80 nominated colleague representatives, management and 
members of our People Services team. The forum meets regularly 
to discuss how the key issues we face as a business might affect 
our colleagues, to share colleague feedback and to discuss other 
relevant colleague matters.  16

Colleague communications and events
In May 2014 we launched a new intranet site, The Wire, which has 
become a critical communication and collaboration tool for the 
business. The tool supports blogging at all levels of the organisation, 
so colleagues can continue to enjoy Dido Harding’s weekly blog, 
as well as regularly hear from members of the senior management 
group and their colleagues.
The tool also supports news sharing, social updates from our people 
and document sharing, so it plays a key role in helping us to work more 
easily with one another across the Company. All of our colleagues 
in the UK have access to The Wire and this summer we are taking 
cross-company collaboration even further when we bring 5,000+ 
of our partners onto the platform as well.
For the last three years we have brought all of our UK-based colleagues 
and partners together for a one-day conference, All Hands, where 
we communicate our strategic priorities for the year ahead. This took 
place in April 2015 in Manchester for all UK-based colleagues and 
partners, followed by a tour in which our Executive committee will 
share the same content with our partners overseas. We also host an 
annual off-site festival called the Great Getaway, where colleagues 
and their families come together for a day out filled with fun activities 
and musical acts.
Colleague recognition
Celebrating colleagues who champion our culture is very important 
to us and we continue to recognise the individuals who are actively 
living our Brighter Basics through our On The Spot award scheme. 
Once a year at our All Hands event we also recognise the ‘Superheroes’ 
amongst our colleagues and partners who have made an outstanding 
contribution to the business over the past year. Last year, our 
14 Superheroes were rewarded with a trip to London where 
highlights included a dinner with Dido Harding at the Gherkin.
Gender and diversity
Our people come from different backgrounds and cultures, creating 
a vibrant working environment that thrives on new ideas and fresh 
thinking. The importance of diversity, equality and non-discrimination 
is highlighted in our Equality Policy and underpinned by our People 
Brighter Basic – ‘We can be ourselves here’, which guides the respectful 
way we behave towards each other. Through our engagement survey 
we know that over 80% of our people agree they can be themselves 
at work – a value we hold dearly and one we believe gives us a 
competitive advantage. A breakdown by gender of the number 
of persons who were Directors of the Company, senior managers 
and other colleagues as at 31 March 2015 is set out below.

Principal risks and uncertainties
In common with other organisations, we are affected by a number of risks, not all of which are in our control. 
Some risks, such as UK macroeconomic factors, are likely to affect the performance of UK businesses generally, 
while others are particular to our operations. This section sets out the material risks to the Group and how we seek 
to mitigate them in the day to day running of our business. 
1.  Regulatory 
environment
Potential impact: Changes in BT’s regulated 
wholesale prices for copper and fibre products 
can significantly impact the Group’s performance. 
Mergers can change the competitive 
landscape of markets we buy in or sell into.
Mitigation: We have continued to actively participate in 
Ofcom’s consultations impacting on wholesale prices, 
especially this year the debate around applying a margin 
test to fibre products. In particular, we have provided 
Ofcom with evidence, argument and expert opinion to 
support the case that competition, consumers’ interests 
and the development of a mass market for super-fast 
broadband will be best served by reductions in wholesale 
prices or, in the case of fibre, a wider margin between 
wholesale and retail prices. Ofcom commencing its 
Strategic Review of the telecoms industry is a positive 
step, with TalkTalk fully engaged in the consultation process. 
We have also engaged with the Competition and Markets 
Authority (‘CMA’) on regulatory assessment of the 
proposed merger between BT and EE.
2.  Customer 
experience
Potential impact: Failure to deliver a seamless 
and positive end to end experience of 
TalkTalk’s products and services or to deal 
with customers’ queries and complaints 
effectively could damage our brand and 
lead to increased churn.
Mitigation: We are committed to continuously reviewing 
and improving the level and quality of customer service we 
provide. This financial year, we have continued to develop 
and deliver a number of major initiatives under Making 
TalkTalk Simpler to i) reduce the likelihood of customers 
experiencing service issues; ii) improve the ability of our 
customers to self-help online; and iii) deliver better 
training and tools to our Customer Service teams so that 
queries and complaints can be handled more effectively. 
3.  T echnology 
innovation and 
change management
Potential impact: In order to deliver high value 
and market-disruptive products and services, 
at competitive prices, we need to continuously 
innovate, whilst sustaining our focus on simplifying 
our systems and processes. In FY16 and beyond 
we will be delivering a number of major 
product innovation initiatives alongside a 
significant IT change agenda. Failure to 
manage this level of innovation and change 
successfully could have an adverse impact on 
the services we provide to our customers 
and on our financial performance.
Mitigation: A new Group Change Director reporting 
directly to the CEO has been appointed. The Group 
Change Director has established a new central Project 
Management Office (PMO), responsible for overseeing 
the governance of change across the organisation. The 
Executive Committee regularly monitors the progress 
of significant change programmes and associated risks 
through the Group PMO. 
4.  Data and cyber 
security
Potential impact: Failure to prevent the loss 
or exploitation of personally identifiable or 
commercially sensitive information could 
result in loss of competitive advantage, 
regulatory fines, damage to the brand, 
and ultimately, churn. 
Mitigation: The Group continually reviews and seeks best 
practice external guidance on its data and cyber security 
capability and invests in and implements new solutions, 
both to prevent and detect incidents. TalkTalk continues 
to adopt the Ten Steps to Cyber Security as a control 
framework for mitigating key areas of risk. Progress is 
monitored via the in house Data Council, which convenes 
monthly and is chaired by the Chief Technology Officer 
(CTO). In FY15, key initiatives including the encryption of 
hardware and removable media, a data loss prevention 
solution, vulnerability scanning and penetration testing 
have been completed. A new Head of Security has also 
been appointed to establish and oversee the new 
Security Operations Centre, the activities of which have 
been outsourced to cyber security experts BAe systems.
Strategic report: Performance 18
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
Strategic report: Performance
5.  Infrastructure 
stability and 
resilience 
Potential impact: Failure to maintain 
sufficient and acceptable levels of network 
and system performance for the Group’s 
Consumer and Business customers could 
lead to complaints and, ultimately, churn.
Mitigation: There has been significant focus during the 
year on ensuring optimum levels of capacity are delivered 
and maintained to avoid network congestion for customers. 
In FY16 we will continue to invest in our infrastructure and 
deliver a number of IT change programmes which will 
improve stability and resilience. 
6.  Regulatory 
compliance
Potential impact: Failure to operate effective 
processes and controls across the Group 
may have an adverse impact on the services 
we deliver to our customers, leading to churn 
and non-compliance with regulatory 
requirements. The fines that Ofcom can 
impose on the Group and the associated 
negative publicity could adversely impact  
our brand, reputation and profitability.
Mitigation: There has been continued focus this year 
on improving processes and controls and clarifying lines 
of accountability both in first line operations and in our 
second line assurance function. There has been 
significant progress with delivering improvements in 
our complaints handling processes during the period. 
This has resulted in a reduction in market share of Ofcom 
complaints from our customers and in our market share 
of complaints for the sector. The Group’s Regulatory 
Compliance Committee has continued to convene 
throughout the year to monitor the mitigation of 
operational risks which could give rise to customer 
complaints and regulatory breaches. The Director of 
Quality and Compliance has chaired weekly operational 
compliance meetings throughout the year, attended by 
senior executives. 
7.  Growth in a highly 
competitive and 
consolidating 
industry 
Potential impact: With BT’s planned 
acquisition of EE, Three’s planned acquisition 
of O2 and with the move towards triple and 
quad play bundles, the medium to long term 
industry structure is less certain. There is 
a risk that industry consolidation creates 
fewer larger and lower cost competitors 
and weakens TalkTalk’s ability to remain 
competitive in a triple and quad play market. 
Mitigation: Our focus remains on: i) engaging with the 
CMA and Ofcom to put in place appropriate remedies in 
support of fair completion when mergers and acquisitions 
take place; ii) delivery of our commercial priorities designed 
to strengthen our market position as a leading and 
disruptive quad play provider; and iii) implementing 
our ‘Making TalkTalk Simpler’ initiatives. 
8.  Key suppliers
Potential impact: TalkTalk relies on a number 
of key suppliers to provide network, equipment 
and services. A failure in their people, systems 
or processes or to act in an ethically responsible 
manner could significantly affect TalkTalk’s 
reputation and financial performance. 
Mitigation: We continue to review and improve our 
processes and controls around supplier selection and 
in-life risk management. In FY15 there has been significant 
focus on establishing a robust governance framework for 
our strategic suppliers in particular. This helps to reduce 
the likelihood and potential impact of business 
interruption due to supplier failure.
9.  Scaling TV
Potential impact: Now that TalkTalk has 
successfully established its TV proposition, 
the business must ensure that it can continue 
to build scale effectively. Failure to innovate, 
deliver high quality content at competitive 
prices or continuously monitor and improve 
the quality of our TV service could adversely 
impact our brand and reputation, leading 
to churn.
Mitigation: Service quality remains a key area of focus 
and we have been working closely with our strategic 
partners to improve the speed and performance of the 
set-top box and remote control. We run an extensive 
customer feedback programme and conduct 
benchmarking tests and field research. We continually 
develop and renew our partnerships with content providers 
to ensure a broad range of family entertainment as we 
build scale including a new deal with Netflix. In Q4 FY15 
we also announced the acquisition of Tesco’s blinkbox 
business, which will help accelerate our product 
innovation and TV growth plans.

Sustainability review
Helping make Britain better off through digital inclusion, environmental sustainability and stronger communities.
We believe that it is not just about the money: digital connectivity, coupled with digital skills, can transform our 
economy, society and environment, and make Britain better off. We believe that, by harnessing our people, 
customers and supply partners, we can help make our community a brighter place. 
Digital inclusion
TalkTalk was a founding partner of Go ON UK in 2012, when we 
pledged to work with the Government to help make the UK the 
world’s most digitally capable nation. We provide funding, our 
expertise on online safety and digital inclusion, and general 
support to the Go ON UK programme. 
This year we have focused on supporting Go ON UK’s pathfinder 
scheme in the North West. TalkTalk partnered with Tinder Foundation 
to run a tailored programme called Internet Start in the North West, 
designed for digitally excluded senior citizens to help them get online 
at home with a bespoke broadband package that suits their needs 
and to provide support with digital skills training through UK Online 
Centres. Our employees have also been encouraged to become 
digital champions and support Internet Start by volunteering at 
participating UK Online Centres in the North West. 
The TalkTalk Digital Heroes Foundation
Since 2011 TalkTalk has supported and celebrated various projects, 
charities and individuals who use digital technology at a very local 
level to make a positive social impact. Last year we formed the 
TalkTalk Digital Heroes Foundation, which has enabled us to support 
our community initiatives, including the TalkTalk Digital Heroes 
Awards, our Digital Heroes Auction as well as a number of elected 
hero projects. 
Our people also support the work of the Foundation, giving up their 
time to take part in volunteering opportunities as part of our Give 
Something Back employee scheme. 
TalkTalk Digital Heroes Awards 2014
Once again we ran our flagship annual awards, in conjunction with 
Go ON UK, the charity Citizens Online, and the Daily Mirror. The 
awards encourage local communities to nominate individuals who 
use digital technology in a socially positive way at a very local level. 
In FY15 we introduced nine new categories covering themes 
such as Employment, Education, Sustainability, Healthy Living 
and Volunteering and Fundraising. We awarded over £70,000 
in grants and prizes.
The judges were our Chairman, Sir Charles Dunstone; the UK’s 
Digital Champion, Baroness Lane Fox; the editor of the Daily Mirror, 
Lloyd Embley; and a new guest judge, 2012 Digital Hero winner 
Clare Sutcliffe from Code Club. They crowned Andrew Mulholland 
of Northern Ireland, who was winner of the Next Generation category, 
as the national TalkTalk Digital Hero 2014 and awarded him the overall 
£10,000 prize. Andrew was recognised for his outstanding work 
in developing courses and leading workshops teaching hundreds 
of children across Northern Ireland about computer science. His prize 
money will go towards designing his trial to teach secondary school 
teachers how to use Raspberry Pi computers in the classroom.
Ambitious about Autism 
This year we continued to support our long term charity partner 
Ambitious about Autism, the national charity for children and young 
people with autism. They raise awareness, support specialist schools 
and campaign for change. We raise funds to support their online 
community, Talk about Autism, where families can share their 
experiences, get support and help others to understand the condition. 
Our main fundraising event was the TalkTalk Digital Heroes Auction 
in November; FY15 saw a tremendous £360,000 generated 
(FY14: £300,000). Our people also support Ambitious about 
Autism through various Give Something Back initiatives.
Apps for Good
For the second year running we have supported Apps for Good as 
one of our Digital Heroes Foundation hero projects. Apps for Good 
is an open source education movement that works with schools 
to enable young people to create mobile and social apps to solve 
problems that matter to them – like us, they believe in the power 
of digital technology to make our communities a better place. 
As part of our partnership, we provide the funds for four schools 
near our headquarters in London to run the Apps for Good course. 
These schools are also supported by volunteers from TalkTalk. 
We also sponsor the Connected Communities category in the 
Apps for Good annual awards, where over 6,000 students enter 
to compete in six categories.
Code Club
Code Club, our other Foundation hero project, connects volunteers 
with primary schools that would like to run an after school coding club 
for nine and ten-year olds. Code Club provides the lesson structures 
for the volunteers and the aim is that after two years of the course, 
every child will be able to build a website or an app themselves. 
Our people also volunteer to run coding clubs (ScratchAthons) 
at local schools in the North West.
TalkTalk Digital Champions
We launched a Digital Champions programme in 2013 under the 
wider auspices of Give Something Back, our scheme that gives all 
of our employees paid time off to allow them to volunteer and 
fundraise for good causes. Since launch, we have worked with 
Tinder Foundation and their UK Online Centres to turn over 
150 of our employees into Digital Champions. 
Once trained, the TalkTalk Digital Champions are then matched with 
their local UK Online Centre so they can help others learn basic digital 
skills and enjoy all the benefits the internet can offer. 
As well as providing volunteering support, local centres such as the 
Mercy Foundation Centre in London and the Hamilton Davies Trust 
in Irlam, have received financial benefit to help continue their 
Get Online programmes and services to our communities. Since 
the programme was launched we have now fulfilled over 100 
volunteering opportunities in UK Online Centres across Britain.  20

Child internet safety
TalkTalk understands that all ISPs play a very important role in helping 
to keep children safe online, and that there is much we can do to help 
our customers take an active role and protect them and their families 
from security risks and inappropriate content.
We offer all of our residential customers a free service, called HomeSafe™, 
which quickly and easily protects all the devices on a TalkTalk broadband 
connection. It is built into our network and stops users from accessing 
content in categories they have indicated are inappropriate. We also 
have a similar service specifically for Business customers called 
WorkSafe, which is free with all Business Broadband and Superpowered 
Fibre Business Broadband services.
We have now set up HomeSafe™ in such a way that new customers 
have to make a conscious choice about whether or not to enable it 
on their home network, and all of our existing customers have now 
also been prompted to consider whether to opt into the system. 
We will remind all of our customers about the service once a year, 
so that they can adjust their settings if their needs or usage 
have changed.
As well as offering our customers the safety they deserve online, 
we train colleagues on internet safety so they can help their local 
communities. In FY14 we supported Safer Internet Day through 
our partnerships with Internet Matters, the UK Council for Child 
Internet Safety and F-Secure. 
In FY15 we continued to support Internet Service Matters, an 
independent not-for-profit organisation that provides information, 
support and advice on child internet safety. It is the first of its kind 
in the world and we hope the Internet Matters online portal becomes 
the single most authoritative tool for parents to get quick and easy 
access to the best available resources. TalkTalk has supported 
Internet Matters campaigns such as cyber bullying to inform 
parents about whole-home parental controls like HomeSafe™, 
helping them make the right choices for their household.
Environmental sustainability
Greenhouse gas emissions
This section includes our mandatory reporting of greenhouse gas 
emissions pursuant to the Companies Act 2006 (Strategic Report 
and Directors’ Report) Regulations 2013 (the ‘Regulations’) from 
activities for which the Group is responsible.
Reporting year
Our reporting year is the same as our fiscal year, being 1 April to 
31 March. This greenhouse gas reporting year has been established 
to align with our financial reporting year.

Organisation boundary and responsibility
We report our emissions data using an operational control approach 
to define our organisational boundary, which meets the definitional 
requirements of the Regulations in respect of those emissions for 
which we are responsible.
We have reported on all material emission sources that we deem 
ourselves to be responsible for. These sources align with our operational 
control and financial control boundaries. We do not have responsibility 
for any emission sources that are beyond the boundary of our 
operational control.

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
Methodology
We have used the main requirements of the Department for 
Environment Food & Rural Affairs (Defra) updated greenhouse gas 
reporting guidance, Environmental Reporting Guidelines, issued 
by Defra in June 2013; data gathered to fulfil our requirements under 
the CRC Energy Efficiency Scheme; and emission factors from the 
Department of Energy & Climate Change/Defra’s 2014 update.
The Group’s journey to improve carbon efficiency began in 2011 
when our Chief Executive Officer set our objective: to reduce our 
CO
2
 emissions intensity, in tonnes of CO
2
 equivalent per gigabit 
(tCO
2
e/Gb), by 25% by April 2021, relative to FY11. 
The scope of emissions captured by this objective is more wide ranging 
than those required to be disclosed as part of the Regulations. The 
scope is extended to include CO
2
 emissions from all sources, including 
those for which the Group is not directly responsible (including, for 
example, commercial flights). 
Our internal tracking also shows that our approach is working, as 
despite growing the network in line with customer usage and volume, 
we have improved energy intensity for the third year running:

Sustainable forestry
We display FSC and PEFC certification marks on the envelopes 
of our consumer direct marketing and bills, recognising our decision 
to source paper from certified sustainable sources. In fact, where 
possible, we replace printed materials with an online equivalent. 
This Annual Report is printed on certified 100% recycled paper.
Community investment
During the year, the employees and the Group were responsible 
for generating £725,000 (FY14: £640,800) of income for registered 
charities. Of this, £365,000 was direct cash donations from the 
Group (FY14: £340,800). 
The Group did not make any political donations in the current 
or prior year.
We focus primarily on providing time and money via engagement 
with three key stakeholder groups: 
Engaging with our supply partners 
In November 2014, TalkTalk hosted our fifth annual fundraising 
auction on behalf of Ambitious about Autism. This year our focus 
was the TalkTalk Digital Heroes Auction: an evening to celebrate 
TalkTalk Digital Heroes and benefit Ambitious about Autism’s digital 
projects and new college, continuing the event’s alignment to our 
CSR strategy. Our supply partners were invited to attend, with 
many donating unique lots for the auction. 
Engaging with our customers
We continued three customer driven, cause related fundraising 
initiatives established last year. 
 ƥ The first was our commitment to donate to Ambitious about Autism 
for every call made to our UK directory enquiries number: 118 111.
 ƥ Our second initiative continued to reward customers who return 
to us routers that have been diagnosed as end of life. We pay for 
the postage, refurbish or safely recycle the equipment and then 
donate £1 to charity on their behalf. 
 ƥ Our third initiative is a donation to the charity Cool Earth when 
customers add our unique Global Minutes Boost option to their 
phone package. Cool Earth is the only charity dedicated to protecting 
endangered rainforests through engagement with indigenous 
communities, one of the most effective ways to minimise CO
2
 
reaching our atmosphere.
Engaging with our colleagues
The Group’s Give Something Back initiative includes Company 
donations for our people who raise funds for a registered charity 
of their choice. Hundreds of our people took part in fundraising 
over the year supporting charities such as Cancer Research UK, 
BBC Children in Need and Band Aid.
Other achievements in the year
We retained both our FTSE4Good Index 
membership and Carbon Saver Gold 
Standard certification. Governance

Annual Report 2015
Corporate governance
Introduction
The Board is committed to the highest standards of corporate 
governance and in accordance with the Listing Rules of the UK Listing 
Authority, the Board confirms that the Company has throughout the 
year and as at the date of this Annual Report, complied with the 
provisions set out in the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘Code’).
This section of the Annual Report, together with the Strategic Report, 
provides details of how the Company has applied the principles and 
complied with the provisions of the Code and its five key principles: 
leadership, effectiveness, remuneration, accountability and relations 
with shareholders.
Board balance and independence
The Board has eleven members, six of whom, excluding the Chairman, 
are considered independent Non-Executive Directors. These are 
John Gildersleeve (Deputy Chairman), Ian West (Senior Independent 
Director), John Allwood, Brent Hoberman, Sir Howard Stringer and 
James Powell.
Therefore, at least half of the Board (excluding the Chairman) are 
independent and, notwithstanding the changes to the Board composition 
during the period, this has been the situation for all of FY15.
The following changes to the Board have been announced during the year:
3 June 2014 Tristia Harrison and Charles Bligh joined 
the Board as Executive Directors
22 July 2014 Joanna Shields stepped down as 
Non- Executive Director
13 November 2014 Steve Makin stepped down as 
Chief Financial Officer
5 January 2015 Iain Torrens joined the Board as 
Chief Financial Officer
The Chairman and Executive Directors have service contracts that 
can be terminated by either the Company or the Director on twelve 
months’ notice.
The Non-Executive Directors are expected to serve for an initial period 
of three years, albeit that either party may terminate the appointment 
on three months’ notice with no compensation for loss of office. These 
initial three year periods commenced on 20 January 2010, with the 
following exceptions: Ian West (8 February 2011); Sir Howard Stringer 
(26 July 2012); and James Powell (26 July 2012). After three years, the 
contracts automatically renew. All Directors in any event stand for 
re-election every year.
Leadership
How the Board operates
The Board has reserved certain matters, and delegated others to 
a committee of the Board. Day to day management rests with the 
Group’s Executive Committee, which comprises Dido Harding 
(Chief Executive Officer), Iain Torrens (Chief Financial Officer), 
Tristia Harrison (Managing Director, Consumer), Charles Bligh 
(Managing Director, TalkTalk Business), Tim Morris (Group General 
Counsel and Company Secretary) and other senior employees 
drawn from across the Group. Reserved matters include approving 
the Group’s strategy, annual budgets and other longer term planning.
Board Committees
The Board has established the four committees below, to which it has delegated certain matters; the first three are as required by the Code, 
and the fourth is to ensure the compliance of the Group within the consumer regulatory environment in which it operates.

Nomination Committee
The Committee is responsible for succession planning at Board level, 
overseeing the selection and appointment of Directors, regularly 
reviewing the structure, size and composition of the Board and 
making its recommendations to the Board. It assists in evaluating 
the commitments of individual Directors and the balance of skills, 
knowledge and experience on the Board.
The Committee has overseen the appointment of Tristia Harrison 
and Charles Bligh as Executive Directors and also the appointment 
of  Iain Torrens as Chief Financial Officer during the period.
The Chairman of the Committee updates the Board following each 
Committee meeting.
The Committee’s terms of reference, which are available on request 
from the Company Secretary and are published on the Group’s 
website (www.talktalkgroup.com), comply with the Code.
Other senior executives of the Group attend by invitation 
of the Committee.
Regulatory Compliance Committee
The purpose of the Committee is to provide the Board with visibility 
of how the Group remains compliant with those consumer regulations 
affecting its businesses from time to time. Its members therefore 
include those senior executives who are operationally responsible 
for implementing permanent changes necessary to ensure the 
Group remains compliant. Such members are accountable to the 
Committee and the Board for the successful delivery of such changes.
This Committee meets at least four times a year and reports to the 
Board accordingly. The Group also operates a weekly Compliance 
Committee made up of those senior executives (including the 
Chief Executive Officer) responsible for all key areas of compliance 
across the Group and is chaired by the Company Secretary. Targets 
set at these meetings are monitored against a weekly scorecard.

(2)  Brent Hobermann was unable to attend two Board meetings and one Remuneration Committee due to overseas business commitments.
(3) Sir Howard Stringer was unable to attend two Board meetings due to overseas business commitments.
As well as the formal meetings during the year, the Board met at 
other times as appropriate for approving certain announcements 
to shareholders.
It is important to the Board that Non-Executive Directors have 
the ability to influence and challenge appropriately. To this end all 
Non-Executive Directors are given a thorough induction to the Group 
and take priority in Board discussions. All Directors receive papers in 
advance of meetings. They also receive regular reports and members 
of the Group’s executive team are invited to present at Board meetings 
so that the Non-Executive Directors keep abreast of developments 
in the Group.
The Chairman meets regularly with just the Non-Executive Directors 
prior to every other Board meeting. This ensures that any concerns 
can be raised and discussed outside of formal Board meetings. 
The Senior Independent Director also attends these sessions where 
it is possible, if required, to discuss any matters with the other 
independent Non-Executive Directors.
The Senior Independent Director also takes responsibility for 
performance evaluation of the Board; succession planning for 
the Chairman; and chairing Non-Executive Director only meetings. 
In addition, he is an alternative point of contact for shareholders 
in the event that normal executive channels are not appropriate. 
Details of the Senior Independent Director’s role are set out on 
the Group’s website (www.talktalkgroup.com). 25
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
Performance evaluation and continued development
Each Board member has been subject to an internal performance 
review during the year, where the balance of skills, knowledge and 
experience of each Director was reviewed. This was undertaken 
by each member of the Board completing detailed questionnaires.
The results of these were analysed by the Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and the Board as a whole against the broad 
criteria of overall Board effectiveness and individual contributions. 
As part of the performance review the ability of each Director, in 
particular the Non-Executive Directors, to demonstrate the required 
time commitment to the role was assessed. As a result of this 
performance evaluation the Chairman confirms that each of the 
Directors seeking re-election at the AGM continues to be effective 
and has demonstrated the appropriate commitment to the role.
The Senior Independent Director also met with the other 
Non- Executive Directors during the year to assess the Chairman’s 
effectiveness, taking into account the views of Executive Directors.
The Company Secretary ensures that the Board is made aware of 
new laws, regulations and other information appropriate to the Group 
to ensure that all Directors continually update their skills, knowledge 
and familiarity of the Group in order to fulfil their roles. Additionally, 
each Director has access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary and also has the ability to take independent external 
advice if required.
Diversity
The Board understands the importance of having a diverse 
membership and recognises that diversity encompasses not only 
gender but also background and experience. The Board does not 
have a formal diversity policy and is generally opposed to the idea 
of stated quotas for females.
Our equality policy applies equally to all appointments in the 
Company, and the Board believes that appointments should be 
made solely on merit, the key criterion being whether or not the 
appointee can add to or complement the existing range of skills 
and experience on the Board. 
Risk management and internal control
The Board views management of risk as integral to good business 
practice. The Company has established an ongoing risk management 
programme to identify, assess and mitigate business, financial, 
operational and compliance risks. The programme is designed to 
support management’s decision making and to improve the reliability 
of business performance. The risk management process operates 
throughout the Group, being applied equally to the main business 
units and corporate functions.
The nature of risks identified and assessed are wide-ranging, 
covering risks arising from the regulatory environment, strategy, 
counterparties and organisational change associated with major 
projects. Action plans and controls to mitigate identified risks are put 
in place where possible and if considered appropriate by the Board, 
taking account of costs and benefits. A report is provided to the 
Directors at each Board meeting setting out key risks, changes in 
the status of the key risks and updates on mitigation.
The Directors have overall responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal controls and for reviewing their effectiveness. The Board 
delegates to executive management the responsibility for designing, 
operating and monitoring these systems. The systems are based 
on a process of identifying, evaluating and managing key risks and 
include the risk management processes set out above and channels 
to enable employees to raise concerns about possible irregularities 
in financial reporting and other issues and associated processes 
for those matters to be investigated.
The systems of internal control are supported by the Business 
Assurance and Internal Audit function. Any significant risks identified 
in the year were given appropriate priority.
The systems of internal control are designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives. 
They can only provide reasonable and not absolute assurance 
against material errors, losses, fraud or breaches of law and regulations. 
The effectiveness of these systems is periodically reviewed by the 
Audit Committee in accordance with the revised guidance in the 
Turnbull Report. These systems are also refined as necessary 
to meet changes in the Group’s business and associated risks.
The Audit Committee also adopts an internal audit charter each 
year in accordance with International Internal Auditing Standards.
The systems of internal control were in place throughout the period 
and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report. The Board has 
conducted an annual review of the effectiveness of the systems of 
risk management and internal control in operation during the year 
and up to the date of the approval of the Annual Report. This was 
approved by the Audit Committee and the Board. 
Relations with shareholders
The Board believes it is important to explain business developments 
and financial results to the Company’s shareholders and to understand 
any shareholder concerns. The principal communication media used 
to impart information to shareholders are news releases (including 
results announcements) and Company publications. In all such 
communications, care is taken to ensure that no inappropriate 
information is released. Governance

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
Corporate governance continued
Relations with shareholders continued
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have lead 
responsibility for investor relations. They are supported by an 
Investor Relations Director who, amongst other matters, organises 
presentations for analysts and institutional investors. There is a full 
programme of regular meetings and dialogue with major institutional 
shareholders, fund managers, analysts, retail brokers and credit 
investors, upon which the Chairman ensures the Board receives 
regular updates at Board meetings. The Board also receives periodic 
reports on investors’ views of the performance of the Company. 
All the Non-Executive Directors and, in particular, the Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director are available to meet with major 
shareholders, if such meetings are required.
The Company plans also to communicate with shareholders through 
the AGM, at which the Chairman will give an account of the progress 
of the business over the last year, and a review of current issues, 
and provides the opportunity for shareholders to ask questions. 
The Company’s AGM provides all shareholders with the opportunity 
to vote on the resolutions put to shareholders. Information relating 
to votes cast will, following the AGM, be available on the Company’s 
website (www.talktalkgroup.com).
Further financial and business information is available on the Group’s 
website (www.talktalkgroup.com).
Audit Committee
During the year, the Committee comprised the following independent 
Non-Executive Directors: John Allwood (Chairman), Ian West and 
James Powell. John Gildersleeve was a member of the Committee 
until he stepped down on 1 June 2014. 
The Chairman of the Committee updates the Board, following each 
Committee meeting, on any significant issues that may have arisen. 
In addition, the Chairman of the Committee is happy to make himself 
available to investors on request. During the year, all requirements 
of the Code in respect of the Committee were met. 
The Group’s Chief Financial Officer as well as representatives of the 
Company’s external auditor and other members of senior management 
from Finance, Tax and Treasury, Legal and Business Assurance also 
attend these meetings by invitation of the Committee. The external 
and internal auditors have direct access to the Committee during formal 
meetings and time is set aside for them to have private discussion 
with the Committee, in the absence of management attendees. 
John Allwood remains the member of the Committee with relevant 
and recent financial experience (as recognised by the Consultative 
Committee of Accountancy bodies), although all members are 
expected to be financially literate and have an understanding of:
 ƥ the principles of, contents of and developments in financial 
reporting, accounting standards and statements of 
recommended practice;
 ƥ key aspects of the Company’s operations;
 ƥ matters that influence or distort the presentation of accounts 
and key financial information;
 ƥ the principles of, and developments in, key applicable company 
law and other legislation relevant to the Company;
 ƥ the role of internal and external auditing and risk management;
 ƥ the regulatory framework of the Company’s business; and
 ƥ environmental and social responsibility best reporting practices.
During the year, the formal calendar of items considered at each 
Audit Committee meeting within the annual cycle encompassed 
the Code requirements to: 
 ƥ monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the Company 
and any formal announcements relating to the Company’s 
financial performance, including reviewing significant financial 
reporting judgements contained in them; 
 ƥ disclose the significant issues that the Committee considered 
in relation to the financial statements and how these issues 
were addressed;
 ƥ confirm that the consolidated financial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable, to ensure that the 
narrative sections of the report are consistent with the financial 
statements and accurately reflect the Group’s performance;
 ƥ review the Company’s internal financial controls and its internal 
control and risk management systems and to make 
recommendations to the Board;
 ƥ review the Company’s arrangements by which employees may 
raise concerns in confidence;
 ƥ monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function; 
 ƥ make recommendations to the Board in relation to the appointment, 
re-appointment and removal of the external auditor and to 
approve its remuneration and terms of engagement;
 ƥ review the Company’s policy on the engagement of the external 
auditor to supply non-audit services; 
 ƥ review and monitor the external auditor’s independence and 
objectivity and the effectiveness of the audit process, taking 
into consideration relevant UK professional and regulatory 
requirements; and
 ƥ disclose how the Committee has assessed the effectiveness of 
the external audit process and provide information on the length 
of tenure of the current audit firm.
The Committee’s remit requires it to report to the Board, identifying 
any matters in respect of which it considers that action or improvement 
is needed and to make recommendations as to the steps to be taken.  27
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
Significant judgements
The significant issues considered by the Audit Committee in the current year were as follows:
Significant issue  
considered by the Committee How the issue was addressed by the Committee 
The appropriateness of 
preparing the Group 
financial statements for 
the half year and full year 
on a going concern basis
The Committee considered papers prepared by management and, taking into account management’s 
assumptions and the external auditor’s review of these papers, concluded that management’s 
recommendation to prepare accounts on a going concern basis was appropriate.
The treatment of 
exceptional items and  
their presentation within 
the Group’s financial 
statements
The Committee considered management’s presentation of separately disclosed items. The Committee also 
considered the views of the external auditor both on management’s policy and its application in FY15. At each 
meeting the Committee reviews a paper prepared by management on actual and forecast levels of exceptional 
items including the nature of all the items and the balance of income and cost between exceptionals and 
underlying. The disclosure for inclusion in the consolidated financial statements has been reviewed and 
agreed by the Audit Committee.
In addition the Audit Committee has reviewed the Group’s position in relation to the treatment of prompt 
payment discounts and the historic termination charge settlement discussion with the mobile network 
operators, challenged management assumptions and concurs with the provision made. 
Carrying value of goodwill 
and other intangibles 
The judgements exercised in relation to goodwill impairment testing concern the assumptions used in 
calculating the value in use of the operating companies being tested for impairment. The key assumptions 
applied in the calculation relate to the future performance expectations of the business, which are driven 
by the Group’s calculation of its weighted average cost of capital (WACC) and its assessment of long term 
growth rates. The business plan used in the calculation is the five year plan, which is approved by the Group’s 
Executive Committee and the Board. The Committee has reviewed and challenged management’s paper 
on the outcome of the impairment review and concurs with the conclusion. 
Revenue recognition The key area of judgement in recognising revenue is the identification of revenue arrangements with multiple 
deliverables. When the Group sells a number of products within a bundled transaction, the total consideration 
from the arrangement is allocated to each element based on their relative fair values and limited to the amounts 
billed for that element. The Committee reviewed management’s papers on the proposed accounting treatment 
for new products and customers credits and concurs with the conclusion. In addition, the Committee also 
considers the detailed reports of the external auditor before agreeing on any potential changes to the 
Group’s accounting policies. 
Supplier rebate income The Committee reviewed the recognition of supplier rebate income during the year, an area of inherent risk 
due to the complexity of the arrangements and the judgement applied by management to ensure that rebates 
are recognised over the appropriate financial period. This review required an understanding the nature of 
any significant transactions and adherence to the Group’s accounting policies. As a result of the review, the 
Committee concluded that supplier rebate income had been appropriately recorded within the financial year.
Taxation The key judgement in relation to taxation relates to the assumptions made in recognising deferred tax assets. 
The taxation forecasting model prepared by management is based on the five year plan, which is approved by 
the Group’s Executive Committee and the Board. The Committee has reviewed and challenged management’s 
paper, which outlines the key principles and judgements used in the calculation, and concurs with the 
recognition of the asset accordingly.  Governance

Statement of Directors in respect 
of the Annual Report and Accounts
As required by the Code, the Directors confirm that the Annual Report 
and Accounts, taken as a whole, is fair balanced and understandable 
and provides the information necessary for shareholders to assess 
the Company’s performance, business model and strategy. When 
arriving at this position the Board was assisted by a number of 
processes including:
 ƥ the Annual Report and Accounts is drafted by appropriate senior 
employees across all areas of the business with overall supervision 
being provided by the Director of Group Finance, Tax and Treasury 
to ensure the Report is consistent across all sections;
 ƥ a comprehensive verification process is undertaken to ensure 
the factual accuracy of the entire Annual Report;
 ƥ complete reviews of drafts of the Report are undertaken by the 
Executive Directors and other members of the Group’s Executive 
Committee; and 
 ƥ the final draft is reviewed by the Audit Committee prior to final 
consideration by the Board. 
External audit 
The Committee is responsible for the development, implementation 
and monitoring of the Company’s policy on external audit, which 
assigns responsibility for monitoring the independence, objectivity 
and compliance by the external auditor to the Committee.
Deloitte was appointed as auditor in 2010 when the Group demerged 
from Carphone Warehouse Group PLC. In the year to 31 March 2014, 
Sharon Thorne was newly appointed as the Senior Statutory Auditor. 
Deloitte has confirmed its independence to the Audit Committee. 
The Audit Committee considers the appointment of the external 
auditors annually and has a policy of formally tendering the audit 
every ten years.
In the year to 31 March 2015, the Audit Committee discussed the 
effectiveness of the external audit process and audit quality with 
the others members of the Audit Committee. An auditor assessment 
tool will be completed after the year end audit by each member of 
the Audit Committee, the Chief Financial Officer and other members 
of senior management who are invited to attend the Audit Committee 
meetings. The assessment tool covers all aspects of the audit process 
from the audit partner’s interaction with the Audit Committee through 
to the planning and delivery of the audit. The feedback from this 
process will be considered by the Audit Committee and is provided 
to both the auditor and to senior management. The results reviewed 
at the next Audit Committee meeting. In the current year, the 
Committee believes the external auditor is performing as expected. 
However, if this situation should change in the future, management 
will agree an action plan with the external audit partner, which the 
Audit Committee will keep under review.
The policy relating to the provision of non-audit services by the 
external auditor specifies the types of work from which the external 
auditor is excluded; for which the external auditor can be engaged 
without referral to the Committee; and for which a case-by-case 
decision is required. In order to safeguard the auditor’s objectivity 
and independence, the ratio of non-audit fees to audit fees is 
monitored by the Committee. Any work proposed in excess of 50% 
of the audit fee is referred to the Committee. Amounts below this 
are discussed with the Chairman of the Committee.
A statement of fees paid or accrued for services from the external 
auditor during the period is set out below: 
2015
£m
2014
£m
Fees payable to the Company’s 
auditor for the audit of the Company’s 
annual accounts 0.1 0.1
Audit of the Group and its subsidiaries

Audit services provided 
to all Group companies 0.5 0.5
Taxation and other services 0.2 0.2
Total Group auditor’s remuneration 0.7 0.7
In the current year, the Group incurred non-audit fees of £0.2m. 
Fees relating to tax services of £0.1m principally comprised technical 
advice associated with relevant UK regulations. Other fees of £0.1m 
mainly represented advisory support on implementation of new 
system. Having undertaken a review of the non-audit related work, 
the Committee has satisfied itself that the services undertaken 
during the year did not prejudice the external auditor’s independence.
The Chairman of the Committee updates the Board following each 
Committee meeting. The Committee’s terms of reference, which are 
available on request from the Company Secretary and are published 
on the Group’s website (www.talktalkgroup.com), comply with the Code. 
In light of the assessments and review undertaken, the Committee 
recommended to the Board that Deloitte LLP be retained as the 
auditor of the Company. This recommendation was endorsed by the 
Board. Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office 
as auditor and a resolution to re-appoint Deloitte LLP will be proposed 
at the forthcoming AGM.  Governance
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ report on remuneration for FY15  
in TalkTalk Telecom Group’s fifth year as a publicly listed company.
Introduction
In line with the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Group 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 
(‘the Regulations’), the Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 March 2015 is split into two sections:
 ƥ The Remuneration Policy, which sets out the Company’s policy 
on remuneration for Executive Directors. The policy was accepted 
by shareholders by a binding vote at the 2014 AGM and is now 
effective for three years from this date. There have been no 
amendments to the Remuneration Policy in the year ended 
31 March 2015 and the unchanged policy will remain in effect 
for the year ending 31 March 2016.
 ƥ The Annual Report on Remuneration, which explains how the 
Remuneration Policy was applied in relation to Executive Directors 
for the year ended 31 March 2015 and how it will be implemented 
for the year ending 31 March 2016.
Aligning the Remuneration Policy with Company 
strategy and performance
The Remuneration Committee understands the importance of 
linking the Remuneration Policy and approach to business strategy 
and this focus has continued over the past twelve months. 
The Group’s remuneration approach applies throughout the 
Company and continues to be focused on enabling it to attract, 
motivate and retain high quality talent and ensuring there is a 
transparent link between remuneration and strategy at all levels, 
as well as the long term performance of the Company.
Board changes during FY15
Board resignations
Joanna Shields stepped down from the Board in her role 
of Non- Executive Director, effective from 22 July 2014.
Steve Makin stepped down from the Board in his role of Chief Financial 
Officer effective 13 November 2014 and left the Company on 
31 December 2014. 
Board appointments
Tristia Harrison and Charles Bligh were appointed to the Board as 
Managing Director, Consumer and Managing Director, TalkTalk Business 
respectively, effective from 3 June 2014. These appointments were 
approved at the 2014 AGM. In recognition of their Board appointment 
and in line with our pay policy, the Remuneration Committee set the 
base pay for both Tristia Harrison and Charles Bligh at £335,000 
effective from 1 July 2014.
Iain Torrens joined the Company on 1 January 2015 and was 
appointed to the Board as Chief Financial Officer on 5 January 2015. 
Remuneration Policy during FY15
In the year ending 31 March 2015 and in line with the binding 
shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM, the Remuneration Committee 
have reviewed the Remuneration Policy for Executive Directors 
and have determined that it continues to remain appropriate and fit 
for purpose. All remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors 
and Non-Executive Directors have been operated in line with the 
shareholder-approved Remuneration Policy.
The Annual Bonus scheme pay-out for Executive Directors and 
members of the Executive Committee this year has been determined 
by the Remuneration Committee to be paid at 80.5% of base pay 
as a result of 10% of the Annual Bonus scorecard achieving minimum 
performance and 45% of the scorecard achieving maximum 
performance against the targets set.

Directors’ Remuneration Report continued
Remuneration Policy
This section sets out the Company’s policy on remuneration for Executive Directors. Following approval by 
shareholders and the binding vote at the 2014 AGM, the Remuneration Policy took immediate effect following 
the AGM and will apply for a period of three years from this date. There has been no change to the Remuneration 
Policy following shareholder approval in 2014. The Policy is restated below for reference purposes, with minor 
amendments (such as reference to page numbers), for ease of reading. The definitive version of last year’s 
report is available for review on the Company’s website.
Throughout this year’s report, naming conventions of both the 
TalkTalk Sharesave Scheme and the TalkTalk Shareholder Value Plan 
(SVP), which operate under the rules of the Value Enhancement 
Scheme (VES) have altered slightly from last year’s report, but the 
underlying Policies and Plans have not changed. 
Remuneration Committee 
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for making 
recommendations to the Board in relation to the individual 
remuneration packages for the Executive Directors and the 
Chairman. These recommendations comply with the Remuneration 
Policy, which is set by the Board and the terms of reference of the 
Committee. The Committee works with the Board to determine 
the balance of allocation of profits between employee incentives, 
shareholder dividends and reinvestment into the Group.
Remuneration approach
The aim of the Remuneration Policy is to support the Group in:
 ƥ aligning individual and business performance with the interests of 
shareholders through the delivery of clear and stretching targets;
 ƥ strengthening the link between employee output and the delivery 
of shareholder value;
 ƥ supporting the Group’s overarching philosophy, to maintain its 
‘value player’ positioning in the marketplace;
 ƥ attracting, motivating and retaining high quality talent;
 ƥ maintaining a stable, efficient cost base; 
 ƥ enabling the Group’s remuneration strategy to be tailored to its 
changing circumstances; and
 ƥ reflecting corporate governance best practice.
The Company firmly believes that remuneration should be structured 
in a fair and competitive way, in order to incentivise individuals to 
achieve the highest levels of performance, and takes a consistent 
approach throughout the Group.
Packages are designed to be market competitive with fixed 
remuneration set at market median levels. Variable rewards, which 
are linked to challenging objectives based on the performance of 
the Group, are designed to reward exceptional performance and 
for the delivery of shareholder value creation. 
Employee and shareholder consultation
The Remuneration Committee did not formally consult with employees 
of the Company on the details of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
in the year ended 31 March 2014 when reviewing in line with the new 
Regulations. In reaching this decision the Committee is mindful that 
with its strong culture of employee share ownership, with over 65% 
of employees holding shares in the Company, employees have the 
opportunity to comment and vote on all elements of this report and 
policy in their capacity as shareholders. Employees are also given the 
opportunity to share their views through regular employee surveys 
and the all-employee consultation body ‘One Voice’.
The Remuneration Committee is committed to consultation with 
major shareholders when setting the Remuneration policy. If any 
of these shareholders are opposed to the policy or any proposed 
amendments to the policy, the Committee will endeavour to meet 
with them, as appropriate, to understand and respond to any issues 
they may have.
Remuneration components
We define our main fixed and performance related elements 
of remuneration as follows:
 ƥ base pay, car allowance, benefits and pension contribution 
(fixed); and 
 ƥ annual performance bonus (variable).
In addition, for Executive Directors, Executive Committee members and 
other key senior management, there are two long term incentive plans 
– the Discretionary Share Option Plan (DSOP) and the SVP, operating 
under the rules of the VES. These plans do not run concurrently.
The SVP is an alternative reward mechanism for Executive Directors 
and other members of the senior leadership team who will not 
participate in the DSOP. The Remuneration Committee intends that, 
generally, in any one year, participants may only receive an award 
under the SVP and no other long term incentive plan. 
The Committee reviews, at least on an annual basis, pay-out levels 
for Executive Directors at minimum, ‘on target’, ‘stretch’ and ‘super 
stretch’ levels of performance, in order to ensure alignment with 
our shareholders.
Malus and clawback
The rules of the annual performance bonus and long term incentive 
plans allow the Remuneration Committee to exercise its discretion in 
using malus or clawback provisions, should it feel that it is in the best 
interests of the Company and its shareholders. The Committee’s policy 
on the exercise of its discretion is set out in this Remuneration policy. 
All future long term incentive awards will be subject to malus and 
clawback provisions. Governance

Executive Director shareholding requirement
To ensure that the interests of the Executive Directors are closely 
aligned to those of its shareholders, the Company requires Executive 
Directors to build over a number of years and retain a shareholding 
in the Company of at least 200% of their annual base pay. 
For the purpose of this requirement the Company requires these 
to be in unfettered and beneficially owned shares. Newly appointed 
Executive Directors are given the opportunity to build up their 
shareholding over a period of years.

performance 
bonus
Designed to focus Executives 
on the business priorities 
for the financial year ahead 
and to align the individual’s 
remuneration with the 
delivery of superior 
business performance.
The bonus scheme is based on a ‘balanced 
scorecard’ that is comprised of financial 
and non-financial measures, which are reviewed 
annually. Such measures include Group EBITDA, 
Group revenue and innovation measures.
The measures and targets are set annually  
by the Remuneration Committee, to ensure they 
are appropriately stretching for the delivery of ‘on 
target’, ‘stretch’ and ‘super stretch’ performance. 
At least 40% of the ‘balanced scorecard’  
will be based on financial measures.
Payment is typically made in June.
The Remuneration Committee 
retains the ability to exercise discretion 
to adjust payments up or down in 
exceptional circumstances, where 
they feel this course of action 
is appropriate.
The bonus scheme pays at the 
following levels:
 ƥ on target awards for Executive 
Directors are equivalent to 60% 
of base pay;
 ƥ stretch awards for Executive 
Directors are equivalent to 110% 
of base pay; and
 ƥ super stretch (maximum) awards 
are equivalent to 170% of base pay.

Discretionary 
Share Option 
Plan (DSOP)
Designed to reward and 
retain Executives over the 
longer term whilst aligning 
an individual’s interests 
with those of shareholders.
Discretionary awards of nil-cost options are 
granted over TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC shares.
Level of vesting is dependent on achievement 
of performance targets, usually over a three year 
performance period from the date of grant.
For awards up to 2013, the performance 
measures were 50% EPS and 50% TSR. In 2014, 
the performance measure was a TSR CAGR 
measure with a FTSE 250 tracker underpin.
Awards vest after three years from grant. 60% 
of the total vested options are exercisable in the 
third year with the remaining 40% being eligible  
for exercise from the fourth year.
There is no intention to award DSOP awards to 
those Executive Directors participating in the 
Shareholder Value Plan (SVP). However, this plan 
is included in the Remuneration Policy to give the 
Remuneration Committee flexibility to make an 
award in the case of a new hire.
Awards do not vest until the third 
anniversary of the date of grant and 
may have a deferral element.
If employment ceases during the 
vesting period, awards will by default 
lapse in full, unless the Remuneration 
Committee exercises its discretion.
The maximum level of award  
is a 200% base pay multiple, 
unless the Board determines that 
exceptional circumstances exist, 
which justify exceeding this limit, 
in which case options will not 
exceed 300% of base pay.
The DSOP scheme rules were 
approved by shareholders in 
March 2010 as part of the demerger 
from Carphone Warehouse. Governance

Shareholder 
Value Plan (SVP) 
(award under  
the VES  
scheme rules)
Designed to reward and 
retain Executives over the 
longer term whilst aligning an 
individual’s interests with 
those of shareholders and in 
turn delivering significant 
shareholder value.
The Shareholder Value Plan (SVP), awarded  
under the Value Enhancement Scheme (VES) 
rules, is designed to enable participants to share 
in the incremental value of the Group in excess  
of an opening valuation, as determined by the 
Remuneration Committee and agreed with HMRC. 
Each award entitles the participant to purchase 
a fixed number of separate shares (‘Participation 
shares’) in the subsidiary company, TalkTalk 
Group Limited, the holding company for the 
TalkTalk business.
The number of TalkTalk shares issued to each 
participant is determined by the incremental 
value pool created above a 7% return to shareholders.
In order to avoid the possibility that value is 
created by a ‘rising tide’ rather than management 
performance, the Company’s total shareholder 
return will also be required to outperform the 
FTSE 250 before any vesting is possible.
The vesting of awards will be subject to continued 
employment and the satisfaction of performance 
conditions and/or other specified events as 
determined by the Remuneration Committee.
Participation shares that are purchased 
by participants are acquired at market value 
and participants offered a loan from TalkTalk 
at a commercial rate of interest in order 
to fund such a purchase. 
When the awards vest the Participation shares 
will have a value equal to the corresponding 
percentage they represent of the incremental 
value (if any) of the TalkTalk businesses at the 
time of vesting in excess of the applicable opening 
valuation and shall then be purchased by the 
Company for cash and/or by the issue (or transfer) 
of ordinary shares in the capital of the Company. 
Any loan made to the participants to acquire 
Participation shares will be required to be repaid 
at that time. If the market value of the Participation 
shares is less than the amount of the outstanding 
loan (and any accrued interest) then the participant 
may be required to repay a proportion of the  
loan, the amount of which the Remuneration 
Committee may use its discretion to determine.
Executive Directors and Executive Committee 
members will be required to hold 100% of any 
vested shares for a period of twelve months 
following vesting. Other participants will be 
required to hold 50% of vested shares for a twelve 
month period. Participation shares are generally 
forfeited to the value of the original loan plus 
accrued interest in the event that a participant 
leaves the Company prior to the vesting date.
Awards are discretionary and are 
made as a ‘block award’ to last four 
years rather than an annual award.
Each participant is entitled to 
purchase an agreed number of 
Participation shares, with no 
participant being awarded more than 
10% of the value of the pool created. 
60% of the award vests after three 
years, with the remaining 40% of 
the award vesting after four years.
A cap on the total value of the 
awards that vest at the end of the 
four year period applies and total 
awards will not result in a dilution 
of the issued share capital of the 
Company of more than 2.75%.
The VES rules were approved 
by shareholders in March 2010 
as part of the demerger from 
Carphone Warehouse.

Remuneration scenarios
The charts below illustrate the level of total remuneration the current Executive Directors could receive under the Remuneration Policy based 
on four levels of performance to ensure alignment with returns, which are received by our shareholders: at minimum, ‘on target’, ‘stretch’ and 
‘super stretch’ levels of performance. The ‘on target’ level of total remuneration represents performance in line with the Company’s expectations 
and ‘super stretch’ is considered to be the maximum level of total remuneration in practice, but the cap on the SVP has intentionally been set 
at a level higher than this.
� Base pay � Benefits, pension and car allowance � Annual bonus � LTIP
 
Notes
(1) Base pay is actual base pay in the year ended 31 March 2015.
(2) Taxable benefits are at the level over the year ended 31 March 2015.
(3)  Pension is based on a 10% Company contribution/cash in lieu for D Harding, S Makin 
and I Torrens and a 5% Company contribution for T Harrison and C Bligh.
(4)  Annual performance bonus is at 60% of base pay for target performance, 110% of base 
pay for stretch performance and 170% of base pay for super stretch performance.
(4)  SVP outcomes include assumed share price increases over the four year 
performance term.
(5)  As SVP is a ‘block award’ over a four year term rather than an annual award, we have 
annualised the potential pay-out over a four year period.

Other share-based remuneration
TalkTalk Sharesave Scheme (SAYE)
The Company operates an all-employee, HMRC-approved, 
Sharesave scheme, which all eligible employees and Executive 
Directors are able to participate in. All eligible employees are 
invited to join the scheme on an annual basis, subject to maximum 
participation levels, currently £500 per month, or in line with HMRC 
limits if these are increased in the future. Details of current schemes 
can be found in the Annual Remuneration section of this report.
TalkTalk Share Match Plan (SIP)
The Company launched its first all-employee, HMRC-approved Share 
Match Plan in June 2014, following the Remuneration Committee 
approval of this scheme in the year ending 31 March 2014. Approval 
for the TTG Share Match was granted by shareholders at the AGM 
on 24 July 2013.
TTG Share Match enables eligible employees to purchase market priced 
shares by entering into a partnership share agreement and holding 
such shares in trust for up to a five year period. The rules of the Plan 
allow an employee maximum contribution of £1,800 per annum, 
or in line with HMRC limits if these are increased. The Remuneration 
Committee, at its discretion may award matching and/or free shares 
to eligible participants. Matching shares may be granted up to a 
maximum ratio of two matching shares for each partnership share 
purchased by a participant. Free shares may be awarded up to a 
maximum value of £3,600 tax free per annum, or in line with HMRC 
limits if these are increased.
Currently the Company provides one matching share for each 
partnership share purchased by participating employees 
or Executive Directors.
Service contracts and remuneration packages
Service contracts for Executive Directors
Under the Executive Directors’ service contracts both parties are 
required to give twelve months’ notice of termination of employment. 
At the Company’s discretion they may terminate the contract 
immediately and not require the Director to work their notice 
and instead pay twelve months’ contractual pay plus benefits. 
The Executive Directors’ service contracts also include 
a twelve month non-compete period.
These contracts are available for inspection at the Company’s 
registered office.
Recruitment policy for new hires
When hiring a new Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee 
will align the remuneration package with the Remuneration Policy 
stated above, including the maximum limits for each remuneration 
component. The Remuneration Committee will take all relevant 
factors into consideration when making a remuneration decision 
on a new Executive hire to ensure that these decisions are being 
made in the best interests of the Company and its shareholders 
including, but not limited to:
 ƥ quantum;
 ƥ type of remuneration being offered;
 ƥ the impact on existing remuneration arrangements for 
other Directors;
 ƥ the remuneration package of any exiting equivalent Director; and
 ƥ the remuneration arrangements of the candidate in their 
previous role. 
In hiring a new Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee may 
also make a ‘buy-out’ award to an external candidate in compensation 
for any remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous 
employer. In making such an award, the Committee will take into 
consideration relevant performance conditions, vesting periods 
and the form in which the award was made. It is usual that any 
‘buy-out’ awards will be made on a comparable basis. In exceptional 
circumstances, the Remuneration Committee may make an exceptional 
award under one of the Company’s existing long term incentive plans 
in order to compensate a candidate for any remuneration arrangements 
forfeited on leaving a previous employer.
The Remuneration Committee would only consider making such 
awards where the individual has lost an award as a result of joining 
the Group and awards will be subject to continued employment and 
performance conditions, as appropriate. Following the appointment 
of a new Executive Director the shareholders will be informed of the 
details as soon as practicable.
There may be exceptional and unforeseen circumstances where 
the Remuneration Committee considers it appropriate to exercise 
discretion available under Listing Rule 9.4.2 R to grant an award to 
facilitate the recruitment of an Executive Director. Where a variable 
or performance related award is made under such circumstances, 
the Remuneration Committee confirms that the award will be within 
the limits specified in the Remuneration Policy table.
The Remuneration Committee emphasises that such discretion would 
only ever be used in genuinely unforeseen and exceptional events 
where it would be disproportionate to seek shareholder approval 
at a general meeting. The Remuneration Committee considers that 
in practice such events would arise highly infrequently, if at all, for 
the duration of the Remuneration Policy. Where such an event arises, 
the Remuneration Committee will consult with major shareholders 
and an explanation on how discretion has been exercised would be 
provided in the following year’s Remuneration Report.

Annual Report 2015
Service contracts and remuneration packages continued
Relocation packages
There may be occasions when hiring a new Executive Director that 
a relocation package is awarded, where a candidate and/or the 
candidate’s immediate family relocate either on a temporary or 
permanent basis in order to fulfil their role for the best interests 
of the Company and its shareholders. In such instances, the 
Remuneration Committee retains the right to compensate 
for reasonable and appropriate relocation expenses.
Expatriate packages
On appointing a new Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee 
may offer assistance where a candidate and/or the candidate’s 
immediate family is asked to relocate either on a temporary or 
permanent basis, from an overseas location to the UK or from the 
UK to an overseas location. In such instances, the Remuneration 
Committee retains the right to compensate for reasonable and 
appropriate relocation expenses.
Remuneration policy for internal promotions
When an existing employee of the Company is promoted internally 
to the role of Executive Director, the Remuneration Committee will 
align the remuneration package with the Remuneration Policy stated 
above, including the factors it takes into account for new hires.
Any remuneration awarded prior to promotion as an Executive 
Director will be retained and will be subject to the previous payment 
terms. The shareholders will be informed of any such remuneration 
in the Directors’ Remuneration Report following promotion.
Exit payments
The Company operates the following policy in respect of exit payments:
 ƥ Executive Directors have a twelve month notice period from the 
Company and they in turn are asked to give the Company twelve 
months’ notice.
 ƥ Exit payments in relation to the service contract are limited to no 
more than one year’s contractual pay plus other benefits, and any 
contractual notice pay, unless determined otherwise by the Board 
in exceptional circumstances, or unless otherwise dictated by law.
 ƥ The Remuneration Committee may use its discretion to determine 
appropriate bonus amounts and the vesting of any share-based 
award, taking into consideration the individual circumstances 
under which an Executive Director is leaving the Company.
The default position is for annual bonus amounts and the vesting 
of share-based awards for ‘good leavers’ to be pro-rated for time 
served from the start date of the scheme to the individual’s exit 
date and will be subject to the applicable rules of the scheme. 
The Remuneration Committee will have sole discretion to determine 
the ‘good leaver’ status of an Executive Director. The Committee 
will determine on a case by case basis whether any vesting of 
a share-based award is appropriate.
Fees for Non-Executive Directors
The Non-Executive Directors do not take part in discussions on their 
remuneration. Each of the Non-Executive Directors has a letter of 
appointment substantially in the form suggested by the Code, and 
each has a three month notice period with no compensation for loss 
of office. The Company has no age limit for Directors. The dates of 
each contract are set out on page 44.
The fees for Non-Executive Directors are set out on page 43 of this 
report. These fees are reviewed (but not necessarily increased) on 
an annual basis, taking into account the responsibilities of the role 
and their participation in the various governance committees of 
the Company.
Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to participate in any annual 
or long term incentive plans, or any pension arrangements.
External appointments
The Board supports Executive Directors holding Non-Executive 
Directorships of other companies and believes that any such 
appointments are part of the continuing development of the 
Executive Directors from which the Company will ultimately benefit. 
The Board has reviewed all such appointments and those appointments 
that the Board believes require disclosure pursuant to the Code are 
set out on page 44. The Board has also agreed that the Directors may 
retain their fees from such appointments. Governance

Tristia Harrison and Charles Bligh were appointed to the Board in the

Iain Torrens joined the Company on 1 January 2015 and was 
appointed to the Board in the role of Chief Financial Officer on

Detail of this one-off discretionary award can be found on page 41.
In line with the Remuneration Policy, the Committee considered both 
internal and external factors when setting the remuneration package 
for all newly appointed Executive Directors, in order to ensure that 
the decisions taken were made in the best interests of the Company 
and its shareholders.

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
Leavers in the year ended 31 March 2015
Steve Makin stepped down from the Board in his role as Chief 
Financial Officer on 13 November 2014 and left the Company on 
31 December 2014. No severance payments were made in relation 
to his exit. 
In line with the Company’s treatment of leavers as set out in the 
Policy above, the award made under the DSOP 2013 were lapsed 
and the Participation shares purchased under the SVP in June 2014 
were forfeited for the value of the outstanding loan plus accrued 
interest on Steve’s exit from the Company on 31 December 2014.
Base pay
Year ended 31 March 2015
As previously disclosed in last year’s report, following the Committee’s 
review of Executive remuneration in the year ended 31 March 2014, 
it was agreed that the base pay of the CEO would be increased to 
£550,000, which was a 10% uplift and was effective from 1 July 2014. 
As previously disclosed, the CEO had received no pay increase since 
joining the Company in 2010. On appointment to the Board, the base 
pay for both Tristia Harrison and Charles Bligh was set at £335,000 
effective from 1 July 2014. Remuneration increases for Executive 
Directors were reviewed in line with market trends, peer group 
benchmarking and current internal practices. Peer group analysis 
was conducted by Towers Watson, comparing against FTSE-listed 
companies with comparable revenue and market capitalisation.
For the year ended 31 March 2015, average base pay increases 
for all other employees was 3%.
Year ending 31 March 2016
Following the Committee’s review of Executive remuneration 
during the year ended 31 March 2015, it was decided to increase the 
base pay of Tristia Harrison and Charles Bligh, under an exceptional 
base pay award, to £375,000 effective from 1 July 2015, which is 
an uplift of 12%. In line with the Remuneration Policy, under normal 
circumstances no Executive Director will receive an increase in excess 
of 10% of their base pay in any given financial year. In determining 
these pay levels , the Committee has taken into consideration the 
contribution the Managing Director, Consumer and the Managing 
Director, TalkTalk Business have made since their appointment to 
the Board and the increased responsibilities that these positions 
carry, as well as the ongoing contribution that they will continue 
to make to the business. The Committee does not anticipate any 
substantial base pay increases for either Tristia Harrison or 
Charles Bligh in the foreseeable future. 
For the year ending 31 March 2016, average base pay increases for 
all other employees will be 1.5%. This is applied as a 1.5% all employee 
increase. In addition, adjustments were made in order to ensure that 
no employee of the Company is in receipt of base pay lower than the 
Living Wage from 1 April 2015. 
Pension contributions*
Year ended 31 March 2015
During the course of the year, Executive Directors received Company 
pension contributions in line with the Remuneration Policy. There 
were no Directors who were members of a defined benefit pension 
scheme during the year. 
Dido Harding had previously left the pension scheme at the end of 
February 2014 and therefore a cash payment in lieu of pension, equivalent 
to 10% of base pay, was made for the year ending 31 March 2015. 
Stephen Makin received a 10% of base pay contribution (pro-rata) 
into his private pension plan up to his exit date of 31 December 2014.
Iain Torrens chose not to join the Company pension scheme on 
his appointment and therefore a cash payment in lieu of pension, 
equivalent to 10% of base pay, was made for the year ended 
31 March 2015. 
Pension contributions for Tristia Harrison and Charles Bligh were 
made by the Company of 5% of their base pay for the year ended 
31 March 2015. 
The pension schemes provided for other employees of the Group 
are included in note 4 to the consolidated financial statements.
Year ending 31 March 2016
In the year ending 31 March 2016, pension contributions from 
the Company for Dido Harding and Iain Torrens will continue to 
be capped at 10% of base pay, in line with the Remuneration Policy, 
and will be paid as a cash payment in lieu. 
Annual performance bonus
Year ended 31 March 2015
For the year ended 31 March 2015, the annual performance bonus 
was based on a ‘balanced scorecard’ blend of financial and 
non-financial measures as set out in the table below. 
Executives had an incentive opportunity in the range of 0% to 170% 
of base pay. Performance for the year was 134.1% of the target bonus 
potential, with 10% of the scorecard achieving minimum performance 
and 45% of the scorecard achieving maximum performance against 
the targets set, resulting in a bonus payment of 80.5% of base pay. 
Performance against each of the measures is set out below:
Measure Weighting Achievement
Headline Group EBITDA 15% Missed
Group operating free cash flow 10% Minimum
Consumer revenue 10% Missed
TalkTalk Business revenue 10% Super stretch
On-net churn 25% Super stretch
TV net adds and NPS 10% Missed
NPS 10% Missed
Innovation 10% Super stretch
When determining bonus payments, the Remuneration Committee 
takes into account performance against the measures above, 
overall business performance and individual performance 
of Executive Directors. Governance

TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
Annual performance bonus continued
Year ended 31 March 2015 continued
Significant investment in the year in our rapidly growing TV business, 
in our fibre and mobile propositions has resulted in the majority of 
financial measures being confirmed at below minimum. Considered 
focus for the year on customer churn, accelerated growth within 
TalkTalk Business and a strong pipeline for innovation has delivered 
strong performance against the remainder of the scorecard which 
has resulted in bonus being paid out to Executive Directors at just 
above target levels.
The Remuneration Committee has judged that the targets are 
commercially sensitive and remain so even on a retrospective basis 
as they could give competitors insight into TalkTalk’s business 
planning process.
The Remuneration Committee is satisfied that this bonus has 
provided a strong link between reward and operating performance 
and the creation of further shareholder value.
Year ending 31 March 2016
A review of the annual bonus scheme was conducted in the year 
ending 31 March 2015 to ensure that the performance measures in 
the balanced scorecard continue to be aligned to Company strategy. 
The performance measures and their weightings for the year ending 
31 March 2016 are set out below:
Performance measure Weighting
Headline Group EBITDA 25%
Group revenue 20%
Churn 25%
Innovation 10%
Transformation 20%
The Board has determined that the disclosure of performance 
targets continues to be deemed commercially sensitive and they are 
therefore not disclosed in this report. These targets are determined 
within the context of a longer term business plan and the disclosure 
of these targets could give information to TalkTalk competitors to the 
detriment of business performance.
The Committee will disclose performance against all these measures 
in next year’s Directors’ Remuneration Report.
There is no change to the annual bonus policy for Executive Directors 
which is set out in the Remuneration Policy table, with the exception 
of new performance measures and weightings shown above. 
Share-based incentive plans*
Year ended 31 March 2015
The single figure of remuneration includes amounts for the value of 
options to acquire ordinary shares in the Company granted to or held 
by the Directors. Details of the options for the Directors who served 
during the year are as follows:
The TalkTalk Group Shareholder Value Plan  
(awarded under the Value Enhancement Scheme rules)
The Board strongly believes that due to the evolving and dynamic 
nature of the Company and its growth aspirations, an award under 
the SVP will continue to closely align the senior team to shareholders’ 
interests and to further incentivise the Executive team to create 
significant value for shareholders for the next phase of development 
of the business.
As stated in the Remuneration Policy, the Shareholder Value Plan 
(SVP) is designed to enable participants to share in the incremental 
value of the Group in the excess of an opening valuation, as determined 
by the Remuneration Committee and agreed with HMRC, with the 
initial valuation being calculated over the five business day average 
up to 3 June 2014. Following consultation with the Company’s top ten 
institutional shareholders, comprising 53% of the Company’s 
shareholders, in April and May 2014, awards under the SVP were 
made on 18 June 2014.
Participants purchase Participation shares at market value and are 
given a loan by the Company in order to pay for the Participation 
shares. The loan attracts interest on an annual basis which is set 
by HMRC. There are two performance conditions on which vesting 
are dependent:
 ƥ at least a 7% compound annual increase in the market capitalisation 
of TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC from the starting valuation over the 
following three and four year periods; and
 ƥ TalkTalk Group’s shareholder return should outperform that 
of the FTSE 250.
As performance conditions are satisfied and the award vests, the 
Participation shares are purchased by TalkTalk through the issue 
of TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC shares or satisfied by shares held 
by the Group ESOT. 
Subject to performance conditions being met, 60% of the scheme 
will vest in 2017, with the remaining 40% vesting in 2018. On vesting, 
all Plc shares must be held for a minimum of twelve months from 
the vesting date for Executive Directors and 50% of Plc shares for 
a minimum of twelve months from vesting for other participants.
Participation shares were acquired and loans granted by the Company

on his exit from the business on 31 December 2014.
(2)  Award to I Torrens made on 2 February 2015, resulting in a higher cost per Participation 
Share than original participants.
The remaining percentage of allocated shares in the SVP pool is held 
by other senior management of the Group. 
Interest on outstanding loans was charged at 3.25% during the year. 
There was no clawback in respect of this scheme during the year 
ended 31 March 2015 and no Non-Executive Directors participated 
in this scheme.

TalkTalk Discretionary Shares
The TalkTalk Discretionary Share Option Plan (DSOP) is designed to provide a long term incentive plan for certain employees of the TalkTalk 
Group. It is the intention of the Committee that, generally in any one year, participants may only receive an award under one such scheme.
Awards under the DSOP granted during the year or where performance periods ended during the year are set out below.
Scheme interests awarded in the year
2014 grant
An award was granted under the DSOP rules approved by shareholders in 2010 and was an unapproved scheme in June 2014.
The Board recognises the importance of closely aligning the interests of the senior team to those of shareholders and therefore awarded 
all participants a multiple of 300% base pay, as an exceptional award under the DSOP rules. The exercise of these options is subject to 
continuing employment and two performance conditions, which are set out below:
 ƥ at least a 7% compound annual increase in the market capitalisation of TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC from the starting valuation over 
the following three and four year periods; and
 ƥ TalkTalk Group’s shareholder return should outperform that of the FTSE 250.
Awards under this scheme vest in June 2017. The awards held by Executive Directors are detailed in the table below.
There was no clawback in respect of this scheme during the year ended 31 March 2015 and no Executive or Non-Executive Directors 
participated in this award.
In line with the Remuneration Policy, the Committee, at its sole discretion, may, in hiring a new Executive Director, make a ‘buy-out’ award 
to an external candidate in compensation for any remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous employer. 
A special discretionary award was made to I Torrens on 3 February 2015 in compensation for long term incentives forfeited from his previous 
employer on joining the Company. The exercise of these options is subject to continuing employment and the award vests in February 2018.

The TalkTalk Group Shareholder Value Plan (SVP)
The Company proposes to make a further SVP award under the rules 
of the VES, already approved by shareholders, as a one-off award to 
a limited number of members of the senior leadership team.
The Board strongly believes that due to the evolving and dynamic nature 
of the Company and its growth aspirations, a further award under the 
SVP to a limited number of hires within the senior leadership team will 
continue to closely align the senior team to shareholders’ interests 
and to further incentivise the team to create significant value for 
shareholders for the next phase of development of the business.
The level of award granted to each individual during the year ending 
31 March 2016 will be determined by the Remuneration Committee. 
The awards will recognise the individual’s performance, including 
exceptional performance, but no individual participant shall be awarded 
more than 10% of the SVP pool. In addition, the total value of the SVP 
awards will be subject to the cap set out in the Remuneration Policy.
It is expected that no Executive Directors will participate in the SVP 
in the year ending 31 March 2016.
TalkTalk discretionary shares
The Remuneration Committee intends to make an award in 2015 
under the DSOP rules approved by shareholders in 2010 to members 
of the senior management group.
The exercise of any options awarded under this scheme will be dependent 
on continued employment and the achievement of performance 
conditions, set out below:
 ƥ at least a 7% compound annual increase in the market capitalisation 
of TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC from the starting valuation over the 
following three and four year periods; and
 ƥ TalkTalk Group’s shareholder return should outperform that of the 
FTSE 250.
Awards under this scheme will vest in 2018.

All-Employee Share Plans*
TalkTalk Sharesave Scheme (SAYE)
The TalkTalk Sharesave Scheme is a Save-As-You-Earn (SAYE) share 
option scheme and is approved by HMRC. The SAYE Scheme is 
administrated by a duly authorised committee of the Board. All UK 
Executive Directors and employees of TalkTalk and participating 
companies within the Group are eligible to participate in the 
Sharesave Scheme as long as they have been employed for a 
qualifying period. To participate in the Scheme an eligible employee 
must enter into a Sharesave contract and agree to make monthly 
contributions between £5 and £500 for a specified period of three 
or five years. 
Options granted to acquire TalkTalk Shares under the Scheme have 
an option price determined by the TalkTalk Board, which will be not 
less than the higher of 80% of the middle market quotation price 
or their nominal value.
No share options were exercised by Executive Directors within 
the period. 
Dido Harding was awarded 3,750 share options under the 2014 
scheme at an option price of £2.40, which has been reflected 
in the single figure table detailed above.
No Non-Executive Directors participated in this scheme.
Further details of the features and operations of the Sharesave Scheme 
can be found in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
All-employee Share Match Plan (SIP)
In June 2014, the Company introduced an all-employee, HMRC-approved 
Share Incentive Plan or SIP, Share Match Plan, which had been 
approved by the Remuneration Committee during the previous 
financial year. This enables eligible employees to purchase market 
priced shares by entering into a partnership share agreement and 
holding such shares in trust for up to a five year period. Approval 
for the TTG Share Match was granted by shareholders at the AGM 
on 24 July 2013.
Both Dido Harding and Iain Torrens and have received the following

Advice and services provided to the Remuneration Committee
Except when matters concerning their own positions are being 
considered, the Chief Executive Officer and the Group Human 
Resources Director are normally invited to attend the meetings of 
the Remuneration Committee. The Committee may discuss any 
matter affecting the Chairman without the Chairman being present.
Over the course of the year ended 31 March 2015, the Remuneration 
Committee was advised on matters relating to Executive remuneration 
by Towers Watson. The Remuneration Committee deems the advisers 
to be independent from the Company and the advice they received 
during the year to be appropriate and objective.
Towers Watson is a signatory to the Remuneration Consultants’ 
Group Code of Conduct in relation to executive remuneration 
consulting in the UK.
Towers Watson has also been appointed by the Group HR Director 
to advise the Company on other matters in relation to employee 
remuneration, such as variable pay plans over the course of the year.

Directors’ responsibilities statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the 
financial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted 
by the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
elected to prepare the Parent Company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). 
Under company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state 
of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of the Company for 
that period. 
In preparing the Parent Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 ƥ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 ƥ make judgements and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
 ƥ state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; and
 ƥ prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors:
 ƥ properly select and apply accounting policies;
 ƥ present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 ƥ provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand 
the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions 
on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and
 ƥ make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that 
the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 2006. 
They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company 
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of 
the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation 
and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation 
in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 ƥ the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
financial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
 ƥ the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face; and
 ƥ the Annual Report and financial statements, taken as a whole, are 
fair, balanced and understandable and provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
This responsibility statement was approved by the Board of Directors 
on 13 May 2015 and is signed on its behalf by:

Opinion on financial statements  
of TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC
In our opinion:
 ƥ the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2015 and of the Group’s 
profit for the year then ended;
 ƥ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union;
 ƥ the Parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and
 ƥ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Group income statement, the Group 
statement of comprehensive income, the Group and Parent Company balance 
sheets, the Group cash flow statement, the Group statement of changes in equity, 
the Parent Company reconciliation of movements in shareholders’ funds and 
the related notes 1 to 28. The financial reporting framework that has been applied 
in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs 
as adopted by the European Union. The financial reporting framework that has 
been applied in the preparation of the Parent Company financial statements 
is applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs  
as issued by the IASB
As explained in note 1 to the Group financial statements, in addition to complying 
with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, the 
Group has also applied IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting 
Standards Board (IASB).
In our opinion the Group financial statements comply with IFRSs as issued 
by the IASB.
Going concern As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the Directors’ statement 
contained within the Chief Financial Officer’s Statement that the Group is 
a going concern. We confirm that:
 ƥ we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; and
 ƥ we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this 
statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had 
the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the audit 
and directing the efforts of the engagement team.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Revenue recognition 
Revenue represents a material balance consisting 
of a high volume of individually low value 
transactions and we have identified the following 
types of transactions and assertions related to 
revenue recognition which give rise to key risks:
 ƥ the completeness of revenue recorded as a result 
of the reliance on output of the billing systems;
 ƥ the accuracy and completeness of revenue 
recognised on transactions which are outside the 
normal billing process, which by their nature carry 
a higher level of management judgement; and
 ƥ the appropriateness of the allocation of the total 
transaction value between multiple elements in 
a bundled transaction. The Group’s policy with 
respect to bundled transactions is to limit the 
revenue recognised for delivered elements to the 
amounts billed, with promotional credits deferred 
over the contractual term.
See note 1 in the financial statements for revenue 
recognition policy.
We tested the operating effectiveness of automated and non-automated 
controls over the customer billing systems. Our tests assessed the controls 
in place to ensure all services supplied to customers are input into and 
processed through the billing systems. 
This enabled us to obtain assurance over billing systems accounting for over 95% 
of total Group revenue. We subsequently applied a combination of substantive 
analytical review procedures and tests of detail to obtain assurance over the 
validity and completeness of the reported output of these systems.
We performed substantive testing on a sample of non-systematic adjustments 
which are outside of the normal billing process and therefore carry higher levels 
of management judgement. These included revenue deferrals and the write - back 
to the income statement of credits applied to customer accounts. 
We have assessed the appropriateness of this policy and also performed 
substantive testing to confirm the fair value of elements delivered up front 
is in excess of the amounts billable and therefore appropriate application 
of their accounting policy.
Supplier rebates
As disclosed in note 1 of the financial statements, 
the Group periodically receives commercial income, 
bonuses or other rebates from suppliers. There is 
a risk that these are incorrectly accounted for or 
recognised in the wrong accounting period. 
We held discussions with the relationship managers for the major suppliers 
across the Group and reviewed supplier accounts to identify significant credits 
from suppliers. For significant credit items we reviewed the relevant contracts  
to understand the terms and conditions associated with the transaction and 
associated commercial rationale. Based on our review of the contracts, we have 
challenged management’s recognition of the accounting treatment of credits 
recognised from suppliers and, where the credits were significant, held 
discussions with the counterparty to confirm our understanding of the 
commercial arrangement.
Disclosure of exceptional items and the presentation 
of adjusted measures in the financial statements
The disclosure of exceptional items and their 
presentation on the face of the income statement 
represents an audit risk given the level of management 
judgement involved. Areas of particular audit focus 
in the current year are exceptional costs recognised 
in relation to amounts recognisable in respect of the 
historic termination charges settlement (see note 9), 
operating efficiencies, dual running costs, asset 
impairments and customer migration costs – all of 
which we deem to carry a higher level of judgement. 
Furthermore, the Group is challenging HMRC’s 
interpretation of the VAT Prompt Payment Discount 
rules. Determining the likely outcome of any such 
disputes, and therefore required provisions, 
is inherently uncertain.
The nature of these costs has been defined in note 9 
to the accounts.
In addition to understanding the composition of exceptional items and agreeing 
a sample of items to supporting documentation, we have challenged management’s 
rationale for the presentation of items within the income statement as exceptional, 
particularly around the areas of higher judgment such as ladder pricing to assess 
if the exceptional credit is virtually certain and regarding dual running and customer 
migration costs to determine whether the costs recognised as exceptional meet 
the criteria of the accounting policy for such items defined by the Group within 
note 9. This includes assessing the incremental nature of the costs, the extent to 
which the costs are non-recurring, whether they are specific to individual projects 
and considering whether they should be classified as part of underlying operations.
Regarding the VAT disputes, we have reviewed correspondence with HMRC 
and with the support of our internal VAT specialists we have critically challenged 
management’s assessment of the likelihood of success and the completeness 
of their provisioning and disclosure.
Our work has also included a review, on a sample basis, of items included within 
the income statement to identify income and expenses which may be exceptional 
by nature but not separately identified. This has included consideration of credit 
balances within underlying results. 51

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Acquisition accounting
There have been three significant acquisitions in 
the year as described in note 13 which included two 
customer base acquisitions and a share purchase 
acquisition with material fair value adjustments. 
The transactions give rise to cumulative goodwill  
of £11m and other intangibles assets of £43m. The 
accounting treatment for these acquisitions gives 
rise to significant judgement around the fair value 
adjustments, including the valuation of intangible 
assets recognised, which include determining 
appropriate inputs and assumptions used in the 
underlying valuations.
We have considered management’s assessment that the acquired assets 
represent a business combination under IFRS3 and challenged management’s 
inputs and assumptions used in determining the valuation and completeness  
of the acquired intangible assets. This challenge specifically included the 
consideration of the forecast cash flows expected to be generated by the 
acquired assets, the anticipated rate of churn within the underlying customer 
base and forecast revenue and cost metrics. We have also challenged the 
appropriateness of the useful economic life attributed to the assets.
Carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets
As disclosed in note 11 to the financial statements 
the carrying value of goodwill on the Group balance 
sheet as at 31 March 2015 is £490m. Management is 
required to undertake an impairment review annually 
or, if more frequent, whenever there is an indication 
that the asset may be impaired. This review incorporates 
judgements based on assumptions of future cash 
flows, including assumptions around revenue 
growth, margins and forecast cash flows, the 
selection of appropriate discount rates and the 
assessment of the Group’s cash-generating units.
We challenged management’s assumptions used in the impairment model for 
goodwill and intangible assets, including the determination of cash-generating 
units, the forecast cash flow projections for each cash-generating unit and the 
discount rates applied. In making this assessment of the cash flow projections 
we assessed historical forecasting accuracy and compared forecast profit 
margins to historical margins and benchmarked the discount rate and growth 
rates employed to available market data. We critically assessed management’s 
position as to whether or not a reasonably possible change to key operating 
assumptions could result in an impairment. In doing so we considered the 
sensitivity of the asset valuations to these assumptions, in particular changes to 
the long term growth rate assumed and the growth of the TV and Fibre customer 
bases. We used our specialist team to determine whether the discount rate used 
in the calculations was appropriate. We also considered the appropriateness of 
the related disclosures set out in note 11 to the accounts.
Treatment and presentation of tax balances
The accounting treatment and presentation of the 
measurement of deferred tax assets relating to losses 
acquired in Video Networks (‘VNL’) of £29m (which 
have been disclosed within note 7) is a judgemental 
area. Specifically, the quantum of losses to be 
recognised as a deferred tax asset is dependent 
on future profitability and the judgements within  
and reliance on management forecasts.
We have reviewed correspondence with HMRC supporting the availability 
of the VNL losses. With the use of our tax specialist team we have challenged 
management’s forecasts of future taxable profits to determine the appropriate 
quantum of VNL losses to recognise as a deferred tax asset.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed 
on page 27.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not 
to express an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any 
of the risks described above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters. 52

Our application 
of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable 
that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. 
We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be £6m (2014: £6m), which is approximately 7.3% (2014: 8.2%) 
of profit before tax and exceptional items. Our materiality was set by blending revenue and profit metrics. 
This approach was taken to make allowance for the impact of subscriber acquisition costs related to TV 
customers which has reduced current year earnings. 
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess 
of £120,000 (2014: £120,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope 
of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including 
group-wide controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement at the Group level. Based on that 
assessment, we focused our Group audit scope primarily on the TalkTalk Consumer and TalkTalk Business 
operating units. Each of these was subject to a full audit and represent over 95% (2014: over 95%) of the 
Group’s total assets and revenues. Specific focused audit work was performed over Group functions, 
including those covering treasury and taxation. Our audit work at each division was executed at levels 
of materiality which were lower than Group materiality.
At the parent entity level we also tested the consolidation process and carried out analytical procedures 
to confirm our conclusion that there were no significant risks of material misstatement of the aggregated 
financial information of the remaining components not subject to audit.
Opinion on other matters 
prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion:
 ƥ the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 ƥ the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which  
the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations 
received and accounting 
records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
 ƥ we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
 ƥ adequate accounting records have not been kept by the Parent Company, or returns adequate for our 
audit have not been received from branches not visited by us; or
 ƥ the Parent Company financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion certain disclosures of 
Directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be 
audited is not in agreement with the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising 
from these matters.
Corporate Governance 
Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement 
relating to the Company’s compliance with ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We 
have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other 
information in the 
Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
 ƥ materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
 ƥ apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group 
acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 ƥ otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our 
knowledge acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report 
is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
We confirm that we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements. 53
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
Respective responsibilities 
of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the Directors are responsible for 
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us 
to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with 
International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to 
ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls 
and systems include our dedicated professional standards review team, strategically focused second 
partner reviews and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 
of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s 
members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose. 
To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than 
the Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the 
opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the 
financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements 
sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, 
whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are 
appropriate to the Group’s and the Parent Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied 
and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; 
and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial 
information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements 
and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent 
with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any 
apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the consolidated financial statements 
1. Accounting policies and basis of preparation
Basis of preparation
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC is incorporated in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006. 
The consolidated financial statements of the Company have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted for use in the European Union (EU) and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006. These 
financial statements therefore comply with Article 4 of the European Union International Accounting Standard regulation. The Company has 
elected to prepare its Parent Company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP.
The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, except for the revaluation of certain financial instruments and investments. 
The financial statements are presented in Sterling, rounded to the nearest million, because that is the currency of the principal economic 
environment in which the Group operates.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of the Company, entities controlled by the Company (its subsidiaries) 
and entities which are joint ventures accounted for using the equity method made up to 31 March each year. Control is achieved where the Company 
has the power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or sold during the year are included from or to the date on which control passed to or was relinquished 
by the Group. Intercompany transactions and balances between subsidiaries are eliminated on consolidation.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries and the results of joint ventures to bring accounting policies in line 
with those used by the Group.
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Details of the considerations undertaken by the Directors in reaching this 
conclusion are set out on page 14 within the Chief Financial Officer’s Statement.
Accounting policies
The Group’s principal accounting policies, which relate to the financial statements as a whole, are set out below. Where an accounting policy is 
specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates. This section also shows new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments 
and interpretations, whether these are effective in the current or later years. In both cases it is explained how they are expected to impact the 
performance of the Group. 
Revenue
Revenue is stated net of VAT and other sales-related taxes and represents the gross inflow of economic benefit generated from the provision 
of fixed line, TV and mobile telecommunications services. All such revenue is recognised as the services are provided:
 ƥ line rental is recognised in the period to which it relates;
 ƥ voice and broadband subscriptions are recognised in the period to which they relate;
 ƥ usage including voice and TV content is recognised in the period in which the customer takes the service;
 ƥ promotional discounts and credits are amortised on a straight line basis over the minimum contract period subject to an adjustment for 
in-contract churn; and
 ƥ data service solutions and other service contracts are recognised as the Group fulfils its performance obligations.
Revenue is measured at fair value of the consideration received or receivable. When the Group sells a number of products within a bundled 
transaction, the total consideration from the arrangement is allocated to each element based on their relative fair values. Management 
applies judgement in determining the amount of revenue the Group recognises for delivered elements. This is limited to the amounts 
billed for that element.
Subscriber acquisition costs
Subscriber acquisition costs include both third party costs of recruiting and retaining new customers as well as device costs. These are expensed as incurred. 
Foreign currency translation and transactions
Material transactions in foreign currencies are hedged using forward purchases or sales of the relevant currencies and are recognised in the 
financial statements at the exchange rates thus obtained. Unhedged transactions are recorded at the exchange rate on the date of the transaction. 
Hedge accounting as defined by IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ has been applied in the current and preceding 
financial year by marking to market the relevant financial instruments at the balance sheet date and recognising the gain or loss through other 
comprehensive income in respect of cash flow hedges.
The principal exchange rates against UK Sterling used in these financial statements are as follows:
Average Closing
2015 2014 2015 2014
Euro 1.29 1.19 1.38 1.21
United States Dollar 1.61 1.60 1.49 1.67 60

Annual Report 2015
Financial statements
Notes to the consolidated financial statements continued 
1. Accounting policies and basis of preparation continued
Leases
Rental payments under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the period of the lease, even where 
payments are not made on such a basis. Lease incentives and rent free periods are amortised through the income statement over the period 
of the lease term.
Gains or losses from sale and leaseback transactions are deferred over the life of the new lease to the extent that the rentals are considered 
to be above or below market rentals. The remaining gain or loss is recognised within operating expenses in the year in which the sale is completed.
Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities, in respect of financial instruments, are recognised in the Group balance sheet when the Group becomes 
a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables, loans and other receivables that have fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market are classified 
as loans and receivables. Loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. Interest 
income is recognised by applying the effective interest rate, except for short term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial. 
Rebates receivable from suppliers
Occasionally, the Group enters into agreements with certain suppliers for rebates on the cost of goods purchased. Judgement is applied by management 
in these circumstances to ensure that the rebate is recognised over the appropriate financial period. 
Rebates from suppliers in the year related to renegotiated contract rates and compensation received under existing contracts. Where these 
amounts relate to historical transactions, but negotiated in the current year, they are recognised in the current year income statement.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents and bank deposits consist of cash in hand. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are other financial liabilities initially measured at fair value and subsequently measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments issued by the Group are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered 
into and the definitions of a financial liability and an equity instrument. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest 
in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities and includes no obligation to deliver cash or other financial assets. The accounting policies 
adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Loans and other borrowings
Loans and other borrowings represent committed and uncommitted bank loans, US Private Placement notes and bank overdrafts. These are 
initially measured at net proceeds and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest rate method.
Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of external financing are capitalised and amortised over the term of the relevant facility. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash 
equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Group are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issuance costs.
Shares in the Company held by the Group ESOT are shown as a reduction in shareholders’ funds. Other assets and liabilities held by the trust 
are consolidated with the assets of the Group.
Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
The Group’s activities expose it to the financial risks of changes in foreign exchange rates and interest rates. The use of financial derivatives is 
governed by the framework approved by the Board, which provides written principles on the use of financial derivatives consistent with the Group’s 
risk management strategy. Changes in values of all derivatives of a financing nature are included within investment income and financing costs 
in the income statement. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative purposes.
Derivative financial instruments are initially measured at fair value on the contract date and are subsequently remeasured to fair value at each 
reporting date.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting, or the Company chooses to end the hedging relationship.  61
TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC  
Annual Report 2015
1. Accounting policies and basis of preparation continued
Financial instruments continued
Cash flow hedges
The Group uses derivative instruments (primarily interest rate swaps) to manage its interest rate risk. The Group designates these as cash flow 
hedges. The effective portion of changes in the fair value of these instruments is recognised in other comprehensive income. The gain or loss 
relating to the ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Measurement
The financial instruments included on the Group balance sheet are measured at fair value or amortised cost. The measurement of this fair 
value can in some cases be subjective and can depend on the inputs used in the calculations. The different valuation methods are called ‘hierarchies’ 
and are described below:
 ƥ Level 1: Fair values measured using quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
 ƥ Level 2: Fair values measured using inputs, other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability either directly 
or indirectly; and
 ƥ Level 3: Fair values measured using inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data.
Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. Estimates 
and assumptions used in the preparation of the financial statements are continually reviewed and revised as necessary. Whilst every effort 
is made to ensure that such estimates and assumptions are reasonable, by their nature they are uncertain, and as such changes in estimates 
and assumptions may have a material impact.
The areas involving the most sensitive estimates and assumptions that are significant to the financial statements are set out in more detail 
in the related notes:
 ƥ rebates receivable from suppliers (note 1);
 ƥ revenue recognition for bundled transactions (note 1);
 ƥ taxation (note 7);
 ƥ exceptional items (note 9);
 ƥ impairment of goodwill (note 11);
 ƥ valuation of acquisition intangibles (note 11);
 ƥ capitalisation and useful economic lives of assets (notes 11 and 12);
 ƥ impairment of assets (notes 11 and 12); and
 ƥ trade receivables (note 16).
Application of significant new or amended EU endorsed accounting standards
Amendments to IFRS 2 ‘Share-based Payment’, IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’, IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, IFRS 13 ‘Fair Value Measurement’, 
IAS 16 ‘Property, Plant and Equipment’, IAS 24 ‘Related Party Disclosures’, IAS 38 ‘Intangible Assets’ and IAS 40 ‘Investment Property’ became 
effective in the current reporting period. These new and revised standards and interpretations have no material impact on the Group.
Future accounting developments
At the date of authorisation of these financial statements, there were a number of significant standards and interpretations that have not been 
applied in these financial statements, these were in issue, but not yet effective (and in some cases had not yet been adopted by the EU).
The Directors expect that the following standards will have material impact on the financial statements of the Group in future periods:
 ƥ IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, impacting both the measurement and disclosure of financial instruments.
 ƥ IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’, impacting revenue recognition, related costs and disclosures.
Beyond the information above, it is not practicable to provide a reasonable estimate of the effect of these standards until a detailed review 
has been completed. 62

2. Segmental reporting
Accounting policy
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’ requires the segmental information presented in the financial statements to be that used by the chief operating 
decision maker to evaluate the performance of the business and decide how to allocate resources. The Group has identified the Board as its 
chief operating decision maker. The Board considers the results of the business as a whole when assessing the performance of the business 
and making decisions about the allocation of resources. Accordingly the Group has one operating segment.

5. Share-based payments
Accounting policy
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees and Executive Directors. Equity-settled share-based payments 
are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed over the vesting period, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will 
eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a dividend discount or Binomial model for share-based payments with internal, non-market performance 
criteria (for example, EPS targets) and a Black Scholes or Monte Carlo model for those with external performance criteria (for example, 
TSR targets).
For schemes with non-market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is recalculated at each balance sheet date, 
based on expectations of performance against target and of leavers prior to vesting. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous 
balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in reserves.
For schemes with market performance criteria, the number of options expected to vest is adjusted only for expectations of leavers prior to 
vesting. The movement in cumulative expense since the previous balance sheet date is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding 
entry in reserves.
If a scheme is cancelled, any remaining part of the fair value of the scheme is expensed immediately. If a scheme is forfeited, no further expense 
is recognised and any charges previously recognised are reversed.
Charges arise on loans that are provided to employees to fund the purchase of shares in the Group as part of long term incentive plans. To the 
extent to which the loans are not, in certain circumstances, repayable, the cost of such loans is expensed over the course of the relevant incentive 
plans. Charges are also recognised on loans provided to employees to settle personal tax liabilities. To the extent to which the loans are not, 
in certain circumstances, repayable, the cost of such loans is expensed on grant.  64

Group share schemes
The Group’s share schemes are the Shareholder Value Plan (SVP), Discretionary Share Option Plan (DSOP), Save-As-You-Earn scheme (SAYE) 
and Share Match scheme (SIP).
In order to aid the user of the accounts, the dilutive effect on EPS of each of the Group schemes has been presented. This has been calculated 
using an average share price for the financial year of £3.00 (2014: £2.67).
In June 2014, the Group made awards under the SVP and the DSOP schemes, under rules previously approved by shareholders. Further 
information is set out in sections (i) and (ii) of this note. The TTG Value Enhancement Scheme (VES) and CPW TTG VES have fully vested 
in the prior year; therefore, disclosures are limited to the dilutive effect on EPS and the number of outstanding options in the prior year.

(i) TTG SVP
On 18 June 2014, the Company made awards in the SVP, operating under the VES rules previously approved by shareholders. Subsequent 
awards were made to new joiners of the Group in December 2014, February and March 2015. The Group advanced loans to participants 
to enable them to purchase participation shares in TalkTalk Group Limited, the holding company of the Group’s operating business. 
The SVP is a growth plan and not a share option plan. These loans are subject to a commercial rate of interest set by HMRC. The SVP 
enables participants to share in up to 7% of any increase in the value of the Group over an opening market capitalisation of £2,941m 
based on a five business day average up to 3 June 2014. The awards are subject to the following performance conditions: 
 ƥ at least a 7% compound annual increase (CAGR) in the market capitalisation of the Group from the above valuation over a three and 
four-year period; and 
 ƥ the Group’s TSR outperforms the FTSE 250.  65

(i) TTG SVP continued
The performance conditions are measured over an initial performance period from 3 June 2014 to the date of announcement of the Group’s 
FY17 annual results after which a total of 60% of the options will vest. The remaining options are measured over a performance period from 
3 June 2014 to the date of announcement of the Group’s FY18 annual results. Participation shares are forfeited for the value of the outstanding 
loan plus accrued interest, if an employee leaves the Group before the scheme vests. The Pool also has a maximum cap on incremental value 
equal to 2.75% of the total issued share capital of TalkTalk Telecom Group PLC at the date of each vesting. 
There is a holding period on 100% of the PLC Shares received in exchange for participation shares on vesting, of twelve months from each 
vesting date for Executive Directors. All other participants are required to hold 50% of the PLC Shares received in exchange for participation 
shares on vesting for twelve months from each vesting date. 
A fair value exercise was conducted for the award using the Monte Carlo method with the total fair value of the participation shares granted 
totalling £6m. The resulting IFRS 2 charge for the year ended 31 March 2015 is £1.6m.
(ii) DSOP – 2014 grant
In June 2014, the Group granted eight million nil-priced share option awards subject to the following performance conditions:
 ƥ at least a 7% compound annual increase (CAGR) in the market capitalisation of the Group from the above valuation over the next three and 
four year periods; and 
 ƥ the Group’s TSR outperforms the FTSE 250. 
The options are measured over a performance period from 3 June 2014 to 3 June 2017 and will vest on announcement of the Group’s FY17 
annual results. A total of 60% of the vested options are exercisable from the vesting date, with the remaining 40% of options being exercisable 
twelve months later. Options are forfeited if an employee leaves the Group before the options vest, subject to the DSOP scheme rules. Subsequent 
awards were made to new joiners of the Group in December 2014 and February 2015.

*  In accordance with the scheme rules, the final performance of the DSOP 2012 was measured on 31 March 2015. It was confirmed that performance against the EPS measure fell below 
the minimum threshold and was missed, but that performance against the TSR measure exceeded Super Stretch and was hit. 50% of the DSOP 2012 will therefore vest on 14 May 2015, 
with 60% of the vested options being available to exercise from this date and the remaining 40% available to exercise on 14 May 2016.

(vii) Share Match
The Group launched its first all-employee, HMRC approved Share Match Plan (SIP) in June 2014, following the Remuneration Committee 
approval of this scheme in the year ending 31 March 2014. This enables eligible employees to purchase market priced shares by entering into a 
partnership share agreement and holding such shares in trust for up to a five year period. The rules of the Plan allow an employee maximum 
contribution of £1,800 per annum, or in line with HMRC limits if these are increased. Approval for the TTG Share Match was granted by 
shareholders at the AGM on 24 July 2013.
The Remuneration Committee, at its discretion may award matching and/or free shares to eligible participants. Matching shares may be granted 
up to a maximum ratio of two matching shares for each partnership share purchased by a participant. Free shares may be awarded up to a maximum 
value of £3,600 tax free per annum, or in line with HMRC limits if these are increased.
Currently the Group provides one matching share for each partnership share purchased by participating employees or Executive Directors. 
During the year ended 31 March 2015, the impact of Share Match scheme on the Group’s results was not material. 68

7. Taxation
Accounting policy
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and overseas tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences between the carrying amount of an asset or liability in the balance sheet and its tax base.
Deferred tax liabilities represent tax payable in future periods in respect of taxable temporary differences. Deferred tax assets represent tax 
recoverable in future periods in respect of deductible temporary differences, and the carry-forward of unused tax losses and credits. Deferred tax 
is determined using the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and are expected to apply when 
the deferred tax asset is realised or the deferred tax liability is settled.
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can 
be utilised. Current and deferred tax is recognised in the income statement except where it relates to an item recognised directly in reserves, 
in which case it is recognised directly in reserves.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy
The extent to which tax losses can be utilised depends on the extent to which taxable profits are generated in the relevant jurisdictions 
for the foreseeable future, and on the tax legislation then in force, and as such the value of associated deferred tax assets is uncertain.

No deferred tax assets and liabilities have been offset in either year, except where there is a legal right to do so in the relevant jurisdictions. 
During the year, the Company reviewed the period over which it recognises assets in respect of brought forward tax losses and revised this 
from five years to ten years due to the increased stability of the TV proposition. The incremental movement of £29m has been recognised 
through exceptional items. 
At 31 March 2015, the Group had unused tax losses of £674m (2014: £702m) available for offset against future taxable profits. A deferred tax 
asset of £69m (2014: £39m) has been recognised in respect of £347m (2014: £197m) of such losses, based on expectations of recovery in the 
foreseeable future.
No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of the remaining £327m (2014: £505m) as there is insufficient evidence that there will 
be suitable taxable profits against which these losses can be recovered. All losses may be carried forward indefinitely. 70

Total ordinary dividends 116 99
The proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 March 2015 of 9.2p per ordinary share on approximately 922 million ordinary shares 
(approximately £85m) was approved by the Board on 13 May 2015 and will be recommended to shareholders at the AGM in July. The dividend 
has not been included as a liability as at 31 March 2015.
The Group ESOT has waived its rights to receive dividends in the current and prior year and this is reflected in the analysis above.
9. Reconciliation of Headline information to Statutory information
Headline information is provided because the Directors consider that it provides assistance in understanding the Group’s underlying performance. 
Accounting policy
Headline results are stated before the amortisation of acquisition intangibles and exceptional items. Exceptional items are those that are 
considered to be one-off or non-recurring in nature and so material that the Directors believe that they require separate disclosure to avoid 
distortion of underlying performance and should be separately presented on the face of the income statement. 
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy
The classification of items as exceptional is subjective in nature and therefore judgement is required to determine whether the item is in line 
with the accounting policy criteria outlined above. Determining whether an item is exceptional is a matter of qualitative assessment, making 
it distinct from the Group’s other critical accounting judgements where the basis for judgement is estimation.

9. Reconciliation of Headline information to Statutory information continued
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy continued
a) Revenue
Within the Statutory results are two items relating to ongoing commercial discussions; the treatment of prompt payment discounts and 
historic termination charge settlements with the Mobile Network Operators. The net impact of these two items is not material. (2014: -£5m).
b) Operating efficiencies – Making TalkTalk Simpler (MTTS)
During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group has continued its simplification and cost reduction programmes to drive a seamless and efficient 
customer experience and provide the business with operations and processes that are fit for purpose. 
The costs incurred in the year included work on improving Consumer and TalkTalk Business customer operations, services and rationalising 
customer tariffs and exiting Group legacy products and access methods.
These programmes have resulted in £29m (2014: £20m) of costs including project management, consultancy, migration and call centre costs.
A total taxation credit of £7m has been recognised on these costs in the year ended 31 March 2015 (2014: £5m). 
c) Acquisitions and disposal
During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group acquired broadband and voice customer bases from both Virgin Media Limited (‘Virgin Media’) 
and Tesco Stores Limited (‘Tesco’) and acquired blinkbox Entertainment Limited (‘blinkbox’). The Group has incurred costs for the migration 
of customers onto the Group’s network and integration costs including redundancy. The total charge incurred in the year ended 31 March 2015 
was £4m (2014: £nil).
Further to this, the Group has provided for £10m of costs in respect of committed future programmes predominantly in respect of migration, 
reorganisation and related costs.
In addition, on 24 December 2014, the Group disposed of its existing off-net broadband customer base to Fleur Telecom Limited, a member 
of Daisy Communications Group. This transaction generated £5m profit to the Group. 
A total taxation credit of £2m (2014: £nil) has been recognised in relation to these items in the year ended 31 March 2015.
d) Mobile Migration
As part of the plan to build a scale quad-play business, during the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group has entered into a new multi-year 
commercial MVNO agreement with Telefónica UK, where by Telefónica UK will provide TalkTalk with access to 4G and national roaming services 
in the UK. As a result, the Group provided for £8m (2014: £nil) of costs in respect of committed future mobile migration programmes from 
the existing network provider to Telefónica UK predominantly in respect of SIM replacement, customer communications and related costs.
A total taxation credit of £2m (2014: £nil) has been recognised on these costs in the year ended 31 March 2015.
e) Impairment loss
As a result of the MTTS exceptional projects, an £11m impairment charge has been recognised in respect of a number of systems to be 
decommissioned or replaced before the end of their useful economic life. £5m (2014: £nil) of this impairment charge related to equipment 
and has been included within exceptional depreciation and the remaining £6m (2014: £nil) related to a billing system and has been included 
in exceptional amortisation on the face of the Group income statement.
A total taxation credit of £2m (2014: £nil) has been recognised on these costs in the year ended 31 March 2015. 
f) Amortisation of acquisition intangibles
An amortisation charge in respect of acquisition intangibles of £6m was incurred in the year ended 31 March 2015 (2014: £21m). The Tiscali 
customer base was fully amortised in the year.
A total taxation credit of £1m has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2015 (2014: £5m).
g) Tax items
The Group has recognised tax credits of £45m (2014: £nil) comprising a further £29m in respect of VNL tax losses following the increase in the time 
period used to recognise losses from five to ten years and £16m for the resolution of legacy demerger items (note 7). 72

11. Goodwill and other intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Accounting policy
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings and businesses, representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration 
given over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired is recognised initially as an asset at cost and is subsequently measured 
at cost less any accumulated impairment losses.
On disposal of a subsidiary undertaking, the relevant goodwill is included in the calculation of the profit or loss on disposal.
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy
The Group has two CGUs – Consumer and TalkTalk Business. For the purpose of impairment testing, at the acquisition date, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the acquisition. The Group’s shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure 
and central overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the relative future cash flows that those shared costs support. 
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires estimation of the value in use of the CGUs to which the goodwill has been allocated. 
The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates 
to use to calculate present values.
Impairment of goodwill 
Goodwill is not subject to amortisation but is tested for impairment annually or whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired; 
this review is performed at a CGU level.
Impairment is determined by assessing the future cash flows of the CGU to which the goodwill relates. The future cash flows of the Group are 
taken from the Board approved five-year plan and extrapolated out to 20 years based on the UK’s long term growth rate. This is discounted by 
the CGU’s weighted average cost of capital pre-tax to give the net present value of that CGU. Where the net present value of future cash flows 
is less than the carrying value of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
CGU and then to the other assets of the CGU pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. Any impairment loss is recognised 
in the income statement and is not subsequently reversed. 73

Impairment review
The key assumptions used in the Group’s goodwill impairment review are as follows:
 Ɂ Long term growth rates
Long term revenue growth rates applied are based on the growth rate for the UK per the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development 
(OECD). The rate applied in the current year was 2.2% (2014: 1.7%).
 Ɂ Discount rate
The underlying discount rate for each CGU is based on the UK ten-year gilt rate adjusted for an equity risk premium and the systematic risk 
of the CGU. The average pre-tax rate for both CGUs used to discount the forecast cash flows is 9.0% (2014: 8.4%). The assumptions used in the 
calculation of the CGUs’ discount rate are benchmarked to externally available data. The same discount rate has been applied to both CGUs 
due to the similarity of risk factors and geographical location. 
 Ɂ Capital expenditure
Forecast capital expenditure is based on senior management expectations of future required support of the network and current run rate 
of expenditure, typically at 6% of revenue.
 Ɂ Customer factors
The key assumptions for the forecast cash flows of each of the CGUs are based on expected customer growth rates, ARPU, direct costs including 
acquisition costs, and change in product mix. The value assigned to each of these assumptions has been determined based on the extrapolation 
of historical trends in the Group and external information on expected trends of future market developments. 
Sensitivity analysis has been performed for each key assumption and the Directors have not identified any reasonably possible material 
changes in the key assumptions that would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed the recoverable amount.
(b) Other intangible assets
Accounting policy
Operating intangibles
Operating intangibles include internal infrastructure and design costs incurred in the development of software for internal use. Internally generated 
software is recognised as an intangible asset only if it can be separately identified, it is probable that the asset will generate future economic benefits, 
and the development cost can be measured reliably. Where these conditions are not met, development expenditure is recognised as an expense 
in the year in which it is incurred. Operating intangibles are amortised on a straight line basis over their estimated useful economic lives of up to eight years.
Acquisition intangibles
Acquired intangible assets such as customer bases and other intangible assets acquired through a business combination are capitalised separately 
from goodwill and amortised over their expected useful lives of up to six years on a straight line basis. The value attributed to such assets is based 
on the future economic benefit that is expected to be derived from them, calculated as the present value of future cash flows after a deduction 
for contributory assets. 74

Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy
Impairment
At the acquisition date, acquisition intangibles are allocated to each of the CGUs expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. 
The Group’s shared costs and assets relating mainly to infrastructure and central overheads are allocated across the two CGUs based on the 
relative future cash flows. 
Determining whether the carrying amounts of operating and acquisition intangibles have any indication of impairment requires judgement. 
If an indication of impairment is identified, further judgement is required to assess whether the carrying amounts can be supported by the value 
in use of the CGU that the asset is allocated to. 
The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of appropriate discount rates to use 
to calculate present values.
Useful economic lives
The assessment of the useful economic lives of these operating and acquisition intangibles requires judgement. Amortisation is charged to the income 
statement based on the useful economic life selected. This assessment requires estimation of the period over which the Group will benefit 
from the assets.
Impairment of assets 
The Group reviews the carrying amounts of its intangible assets to determine whether there is any indication that those assets have suffered 
an impairment loss at each reporting date. Where an indicator of impairment exists, the Group makes a formal estimate of the asset’s recoverable amount 
and the extent of any impairment loss. 
The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated cash 
flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market assessments of the time value of money 
and the risks specific to the asset for which the estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced 
to its recoverable amount.

Operating intangibles 
Operating intangibles includes internally generated assets with a net book value of £59m (2014: £39m), which are amortised over a period of up 
to eight years. This includes additions of £31m (2014: £15m) and an amortisation charge of £10m (2014: £7m) in the year ended 31 March 2015. 
Included within operating intangibles is the following asset, which is material to the Group: 
 ƥ TRIO, the customer billing system, which has a net book value of £66m (2014: £76m). TRIO is amortised over a period of up to eight years 
depending on the release date of the relevant component. The weighted average remaining useful economic life of the components of TRIO 
is three years (2014: four years). 
Acquisition intangibles
At 31 March 2015, the acquisition intangibles relate to the broadband customer bases acquired from Virgin Media and Tesco in October 2014 
and January 2015 respectively (see note 13). The valuation of customer bases is derived from the discounted future cash flows expected from 
them, after a deduction for contributory assets. 
The value of these broadband customer bases is material to the Group with net book value of £38m. The useful economic life of acquired 
customer bases is five years from the date of acquisition. The Tiscali customer base was fully amortised in the year.
The remaining £4m of acquisition intangibles relate to the website acquired as part of the blinkbox transaction in January 2015 (see note 13). 
The website is valued using replacement method and has a remaining useful economic life of three years.
12. Property, plant and equipment
Accounting policy
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost, net of depreciation and any provision for impairment. Depreciation is provided on all property, 
plant and equipment at rates calculated to write off the cost, less estimated residual value, of each asset on a straight line basis over its expected 
useful life from the date it is brought into use, as follows:
Short leasehold improvements 10% or the lease term if less than ten years 
Network equipment and computer hardware 12.5–50% per annum 
Fixtures and fittings 20–25% per annum
Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policy
The assessment of the useful economic lives of these assets requires judgement. Depreciation is charged to the income statement based 
on the useful economic life selected. This assessment requires estimation of the period over which the Group will benefit from the assets.
Determining whether the carrying amount of these assets has any indication of impairment also requires judgement. If an indication of impairment 
is identified, further judgement is required to assess whether the carrying amount can be supported by the value in use of the CGU to which 
the asset is allocated. The value in use calculation involves estimation of both the future cash flows of the CGUs and the selection of 
appropriate discount rates to use to calculate present values (note 11).  76

13. Non-current asset investments
Accounting policy
Investments, other than subsidiaries, are initially recognised at cost, being the fair value of the consideration given plus any transaction costs 
associated with the acquisition.
Investments are categorised as available for sale and are recorded at fair value. Changes in fair value, together with any related taxation, are taken 
directly to equity, and recycled to the income statement when the investment is sold or determined to be impaired.
Non-current asset investments at 31 March 2015 related to a 7.3% (2014: 7.3%) interest in Shared Band Limited, a telecommunications 
technology provider. The cost of the investment is not material. 
(a) Principal investments
The Parent Company has investments in the following subsidiary undertakings, which principally affected the profits or losses or net assets of 
the Group. To avoid a statement of excessive length, details of investments that are not significant have been omitted. All holdings are in equity share 
capital and give the Group an effective holding of 100% on consolidation.

(b) Acquisitions and disposals
(i) Acquisitions
The Group has made the following acquisitions during the year ended 31 March 2015:
Virgin Media broadband customer base acquisition
On 27 October 2014, the Group acquired the Virgin Media broadband service business from Virgin Media which comprises broadband customers 
(MPF, SMPF and IP Stream). The acquisition is complementary to the Group’s existing business model. The legal title of asset was transferred 
as the customers migrated to the Group’s network which substantially took place in the period from December 2014 to March 2015. As this is 
an acquisition of customer base, nil voting shares were acquired. The provisional goodwill represents the future economic benefit arising from 
the aligning of customers’ existing products with the Group’s products and its fit with existing operations. Provisional goodwill has been allocated 
to the Consumer Cash Generating Unit (CGU).
Tesco broadband and voice customer base acquisition
On 7 January 2015, the Group acquired the Tesco broadband service business from Tesco which comprises broadband (MPF, SMPF and IP Stream) 
and voice customers. The acquisition is complementary to the Group’s existing business model. The legal title of asset was transferred on 
1 March 2015. As this is an acquisition of customer base, nil voting shares were acquired. The provisional goodwill relation to the future 
economic benefit arising from aligning the customers’ existing products with the Group’s products and its fit with existing operations. 
Provisional goodwill has been allocated to the Consumer Cash Generating Unit (CGU).
blinkbox acquisition
On 7 January 2015, the Group acquired 100% of the issued and voting share capital of blinkbox from Tesco Holdings Limited. The acquisition 
is complementary to the Group’s existing business model. blinkbox provides movies and TV series online for customers to stream or download 
on demand.

Fair value adjustments relate principally to:
 ƥ the write down of internally developed software to its fair value; and
 ƥ provisions for onerous contracts.
The book value of the current assets is expected to equal their fair value. 
The provisional goodwill of £5m relates to the future opportunities arising from the nature of the business, particularly around the knowledge of 
creating on demand TV platforms, and fit with the Group’s existing operations. The provisional goodwill has been allocated to the Consumer CGU.
All the acquisitions were carried out by in house functions therefore the impact of external adviser fees relating to the acquisition in the 
Group’s results was £nil. Other acquisition costs are set out in note 9. 
All of the goodwill generated from acquisitions is expected to be deductible for Corporation tax purposes.
In the prior year, the Group acquired the remaining 75% of the issued share capital of Future Office Communications Limited (note 22).
(ii) Disposals 
On 24 December 2014, the Group agreed to dispose of its existing off-net broadband customer base to Fleur Telecom Limited (Fleur), a member 
of Daisy Communications Group, for a contingent consideration of £8m generating a profit on disposal of £5m. The expected cost to sell 
of £3m has been included within the Group’s trade and other payable balance on the consolidated balance sheet. The consideration 
is contingent on the performance of this customer base in the period of 24 months following the network migration completion date.
The customer base was derecognised from the balance sheet at completion date, 31 March 2015.
There were no disposals in the prior year.
(iii) Asset held for sale
As at 31 March 2015, the Group agreed to sell the acquired off-net broadband base from Virgin Media and Tesco to Fleur. The transaction 
is expected to complete in the year ending 31 March 2016. These bases therefore met the definition of asset held for sale under IFRS 5 and 
has been included as part of trade and other receivables balance on the Group consolidated balance sheet (£1m). The carrying value of 
these assets was based on the selling price of the disposal transaction; therefore no gain or loss is recognised as a result of this classification.  79

14. Interest in joint ventures
Accounting policy
Interests in joint ventures are accounted for using the equity method. The Group income statement includes the Group’s share of the post-tax profits 
or losses of the joint ventures based on their financial statements for the year. 
In the Group balance sheet, the Group’s interest in joint ventures is shown as a non-current asset, representing the Group’s investment in the 
share capital of the joint ventures, as adjusted for post-acquisition changes in the Group’s share of the net assets or liabilities less provision 
for any impairment. 
In addition to the carrying amount of the investment, the Group’s interest in joint ventures includes, where applicable, any long term interests 
in the venture that, in substance, form part of the Group’s net investment in the joint venture. An item for which settlement is neither planned 
nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future is, in substance, an extension of the Group’s interest in that joint venture. 
Any loans advanced to a joint venture that, in substance, do not form part of the Group’s net investment are shown separately in the balance 
sheet, as a receivable to the Group. Losses recognised using the equity method in excess of the Group’s investment in ordinary shares are applied 
to the other components of the Group’s interest in the joint venture in the reverse order of their seniority (i.e. priority in liquidation).
YouView TV Limited (‘YouView’)
The Group holds 14.3% (2014: 14.3%) of the ordinary share capital of YouView, a joint venture with The British Broadcasting Corporation, ITV Broadcasting 
Limited, British Telecom PLC (BT), Channel Four Television Corporation, Arqiva Limited and Channel 5 Broadcasting Limited. The joint venture 
was set up in order to develop a free-to-air internet-connected TV service to UK homes. During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group signed 
a new agreement with the other existing holders of YouView whereby all seven original partners (together ‘Tier 1’ funders) continue to contribute 
approximately £1m per annum to basic operational and technology costs of YouView, and the Group together with BT as ‘Tier 2’ funders, 
contribute up to a further £10m per annum for additional development of the technology to support their TV propositions. The Group’s total 
contribution to YouView in the year ended 31 March 2015 was £8m (2014: £5m).
There was no change in the overall control of the joint venture as a result of these changes as all seven partners share overall control. 
Under this agreement, the Group’s share of losses comprises one-seventh of any Tier 1 loss and half of any Tier 2 loss. During the year 
ended 31 March 2015, the Group recognised £8m share of losses (2014: £7m).
The Group has reviewed the carrying value of YouView and has concluded that there is no indication of impairment. 
Bolt Pro Tem Limited 
The Group holds 33% of the ordinary shares capital of Bolt Pro Tem Limited (‘BPT’), a joint venture with British Sky Broadcasting Limited (‘BSkyB’) 
and City Fibre Holdings Limited. The joint venture was set up in FY15 to deliver fibre to the premise (‘FTTP’) broadband services in the City of York. 
The Group has committed to contribute £5m over the three-year period to 31 March 2017. In FY15, the joint venture started to build a trial 
network in York. During the year ended 31 March 2015, the Group contributed £3m to the joint venture and received £nil share of losses. 
The Group has reviewed the carrying value of BPT and has concluded that there is no indication of impairment. 
Internet Matters
During the year ended 31 March 2014, the Group, alongside BSkyB, BT and Virgin Media established an equal membership joint venture, 
Internet Matters Limited. It is a not-for-profit company, set up as an industry-led body to promote and educate parents about internet 
safety for children. The Group is committed to contribute £2m over the period to 31 March 2017.

Accounting policy
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, valued on a FIFO basis, and consists primarily of set top boxes, handsets 
and routers. Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price, less costs expected to be incurred. A provision is made for obsolete items 
where appropriate.

Details of the current and non-current borrowing facilities of the Group for the year are set out below.
Bank overdrafts
Overdraft facilities are used to assist in short term cash management; these uncommitted facilities bear interest at a margin over the Bank of England 
base rate.
$185m US Private Placement (USPP) Notes
In July 2014 the Group issued $185m of USPP notes maturing in 3 tranches ($139m 2021, $25m 2024, $21m 2026). The interest rate payable 
on the notes is at a margin over US treasury rate for the appropriate period. The USPP proceeds were swapped to £109m (£82m 2021, £15m 2024, 
£12m 2026) and the net debt includes retranslation of the USPP funds at the rates achieved where hedged by cross currency swaps.
£560m revolving credit facility (RCF) and £50m bilateral agreement
The Group has a £560m RCF, which matures in July 2019. The interest rate payable in respect of drawings under this facility is at a margin 
over LIBOR and for the appropriate period. The actual margin applicable to any drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA calculated 
in respect of the most recent accounting period. In addition to the RCF, the Group also has a £50m bilateral agreement which matures in 
July 2019. 
£100m term loan
The Group has a committed term loan of £100m (2014: £75m), with a final maturity date of July 2019. This loan amortises over the term 
with repayments due of £25m in January 2017, £25m in January 2018 and the remainder in July 2019. The interest rate payable in respect 
of drawings under this facility is at a margin over LIBOR for the relevant currency and for the appropriate period. The actual margin applicable 
to any drawing depends on the ratio of net debt to EBITDA calculated in respect of the most recent accounting period.
The Group’s facilities total £819m (excluding the translation impact). The financial covenants included in each facility are identical; they 
restrict the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and require minimum levels of interest cover.
The Group was in compliance with its covenants throughout the current and prior year.

The Group had undrawn committed borrowing facilities at the end of the year, in respect of which all conditions precedent had been met, as follows:

(173) (196)
*   Derivative financial instruments are included with other receivables in note 16.
** Deferred income has been included within the financial liabilities above so as to give completeness over the Group’s contractual commitments on future cash outflows.
(a) Financial instruments
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including market risk (such as currency risk and interest rate risk), credit risk and 
liquidity risk. The Group Treasury function uses certain financial instruments to mitigate potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial 
performance from these risks. These financial instruments primarily consist of bank loans and interest rate swaps. Other products, such as 
currency options, can also be used depending on the risks to be covered, but have not been used in the current or preceding financial year. 
The Group does not trade or speculate in any financial instruments.
The Group has cash flow hedges in place to (a) swap the interest rate risk on the RCF from floating to fixed and (b) swap the currency and 
interest rate risk on the USPP debt from USD to GBP and from fixed US Treasury interest rates to fixed GBP interest rates. These hedges have 
been fully effective from inception. The fair value measurement is classified as Level 2 (FY14: Level 2), derived from other observable market 
data; this means that their fair value is based upon the mark to market valuation at the balance sheet date. Fair value measurement at Level 2 
gives consideration to interest rates, yield curves and foreign exchange rates at commonly quoted intervals for relevant currencies. The Group 
has also assessed the credit risk within its financial instruments. The fair value of these instruments at 31 March 2015 is £11m (2014: £nil). A loss 
of £5m (2014: gain of £3m) has been recognised in other comprehensive income in the year ended 31 March 2015. As the hedges were fully 
effective there has been no income statement impact. 
(b) Embedded derivatives
No contracts with embedded derivatives have been identified and accordingly no such derivatives have been accounted for separately.
(c) Foreign exchange risk
The Group uses spot and forward foreign exchange trading to hedge transactional exposures, which arise mainly through cost of sales and 
operating expenses, and are primarily denominated in Euro and US Dollar. The Group also uses cross currency swaps to hedge its US Dollar 
denominated borrowings (US Private Placement). At 31 March 2015 the adjustment to translate our net debt to Sterling at swap rates to reflect 
the impact of hedging was £16m (2014: £nil). 
Borrowings and foreign exchange contracts are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange rates; this sensitivity can be analysed in comparison 
to year-end rates. There was no material impact of a 10% movement in the UK Sterling/Euro exchange rate on either the income statement or 
other equity. The effect of foreign exchange derivatives on borrowings at the year-end was as follows:

Financial statements

(d) Interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises primarily from cash, cash equivalents and borrowings, all of which are at floating rates of interest and thus 
expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk. These floating rates are linked to LIBOR and other interest rate bases as appropriate to the instrument 
and currency. Future cash flows arising from these financial instruments depend on interest rates and periods for each loan or rollover. As detailed 
in section (a), the Group has cash flow hedges in place to mitigate its interest rate risk on its borrowings. 
Cash and borrowings, as well as some foreign exchange products, are sensitive to movements in interest rates and such movements have been analysed 
in the table below by calculating the effect on the income statement and equity of one percentage point movement in the interest rate for the 
currencies in which most Group cash and borrowings are denominated. Funding to related parties has been offset against gross borrowings in 
calculating these sensitivities. This annualised analysis has been prepared on the assumption that the year-end positions prevail throughout 
the year, and therefore may not be representative of fluctuations in levels of borrowings.

(e) Liquidity risk
The Group manages its exposure to liquidity risk by regularly reviewing the long and short term cash flow projections for the business against 
facilities and other resources available to it. Headroom is assessed based on historical experience as well as by assessing current business risks, 
including foreign exchange movements. Existing bank debt facilities do not expire until July 2019, USPP debt matures in three tranches July 2021, 
2024 and 2026; it is Group policy to refinance debt maturities significantly ahead of maturity dates.
The table below analyses the Group’s financial liabilities into relevant maturity groupings. The amounts disclosed in the table are the contractual 
undiscounted cash flows assuming year-end interest rates remain constant and that borrowings are paid in full in the year of maturity.

(f) Credit risk
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is regularly monitored. Debt, investments, foreign exchange and derivative transactions are all spread 
amongst a number of banks all of which have short or long term credit ratings appropriate to the Group’s exposures. Trade receivables primarily 
comprise balances due from Consumer and TalkTalk Business fixed line customers, and provision is made for any receivables that are considered 
to be irrecoverable. 85

(g) Capital risk management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return 
to stakeholders.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, which includes the borrowings disclosed in note 18, cash and cash equivalents and equity 
attributable to equity holders of the parent, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as disclosed in notes 21 to 22.
The Group’s Board reviews the capital structure on an annual basis. As part of this review, the Board concluded that it is more appropriate to 
align its measures with the external metrics in the banking agreement. The Group uses the ratio of net debt to EBITDA and has a medium term 
ratio target below 2.0x. The ratio at 31 March 2015 is 2.4x driven primarily by the Company’s continued investment in growth combined with an 
increased dividend pay-out. The Board is confident that the ratio will return to its target in the medium term. 
The net debt to EBITDA ratio at the year-end is as follows:

20. Provisions
Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when a legal or constructive obligation exists as a result of past events and it is probable that an outflow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. Provisions are discounted where the 
time value of money is considered to be material.
Provisions are categorised as follows:
Operating efficiencies
Operating efficiencies provisions relate principally to redundancy costs and are only recognised where plans are demonstrably committed 
and where appropriate communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date. These provisions are expected 
to be utilised over the next twelve months. 
One Company integration
These provisions relate principally to reorganisation costs and are only recognised where plans are demonstrably committed and where appropriate 
communication to those affected has been undertaken at the balance sheet date. These provisions are expected to be utilised over the next 
twelve months. 
Property
Property provisions relate to dilapidations and similar property costs, and costs associated with onerous property contracts. All such provisions 
are assessed by reference to the terms and conditions of the contract and market conditions at the balance sheet date. Onerous property contracts 
are expected to be utilised over the next seven years. Dilapidation provisions are expected to be utilised as and when properties are exited. 86

Contract and other
Contract and other provisions relate mainly to customer migration costs as a result of the customer base acquisitions in the current year and 
the SIM replacement costs as part of the mobile migration programme (note 9). The remaining are provisions on onerous contracts and contracts 
with unfavourable terms arising on the acquisition of businesses and anticipated costs of unresolved legal disputes. All such provisions are 
assessed by reference to the best available information at the balance sheet date.

*    On 16 September 2013, the Group’s Remuneration Committee determined that the relevant performance conditions of the VES schemes had been satisfied, meaning the VES participants 
were entitled to exercise the remaining 40% of their options as set out in note 5. The settlement of the schemes resulted in the recognition of share premium of £66m and a £78m 
movement in retained earnings and other reserves.
**  On 14 May 2013, the Group acquired the remaining 75% of the issued share capital of FOC. The Group already held 25% of FOC and had control of the business. The cash consideration 
paid for the acquisition of £3m has been recognised as a transaction with a non-controlling interest.
Group ESOT
The Group ESOT held 33 million shares at 31 March 2015 (2014: 34 million) in the Company for the benefit of employees. The Group ESOT has 
waived its rights to receive dividends and none of its shares have been allocated to specific schemes. At the year end the shares had a market 
value of £112m (2014: £109m).
Demerger reserve
The demerger reserve primarily reflects the profits or losses arising on the transfer of investments and net assets of CPW on demerger. 
Translation reserve
The results of overseas operations are translated at the average foreign exchange rates for the year, and their balance sheets are translated at 
the rates prevailing at the balance sheet date. Exchange differences arising on the translation of opening net assets and results of overseas operations 
are recognised in the translation and hedging reserve. All other exchange differences are included in the income statement.

Report on pages 29 to 46. The remuneration of all key management personnel is disclosed in note 4.
27. Contingent liabilities 
As at 31 March 2014, the Group had received £33m in total in relation to an Ofcom determination that BT had overcharged for certain 
wholesale Ethernet services. During the year ended 31 March 2015, BT lost its appeal against Ofcom’s determination in the Competition 
Appeal Tribunal and appealed to the Court of Appeal. The decision of that appeal has not yet been made and the Group considers the 
appeal is unlikely to succeed based on the advice received and so no liability for repayment has been recorded at the year end, although 
the outcome of the appeal is not yet certain.
28. Events after the balance sheet date
On 22 April 2015, the Group acquired 100% shares of tIPicall limited, a company providing Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) services for cash 
of £5m plus an element of deferred consideration depending on the performance of the business. The Group’s investment in the company 
will be accounted for as a subsidiary in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combination’. The financial impact of the acquisition on the Group 
position is not material.

Notes to the Company financial statements
1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The separate financial statements of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared under 
the historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law. 
The financial statements have been prepared on the going concern basis. Details of the considerations undertaken by the Directors in reaching this 
conclusion are set out on page 14 within the Chief Financial Officer’s Statement.
Accounting policies
The Company’s principal accounting policies, which relate to the financial statements as a whole, are set out below. Where an accounting policy 
is specific to one note, the policy is described in the note to which it relates. 
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after deducting all of its liabilities. The accounting 
policies adopted for specific financial liabilities and equity instruments are set out below.
Loans and other borrowings 
Loans and other borrowings represent committed and uncommitted bank loans, and bank overdrafts. 
These are initially measured at fair value (which is equal to cost at inception) and are subsequently measured at amortised cost, using the effective interest 
rate method, except where they are identified as a hedged item in a fair value hedge. Any difference between the proceeds net of transaction 
costs and the settlement or redemption of borrowings is recognised over the term of the borrowing.
Bank fees and legal costs associated with the securing of external financing are capitalised and amortised over the term of the relevant facility. 
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the proceeds received, net of direct issuance costs. 
Share-based payments
The Company issues equity settled share-based payments to certain employees. Share-based payments issued by the Company to its subsidiary 
undertakings are treated as additions to investments based on the fair value of the grant, spread over the relevant vesting period, with a corresponding 
credit to reserves. Where the Company recharges the cost of share-based payments to its subsidiary undertaking the investment is reduced accordingly. 
Further details are provided in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements.
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted 
at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date where transactions 
or events that result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to pay less, tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date, with the following exception:
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that the Directors consider that it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from 
which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis with the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences reverse, 
based on tax rates and laws enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
The taxation liabilities of certain Group companies are reduced wholly or in part by the surrender of losses by fellow Group companies. 
Exemptions
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 8 ‘Related Party Disclosures’ not to provide details of related party transactions 
with other Group companies, as the Company financial statements are presented together with the consolidated financial statements. 
The Company has applied the exemption under FRS 29 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ so as not to disclose details of financial instruments 
held by the Company. Full disclosure of the Group’s financial instruments recognised under FRS 29 (IFRS 7) ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ 
and IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ is provided in note 19 to the Group’s consolidated financial statements. 92

2. Profit for the year
As permitted by Section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has elected not to present its own profit and loss account for the 
year. The Company reported a profit of £433m for the year ended 31 March 2015 (2014: £28m). This includes a dividend from a subsidiary 
of £400m (2014: £nil).
The auditor’s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in the Corporate Governance Report on page 28. 
Detailed disclosures of the Directors’ remuneration and share-based payments are given in the audited section of the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
on pages 38 to 46 and should be regarded as an integral part of this note. 
In the current and prior year, the Directors’ remuneration was borne by another Group company and not recharged.
The Company has no employees other than Directors.
3. Dividends
Accounting policy
Dividends receivable from the Company’s subsidiaries and joint venture investments are recognised only when they are approved or paid by shareholders.
Final dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are recognised as a liability in the financial statements in the period in which they 
are approved by the Company’s shareholders. Interim dividends are recognised in the period in which they are paid.

(approximately £85m) was approved by the Board on 13 May 2015 and has not been included as a liability as at 31 March 2015.
The Group ESOT has waived its rights to receive dividends in the current and prior year and this is reflected in the analysis above. 
4. Investments
Accounting policy
Investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures are recorded at cost, being the fair value of consideration, acquisition charges associated 
with the investment and capital contributions by way of share-based payments, less any provision for impairment.

satisfied, meaning the VES participants were entitled to exercise the remaining 40% of their options as set out in note 5 to the consolidated financial statements. The settlement of the 
scheme resulted in a net increase of £83m in investments (note 4), the recognition of share premium of £66m and a decrease in the net cost of share-based payments previously 
recognised in reserves of £2m.

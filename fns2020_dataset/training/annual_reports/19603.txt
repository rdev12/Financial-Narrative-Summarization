SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com 
> > < Smith & Nephew’s transformation  
is delivering stronger growth.
A strong performance, demonstrating our  
actions are translating into positive outcomes
Dear Shareholder ,
I am delighted to present Smith & 
Nephew’s 2015 Annual Report. During 
the year the Group made good financial 
and strategic progress. The increase 
in underlying revenue growth, trading 
profit margin and adjusted earnings 
year-on-year reflect management’s 
actions to improve both our commercial 
performance and operational efficiency.
Revenue was $4.6 billion, up 4% on an 
underlying basis before adjusting for currency 
and the benefits from acquisitions. Trading 
profit was $1.1 billion. The trading profit margin 
was 23.7%, up 80bps on the previous year . 
Adjusted earnings per share were 85.1¢, 
up 2%.
The Board is proposing a final dividend for the 
year of 19.0¢ per share, giving a total dividend 
distribution for 2015 of 30.8¢, up 4% year-on-
year and slightly ahead of earnings growth, 
reflecting our confidence in the business.
Strategy
We have continued to pursue the same 
strategy as in previous years, building a strong 
position in Established Markets, focusing 
on Emerging Markets, innovating for value, 
simplifying and improving our operating model 
and supplementing organic growth with 
acquisitions. The Board’s oversight ensures 
that management remains focused on these 
strategic priorities and that investments are 
made in line with these objectives
In 2015, the Board has continued our 
programme of understanding the business 
more deeply. We scheduled a number of 
sessions at the Board meetings held in 2015 
looking at different aspects of our business, 
including reviews of our European business 
with a focus on Iberia, our Emerging Markets 
business with a focus on China, and the 
development of products for the mid-tier . Our 
Board site visit to Durban, South Africa gave 
us insights into one of our oldest and fastest 
growing overseas businesses.
Our annual Strategy Review in September 
included presentations and discussions on a 
wide range of different areas of our business. 
This meeting underpins our confidence 
in management’s strategic priorities and 
future progress.
Members of the Board also attend significant 
management meetings. For instance, during 
2015, I attended the Managing Director’s 
meeting and Robin Freestone attended the 
CEO led meeting for top talent. We also attend 
investor presentations.
Corporate governance
As a Board, we feel strongly that good 
corporate governance lies at the heart of a well-
run Company. Openness and transparency, 
accountability and responsibility should run 
through everything that we do, both as a Board 
and throughout the business as a whole. The 
Board and I aim to set the tone at the top which 
pervades throughout the organisation.
Later in this report, as well as the standard 
corporate governance disclosures we are 
required to make, you will find reports from Ian 
Barlow, Michael Friedman, myself and Joseph 
Papa, the Chairmen of our Board Committees 
on the activities of these committees 
throughout the year (pages 68 to 79). These 
reports explain where we focused our work in 
2015 and our plans for 2016. 
Risk management and  
the Viability Statement
During 2015, we spent time considering what 
work would need to be done to make us 
feel comfortable in making the new Viability 
Statement. Both the Board and the Audit 
Committee received papers from the Group 
Risk Officer during the year and we discussed 
risk in depth at our Annual Strategy Meeting 
in September .

Board succession planning
We continued the work we started in 2014 in 
refreshing the Board following the retirement 
of some longer-serving directors. Vinita Bali 
joined the Board at the end of 2014. She was 
followed by Erik Engstrom in January 2015 and 
Robin Freestone in September 2015. After the 
changes to Board composition made over the 
past two years, we are confident that we now 
have a Board with the appropriate balance of 
skills, experience and diversity to lead Smith & 
Nephew through the next stage of our history.
Olivier Bohuon
In February we announced that our Chief 
Executive Officer, Olivier Bohuon, had been 
diagnosed with a highly treatable form of 
cancer . Olivier will remain Chief Executive 
Officer and be actively involved in running 
the Company through much of his treatment 
period, which is expected to be completed 
by late autumn. The Board has approved 
provisional governance procedures to ensure 
the effective operation of Smith & Nephew 
during the treatment period, and I will provide 
executive oversight if required.
Sir John Buchanan
It is with great sadness that we learnt of the 
passing of our former Chairman of the Board, 
Sir John Buchanan, during the year . Sir John 
was a wise, distinguished and respected 
colleague who served Smith & Nephew and 
many other companies with great distinction. 
His legacy of integrity, strong values and high 
standards will live on here at Smith & Nephew.
Thank you for placing your trust in us as a Board 
by holding shares in Smith & Nephew. The 
Board takes our responsibilities very seriously 
and look forward to continuing to govern the 
Company in 2016 and returning good results for 
you, our shareholders.
Yours sincerely,
Roberto Quarta
Chairman

CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 2015 was a good year
Dear Shareholder ,
Smith & Nephew delivered an improved 
performance in 2015 through focused 
innovation, better commercial execution 
and greater efficiency. We began to reap 
the benefits of our investments and 
operational improvements across the 
Group as we continued to deliver against 
our strategic priorities.
A stronger commercial 
performance
Geographically, we drove growth in all of our 
regions in 2015. In our Established Markets we 
delivered 5% growth in the United States, our 
largest market, a significant improvement on 
the previous year . We successfully stabilised 
our European business which delivered a 
better outturn year-on-year , and our Australia, 
New Zealand and Japan region delivered 
good growth, led by the Advanced Wound 
Management businesses.
In the Emerging Markets we delivered 11% 
revenue growth in 2015 despite the slow-down 
in China. Whilst we expect growth in China 
to remain below previous levels in the near 
term, it remains a very attractive market and 
we are committed to building our business 
here. We continued to successfully deliver 
strong revenue growth across the rest of the 
Emerging Markets. 
Global franchise highlights in 2015 included the 
performance of Sports Medicine, which was 
strengthened by the ArthroCare acquisition. 
The Advanced Wound Management 
businesses delivered a significantly better 
outcome following new management initiatives. 
Orthopaedic Reconstruction grew ahead of the 
market driven by our Knee Implant franchise. 
These strong results demonstrate the 
anticipated positive effects of our actions 
coming through across the Group. Where  
we have invested to improve existing 
businesses we are beginning to reap 
the benefits.

OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS
 
SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com 
> > < We are further strengthening our commercial 
platform by aligning under a newly created role 
of Chief Commercial Officer tasked with driving 
commercial excellence across the organisation 
globally. We are also bringing all of our US 
Orthopaedic Reconstruction, Sports Medicine, 
Trauma and Advanced Wound Management 
businesses under one leader , completing 
the roll-out of our ‘single managing director’ 
model globally.
Focused on innovation 
We continue to innovate for value. Through our 
Research and Development (‘R&D’) strategy 
we deliver pioneering products and services, 
and drive innovation across the markets we 
serve. In 2015, we reiterated our commitment to 
innovation by announcing a single global R&D 
organisation, to be led by a new President of 
Global R&D, reporting to me.
We launched many new products in 2015 
and made good progress with our innovative 
business models, including Syncera
◊
, our value 
solution for orthopaedic reconstruction. We 
have a strong new product line-up for this year . 
With increased focus on R&D we will apply 
more resource to the development of disruptive 
products and services that increasingly define 
Smith & Nephew and will help drive our 
success in the future.
Successful acquisition track record
Smith & Nephew has established a successful 
acquisition track record in recent years. 
With Healthpoint Biotherapeutics, acquired 
in 2012, our third year return on capital has 
exceeded our weighted average cost of capital, 
despite certain issues we had to address 
with regard to facilities acquired. ArthroCare, 
acquired in 2014, is performing in-line with our 
expectations and we are ahead of our plan to 
deliver $85 million of synergies by 2017 .
In 2015, we continued to invest in acquisitions 
that provide opportunities to supplement our 
organic growth, strengthening our technology 
and product portfolios and our Emerging 
Markets business. Blue Belt Technologies, 
announced in October 2015, has given us 
a leading position in the fast-growing area 
of robotics-assisted orthopaedic surgery. In 
Russia we acquired a trauma and orthopaedics 
distribution business that includes mid-tier 
manufacturing. In Colombia, one of the largest 
economies in Latin America, we acquired our 
distributor for orthopaedic reconstruction, 
trauma and sports medicine products. 
Proud of our heritage
Smith & Nephew is 160 years old. From our 
roots in Hull, UK, we have become a global 
business that is proud to support healthcare 
professionals in their daily efforts to improve 
their patients’ lives in more than 100 countries.
Our longevity is due in large part to the 
excellence of our employees. As I visit our sites 
and meet our teams I am constantly impressed 
by their integrity and dedication to our core 
values of innovation, trust and performance. 
I thank them all for their work. I know we 
were all proud when our commitments to 
act sustainably and responsibly were again 
recognised by the FTSE4Good and Dow Jones 
Sustainability indices.
Excited by our prospects 
Whilst we are pleased with our progress in 
2015, it was just one step on our journey. I am 
confident that we will continue to build an ever 
more successful company, a medical device 
company that is truly like no other . 
Yours sincerely,
Olivier Bohuon

Re-invigorating Smith & Nephew
Dear Shareholder ,
Group revenue in 2015 was 
$4,634 million (2014 – $4,617 million), 
an increase of 4% on an underlying basis 
and flat on a reported basis. Foreign 
exchange movements reduced revenue 
by 8% partially offset by acquisitions, 
which added 4% to the reported 
growth rate.
Revenue growth was 5% in the US, 1% across 
our Other Established Markets and 11% in the 
Emerging Markets. 
Trading profit was $1,099 million (2014 – 
$1,055 million). The trading profit margin was 
23.7% (2014 – 22.9%), up 80bps, reflecting 
the benefits from the Group Optimisation 
programme and synergies from the 
ArthroCare acquisition.
Reported operating profit of $628 million 
(2014 – $749 million) is after integration and 
acquisition costs, as well as restructuring 
and rationalisation costs, amortisation and 
impairment of acquired intangibles and legal 
and other items incurred in the full year . 
The 2015 operating profit was lowered by a 
$203 million accounting charge relating to a 
legal settlement and provision explained below.
The tax rate for the full year is 26.8% on trading 
results (2014 – 27 .7%), a 90bps reduction 
year-on-year . We expect the tax rate on trading 
results to be 26.5% or slightly lower for 2016, 
barring any changes to tax legislation. 
Adjusted earnings per share was 85.1¢ (170.2¢ 
per American Depositary Share (‘ADS’)) 
compared to 83.2¢ last year, up 2%, which 
would have been up 9% at constant exchange 
rates. Basic earnings per share was 45.9¢  
(91.8¢ per ADS) (2014 – 56.1¢), primarily 
in recognition of the metal-on-metal 
accounting charge.
Trading cash flow was $936 million in the year. 
The trading profit to cash conversion ratio was 
85% (2014 – 74%), a year-on-year improvement 
in working capital management.
Net debt was $1,361 million, down from 
$1,613 million at the end of Q4 2014. This 
represents a reported net debt/EBITDA ratio of 
1.0x. The Blue Belt acquisition was completed 
after the year end for $279 million.
Striving to achieve ever greater  
efficiencies is an important element  
of Smith & Nephew’s strategy. 
It liberates resources for investment, 
and benefits our margin.

OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS
 
SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com 
> > < Legal settlement and provision
During the fourth quarter of 2015, 
Smith & Nephew settled the majority of US 
metal-on-metal hip claims, without admitting 
liability with the net cash cost after insurance 
recoveries being $25 million. These claims 
principally related to Smith & Nephew’s 
portfolio of modular metal-on-metal hip 
products (such as the R3 metal liner), which 
are no longer on the market. 
We have taken an accounting charge of 
$203 million to cover both this net cost and 
also the present value of the estimated costs to 
resolve all other known and anticipated claims 
over the coming years. This amount does not 
include associated legal fees or any possible 
insurance recovery on these other claims as 
such recoveries cannot be recognised for 
accounting purposes until virtually certain. The 
Group carries considerable product liability 
insurance and we will continue to defend 
claims vigorously. The estimate is based on 
an actuarial model with assumptions relating 
to the number of claims and outcomes, and is 
subject to revision as circumstances evolve. 
Capital returns
The efficient use of capital on behalf of 
shareholders is important to Smith & Nephew. 
The Board believes in maintaining an efficient, 
but prudent, capital structure, while retaining 
the flexibility to make value enhancing 
acquisitions. This approach is set out in our 
Capital Allocation Framework which we used 
to prioritise the use of cash and ensure an 
appropriate capital structure. 
Our commitment, in order of priority, is to: 
1.  continue to invest in the business to drive 
organic growth; 
2.  maintain our progressive dividend policy; 
3.  realise acquisitions in-line with strategy; and 
4.  return any excess capital to shareholders. 
This is underpinned by maintaining leverage 
ratios commensurate with solid investment 
grade credit metrics. 
Enhancing Group efficiency 
We continue to simplify and improve our 
operating model, becoming more efficient in 
2015. Our programme to realise more than 
$120 million of annual savings is progressing 
ahead of plan, and had delivered $100 million 
of annualised benefits at year end. The 
suspension of the Medical Device Excise Tax 
will present us with opportunities to accelerate 
investment in our quality and regulatory 
systems and health economics teams, 
particularly in support of the US market. 
Acquisitions
We completed the acquisition of ArthroCare 
on 29 May 2014, further strengthening our 
Sports Medicine franchises. This business is 
performing in-line with our expectations. We 
are ahead of our plan to deliver $85 million 
of synergies by 2017 and have achieved 
almost all our targeted cost savings. Revenue 
synergies will continue to be delivered over the 
coming years.
Just after the year end, on 4 January 2016, 
we acquired Blue Belt Technologies for 
$279 million, giving us a leading position in 
the fast-growing area of orthopaedic robotics-
assisted surgery. We expect strong revenue 
growth from Blue Belt Technologies. Investment 
in the combined R&D programmes and 
supportive clinical evidence will dilute Group 
trading profit margin by around 60bps in 
2016, with the BlueBelt Technologies business 
becoming profitable in 2018. 
Outlook
In 2016, we expect to deliver continued good 
underlying revenue growth as we benefit 
from our investments in existing businesses, 
acquisitions and pioneering technologies.
We would have expected our trading profit 
margin to reach or exceed 24% in 2016, 
including the 60bps dilution from investing in 
the Blue Belt Technologies product pipeline. 
However , our margin will be reduced by a 
significant –120bps transactional currency 
headwind based on current exchange rates, 
as highlighted in our Q3 results.
We have a clear strategy that is re-invigorating 
Smith & Nephew and I am confident that we 
will continue to execute successfully in 2016 
and beyond. 
Yours sincerely,
Julie Brown

OUR BUSINESS MODEL BUILD A STRONG POSITION 
IN ESTABLISHED MARKETS
Established Markets for Smith & Nephew 
are Australia, Canada, Europe, Japan, 
New Zealand and the US.
Geographically, we delivered 5% growth 
in the United States, our largest market, a 
significant improvement on the previous 
year. We successfully stabilised our 
European business, which delivered a 
better outcome year-on-year, and our 
Australia, New Zealand and Japan region 
delivered good growth, led by the Advanced 
Wound Management businesses. 
Global franchise highlights included good 
performances from Sports Medicine, 
strengthened by the ArthroCare acquisition; 
the Advanced Wound Management 
businesses, following new management 
initiatives; and Orthopaedic Reconstruction, 
which grew ahead of the market driven by 
our Knee Implant franchise. 
We are further strengthening our 
commercial platform by aligning under a 
newly created role of Chief Commercial 
Officer, tasked with driving commercial 
excellence across the organisation. We 
are also bringing all of our US Orthopaedic 
Reconstruction, Sports Medicine, Trauma 
and Advanced Wound Management 
franchises under one leader, completing 
the roll-out of our single managing director 
model globally. 
FOCUS ON EMERGING MARKETS 
Our Emerging Markets represent those 
outside of the Established Markets, 
including the BRIC group of Brazil, Russia, 
India and China. These countries now 
represent 15% of Smith & Nephew’s 
revenue, up from 8% in 2010, reflecting our 
continuing effort to rebalance our business 
and build share in higher growth markets. 
The overall percentage of Group revenue in 
2015 compared to 2014 has been impacted 
by the strengthening of the US dollar.
In the Emerging Markets we delivered 
11% revenue growth in 2015 despite the 
significant slow-down in China. Whilst 
we expect growth in China to remain 
below previous levels in the near-term, it 
remains a very attractive market and we are 
committed to building our business there.
We continued to deliver strong revenue 
growth across the rest of the Emerging 
Markets, led by South Africa, India and the 
Middle East. Excluding China, Emerging 
Markets growth would have been in-line 
with the trend of the last five years.
We enhanced our commercial footprint 
and product portfolio. In Russia we 
acquired a trauma and orthopaedics 
distribution business that includes mid-tier 
manufacturing. In Colombia, one of the 
largest economies in Latin America, we 
acquired our distributor for orthopaedic 
reconstruction, trauma and sports 
medicine products.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com 
> > < INNOVATE FOR VALUE 
We continued to innovate for value in 2015. 
Through our Research and Development 
(‘R&D’) strategy we deliver pioneering 
products and services, and drive innovation 
across the markets we serve. Products 
such as the JOURNEY
◊
 II Total Knee System 
and our VERILAST
◊
 bearing surface provide 
our customers with unique features and 
successfully differentiate Smith & Nephew.
We launched many new products in 2015 
and have a strong new product line-up  
for 2016 as the result of our internal 
programmes and recent acquisitions. 
We also made good progress with our 
innovative business models, including 
Syncera, our value solution for orthopaedic 
reconstruction. This completed its US pilot, 
and we now have a number of trained 
and fully operational customer sites. We 
are encouraged by the reception from 
healthcare providers. 
The total investment in R&D in the year 
was reduced when we stopped the 
phase 3 programme for HP802-247 
(announced 2014).
In 2015, we reiterated our commitment to 
innovation by announcing a single global 
R&D organisation to be led by a new 
President of Global R&D. With increased 
focus on R&D we will apply more resource 
to the development of disruptive products 
and services that increasingly define Smith 
& Nephew and will help drive our success 
in the future.
SIMPLIFY AND IMPROVE  
OUR OPERATING MODEL
During 2014, we launched a Group 
Optimisation programme to target 
$120 million of efficiencies. We identified 
four main areas of activity:
1) Examining our supporting functions such 
as Finance, HR, IT and Legal to ensure 
that we are operating most effectively to 
support business growth.
2) Driving procurement savings to get the 
most value from the money we spend.
3) Optimising our footprint to ensure 
it matches our strategy and 
future aspirations.
4) Further simplifying our operating model, 
including aligning our management 
structure so that we can make decisions 
more quickly and effectively. 
We have made significant progress 
delivering this programme, and at the end 
of 2015 were ahead of plan, having realised 
$100 million of annualised benefits. 
We continue to look at opportunities 
to improve efficiency, creating global 
commercial and R&D organisations and 
implementing our single managing director 
model in the US at the start of 2016. The 
suspension of the Medical Device Excise 
Tax will present us with opportunities to 
accelerate investment in our quality and 
regulatory systems and health economics 
teams, particularly in support of the 
US market. 
SUPPLEMENT ORGANIC  
GROWTH WITH ACQUISITIONS
Smith & Nephew has established a 
successful acquisition track record in 
recent years. Our two largest acquisitions 
are performing strongly. With Healthpoint 
Biotherapeutics, acquired in 2012 for 
$782 million, our third year return on capital 
has exceeded our plan and also our 
weighted average cost of capital, despite 
certain issues we had to address with 
regard to facilities acquired. ArthroCare, 
acquired in 2014 for $1.5 billion, is 
performing in-line with our expectations 
in-line with our expectations. We are 
ahead of our plan to deliver $85 million 
of synergies by 2017 and have achieved 
almost all our targeted cost savings.
In 2015, we continued to invest in 
acquisitions that provide opportunities 
to supplement our organic growth, 
strengthening our technology and 
product portfolios and our Emerging 
Markets business. Blue Belt Technologies 
announced in October 2015, has given us a 
leading position in the fast growing area of 
robotics-assisted orthopaedic surgery. Its 
NAVIO
◊
 surgical system provides robotics-
assistance in partial knee replacement 
surgery and we intend to expand it into 
total knee, bi-cruciate retaining knee and 
revision knee implants, potentially delivering 
significant further upside. 
We also completed the acquisition of the 
ZUK
◊
 partial knee system in the US market 
during the year. This has given us access 
to many new customers and is highly 
complementary to Blue Belt Technologies.

OUR KPIS Our marketplace is driven by longer-term trends
Ageing populations are placing  
greater burdens on healthcare  
systems as chronic diseases  
become more prevalent.
It is expected that by 2050, the number of 
people aged 60 or over will total 2 billion. 
However, although we are living longer, we are 
not necessarily as healthy. In 2014, the World 
Health Organisation (‘WHO’) estimated that 
more than 1.9 billion adults were overweight. 
Of these, over 600 million were classified as 
obese. Overweight and obesity are the major 
risk factors for diseases such as diabetes and 
musculoskeletal disorders. 
Additionally, WHO estimates that by 2020, 
people aged 60 years and older around the 
world will outnumber children younger than five 
years. This changing dynamic will decrease the 
level of funds available for healthcare raised 
through taxes.
Therefore, governments and healthcare 
providers are under pressure to look for ways 
to reduce their overall healthcare expenditure, 
while at the same time maintaining the quality 
of care and treatment provided.
Customers 
We market our products largely to 
healthcare providers. 
In certain parts of the world, including the 
UK, much of Continental Europe, Canada 
and Japan, healthcare providers are often 
government organisations funded by tax 
revenues. In the US, our major customers are 
public and private hospitals, which receive 
revenue from private health insurance and 
government reimbursement programmes. 
Medicare is the major source of reimbursement 
in the US for knee and hip reconstruction 
procedures and for wound treatment regimes. 
In the Emerging Markets, demand is driven by 
self-pay patients. 
New commercial purchasing models are being 
adopted by health systems as a solution to 
improving resource allocation. There is a shift 
towards ‘payment for performance’ schemes, 
where financial incentives are provided to 
healthcare administrators as well as surgeons 
to increase better health outcomes and reduce 
the overall cost of delivery. Healthcare providers 
are implementing incentives for reduced 
hospital stay or preventing readmissions.
However, product innovation remains of vital 
importance with increasing focus on products 
which simplify and increase the efficiency of 
procedures as well as robotics which increase 
precision and enhance procedure outcomes. 
With this increased focus on health outcomes, 
governments are beginning to impose 
penalties on healthcare facilities holding them 
accountable for acute patient re-admissions or 
for infections acquired within the health system.
Pricing pressures also remain pertinent. In 
many cases, highly regulated markets employ 
various controls on pricing. 
Pricing of products is largely influenced in 
most developed markets by governmental 
reimbursement programmes. Initiatives 
sponsored by government agencies, legislative 
bodies and the private sector to limit the growth 
of healthcare costs are ongoing and include 
price regulation, excise taxes and competitive 
pricing. Governments and healthcare providers 
are increasingly requesting health economic 
data to justify the pricing of products and 
procedures or reimbursement requests. More 
collaboration between industry and data 
research institutions is emerging as a result.
Regulatory standards 
and compliance in the 
healthcare industry
Alongside healthcare provision and payment 
becoming more complex, the regulation of the 
medical device industry is also intensifying. 
Regulatory requirements are important in 
determining whether substances and materials 
can be developed into effective products in an 
environmentally sustainable way.
National regulatory authorities administer 
and enforce a complex series of laws 
and regulations that govern the design, 
development, approval, manufacture, 
labelling, marketing and sale of healthcare 
products. They also review data supporting 
the safety and efficacy of such products. Of 
particular importance is the requirement in 
many countries that products be authorised 
or registered prior to the placement on market 
and that such authorisation or registration 
be subsequently maintained. The industry 
is focusing its resources on meeting the 
increased regulatory pressure around 
the world.
 
Global medical 
device market grew 
+3%
 
A strong US 
Dollar is making 
American devices 
more expensive to 
overseas buyers.
 
The US 
accounts for 43% 
of the global medical 
device market.

OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS
 
SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com 
> > < The major regulatory agencies for Smith & 
Nephew’s products include the Food and Drug 
Administration (‘FDA’) in the US, the Medicines 
and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency 
in the UK, the Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare in Japan, the China Food and Drug 
Administration and the Australian Therapeutic 
Goods Administration.
In general, with the aforementioned industry 
trends, safety standards and regulations in 
the medical device industry are becoming 
more stringent. Regulatory agencies are 
intensifying audits of manufacturing facilities 
and the approval time for new products has 
lengthened. Legislation covering corruption 
and bribery such as the UK Bribery Act and the 
US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act also apply to 
all our global operations. We are committed to 
ensuring a high level of regulatory compliance 
and to doing business with integrity and we 
welcome the trend towards higher standards 
in the healthcare industry. We and other 
companies in the industry are subject to regular 
inspections and audits by regulatory agencies 
and notified bodies, and in some cases, 
remediation activities have required and will 
continue to require significant financial and 
resource investment. See ‘Legal proceedings’ 
on page 147 .
Seasonality
Orthopaedic and sports medicine procedures 
tend to be higher in the winter months when 
accidents and sports related injuries are 
highest. Conversely, elective procedures tend 
to slow down in the summer months due to 
holidays. Due to the nature of our product 
range, there is little seasonal impact on our 
advanced wound management franchises.
Competitors
We compete against both local and 
multinational corporations in the global medical 
devices market, including some with greater 
financial, marketing and other resources.

The products we take to market
Smith & Nephew has nine global 
product franchises.
Knee implants
Smith & Nephew offers an innovative 
range of products for specialised 
knee replacement procedures. Knee 
replacement surgery involves replacing 
the worn, damaged or diseased portion of 
a knee with an artificial joint. It is a routine 
operation for knee pain most commonly 
caused by arthritis. Every year more than 
two million patients receive total, partial or 
revision knee replacements.
Smith & Nephew’s knee systems include 
the LEGION
◊
/GENESIS
◊
 II Total Knee System, 
a comprehensive system designed to allow 
surgeons to address a wide range of knee 
procedures from primary to revision and our 
JOURNEY II Family of Active Knees. JOURNEY 
II has been engineered to empower patients 
with a renewed active lifestyle by breaking 
through traditional knee replacement barriers 
and delivering function, motion and durability 
through PHYSIOLOGICAL MATCHING
TM
. 
These systems also feature VERILAST 
Technology, our advanced bearing surface. 
The LEGION Primary Knee with VERILAST 
Technology has been laboratory-tested to 
30 years of simulated wear. 
Our knee systems also utilise our VISIONAIRE
◊
 
Patient-Matched Instrumentation. With 
VISIONAIRE Instrumentation, a patient’s MRI 
and X-rays are used to create customised 
cutting guides that allow the surgeon to achieve 
optimal mechanical axis alignment of the 
new implant. VISIONAIRE cutting guides also 
help to save time by reducing the number of 
procedural steps and instruments used in the 
operating room.
Our Knee Implant franchise delivered a strong 
performance in 2015. We grew revenue by 5% 
globally. In the US, our largest market, revenue 
growth of 6% was driven by our JOURNEY II 
Total Knee System and the benefits of a US 
marketing campaign for VERILAST Technology, 
featuring both hips and knees.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < During 2015, we acquired the Zimmer
®
 
Unicompartmental High Flex Knee (‘ZUK’) 
system in the US market. ZUK is a clinically 
proven uni knee replacement introduced 
globally in 2004, and expands our access 
to the attractive area of partial knee 
joint reconstruction. 
In early 2016 we completed the acquisition 
of Blue Belt Technologies, securing a 
leading position in the fast-growing area of 
orthopaedic robotics assisted surgery. Blue 
Belt Technologies’ Navio
®
 surgical system 
provides robotics assistance in partial knee 
replacement surgery. 
For Smith & Nephew, this acquisition is 
expected to create a strong combined partial 
knee portfolio from which to accelerate our 
growth in partial knee replacement surgery. 
We anticipate significant upside from a range 
of new product launches that will expand 
into indications beyond partial knees. These 
include a total knee system, due to launch 
in 2017 , and revision knee and bi-cruciate 
retaining knee systems. 
Increased value and 
efficiency to hospitals 
and ASCs
ANTHEM GLOBAL KNEE 
The unique design of the ANTHEM
◊
 Total 
Knee System creates a knee offering fit for 
all ethnicities. Based on both intraoperative 
measurements and the analysis of CT 
images from patients. ANTHEM utilises the 
ORTHOMATCH instrumentation platform, 
reduces weight, footprint and unnecessary 
cost without compromising on quality or 
clinical outcomes. Currently in limited market 
release, ANTHEM will provide an advanced and 
globally relevant knee implant that is accessible 
to all orthopaedic surgeons and patients in 
emerging markets.
In August 2014 we announced Syncera, 
a disruptive orthopaedic supply chain 
model providing increased value and 
efficiency to hospitals and ambulatory 
surgery centres (‘ASC’) performing knee 
and hip replacement surgeries. 
Syncera offers a different channel strategy 
providing attractive economics through 
clinically proven products and cutting-edge 
technology solutions within the primary 
reconstructive hip and knee marketplace. 
Its innovative business model brings value 
solutions to the operating room (‘OR’) with 
pioneering point-of-care technology that 
links and interfaces with the entire hospital 
or ASC supply chain systems. Recently 
acquired Syncera software platforms 
improve training time for OR staff and drive 
down cost in instrument sterilisation.
By using Syncera, a hospital performing  
400 total hip and knee surgeries over 
a 3-year period, can realise estimated 
savings of $4 million.
Since launching our pilot in the United 
States, we have secured strong reference 
sites with hospital and surgeon advocates, 
now trained and fully operational with 
Syncera. These sites have purchased 
instruments and implant inventory and are 
using our software.
In August 2015 we had Syncera customers 
with potential to perform more than 3,000 
annualised Syncera procedures. Our 
progress has also given us confidence to 
move forward with our plans outside of the 
US, with pilots launched in Europe in 2015.

OUR PRODUCTS Smith & Nephew’s Hip Implant franchise 
offers a range of specialist products for 
reconstruction of the hip joint. This may 
be necessary due to conditions such as 
arthritis, causing persistent pain, and/
or as a result of hip fracture. Every year 
more than two million patients undergo 
total, resurfacing and revision hip 
replacement procedures.
For Hip Implants, Smith & Nephew has 
developed a range of primary hip systems. 
Core systems include the ANTHOLOGY
◊
 Hip 
System, SYNERGY
◊
 Hip System, the SMF
◊
 
Femoral Hip System, POLARSTEM
◊
 Femoral 
Hip System, the R3
◊
 Acetabular System and 
the POLARCUP
◊
 Dual Mobility Hip System. 
This diversity exemplifies our commitment 
to providing surgeons with implant and 
instrumentation options that meet the 
specific demands of their preferred surgical 
approach, most notably the direct anterior or 
posterolateral approach. 
Smith & Nephew’s portfolio includes the 
REDAPT Revision Femoral System. The need 
to perform a revision can occur for a variety 
of reasons including infection, dislocation, or 
failure of the implants to achieve biologic fixation. 
REDAPT turns such complex hip revisions 
into efficient, reproducible surgeries, allowing 
surgeons to effectively recreate a patient’s 
unique functionality, while quickly and easily 
addressing issues such as poor bone quality.
In 2015, we announced our decision voluntarily 
to remove from the market certain smaller sizes 
of the BIRMINGHAM HIP
◊
 Resurfacing (‘BHR’) 
System. This was a decision we made based 
on our own post-market surveillance and 
clinical follow-up. Many thousands of patients 
have benefited from BHR over the years. It 
continues to demonstrate very good clinical 
performance in male patients under 65 years 
of age and remains an important option for 
surgeons treating these patients. 
Our Hip Implants franchise revenue remained 
flat in 2015. Excluding the headwind from the 
changes to BHR, performance would have 
increased by 1%.
This year saw the launch of collared and 
valgus versions of our popular POLARSTEM 
Cementless Hip Stem System. These new stem 
options join the expanding POLARSTEM family 
of implants which has been in use clinically 
since 2002.

The OXINIUM material is a ceramicised 
metal that offers patients better 
wear-reduction and durability than 
other conventional cobalt chrome or 
ceramic implants. 
OXINIUM Technology, a point of 
differentiation for Smith & Nephew, 
combines the enhanced wear resistance 
of a ceramic bearing with the superior 
toughness of a metallic bearing. When 
combined with highly cross-linked 
polyethylene (‘XLPE’) it results in our 
proprietary VERILAST Technology. 
In Hip Implants, VERILAST Technology 
has been shown in various national joint 
replacement registries to have displayed 
best in class survivorship rates when 
compared to implants made from any 
other materials.
In Knee Implants, the LEGION Primary 
Knee with VERILAST Technology has been 
laboratory-tested to 30 years of simulated 
wear . While lab testing is not the same as 
clinical performance, the tests showed 
significant reduction in wear compared to 
conventional technologies.

The combination of Blue Belt 
T echnologies with Smith 
& Nephew’s Knee Implant 
franchise has a powerful 
rationale. It reinforces our 
distinctive orthopaedic 
reconstruction strategy , 
which combines cutting 
edge innovation, disruptive 
business models and a strong 
Emerging Markets platform to 
drive outperformance.
Shaping the future of 
surgery with robotics
In 2015, we announced the acquisition 
of Blue Belt Technologies, securing a 
leading position in the fast-growing area 
of robotics-assisted surgery. Robotics 
is expected to become increasingly 
mainstream across orthopaedic 
reconstruction in the foreseeable future. 
Blue Belt Technologies’ Navio
®
 surgical 
system provides robotics-assistance in 
unicondylar or partial knee replacement 
surgery through a unique hand-held, 
robotic bone-shaping device. Navio 
brings a high degree of implant placement 
accuracy, combined with attractive 
economics and ease of use. 
The acquisition will complement existing 
products and R&D programmes, creating 
a platform from which we can shape this 
exciting new area of surgery. It creates a 
strong combined partial knee portfolio from 
which to accelerate growth in the attractive 
area of partial knee replacement surgery, 
with further opportunities for a range of 
new products. A total knee variant is due 
to be launched in 2017 , bringing Navio to 
surgeons performing total knee procedures 
and supporting Smith & Nephew products 
such as JOURNEY II. A revision knee version 
is in the pipeline to bring this technology 
to this highly complex and fast-growing 
area currently not served by robotics. A 
bi-cruciate retaining knee programme will 
support our existing development work in 
this potential major new market. Bi-cruciate 
knee implants are technically demanding, 
and we expect they will offer patients 
more natural motion and greater stability 
by preserving the anterior and posterior 
cruciate ligaments.

COBLATION TECHNOLOGY
In 2015, COBLATION Technology made a strong 
contribution to AET’s overall performance. 
The COBLATION process involves the creation 
and application of an energy field called 
‘glow discharge plasma’ , which acts to ablate 
molecules in the tissue.
COBLATION Technology provides advantages to 
the surgeon by operating at lower temperatures 
than other RF-based technologies, and allowing 
for precise removal of soft tissue with minimal 
damage to untargeted tissue.

management portfolio, namely: silver 
and iodine. 
Our silver-based products (ACTICOAT
◊
, 
DURAFIBER
◊
 Ag and ALLEVYN Ag) continue 
to gain market share due to their overall ability 
to reduce wound infection, their rapid onset 
of action (ACTICOAT) and their ease of use. 
ACTICOAT is very well positioned to address 
urgent cases at risk for infection such as 
burns, which are highly prevalent in developing 
countries, or acute trauma. 
Our iodine based product IODOSORB
◊
 has a 
long history of accumulating clinical evidence 
for its potentially transformative role in 
combating biofilms (layers of bacteria and other 
forms of infection) which are cited as impeding 
the healing of chronic wounds in 60% of cases 
globally. Through its unique mode of action, 
IODOSORB has proven to be very effective on 
addressing the issue of biofilms.
Smith & Nephew’s Cornerstone range offers 
a wide selection of wound care products, 
which means we have one of the most

 are 
proven preventative skin care products which 
help maintain and protect skin integrity. 
The Advanced Wound Care (‘AWC’) 
franchise consists of several groups of 
brands, including exudate management, 
infection management and our 
Cornerstone range of products. As a 
whole, this franchise produced revenue 
growth of 8% in 2015. 
Exudate management products focus on 
effectively locking away wound fluid and thus 
helping to create an optimal wound healing 
environment. This will reduce the burden a 
wound has on the patient and help them to 
get on with their lives and at the same time 
diminish costs for materials and nursing time. 
Our key growth brand in this space is ALLEVYN
◊
 
Life, an innovative dressing designed to 
improve the quality of life for patients with 
chronic wounds, as well as helping healthcare 
professionals reduce the costs of frequent 
dressing changes. 
During 2015, we continued to invest in 
significant new clinical and health economic 
evidence with a number of studies being 
published demonstrating superior outcomes 
for ALLEVYN LIFE. This includes a UK study 
showing how ALLEVYN LIFE enabled a 
reduction in home care nurse visits from 
three to one per week

OUR PRODUCTS RESEARCH & DEVELOPMENT
Innovation is part of our culture and 
we invest 5% of our revenue to find 
new products that will help improve 
people’s lives.
The resources we need to deliver our products
Our Research and Development (‘R&D’) 
strategy is at the heart of our business 
model. Through it we deliver pioneering 
products and services, and drive 
innovation across the markets we serve.
In 2015, we reiterated our commitment to R&D 
by announcing a single global organisation to 
be led by a new President of Global Research 
and Development, reporting directly to the 
Chief Executive Officer. 
The new global R&D team will focus on 
delivering a broader portfolio of more 
meaningfully disruptive products and services, 
as well as a greater utilisation of digital 
technologies in medical devices. It will also 
enable better product life cycle management 
and alignment and sharing of resources across 
our franchises. 
We are already highly disciplined in project 
selection. Our R&D experts in the UK, US, 
Europe, China and India have extensive 
customer and sector knowledge, which is 
augmented by ongoing interaction with our 
marketing teams. Strict criteria are applied to 
ensure new products fulfil an unmet clinical 
need, have a strong commercial rationale, and 
are technologically feasible. The R&D function 
works closely with the manufacturing and 
supply chain management teams to ensure 
we can produce new products to clinical, cost 
and time specification. Our products undergo 
clinical and health economic assessments both 
during their development and post launch.
In 2015, we invested $222 million in R&D, 
in-line with our commitment, set out in 2011, to 
increase our investment level to around 5% of 
revenue. We expect to maintain this proportion 
going forward, but to realise greater benefit 
through our new structure. We have a strong 
new product pipeline for 2016, with many 
innovations scheduled. 
We invest in scouting for new technologies, 
identifying complementary opportunities in our 
core and adjacent segments. The acquisition 
of robotics-assisted surgical business Blue 
Belt Technologies, announced in 2015, is an 
example of this activity. 
We also invest in small companies developing 
compelling technologies in our franchise areas 
through our incubation fund. In addition to 
funding, we bring our expertise to help the 
development process, including supporting 
clinical studies, and typically secure preferred 
access to technology as it nears market 
readiness. Recent investments include exciting 
early-stage but high-potential technologies in 
sports medicine, extremities and trauma.
With increased focus on R&D, we will 
apply more resource to the development 
of disruptive products and services that 
increasingly define Smith & Nephew and 
will help drive our success in the future.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < Code of Conduct and 
Business Principles
Smith & Nephew earns trust with patients, 
customers, healthcare professionals, 
authorities and the public by acting in an 
honest and fair manner in all aspects of 
its operations. 
We expect the same from those with whom 
we do business, including distributors and 
independent agents that sell our products. 
Our Code of Conduct and Business Principles 
(‘Code’) governs the way we operate to achieve 
these objectives.
Smith & Nephew takes into account ethical, 
social, environmental, legal and financial 
considerations as part of its operating 
methods. We have a robust whistle-blowing 
system in all jurisdictions in which we operate. 
We are committed to upholding our promise 
in our Code that we will not retaliate against 
anyone who makes a report in good faith. 
New employees receive training on our Code, 
and we assign annual compliance training to 
employees. We also require our distributor and 
agents or higher-risk vendors and suppliers 
to complete training on our Code. Finally, we 
assign role-based training to targeted groups 
including people managers, distributor or 
agent relationship managers, members of our 
Finance team and selected Sales groups. 
Global compliance programme
Smith & Nephew has implemented a world-
class Global Compliance Programme that 
helps our businesses comply with laws and 
regulations. Our comprehensive compliance 
programme includes global policies and 
procedures; on-boarding and annual training 
for employees and managers; monitoring and 
auditing processes; reporting channels and 
recognition for demonstrating our values.
Through our global intranet, we provide 
resources and tools to guide employees to 
make decisions that comply both with the law 
and our Code. We conduct advance review 
and approval for significant interactions with 
healthcare professionals or government 
officials. We regularly assess existing and 
emerging risks in the countries in which 
we operate. 
Managing directors are required to complete 
an annual certification to the CEO to confirm the 
implementation of required policies. Managers 
and employees make an annual compliance 
certification and conflict of interest disclosure, 
and executive management, managers and 
employees have a compliance performance 
objective customised to their role and seniority. 
In order to reinforce our value of trust, in 
2015, we implemented a programme where 
employees nominate their peers for actions 
that earn trust. Approximately 30 ‘Spotlight on 
Trust Certificates’ were awarded to employees 
from more than 10 countries. Two employees 
received additional recognition from the CEO. 
Secondly, during our annual manager 
certification this year, managers were required 
to have an ‘ethics/compliance conversation’ 
with some of their direct reports. They were 
given centrally-created materials focusing 
on the importance of earning trust and then 
provided with specific, topic-based scenarios 
to discuss with their staff actions that would 
demonstrate this core Smith & Nephew value. 
This model enhanced dialogue on ethics, 
compliance and the importance of earning trust 
with our actions between managers and staff. 
Finally, we launched a new face-to-face training 
programme for managers in the Sales & 
Marketing functions. The key objectives of this 
workshop are to teach managers how to build 
a culture of trust within their department and 
how to identify and respond appropriately to 
compliance questions and ethical dilemmas.
New distributors and other higher risk 
third parties are subject to screening and 
are contractually obligated to comply with 
applicable laws and our Code of Conduct. 
Compliance training and certifications are 
included in this process. In 2015, we created a 
Code of Conduct module that was designed 
specifically to address the needs of our 
distributors and agents. We also introduced 
Additional Compliance Standards to provide 
greater details on Code requirements. We 
continue our oversight of independent agents 
and distributors with on-site assessments to 
review compliance controls and monitor books 
and records.

Global manufacturing  
in Hull 
Smith & Nephew was founded in 
Hull in 1856. We are very proud of our 
heritage in Hull and the site remains a 
cornerstone of Smith & Nephew. We are 
delivering new programmes and actively 
working on bringing new processes to 
Hull in order to maximise the benefits 
from our highly skilled workforce and to 
continue to create a sustainable future 
for the site. 
Since 2011, we have invested approximately 
£50 million in capital projects at our 
Hull site. This has included bringing 
the manufacturing of our complex 
silver coating technology for ACTICOAT 
to Hull and installing a Film Extrusion 
manufacturing line. The core technology 
for this manufacturing process has been 
developed in Hull and is a bespoke piece 
of equipment, specially made for the 
manufacture of our unique film for a range 
of wound dressings, including ALLEVYN 
and IV3000. 
New flood defences
In 2013, our Hull facility was badly impacted 
by highly unusual levels of flooding, with 
the site incurring damage across its entire 
ground floor, including in the manufacturing 
facility and office areas. We worked to 
ensure manufacturing for customers was 
re-established as soon as possible, and it 
was through great teamwork that the facility 
was able to recover quickly. Since then, 
we have invested £3 million into new flood 
defences to help to protect us against any 
repeat events.
Focus on development
In Hull we manufacture some of the most 
high-technology wound care products on 
the market. Over the last few years we have 
introduced pioneering products such as 
PICO, DURAFIBER and ALLEVYN Life, all of 
which are manufactured in Hull. 
Our future plans for Hull include a focus 
on the development and launch of new 
products and the operation of complex 
manufacturing processes. Work is 
underway to bring more new product 
development work to Hull.

We operate manufacturing facilities in a 
number of countries across the globe, and a 
number of central distribution facilities in key 
geographical areas. Products are shipped to 
individual country locations which hold small 
amounts of inventory locally for immediate 
supply to meet customer requirements. We 
have a defined manufacturing and facility 
footprint plan in-line with our commercial 
strategy, which is reviewed on a regular basis. 
We continue to implement improved processes 
such as ‘Lean Manufacturing’ throughout 
our factories, the global supply chain and the 
supporting operations to improve and sustain 
the levels of safety, quality, delivery, productivity 
and efficiency. We have numerous Core 
Competences including materials technology, 
precision machining, high volume and 
automated manufacturing for various products 
from our franchises.

manufactures COBLATION technology.
The majority of our wound management 
products are manufactured at our facilities in 
Hull, UK; Suzhou, China; and Curaçao.
The products manufactured at our Hull site 
cover the therapies of exudate management 
(foam products – principally ALLEVYN), burns 
treatment (ACTICOAT) and wound closure 
(OPSITE film products). In 2015, we closed our 
facility in Alberta (Canada) which provided 
specific expertise in the addition of silver 
coatings onto the ACTICOAT burns range and 
transferred the process to our Hull site. 
Manufacturing of our Advanced Wound 
Bioactive products takes place in Curaçao 
and at various third party facilities in the US.

OUR RESOURCES Procurement
We procure raw materials, components, 
finished products and packaging materials 
from suppliers in various countries. These 
purchases include metal forgings and castings 
for orthopaedic products, optical and electronic 
sub-components for sports medicine products, 
active ingredients and semi-finished goods 
for Advanced Wound Management as well as 
packaging materials across all product ranges.
Suppliers are selected, and standardised 
contracts negotiated, by a centralised 
procurement team wherever possible, with a 
view to ensuring value for money based on the 
total spend across the Group. On an ongoing 
basis, we work closely with our key suppliers to 
ensure high quality, delivery performance and 
continuity of supply.
We outsource certain parts of our 
manufacturing processes where necessary to 
obtain specialised expertise or to lower cost 
without undue risk to our intellectual property. 
Suppliers of outsourced products and services 
are selected based on their ability to deliver 
products and services to our specification, and 
adhere to and maintain an appropriate quality 
system. Our specialist teams work with and 
monitor suppliers through on-site assessments 
and performance audits to ensure the required 
levels of quality, service and delivery.
Global Supply Chain
In 2015, we further centralised and realigned 
our Global Supply Chain function. We made 
these enhancements to ensure that our 
products reach our internal and external 
customers where and when they are needed, 
in a compliant and efficient manner. Bringing 
together people, knowledge and expertise 
helps us meet our objectives and our 
customers’ expectations, driving us to become 
more competitive, responsive and integrated. 
We operate three main holding warehouses, 
one in each of Memphis (Tennessee, US), Baar 
(Switzerland) and Singapore. These facilities 
consolidate and ship to local country and 
distributor facilities.
Our distribution hubs for advanced wound 
products are located in Neunkirchen (Germany) 
and Derby (UK) for international distribution, 
Bedford (UK) for UK domestic distribution and 
Lawrenceville (Georgia, US) for US distribution.
Quality Assurance 
and Regulatory Affairs
Smith & Nephew takes a global approach 
to managing quality to ensure we have 
the same high standards everywhere we 
do business. This includes having strong 
manufacturing quality management in place 
at every Smith & Nephew location. With a 
single organisation and Quality Management 
System, manufacturing quality processes 
can be harmonised with quality controls that 
are applied consistently and to a very high 
standard across all locations. This ensures 
ever-improving product quality and a more 
stable and predictable supply chain for 
our customers. 
The same holds true for our suppliers, who 
provide a substantial part of our products. 
A single Supplier Quality Assurance (‘QA’) 
organisation is being built to harmonise 
supplier’s QA requirements across the globe, 
while instituting Scorecard-style performance 
reports to them and working with, or replacing, 
those that do not meet our quality standards.
We also take a global approach to Regulatory 
Affairs, coordinating product registration across 
our geographic markets. With the increased 
frequency of regulatory visits this global 
approach and a close working relationship with 
our Quality team are vital. The suspension of 
the Medical Device Excise Tax in the US will 
present us with opportunities to accelerate 
investment in our quality and regulatory 
systems and health economics teams, 
particularly in support of the US market.

Every year , thousands of customers attend 
our state-of-the-art training centres in the US, 
UK and China and Smith & Nephew courses 
at multiple hospitals and facilities around 
the world.
In 2015, we provided training to more than 
40,000 surgeons. Working under expert 
guidance, attendees refine techniques and 
learn new skills, to ensure the effective use 
of our products. We also support healthcare 
professionals through our online resources 
such as the Global Wound Academy, The 
Wound Institute and, for surgeons, our 
Education and Evidence website.
Training & Education
The Wider Scope  
of Arthroscopy
Every year , Smith & Nephew hosts a Sports 
Medicine fellowship meeting, ‘The Wider 
Scope of Arthroscopy’ , at its Andover , 
Massachusetts facility. The meeting unites 
promising new doctors (fellows) together 
with renowned orthopaedic surgeons to 
review, discuss and practice current and 
forward-looking surgical techniques in the 
areas of hip, knee and shoulder repair. 
The forum helps up-and-coming surgeons 
develop trust and gain the experience and 
confidence necessary to become experts 
in their field.
The curriculum focuses on the 
fundamentals of joint repair but also on 
forward-looking topics such as ‘Inventive 
Approach to AC Joint Reconstruction’ 
and ‘Alternative Management Options in 
Instability Surgery’. 
Held in mid-September 2015, The Wider 
Scope of Arthroscopy was attended by 
nearly 140 fellows and distinguished faculty, 
making it one of the largest fellowship 
meetings Smith & Nephew has ever 
held. Over the years, The Wider Scope of

> > < Our customers are the providers of 
medical and surgical treatments and 
services in over 100 countries worldwide. 
We serve our customers through our sales 
force. Our sales representatives are highly 
trained and skilled individuals. Becoming 
a sales representative requires intense 
training, including passing a strict certification 
programme, before engaging in discussions 
with, and ultimately selling products to 
customers. Depending on their area of 
specialism, representatives must be able to 
demonstrate a detailed knowledge of all the 
surgical instruments used to implant a device, 
or have specific understanding of the various 
surgical techniques a customer might use. 
Once a sales representative is certified, 
they typically spend the majority of their 
time working directly with and supporting 
customers. They help to provide in-hospital 
support to aid in the effective use of our 
implants, instruments and medical products 
and techniques. 
Our US sales forces are specialised by channel. 
They consist of a mixture of independent 
contract workers and employees. Sales 
agents are contractually prohibited from selling 
products that compete with our products. In 
most Established Markets outside of the US, 
country-specific commercial organisations 
led by the country managing director manage 
employee sales forces directly. In our Emerging 
Markets we operate through direct selling and 
marketing operations led by country managing 
directors, and/or through distributors.
The largest single customer worldwide is 
a purchasing group based in the UK that 
represented less than 5% of our worldwide 
revenue in 2015.
Increasingly, we are developing opportunities 
for sales forces to cross sell complementary 
products from other franchises. An example 
would be an orthopaedic reconstruction sales 
representative introducing a surgeon customer 
to the benefits of PICO, our single use Negative 
Pressure Wound Therapy device, in the 
prevention of post-operative infections.
Smith & Nephew utilises a variety of traditional 
and novel means to market to our customers. 
For example, congresses (educational 
conferences or trade shows) represent a 
traditional and efficient way for Smith & 
Nephew to reach a large number of healthcare 
professionals at once, often in terms of both 
advertising/promotion and education. From 
an awareness perspective, Smith & Nephew 
displays its latest, innovative products and from 
an educational standpoint, may also provide 
satellite symposia or other forms of medical 
education around these products. 
We also leverage digital media to connect with 
our customers. Our digital communications 
activities have been evolving as technologies 
and user habits evolve. Content and 
messaging is currently delivered via global 
market websites, social media channels and 
mobile applications. One core use of digital 
technology to communicate and market 
to our customers has been Education & 
Evidence, a membership-driven surgeon 
education website.
Our marketing teams also support product 
development. For instance, our Advanced 
Wound Management brand teams provide 
strategic direction to the brands from 
development to commercial execution. 
In addition, the Therapeutic Excellence team 
drives our portfolio approach across brands 
to drive our strategy to move from product to 
integrated solution.

Our annual CEO Award, open to all employees, 
recognises employees who deliver exceptional 
results in line with our core values, encouraging 
innovation and a spirit of continuous 
improvement at all levels. 
Since December 2012, more than 3,100 new 
employees have joined Smith & Nephew 
as a result of acquisitions. We attach great 
importance to the introduction of these 
new employees to Smith & Nephew, and 
work hard to achieve successful integration 
and engagement. 
Developing talent
Attracting the best talent and developing 
our employees is critical to achieving our 
business objectives. 
We are committed to working with employees 
to develop each individual’s talents, skills 
and abilities. We provide encouragement to 
learn and continuously improve. Employee 
advancement is merit-based, reflecting 
performance as well as demonstration of 
core competencies which include our values, 
with an emphasis on ethics and integrity. We 
prioritise the development and promotion of 
our existing employees whenever possible.
Each year Smith & Nephew conducts a 
comprehensive global development and 
capability review process to identify high-
potential employees and ensure they have 
robust career development plans. Employees 
are provided with opportunities to develop their 
skills and career through new assignments and 
on the job experiences.
In addition, the Board reviews succession plans 
for key executive roles and succession plans 
are in place for other critical positions across 
our business.
Retaining our people
Investing in retaining our people helps ensure 
the long-term sustainability of our business. 
We provide fair recognition and reward based  
on performance. Our performance management 
process ensures all employees set objectives 
which align to our overall business goals and 
have clear line-of-sight to how their individual 
contributions benefit the Company. Our 
performance management system assesses 
and rewards both performance and behaviour , 
in line with our Code of Conduct. All employees 
have a specific annual objective to adhere to 
the Code of Conduct and to complete training 
certifying their compliance with this Code.
Smith & Nephew offers a large number of 
wellness programmes, including annual 
wellness days, fitness support and healthy 
eating programmes. These are designed from 
a perspective that blends health and wellbeing, 
improving the lives of our employees.
Global Employee Assistance Programs (‘EAPs’) 
focus on stress and work/life issues and 
problems, providing counselling, webinars and 
web tools and other resources across many 
work/life topics. Counselling can span from 
traditional EAP counselling to financial, legal 
and everyday family assistance.
Changing the way change happens
To ensure we have organisation change 
readiness capability, we recently put in place 
a structured programme, which deploys a 
change management model and methodology. 
This is designed to focus on our employees 
during the implementation of major strategic 
initiatives in order to support our employees 
and reduce the financial and operational risks 
associated with such organisational changes.
Training is the cornerstone to this success. 
To ensure effective change throughout Smith 
& Nephew, we have trained and certified 
internal methodology masters and change 
agents. All leaders at an executive level will 
have participated in a programme specially 
designed for sponsors of change. The Change 
Awareness e-lesson for all employees was 
successfully launched in 2015, to assist them 
when working in partnership with sponsors 
and change agents. 
Employees will be consistently trained and 
coached to embed the change management 
methodology into our culture.

> > < Diversity at Smith & Nephew
We believe that diversity fuels innovation. We 
are committed to employment practices based 
on equality of opportunity, regardless of colour, 
creed, race, national origin, sex, age, marital 
status, sexual orientation or mental or physical 
disability unrelated to the ability of the person to 
perform the essential functions of the job.
Smith & Nephew has a Human Resource 
Global Standard for diversity and inclusion in 
the workplace and is committed to creating 
an inclusive environment that embraces and 
promotes diversity.
The Board and Executive Officers continue to 
recognise the importance of diversity. Three of 
our 11 Board members are female.
We recruit, employ and promote employees on 
the sole basis of the qualifications and abilities 
needed for the work to be performed. We do 
not tolerate discrimination on any grounds and 
provide equal opportunity based on merit.
We are committed to building diversity in a 
working environment where there is mutual 
trust and respect and where everyone feels 
responsible for the performance and reputation 
of our Company. 
We are committed to providing healthy and 
safe working conditions for all employees. We 
achieve this by ensuring that health and safety 
and the working environment are managed 
as an integral part of the business, and we 
recognise employee involvement as a key part 
of that process.
We do not use any form of forced, compulsory 
or child labour. We support the Universal 
Declaration of Human Rights of the United 
Nations. This means we respect the human 
rights, dignity and privacy of the individual 
and the right of employees to freedom of 
association, freedom of expression and the 
right to be heard.
Developing &  
retaining talent
The best and the brightest
We aim to bring together the sharpest 
minds in the industry. We recognise that 
to achieve this we need to create an 
environment where talented people have 
the opportunity to develop and continue to 
grow. We have an ongoing focus on keeping 
our talent and leadership pipeline filled to 
ensure it is a sustainable, self-reinforcing 
cycle, creating more opportunities 
for growth.
Talent development
Our development philosophy is based 
on the 70:20:10 Model for Learning 
and Development. This is a form of 
transformational development that engages 
people and mirrors how they learn, helping 
to create change within the individual and 
infuse change into the organisation.
We have a comprehensive global 
development and capability review process 
to identify high potential employees 
and ensure they have robust career 
development plans. Talented employees 
are provided with opportunities to develop 
their skills and career through new 
assignments and on the job experiences. 
In 2015, we ran our CEO Forum for our Top 
Talent, providing them with the opportunity 
to work closely with our executive team and 
work together on strategic challenges. We 
also launched a modular Managing Director 
programme to further enhance the skills 
and career opportunities of key individuals 
pursuing a career in this critical area.
Our performance management process 
ensures all employees set objectives which 
align to our overall business goals and have 
clear line-of-sight to how their individual 
performance management system 
assesses and rewards both performance 
and behaviour.

OUR RESOURCES We continue to embed sustainability into 
all our business operations, focusing 
our efforts on delivering affordable and 
effective products to our customers. 
We achieve this by caring for our 
employees, the society in which we 
operate and the environment around us. 
This is a summary report of our sustainability 
activities and progress in 2015. Our annual 
Sustainability Report will be published in 
April 2016.
We made some great progress on our 
sustainability journey in 2015 since we laid out 
aggressive sustainability targets in 2011. Our 
employee lost time incident frequency rate 
declined a further 49% through continued 
implementation of behaviour-based safety 
and robust incident reporting and investigation 
systems across the Group. Waste sent to 
landfill was further reduced, enabled by the 
thorough understanding of our waste streams 
delivered by the conduct of detailed waste 
audits. Sustainability considerations were 
formalised and extended in our supply chain, 
ensuring that our vendors are committed 
to achieving the same high standards of 
sustainable operation as we are. Engagement 
with the communities in which we operate 
was significantly extended through employee 
volunteering and we have strengthened 
and deepened employee wellness 
programmes with a focus on enabling healthy 
lifestyle choices.
The learnings from the 2012-2015 period 
provide an opportunity for insight to our 
sustainability journey. It is clear that we were 
successful in achieving targets in areas which 
are closely aligned to the purpose of the 
Company – health and wellbeing, diversity and 
inclusion, providing wider access to quality 
healthcare, and building trust. We have fallen 
short where we have not yet successfully built 
bridges from our targets to our values and 
strategy. We commit to fully examining these 
latter areas in 2016, developing a sustainability 
strategy which more fully reconciles our 
purpose, values and strategy to the wider 
needs of society and the environment.
In 2015, our Lost Time Incident Frequency Rate 
(‘LTIFR’) reduced by 49% to 0.20. There were 
no employee or contractor fatalities and our 
recordable injury rate also fell by 41% to 0.54. 
Compared to the previous year , total waste 
decreased by 2% but is 27% higher than in our 
baseline year, 2011. However, as we identified 
more recycling opportunities, the amount of 
waste disposed to landfill has fallen by a further 
4% over the last year , a total of 39% reduction 
since 2011. Energy consumption has increased 
by 2% over the last year mainly all driven by 
organic growth, acquisitions, changes in 
footprint, and limited resource efficiency focus.
The Board has evaluated the social, 
environmental and ethical risks and have 
concluded that other than the risk of Bribery 
and Corruption, which is explained in greater 
detail in the Group Risk section on page 48, 
none of these risks is material in the context 
of the Group as a whole.
OUR DONATIONS
We donated approximately $11.5 million in 
philanthropic activities, of which $1.4 million 
was in product donations and charitable gifts. 
Volunteering programmes were active in most of 
our locations around the world and employees 
and local communities were able to benefit from 
the increased level of involvement.
Safety
Ensuring the safety of our employees and 
those who work with us is at the forefront 
of the way we carry out our activities both 
on the manufacturing sites and also in our 
commercial activities.
The implementation of our integrated 
management system, an active internal audit 
programme and a number of behavioural-
based safety campaigns have enabled us to 
report safety rates which are amongst the best 
in our sector.
Our headline safety performance includes all 
employees and supervised contractors and 
excludes unsupervised contractors. We adopt 
the industry standard USA Occupational Safety 
and Health Administration (‘OSHA’) system 
to record incidents of occupational injury and 
ill-health.
Lost-time incidents are defined as those 
which result in a person not being able to 
report for work on the day or shift following 
the incident. Performance is expressed as a 
rate of the number of incidents per 200,000 
hours worked.
Waste
As the footprint of the business has expanded, 
coupled with growth and acquisitions since 
2011, our total waste has increased by 27%. 
The actions raised by our 2014 waste audits are 
now gaining momentum and we reported a 2% 
annual decrease in 2015, a trend we aim to 
continue. Significant improvements were again 
made by diverting waste away from landfill in 
2015 with 75% of our waste streams now being 
recycled or sent for energy recovery.
Energy and greenhouse 
gas emissions
Over the past year our energy use has 
increased by 2% with a corresponding 3% 
increase in CO 2 emissions all driven by organic 
growth, acquisitions and changes in footprint. 
The effect of the recently acquired business 
(ArthroCare) accounted for 6.4 GWh of the 
increase, without which energy use would have 
decreased by 2%.
Methodology, materiality 
and scope
The data reported relates to areas of largest 
environmental impact including manufacturing 
sites, warehouses, research and offices. 
Smaller locations representing less than 2% 
of our overall emissions are not included. 
Acquisitions completed before 2015 are 
included in the data. Each year we work with an 
independent partner to verify our sustainability 
data and gain assurance.

> > < The scope for measuring emissions is in line 
with the scope of businesses covered in our 
consolidated financial statement. We have 
used Greenhouse Gas Protocol to measure 
our emissions. A Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard (Revised Edition) is 
guidance for this process. Primary data from 
energy suppliers has been used wherever 
possible. Data from the ArthroCare acquisition 
is included in 2015 for the first time. Recent 
acquisitions in 2015 are excluded and this is in 
line with our established policy for integration of 
acquired assets.
Our emissions have been calculated by 
using specific emissions factors for each 
country outside the USA and regional factors 
within the USA. We have used the US EPA 
‘Emissions & Generation Resource Integrated 
Database’ (‘eGRID’) for US regions and the UK 
Government DEFRA Conversion Factors for 
Greenhouse Gas Reporting elsewhere. The 
emissions from 2014 have been recalculated 
using the most up-to-date factors available 
in 2015 and may therefore differ slightly from 
those published previously.
Direct emissions include fugitive emissions 
from the manufacturing and research locations 
and arise from the losses of refrigerant gases, 
they also include the combustion of fuels 
on-site for the operation of facilities. Indirect 
emissions include purchased electricity.

SAFE DRIVING
Throughout 2015, we raised awareness of safe 
driving on company business and extended 
this to encourage all staff to think carefully about 
their driving habits whilst at work and in their 
leisure time. We ran a poster campaign which 
was well received in all countries and this is 
being rewarded by a reduction in the number 
of recordable injuries involving driving whilst 
on business.
MR. SAFETY
The ‘Mr Safety’ programme was rolled out in

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < Revenue
Group revenue for the full year was 
$4,634 million, an increase of 4% on an 
underlying basis and flat on a reported basis 
from $4,617 million in 2014. Foreign exchange 
movements reduced revenue by 8% partially 
offset by acquisitions, primarily the acquisition 
of ArthroCare in May 2014 which has a full year 
of sales in 2015 and added 4% to the reported 
growth rate.
In 2015, we achieved revenue growth in all of 
our geographical selling regions in 2015. In our 
Established Markets we delivered 5% growth 
in the United States, our largest market, a 
significant improvement on the previous year. 
We successfully stabilised our European 
business which delivered a better outturn year-
on-year , and our Australia, New Zealand and 
Japan region delivered good growth, led by the 
Advanced Wound Management businesses 
resulting in a 1% increase across our Other 
Established Markets.
In the Emerging Markets we delivered 11% 
revenue growth in 2015 despite the slow-down 
in China. Whilst we expect growth in China to 
remain below previous levels in the near-
term, it remains a very attractive market and 
we are committed to building our business 
here. We continued to successfully deliver 
strong revenue growth across the rest of the 
Emerging Markets. 
Global franchise highlights in 2015 included the 
performance of Sports Medicine, which was 
strengthened by the ArthroCare acquisition. 
The Advanced Wound Management 
businesses delivered a significantly better 
outcome driven by the actions of new 
management initiatives. Orthopaedic 
Reconstruction grew ahead of the market 
driven by our Knee Implant franchise. 
We are further strengthening our commercial 
platform by aligning under a newly-created role 
of Chief Commercial Officer tasked with driving 
commercial excellence across the organisation 
globally. We are also bringing all of our US 
Orthopaedic Reconstruction, Sports Medicine, 
Trauma and Advanced Wound Management 
franchises under one leader , completing 
the roll-out of our single managing director 
model globally.
Trading profit
Our gross margin for the full year was 75.3%, 
30 basis points down on the prior year. This 
is a combination of price erosion, currency 
headwinds and offsetting manufacturing 
efficiencies. On price, we faced similar overall 
pressures of between 1% and 2%. This 
was offset by cost of goods improvement 
programmes. On currency, we are seeing 
headwinds as a result of transactional 
exchange, although in 2015 this was mostly 
offset by hedging gains. 
Our selling, general and administration 
expenses reduced by 80 basis points to 46.8% 
of sales, largely due to savings within general 
and administration. These savings were 
primarily driven by benefits from the Group 
Optimisation programme and also synergies 
from our ArthroCare acquisition. We continue 
to simplify and improve our operating model, 
becoming more efficient in 2015. Our Group 
Optimisation Programme to release at least 
$120 million of annual savings is progressing 
ahead of plan, and had delivered $100 million 
of annualised benefits at year end. Through 
this programme, we have simplified the 
organisation through the rollout of Single 
Managing Director:
 – we have realised benefits and improved 
management information through 
optimising our enabling functions, including 
Finance, IT, Legal and HR;
 – we have delivered good results from 
procurement initiatives across the group; 
and
 – we have rationalised our footprint of office 
locations in a number of major markets 
including Australia, Germany and the US. 
In respect of ArthroCare, when we announced 
the acquisition we said that we were targeting 
$85 million of synergies by 2017 , of which three 
quarters would come from cost savings. We 
are ahead of plan and have now achieved 
almost all our targeted cost savings. Revenue 
synergies will continue to be delivered over the 
coming years. 
The suspension of the Medical Device 
Excise Tax will present us with opportunities 
to accelerate investment in our quality and 
regulatory systems and health economics 
teams, particularly in the US market.
Research and development expenses reduced 
by $13 million to $222 million in the full year , 
reducing as a percentage of sales to 4.8%. This 
is primarily due to the closure of the HP802 
programme, as we announced in 2014. 
Overall trading profit was $1,099 million in the 
year , an increase of 5% on an underlying basis 
and up $44 million from the prior year. Our 
trading margin for the full year increased 80 
basis points – delivering on our commitment of 
margin improvement. 
Operating profit
Operating profit was $628 million for the year, 
a decrease of $121 million from the prior year. 
Operating profit is the most directly comparable 
financial measure under IFRS to trading 
profit and reconciles as indicated on the left 
hand page.
Acquisition related costs primarily relate to the 
remainder of integration costs relating to the 
ArthroCare acquisition which has reduced 
significantly when compared to the prior year 
as ArthroCare was acquired in May 2014.
The ongoing restructuring and rationalisation 
costs relate to the Group Optimisation 
programme, which was announced in 
2014. Costs include redundancy and site 
rationalisation charges from the simplification 
of our operating model to establish a single 
structure under a single managing director 
as well as consultancy spend in delivering 
improved systems and processes.
Amortisation and impairment of acquisition 
intangibles of $204 million in 2015 includes a 
full year of the ArthroCare intangible assets as 
well as $51 million relating to the impairments 
of product related acquisition intangible assets, 
including a $40 million impairment of Oasis, a 
brand acquired with Healthpoint in 2012.
Included within Legal and other in 2015 is 
a total charge of $203 million relating to 
metal-on-metal hip claim settlements and 
associated legal costs of $21 million. Following 
the settlement of the majority of the US claims 
in late 2015 for net $25 million after insurance 
recoveries, a provision for the estimated value 
of current and anticipated claims of $185 million 
was recognised at 31 December 2015.

FINANCIAL REVIEW  Our approach to risk
Our risk appetite
The Group operates in global markets with long-term high growth 
potential. We are pursuing ambitious growth targets and are prepared 
to accept a certain level of risk to remain competitive and to continue 
operating in an ever-changing world. We are very clear about the specific 
risks our businesses face and the level of risk that we are prepared to 
accept in each part of our business. We have put in place robust plans for 
managing those risks, through elimination, avoidance or mitigation. 
Our approach to each risk varies depending on the circumstances and 
we accept that over time, our approach towards each risk might change 
as our business or the external environment evolves. 
During the year , the Board took the opportunity as part of our Strategy 
Review to review our risk appetite in respect of our principal risks. The 
results of our deliberations can be summarised in the adjacent table.
CATEGORY OF RISK RISK PARAMETERS
Strategic In acquiring and developing new products and business models, moving into adjacent markets and technologies, 
organically or through acquisitions, and implementing innovative pricing strategies, we have a moderate to high 
tolerance for risk. We are willing to take certain risks in pursuit of innovation and new business.
Moderate to high
Operational In operating our business, managing our suppliers, keeping control of inventory and managing our talent and our 
facilities, we have a low to moderate tolerance for risk. We aim to be as efficient as possible and adopt a cautious 
approach, but recognise that we need to take certain risks in order to take full advantage of the opportunities open 
to us.
Low to moderate
Financial We recognise that sound financial controls are necessary in order to manage our business as effectively as 
possible. We therefore have a low tolerance for risk relating to financial controls and require all our operations to 
comply with our minimum acceptable practices.
Low
Compliance In complying with laws and regulations and in matters relating to bribery and corruption, product safety and 
patient and employee safety, we have an extremely low tolerance for risk. Whilst we attempt to eradicate this risk 
completely, we recognise that, as in any human system, compliance failures may occur . We will respond to issues 
as they arise and will reassess our business scope where needed, if we judge there to be risk in these areas, 
which we can’t manage.
Extremely low
Risk Management Activities in 2015
FINANCIAL REPORTING COUNCIL CHANGES
 – We reviewed the Financial Reporting Council changes to the Corporate 
Governance Code. 
 – In May, Deloitte assisted us in reviewing our risk management 
programme in light of these changes.
 – In July 2015, the Audit Committee considered the recommendations 
from this review and how best to incorporate these changes into the 
Company’s processes. 
 – This work was followed up in October 2015, when the Audit Committee 
further considered the reporting requirements around risk. 
RISK APPETITE
 – We spent time at the Strategy Review meeting in September 
re-appraising our risk appetite for each of our principal risks.
 – We undertook a ‘black swan’ exercise, thinking about possible, 
yet unlikely, risks which could have a major impact on the Group 
were they to occur. 
 – In December 2015, the Board Development Session focused on risk 
management and we further developed our tolerance for each risk. 
DEEP DIVES
 – In December 2015, the Audit Committee conducted a deep-dive into the 
processes to manage IT and Cyber Security risks as a follow up to work 
undertaken in 2014.
 – The deep dives planned for 2016 are; dependency on single source 
or single site product supply; product quality and liability; and pricing 
and reimbursement. 
PRINCIPAL RISKS AND RISK MANAGEMENT
 – We have expanded the annual certification to the Chief Executive 
Officer on compliance with policies provided by all senior division 
management to include risk management.
 – We have agreed to develop Key Risk Indicators (‘KRI’) to provide 
information on the status of key risks and to assist with tracking on 
a regular basis. 
 – We have taken further risk specific actions, which are detailed in the 
risk table on pages 44 to 48.
Since the year end, in February 2016, the Board has reviewed the effectiveness of the risk management process, considering the principal risks, 
actions taken by management to manage those risks and the Board’s risk appetite in respect of each risk. The Board considered that the risk 
management process was effective. We recognise that this is an ongoing process and work will continue in 2016 and beyond to ensure that this 
remains the case.

The following chart shows how our risk management process is an integral part of our business. 
Individual risk owners within the business areas carry out day-to-day risk management activities 
within the framework established by the risk management office, including the identification of 
risks, undertaking risk assessments and implementing mitigating actions. These activities are 
reviewed by internal audit and other control functions, which provide assurance to the Group Risk 
Committee chaired by the Chief Executive and then to the Board and its committees.

The following pages provide an overview of what the Board considers to be our principal risks together with the actions management is taking to 
address them. These are the risks, which could cause the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations to differ materially and 
adversely from expected and historical levels. Additional detail may be found on pages 171 and 174 under ‘Group Risk Factors’ .
PRODUCT PORTFOLIO DEVELOPMENT
The medical devices industry has rapid new product innovation. The sustainability of our business depends on finding and 
developing suitable products and solutions to meet the needs of our customers and patients to support long-term growth and 
securing appropriate protection for and defending our intellectual property.
Underlying risks Actions taken by management
 – Insufficient innovation due to low R&D investment, R&D skills gap or 
poor product development execution.
 – Competitors may introduce a disruptive technology or 
business model.
 – Competitors may obtain patents or other intellectual property rights 
that affect the Group’s competitive position.
 – Failure to receive regulatory approval to commercialise a pipeline 
product successfully.
 – Claims by third parties regarding infringement of their intellectual 
property rights.
 – Processes are focused on identifying new products and potentially 
disruptive technologies and solutions.
 – Increasing prioritisation and allocation of funds for research 
and development.
 – Pursuing business development opportunities, which augment 
our portfolio.

Our approach to risk continued
The principal risks we have identified
We have developed a detailed risk matrix, which is designed to rate any 
given risk. We rate our risks according to the likelihood of occurrence and 
the impact. The potential impact is assessed using the criteria below and 
others relating to matters such as Legal and other impacts:

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < ACQUISITIONS AND BUSINESS DEVELOPMENT
Failure to identify appropriate business development opportunities, to deliver value from our acquisitions or to integrate them 
effectively into the Group will impact our ability to achieve expected financial returns and lead to loss of reputation.
Underlying risks Actions taken by management
 – Failure to identify appropriate acquisitions.
 – Ineffective acquisition due diligence.
 – Inflated forecasts or projections leading to over-valuation 
of transaction.
 – Failure to embed Group standards, policies and financial controls 
quickly enough following acquisition.
 – Integration process may identify practices that need to be ceased to 
meet Group standards.
 – Failure to learn from past actions.
 – Acquisition activity is aligned with corporate strategy and prioritised 
towards products, franchises and markets identified to have the 
greatest long-term potential.
 – Clearly defined investment appraisal process based on return on 
capital, in accordance with Capital Allocation Framework.
 – Undertaking detailed and comprehensive cross-functional due 
diligence prior to acquisitions.
 – Implementing consistent integration processes designed to identify

Technologies and the distributorships on Colombia and Russia.
 – Comprehensive Integration programme continued for the acquisition 
of ArthroCare in 2014.
 – Post-acquisition review template revised to enable acquisitions to be 
evaluated on consistent basis.
GOVERNMENT ACTION, PRICING AND REIMBURSEMENT PRESSURE
The success of our business depends on governments providing adequate funding to meet increasing demands arising 
from demographic trends. The prices we charge are therefore impacted by budgetary constraints, economic and political 
considerations, fluctuations in exchange rates and our ability to persuade governments of the economic value of our products, 
based on clinical data, cost, patient outcomes and comparative effectiveness. 
Underlying risks Actions taken by management
 – Reduced reimbursement levels and increasing pricing pressures.
 – Reduced demand for elective surgery.
 – Lack of compelling health economics data to support 
reimbursement requests.
 – Government policies favouring lower prices and locally 
sourced products.
 – Political upheavals prevent selling of products, receiving remittances 
of profit from a member of the Group or future investments in 
that country.
 – Economic downturn impacts demand and collections.
 – Trading margin will be impacted when the currencies in our 
manufacturing countries (US, UK, Costa Rica and China) strengthen 
against the currencies in the rest or the world where our products 
are exported.

PRINCIPAL RISKS BUSINESS OPERATIONS, SUPPLY CHAIN AND BUSINESS RECOVERY
Our business depends on purchasing materials, efficient manufacturing, controlled inventory management and the timely supply 
of our products to our customers. Some of our key products are reliant on one production facility or one supplier for raw materials, 
components, finished products and packaging materials. 
Underlying risks Actions taken by management
 – Failure or performance issues at a critical/single source facility or 
supplier of key products or services may impact revenues or profits.
 – If a key facility were rendered unusable by a catastrophe, or we lost 
a number of leaders or employees in a catastrophe, business plans 
and targets may not be met. 
 – Over production of product inventory and instruments sets may 
occur due to inadequate portfolio planning. 
 – If we fail to properly manage our inventory and financial controls 
around inventory we may become overcapitalised or inaccurately 
forecast and report data.
 – Ensuring emergency and incident management and business 
recovery plans are in place at major facilities and for key products 
and key suppliers.
 – Validating second source for critical components or products.
 – Undertaking of risk based review programmes for critical suppliers.
 – Enhancing travel security and protection programme.
 – Developing improved regional inventory metrics to drive efficiency 
and harmonise demand signals with factory capacity constraints.
 – Managing continued reduction in SKUs through product phase outs 
and formal review of slow moving and obsolete inventory.
Actions during 2015
 – Appointed new dedicated President of Global Operations and 
strengthened the supply chain organisation.
IT SYSTEM DISRUPTION AND CYBER CRIME
Our business is heavily dependent on the integrity of our IT systems and the management of information. At the same time, 
cyber crime is growing exponentially in frequency and sophistication and many IT systems are exposed to these threats. 
Underlying risks Actions taken by management
 – IT systems which support our business may be disrupted by 
man-made or natural forces or in the process of upgrades or new 
process implementation.
 – A severe IT service interruption, a cyber attack, the unauthorised 
access to or a misuse of sensitive information could disable critical 
systems and cause loss of sensitive data with major impact for the 
Company, including substantial revenue or profit loss as well as 
material reputational damage.
 – Continuously improving the stability and reliability of IT systems 
and infrastructure.
 – Ensuring IT disaster and data recovery plans are in place to support 
overall business continuity plans.
 – Global management framework for the control and reporting of 
access to our critical IT systems.
 – Following HMG GCHQ guidance, implementing the Cyber 
security roadmap with oversight from the Group Cyber Security 
Steering Committee.
 – Continuously improving controls relating to mobile device and 
removable media, network security and monitoring and malware 
protection and secure configuration.

PRINCIPAL RISKS TALENT RETENTION AND ORGANISATIONAL CHANGE
Our people are critical to the success of our business and we need to attract, motivate and retain the best talent we can, not only for 
our current needs, but also looking ahead to the organisation of the future. We therefore need effective succession planning at all 
levels and support for employees through periods of organisational change.
Underlying risks Actions taken by management
 – Poor retention of high performing and high potential staff could 
jeopardise achieving objectives. 
 – Failure to ensure proactive talent management is undertaken 
effectively may result in business disruption.
 – Failure to support executives and employees affected 
through periods of organisational change could result in sub-
optimal performance.
 – Operating robust talent systems and processes with focus on 
identifying key roles and successors.
 – Operating robust performance management programme, which 
includes regular performance reviews, underpinned by a common 
set of values.
 – Enhancing hiring process with rigorous screening and checks.
 – Running annual talent review process the results of which are 
reported up to the Board to aid discussions on succession planning.
 – Designing competitive management incentive packages. 
 – Holding annual managing directors’ meeting and CEO Forum for high 
potential managers to encourage and develop internal talent.
Actions during 2015

changes implemented at the end of 2015.
 – Coached Senior Executives and managers on how to manage 
effectively through change.
 – Comprehensive change management programme rolled-out at 
multiple levels across the organisation.
 – Further embedded succession planning of key roles at all levels.
PRODUCT SAFETY, QUALITY, REGULATION AND LITIGATION
Many of our products are designed to be implanted or used within the human body. Product safety and quality is therefore of 
critical importance. National regulatory authorities enforce a complex series of laws and regulations that govern the design, 
development, approval, manufacture, labelling, marketing and sale of healthcare products. They also review data supporting the 
safety and efficacy of such products and may also inspect for compliance with appropriate standards, including those relating to 
Quality Management Systems or Good Manufacturing practice regulations. 
Underlying risks Actions taken by management
 – Defects in design or manufacturing products sold by the Group could 
lead to product recalls or product removal or result in loss of life or 
major injury, with negative financial and reputational impacts.
 – If there is significant non-compliance with policy, regulations and 
standards governing products and operations regarding registration, 
manufacturing, distribution, sales and marketing, then we could 
suffer fines and impacts to reputation.
 – Failure in the design or manufacture of products supplied to the 
Company can impact the quality of products sold by the Company.
 – Failure to obtain proper approvals for new or changed 
technologies, products or processes can result in product and 
registration deficiencies.
 – Failure to implement programmes and supporting resources to 
ensure product quality and regulatory compliance.
 – Failure to manage, process, respond to and analyse customer 
complaints and adverse event data could lead to further deficiencies 
and loss of reputation.
 – Ensuring that we have comprehensive product quality processes 
and controls from design to customer supply.
 – Ensuring that ‘design for manufacture’ is embedded into 
product development.
 – Reviewing product safety and complaint data.
 – Standardising and monitoring compliance with Group quality 
management and practices through Global Quality Assurance 
Regulatory Assurance organisation.
 – Incident management teams in place to respond in the event of an 
incident relating to patient safety.

REPUTATION, ETHICS, BRIBERY AND CORRUPTION
There is increasing public scrutiny of ethics in business and ‘doing the right thing’ has become part of our licence to operate. 
Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to increasing scrutiny by government authorities in many countries. 
We are also expected to have in place strong compliance programs under global anti-corruption laws and US healthcare laws.
Underlying risks Actions taken by management
 – Failure to act in an ethical manner consistent with our code of 
conduct can lead to reputational damage.
 – Violation of global anti-corruption and healthcare laws.
 – Cultures in certain geographies and in acquired businesses may not 
fully support the Group’s code of conduct.
 – Failure to conduct adequate due diligence or to integrate appropriate 
internal controls into recently acquired businesses.
 – An instance of fraud could severely impact our finances and 
our reputation.
 – Serious compliance breach by employee or third party in an 
individual geography could threaten our ability to continue to operate 
in that geography.
 – Leadership from the top with Ethics & Compliance Committee 
at Board and Executive level overseeing our ethical and 
compliance practices.
 – All employees globally are required to certify compliance with 
our Code of Conduct and Global Policies and Procedures which 
provide guidelines for ethical behaviour and controls for significant 
compliance risks.
 – Training programmes in place for employees and third parties with 
ethical and compliance responsibilities and monitoring and auditing 
programmes to verify implementation.
 – Independent reporting channels for employees and third parties to 
report concerns in confidence.
 – Compliance risks included as part of due diligence reviews, 
integration plans and reporting for acquisitions.
 – Controls in place to detect and prevent fraud.
Actions during 2015
 – Active engagement in due diligence and integration projects for 
acquisition of Blue Belt technologies, and the distributorships in 
Russia and Colombia.
 – Established ‘spotlight on trust’ programme to recognise employees.
 – Implemented detailed additional compliance standards to 
distributors and agents.
Our approach to risk continued Our Viability Statement
During the year, the Board has carried 
out a robust assessment of the principal 
risks affecting the Company, particularly 
those which could threaten the business 
model. These risks and the actions 
being taken to manage or mitigate them 
are explained in detail on pages 44 to 48 
of this Annual Report. 
Having assessed the principal risks, the Board 
has determined that we have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company will be able to 
continue in operation and meet its liabilities 
as they fall due over a period of three years 
from 1 January 2016. We have chosen a period 
of three years, as the detailed Strategic Plan, 
which we approve each year at our Strategy 
Review in September , is also for a three-year 
period. We also review longer-term plans for 
five and ten years, but our detailed review 
focuses on a three-year period. 
In reaching this conclusion, we have 
undertaken the following process:
 – The Audit Committee reviewed the 
risk management process at their 
meetings in February and July, receiving 
presentations from the Chief Compliance 
and Risk Officer, which explained the 
processes followed by management in 
identifying and managing risk throughout 
the business.
 – As part of the annual Strategy Review in 
September, the Board considered and 
discussed the principal risks which could 
impact the business model over the 
next three years and discussed with the 
management team how each of these 
risks were being managed and mitigated.
 – We have undertaken a robust assessment 
of those risks that would threaten our 
business model, future performance, 
solvency or liquidity of the Company, 
including its resilience to the threats to its 
viability posed by those risks in severe 
but plausible scenarios. We are satisfied 
that we have robust mitigating actions in 
place as detailed on pages 44 to 48 of this 
Annual Report. 
 – We recognise however that the long-term 
viability of the Company could also be 
impacted by other as yet unforeseen risks 
or that the mitigating actions we have put 
in place could turn out to be less effective 
than intended.
 – Therefore where appropriate, stress and 
sensitivity analysis of these risks was 
carried out to evaluate the impact of a 
severe but plausible combination of risks 
actually occurring and consider whether 
additional financing would be required. 
This assessment included quantitative 
and qualitative analyses.
 – We have considered and discussed a 
report from the Chief Financial Officer 
setting out the terms of our current 
financing arrangements and potential 
capacity for additional financing.
Based on this analysis, the Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Company will 
be able to continue in operation and meet its 
liabilities as they fall due over the three-year 
period of their assessment. 
Our conclusion is based on our current 
Strategic Plan approved by the Board in 
September 2015, having regard to longer-term 
strategic intentions, yet to be formulated in 
detail. However , we operate in a changing 
marketplace, which might cause us to adapt 
our Strategic Plans during the three-year 
period. In responding to changing external 
conditions, we will continue to evaluate any 
additional risks involved which might impact 
the business model.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < Independence of Directors
We require our Non-Executive Directors to remain independent from 
management so that they are able to exercise independent oversight 
and effectively challenge management. We therefore continually assess 
the independence of each of our Non-Executive Directors. The Executive 
Directors have determined that all our Non-Executive Directors are 
independent in accordance with both UK and US requirements. None 
of our Non-Executive Directors or their immediate families has ever had 
a material relationship with the Group. None of them receives additional 
remuneration apart from Directors’ fees, nor do they participate in the 
Group’s share plans or pension schemes. None of them serve as 
directors of any companies or affiliates in which any other Director is 
a director.
More importantly, each of our Non-Executive Directors is prepared to 
question and challenge management, to request more information and 
to ask the difficult question. They insist on robust responses both within 
the Boardroom and sometimes, between meetings. The Chief Executive 
Officer is open to challenge from the Non-Executive Directors and uses 
this positively to provide more detail and to reflect further on issues.
Brian Larcombe served as an independent Non-Executive Director for 
a period of 13 years, a period of time that some might regard as likely 
to impact his independence. We do not believe this to have been the 
case as throughout 2015, Brian Larcombe continued to maintain an 
independent view within Board discussions and his experience on the 
Board, wise counsel and corporate memory was valued by the rest of 
the Board. We have asked Brian Larcombe to remain on the Board for 
another year to support the Chairman during the time he will be providing 
additional Executive oversight whilst the Chief Executive Officer is 
undergoing medical treatment.
Management of Conflicts of Interest
None of our Directors or their connected persons, has any family 
relationship with any other Director or Officer, nor has a material interest 
in any contract to which the Company or any of its subsidiaries are, or 
were, a party during the year or up to 23 February 2016.
Each of us as a Director has a duty under the Companies Act 2006 to 
avoid a situation in which we have or may have a direct or indirect interest 
that conflicts or might conflict with the interests of the Company. This duty 
is in addition to the existing duty owed to the Company to disclose to the 
Board any interest in a transaction or arrangement under consideration 
by the Company. 
If any Director becomes aware of any situation which might give rise 
to a conflict of interest, they inform the rest of the Board immediately 
and the Board is then permitted under the Company’s Articles of 
Association to authorise such conflict. This information is then recorded 
in the Company’s Register of Conflicts, together with the date on which 
authorisation was given. In addition, each Director certifies on an annual 
basis that the information contained in the Register is correct.
When the Board decides whether or not to authorise a conflict, only the 
Directors who have no interest in the matter are permitted to participate 
in the discussion and a conflict is only authorised if the Board believes 
that it would not have an impact on the Board’s ability to promote the 
success of the Company in the long term. Additionally, the Board may 
determine that certain limits or conditions must be imposed when giving 
authorisation. No actual conflicts have been identified, which have 
required approval by the Board. However , four situations have been 
identified which could potentially give rise to a conflict of interest and 
these have been duly authorised by the Board and are reviewed on an 
annual basis.
Outside Directorships
We encourage our Executive Directors to serve as a Non-Executive 
Director of one external company. We believe that the work they do 
as Non-Executive Directors of other companies has benefits for their 
executive roles with the Company, giving them a fresh insight into the role 
of a Non-Executive Director. Olivier Bohuon is a Non-Executive Director 
of Shire plc and of Virbac group and Julie Brown is nominated for election 
as a Non-Executive Director of Roche Holding Limited at its Annual 
General Meeting on 1 March 2016. Each Director discussed their external 
roles with the Chairman, prior to accepting these appointments and the 
Chairman was satisfied that each Executive Director had the capacity for 
the time commitment required.
Re-appointment of Directors
In accordance with the Code, all Directors offer themselves to 
shareholders for re-election annually, except those who are retiring 
immediately after the Annual General Meeting. Robin Freestone who was 
appointed to the Board on 1 September 2015, will offer himself for election 
at the Annual General Meeting. Each Director may be removed at any 
time by the Board or the shareholders.
Director Indemnity Arrangements
Each Director is covered by appropriate directors’ and officers’ liability 
insurance and there are also Deeds of Indemnity in place between the 
Company and each Director. These Deeds of Indemnity mean that the 
Company indemnifies Directors in respect of any proceedings brought 
by third parties against them personally in their capacity as Directors 
of the Company. The Company would also fund ongoing costs in 
defending a legal action as they are incurred rather than after judgement 
has been given. In the event of an unsuccessful defence in an action 
against them, individual directors would be liable to repay the Company 
for any damages and to repay defence costs to the extent funded by 
the Company.
Liaison with shareholders
The Board meets with retail investors at the Annual General Meeting 
and responds to many letters and emails from shareholders throughout 
the year. 
The Executive Directors also meet regularly with institutional investors 
to discuss the Company’s business and financial performance both at 
the time of the announcement of results and at industry investor events. 
During 2015, the Executive Directors held meetings with institutional 
investors, including investors representing approximately 43.5% of the 
share capital as at December 2015.
During 2015, Roberto Quarta met with investors to hear their views of the 
Company. He held four meetings with investors holding approximately 
7 .2% of the share capital. 
Joseph Papa, the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee also met 
with key institutional investors towards the end of 2015. He held meetings 
with 14 investors holding around 18.4% of the share capital. These were 
useful discussions giving insight into current investor thinking.
Ian Barlow, the Chairman of the Audit Committee also offered to meet 
with institutional investors to discuss audit related matters. The meetings 
held with six investors holding around 5.6% of the issued share capital 
were interesting and useful and we welcomed some insightful comments 
on possible improvements to the Audit Committee Report.
Michael Friedman, the Chairman of the Ethics & Compliance 
Committee met with one investor during the year who was interested in 
understanding more about our global compliance programme and the 
challenges we face in this area.
Members of the Board are always happy to engage with investors, if they 
have matters they wish to raise with the Non-Executive team.
A short report on our major shareholders and any significant changes 
in their holdings since the previous meeting is reviewed at each Board 
meeting. The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors report back to the 
Board following their meetings with investors. Olivier Bohuon and Julie 
Brown routinely report on any concerns or issues that shareholders 
have raised with them in their meetings. Copies of analyst reports on the 
Company and its peers are also circulated to Directors.
Purchase of ordinary shares
In order to avoid shareholder dilution, shares allotted to employees 
through employee share schemes are bought back on a quarterly basis 
and subsequently cancelled as we stated in Note 19.2 of the accounts on 
page 155.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < Board Effectiveness Review
The Board Effectiveness Review in 2015 was externally facilitated 
by Belinda Hudson of Independent Audit, who had undertaken the 
previous external review in 2012. Independent Audit has no other 
business relationship with the Company or any member of the Board. 
Following an initial planning meeting with the Chairman and Company 
Secretary, she reviewed the minutes and papers of the Board and 
Committee meetings over the previous year . She then interviewed each 
member of the Board, the Company Secretary, the External Auditor and 
a number of other Senior Executives, who regularly interacted with the 
Board and its Committees. She also attended and observed the Board 
meeting in December 2015.
In January 2016, she prepared a report, detailing her findings. This 
report was shared with the Chairman and the rest of the Board. The 
Chairman then discussed the findings with each member of the Board 
and collectively at a meeting with the Non-Executive Directors and the 
Company Secretary. 
She concluded that “the Board appears to have a much better 
understanding of all the issues and challenges that Smith & Nephew 
faces than in the past. It has remained supportive throughout while 
providing a good degree of challenge to the thinking of the executives” 
and commented that the “Board was on a good trajectory and 
becoming increasingly effective.” She highlighted the benefits of 
the refreshing of the Board that had taken place over the previous 
18 months, noting that this had led to a new level of energy and 
dynamism as well as fresh thinking and input, a better balanced 
Board, a better focus on strategy and a stronger focus on exercising 
oversight of risk, better relationships and better informed discussion on 
succession planning.
Suggested Improvements 
She did however recommend some key ways in which the Board 
could become more effective. The Board has discussed these 
recommendations and have agreed the following actions for 2016:
 – Further opportunities to be identified to enable greater 
engagement with the Non-Executive Directors for them to provide 
input on matters brought before the Board.
 – The development of a programme for Non-Executive Directors to 
get to know the business better outside the scheduled Board visits.
 – Continuous review of the Board agenda to ensure sufficient time is 
devoted to HR and people related matters, risk and mitigations and 
the innovation pipeline.
ACTIONS IDENTIFIED ACTION TAKEN
Make more effective use of the annual Board Planner to ensure that all 
key strategic issues were timetabled appropriately throughout the year .
The annual Board planner and the format of the Board agendas were 
redesigned during the year. This has resulted in a more logical flow of 
matters being discussed at each Board meeting with more time spent 
on matters of greater strategic importance and less on routine matters.
Encourage the executive team to access the diverse competencies of 
the Non-Executive Directors more between Board meetings.
Opportunities have been taken by the executives to access the 
specialist skills of some of the Non-Executive Directors during the 
year , particularly in the areas of risk management, cyber security and 
in-country knowledge of certain territories. However, the Board and 
the executive team recognised that this is an area which could be 
developed further in 2016. 
Continue the practice of inviting members of the executive team to 
present regularly to the Board.
At each Board meeting during the year , there was a presentation by 
members of the executive team on relevant topics. This has enabled 
the Non-Executive Directors to meet and get to know key members of 
the executive team, which is helping with succession planning.
The areas for attention identified in the 2014 review have been addressed as follows:

RESPONSIBILITY & ACTIVITY Board Development Programme
Our Board Development Programme is directed to the specific needs 
and interests of our Directors. We focus the development sessions on 
facilitating a greater awareness and understanding of our business 
rather than formal training in what it is to be a Director . We value our 
visits to the different Smith & Nephew sites around the world, where 
we meet with the local managers of our businesses and see the daily 
operations in action. Meeting our local managers helps us to understand 
the challenges they face and their plans to meet those challenges. We 
also take these opportunities to look at our products and in particular the 
new products being developed by our R&D teams. This direct contact 
with the business in the locations in which we operate around the world 
helps us to make investment and strategic decisions. Meeting our local 
managers also helps us when making succession planning decisions 
below Board level.
During the course of the year , we receive updates at the Board and 
Committee meetings on external corporate governance changes likely to 
impact the Company in the future. 
In 2015, we particularly focused on the new reporting requirement to 
include a Viability Statement and the consequent changes we would 
make to the way we monitored risks throughout the Group. 
New Directors receive tailored induction programmes when they join 
the Board. In 2015, Vinita Bali continued her induction programme with 
a series of meetings with key Senior Executives, a visit to our site in Hull 
and attendance at some orthopaedic operations in India. Erik Engstrom 
and Robin Freestone also commenced their induction programmes 
during the year, meeting with key Senior Executives. All Non-Executive 
Directors are encouraged to visit our overseas businesses, if they 
happen to be travelling for other purposes. Our local management 
teams enjoy welcoming Non-Executive Directors to their business 
and it emphasises the interest the Board takes in all our operations. 
The Chairman regularly reviews the development needs of individual 
Directors and the Board as a whole. 
Development activities
The following development sessions covering both the Smith & Nephew 
business and wider market issues were held during the year:
APRIL
 – Presentation from WPP on innovation trends in the Global 
Healthcare market.
JULY
 – Presentation from our Auditor, KPMG on MegaTrends which were 
likely to impact business in coming years.
SEPTEMBER
 – Presentation from Boston Consulting Group on trends 
in healthcare.
 – Presentations from the entire executive team as part of the Board’s 
Strategy review.
 – Board discussion on Risk as part of the Board’s 
Strategy discussions.
OCTOBER
 – Visit to the Company’s site in Durban, South Africa and meetings 
with the South African executive team.
 – Series of presentations from our South African management team 
on the challenges faced by the business in South Africa, our 
strategy and initiatives to meet these challenges and an update on 
progress made since the previous year. 
DECEMBER
 – Internally facilitated workshop on Risk Management programme 
focusing on Group’s principal risks, the Board’s risk appetite and 
tolerance for each risk, mitigation actions and resultant net risks 
post mitigation.

> > < Succession Planning
The Board is responsible for ensuring that there are effective succession 
plans in place to ensure the orderly appointment of directors to the 
Board, as and when vacancies arise. The report from the Nomination 
& Governance Committee on pages 68 to 69 explains the process the 
Board and the Nomination & Governance Committee followed in 2015 to 
build a balanced board for the future in undertaking the search for new 
Non-Executive Directors.
Building a successful executive team is the responsibility of the Chief 
Executive Officer, although this process is also overseen by the Board. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Human Resources Officer present 
a report to the Board on Succession Planning on an annual basis, at 
which the performance and potential of members of the executive team 
are discussed and considered. The Board is also given a number of 
opportunities during the course of the year to meet key members of the 
executive team at the Strategy Review held annually in September and 
at the site visits held in October each year. Executive Officers and their 
direct reports also make regular presentations on different aspects of the 
business. The Board recognises the importance of getting to know the 
executive team below Board level both for the purpose of understanding 
the business better but also in order to plan for executive succession.

Appointment of Robin Freestone
–  Reviewed the short list of candidates for the position of  
Non-Executive Director and discussed the outcome of meetings 
already held with potential candidates. 
–  Agreed to recommend to the Board that Robin Freestone  
be appointed Non-Executive Director with effect from  
1 September 2015.
–  Commenced the appointment for the external Board Evaluation 
process. 
Since the year end, we have also discussed the future structure of the 
Board. In particular , we recommended to the Board that Brian Larcombe 
remains in place as Senior Independent Director in order to support 
me as Chairman, should I be required to provide additional executive 
oversight during the Chief Executive Officer’s period of illness.
We also agreed that Olivier Bohuon would cease to be a member of 
this committee, recognising that some shareholders believe that the 
Chief Executive Officer should not sit on the Nomination & Governance 
Committee. He will continue to attend and contribute to discussions 
at our meetings, as we value his input particularly when discussing 
succession planning.
Non-Executive Directors
During 2015, Erik Engstrom and Robin Freestone joined the Board on 
1 January 2015 and 1 September respectively. In selecting these new 
Board members, we continued the process we started in 2014, which 
had identified the skills and experiences we needed on the Board to 
implement our Strategy over the next five years. The process we followed 
in 2015 was as follows:
 – The analysis in 2014 had identified that we needed one more Board 
member with financial expertise gained as Chief Financial Officer of 
a FTSE 100 company.
 – The Nomination & Governance Committee selected Zygos to 
undertake the search for a new Non-Executive Director with 
financial expertise.
 – Zygos prepared a long list of candidates satisfying one or more of the 
above criteria and Brian Larcombe and I met with them to discuss 
the long list and select a short list of suitable candidates.
 – Members of the Nomination & Governance Committee and Ian 
Barlow, Chairman of the Audit Committee then met individually with 
a number of candidates. 
 – The Nomination & Governance Committee agreed to recommend 
that the Board appoint Robin Freestone as Non-Executive Director 
because of his experience as Chief Financial Officer of Pearson 
plc and previous experience of the Healthcare industry at 
Amersham plc.
Zygos does not perform any other services for the Company and we are 
satisfied that the advice is objective and independent.
Diversity
We aim to have a Board which represents a wide range of backgrounds, 
skills and experiences. We also value a diversity of outlook, approach 
and style in our Board members. We believe that a balanced Board is 
better equipped to consider matters from a broader perspective and 
therefore come to decisions that have considered a wider range of 
issues and perspectives than would be the case in a more homogenous 
Board. Diversity is not simply a matter of gender , ethnicity or other easily 
measurable characteristic. Diversity of outlook and approach is harder 
to measure than gender or ethnicity but is equally important. A Board 
needs a range of skills from technical adherence to governance or 
regulatory matters to understand the business in which we operate. It 
needs some members with a long corporate memory and others who 
bring new insights from other fields. There needs to be both support 
and challenge on the Board as well as a balance of gender , commercial 
and international experience. When selecting new members for the 
Board, we take these considerations into account, as well as professional 
background. A new Board member needs to fit in with their fellow Board 
members, but also needs to provide a new way of looking at things.
In 2012, we stated that our expectation would be that by 2015, 25% of 
our Board would be female and we have met this expectation. 27% 
of our Board is female. We do not regard this as a fixed percentage as 
the number of Board members will fluctuate from time to time and we 
would not necessarily expect to replace any retiring Director with a new 
Director of the same gender . We will still continue to appoint Directors 
on merit, valuing the unique contribution that they will bring to the Board, 
regardless of gender .
Governance
During the year , the Nomination & Governance Committee also 
addressed a number of governance matters. We also received updates 
from the Company Secretary on new developments in corporate 
governance and reporting in both the UK and Europe. We reviewed 
the independence of our Non-Executive Directors, considered 
potential conflicts of interest and the diversity of the Board and made 
recommendations concerning these matters to the Board.

–  Received a report from the SVP Quality Assurance and Regulatory 
Assurance on the activities of the QARA function, reviewing the 
quality and regulatory challenges faced across the Company and 
initiatives to address them.
At each meeting we noted and considered the activities of compliance 
and enforcement agencies and investigation of possible improprieties. 
We also reviewed a report on the activities of the Group Ethics & 
Compliance Committee and reviewed the progress of the Global 
Compliance Programme. 
Since the year end, we have also reviewed the work of the Group Ethics 
& Compliance Committee meeting held in November 2015, considered 
the compliance implications of recent acquisitions and continued our 
oversight of the Quality Assurance and Regulatory Assurance function.
Employee Compliance Programme
New employees are trained on our Code of Conduct, which sets 
out the basic legal and ethical principles for conducting business. 
A copy of the Code of Conduct can be found on our website at 
www.smith-nephew.com
Further support is provided through a comprehensive set of tools and 
resources located on our global intranet platform. These tools and 
resources are regularly updated. 
The Code of Conduct includes our whistle-blower policy, which enables 
employees and members of the public to contact us anonymously 
through an independent provider (where allowed by local law). 
Individuals can also report any concern to their direct manager or a 
manager in Compliance, Legal or Human Resources. All calls and 
contacts are investigated and the appropriate action taken, including 
reports for senior management or the Board, where warranted. As 
stated in the Code of Conduct, we also enforce our non-retaliation policy 
with respect to anyone who makes a report in good faith. The Ethics & 
Compliance Committee is advised of potentially significant improprieties 
from time to time, and the Company’s response. 
In 2015, we continued to work to enhance the employee compliance 
training programme. New employees receive training on our Code 
of Conduct (‘Code’), and we assign annual compliance training to 
employees. In 2015, we also introduced, developed and piloted a 
face to face course for new managers, supplementing the on-line 
manager certification training. 
Compliance Programme for Third Parties
We continually review our compliance programme as it relates to third 
party sellers (such as distributors and sales agents), particularly in higher 
risk markets. This programme includes due diligence, contracts with 
compliance terms and compliance training. To increase oversight, we have 
augmented compliance standards and monitoring programmes in 2015.
Our oversight of third party sellers included site assessments to check 
compliance controls and monitoring visits to review books and records. 
We also have controls over other third parties engaged by us to 
provide services other than selling our products, such as customs, 
registration and travel agents. We have established a policy and process 
requiring that managers prioritise our oversight of third parties and take 
appropriate steps, including performing a risk assessment, conducting 
due diligence and assigning training, based on third party type and 
risk profile. 
Compliance implications around acquisitions 
In support of strategic acquisition activity across the Group, we 
undertake comprehensive due diligence evaluation prior to acquisition 
and implement compliance integration plans from the point of executing 
the acquisition. This is to ensure that new businesses are integrated into 
the Smith & Nephew compliance culture as soon and consistently as 
possible and that all new employees are immediately made aware of 
how we do things at Smith & Nephew. 
Oversight of Quality Assurance and Regulatory 
Assurance Function
In 2014, the Committee assumed responsibility for oversight of the 
Quality Assurance and Regulatory Affairs Function (‘QARA’). Product 
safety is at the heart of our business and regulatory authorities across the 
world enforce a complex series of laws and regulations that govern the 
design, development, approval, manufacture, labelling, marketing and 
sale of healthcare products. The QARA function carries out work in the 
area of Quality Management systems in our manufacturing activities.
The Committee approved the QARA Three Year Plan and the QARA Audit 
Plans for 2015 and 2016. During the year , we reviewed the results of the 
QARA audits undertaken during the year , approved follow up actions 
and monitored progress made to address these actions. 
We also reviewed the results of inspections carried out by the US Food 
and Drug Administration (‘FDA’) and other regulators and monitored 
the progress of improvement work required following some of these 
inspections using a dashboard, which highlighted progress being made 
against objectives. We also monitored the work being undertaken to help 
manufacturing sites prepare for future inspections.
We also reviewed the results of a ‘Culture of Quality’ survey undertaken 
across all employees measuring the culture of quality against four key 
drivers – employee ownership, peer involvement, message credibility 
and leadership emphasis.

ETHICS & COMPLIANCE 
COMMITTEE REPORT Dear Shareholder ,
It’s been a year of positive change for the Audit Committee during 
2015. We have welcomed Erik Engstrom and Robin Freestone to the 
Committee. They both have strong FTSE 100 backgrounds – Robin 
Freestone was previously a Chief Financial Officer – and they provide a 
fresh perspective to the Committee. 
Following the audit tender during 2014 and the appointment of KPMG 
LLP in April 2015, the Committee oversaw a smooth transition from 
the former auditor . This process included KPMG LLP ‘shadowing’ EY 
LLP through the 31 December 2014 year end audit process, along 
with attendance at Group Audit Committee meetings before their 
formal appointment.
This was supplemented by KPMG LLP performing detailed audit 
planning activities at all the Group’s material operating locations 
throughout the summer and a review of EY LLP audit files at 
major locations.
This is the first time in Smith & Nephew’s history as a listed company 
that we have changed our audit firm. Bringing in a new firm to conduct 
our audit has brought fresh energy to the role; risk areas have been 
reassessed and new questions asked. This has not been without 
challenge, and has required the Group to invest significantly more 
resources and time, especially in this first year. However, we are 
pleased with the way in which the change has been managed and the 
output of a robust audit.
At our half-year meeting we received a detailed audit plan for the 2015 
financial year from KPMG LLP identifying their audit scope, planning 
materiality and their assessment of key risks. The audit plan for the 
2015 financial year provided a different style, with further depth and 
coverage including 78% of Group’s revenue and 95% of adjusted Group 
profit before tax.
We undertook a number of non-routine items during the year , which 
have provided debate and progression for the Company, including:
 – Discussion of the risk framework as part of the 2015 Strategy Review. 
This led to further work, which enabled the completion of the first 
2015 Viability Statement. This process was also reviewed by the 
Audit Committee. 
 – A deeper review of SOx work, in particular in our Emerging Markets, 
and following the implementation of COSO 2013, which was first 
applicable in 2014.
 – The Minimum Acceptable Practices (‘MAPs’) were launched in 
December 2014 and are our minimum control procedures and best 
practices. They have become a standardised process across the 
Group and additional support has been provided to the team to 
ensure completion of these by year end.
 – Monitoring of the Finance Transformation project throughout 2015 to 
ensure its risks were mitigated and timeline remained on track. 
 – Following the appointment of a new Head of Internal Audit in 
2014, the scope and depth of the reviews across the business 
increased during 2015. This has led to increased oversight by 
the Audit Committee on issues such as the consequences on 
the China business and its governance framework of the slow 
down of the Chinese economy, and internal controls in newly 
acquired distributors.
 – Reviewed the development of the process for monitoring the results 
and performance of acquisitions.
 – We received a regulatory enquiry during the year. Following 
explanation from Julie Brown, our Chief Financial Officer and her 
team, this matter was dealt with to our satisfaction.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT

OVERVIEW OUR BUSINESS OUR PERFORMANCE GOVERNANCE OUR FINANCIALS
 
SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < Since the year end, we have also reviewed the Annual Report and 
Accounts for 2015 and have concluded that taken as a whole, they are 
fair balanced and understandable and have advised the full Board 
accordingly. In coming to this conclusion, we have considered the 
description of the Group’s strategy and key risks, the key elements of 
the business model, which is set out on pages 10 to 11, risks and the key 
performance indicators and their link to the strategy.
Significant matters related to the financial statements
We considered the following key areas of judgement in relation to the 
2015 accounts and at each half-year and quarterly trading report, which 
we discussed in all cases with management and the external auditor:
VALUATION OF INVENTORIES
A feature of the orthopaedic business model (whose finished goods 
inventory makes up 79% of the Group total finished goods inventory) is 
the high level of product inventory required, some of which is located 
at customer premises and is available for customers’ immediate use. 
Complete sets of product, including large and small sizes have to be 
made available in this way . These sizes are used less frequently than 
standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle are inevitably 
in excess of requirements. Adjustments to carrying value are therefore 
required to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this situation.
Our action
At each quarter end, we received reports from, and discussed with, 
management the level of provisioning and material areas at risk. 
The provisioning level was 21% at 31 December 2015 (21% as at 
31 December 2014). We challenged the basis of the provisions and 
concluded that the proposed levels were appropriate and have been 
consistently estimated.
LIABILITY PROVISIONING
The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant 
degree of estimation. Provision is made for loss contingencies when 
it is considered probable that an adverse outcome will occur , and the 
amount and timing of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In making 
its estimates, management takes into account the advice of internal and 
external legal counsel. Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts 
updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes. The 
ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the 
outcome of court proceedings or settlement negotiations or if new facts 
come to light. The level of provisioning for contingent and other liabilities 
is an issue where management and legal judgements are important. 
Our action
As members of the Board, we receive regular updates from the Chief 
Legal Officer. These updates form the basis for the level of provisioning. 
As disclosed in Note 3 a charge of $203 million has been recorded in 
respect of potential liabilities. This arises from the Group ‘s portfolio of 
modular metal-on-metal hip products. This has resulted in a provision 
being carried forward of $185 million as of 31 December 2015. We 
received detailed reports from management on this position, including 
the actuarial model used to estimate the provision, and challenged the 
key assumptions, including the number of claimants and projected value 
of each settlement. Aside from the developments in relation to metal-on-
metal, the other legal judgements have not moved materially during the 
year , with some cases having been resolved, and some new matters 
arising. We have determined that the proposed levels of provisioning at 
year end of $7 4 million included within ‘legal and other provisions’ in Note 
17 .1 in 2015 ($7 4 million in 2014) were appropriate in the circumstances.
IMPAIRMENT
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill, intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment, a number of significant assumptions 
have to be made when preparing cash flow projections. These include 
the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for 
the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or 
products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory 
approvals. If actual results should differ or changes in expectations 
arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely 
impact operating results.
Our action
We reviewed management’s reports on the key assumptions with 
respect to goodwill, acquisition intangible assets and investments in 
associates – particularly the forecast future cash flows and discount 
rates used to make these calculations. We noted the impairment 
charge of $51m that has been recorded in 2015 the principal 
component of which related to the Oasis brand. Based on our 
challenge of the key assumptions we concurred with management that 
the amount of impairment is appropriate. We have also considered the 
disclosure surrounding these reviews, and concluded that the review 
and disclosure were appropriate.
TAXATION
Provisioning for potential current tax liabilities and the level of deferred 
tax asset recognition in relation to accumulated tax losses are 
underpinned by a range of judgements about the future statutory 
profitability of constituent entities of the Group.
Our action
We annually review our processes and approve the principles 
for management of tax risks. We review quarterly reports from 
management evaluating existing risks and tax provisions. Based on a 
thorough report from management of tax liabilities and our challenge 
thereof of the basis of any tax provisions recorded we concluded, that 
the levels of provisions and disclosures were appropriate.
BUSINESS COMBINATIONS
The Group has identified ‘growth through acquisitions’ as one of its 
Strategic Priorities.
Our action
For completed acquisitions, we received a report from management 
setting out the significant assets and liabilities acquired, details of 
the provisional fair value adjustments applied, an analysis of the 
intangible assets acquired, the assumptions behind the valuation 
of these acquired intangible assets and the proposed useful 
economic life of each intangible asset class. For material acquisitions, 
management engage third party specialists to perform a detailed 
analysis, summaries of which are included in management reports. We 
reviewed, discussed, challenged and approved these summaries for 
Colombia and Russia. During 2015 we also considered and concurred 
with management that there had been no changes to the provisional 
fair values recognised in the 2014 acquisition of ArthroCare.
OPERATING SEGMENTS
Following completion of the Group’s transition to a new commercial 
organisational structure on 1 January 2015 the Group is now engaged 
in a single business activity, being the development, manufacture and 
sales of medical technology products and services. As the allocation of 
the Group’s resources are determined on a project by project basis by 
the Chief Operating Decision Maker (being the Commercial Operations 
team) the Group now has one operating segment. 
Our action
In applying the requirements of the relevant accounting standard, we 
have reviewed management’s analysis on determining that the Group 
has one operating segment and agreed with the interpretation. Given 
the level of judgement involved we have determined that it is appropriate 
to include this as a significant area of judgement in our report.
We note that within the External Audit report there is a principal risk 
associated with the timing of revenue recognition and measurement of 
related reserves as required by auditing standards. We have considered 
this and have concluded that we have appropriate procedures and 
controls in place not to include this as a significant area of judgement.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT External Auditor
Independence of External Auditor
The independence of our external auditor is critical for the integrity of the 
audit. Following a competitive tender in 2014, KPMG LLP were appointed the 
Company’s external auditor for the 201 5 audit replacing Ernst & Y oung LLP who 
had been the Company’s auditor for a number of years. We are satisfied that 
KPMG LLP are fully independent from the Company’s management and free 
from conflicts of interest. Our Auditor Independence Policy , which ensures that 
this independence is maintained, is available on the Company’s website. 
We believe that the implementation of this policy helps ensure that 
auditor objectivity and independence is safeguarded. The policy governs 
our approach when we require our external auditor to carry out non-audit 
services, and all such services are strictly governed by this policy. During 
2015, fees paid to KPMG LLP , our external auditor , for non-audit work 
totalled $1 million, representing 25% of total audit fees. Full details are 
shown in Note 3.2 of the Notes to the Group accounts. 
The Auditor Independence Policy also governs the policy regarding audit 
partner rotation with the expectation that the audit partner will rotate at 
least every five years. The Audit Committee confirms it has complied 
with the provision of the Competition and Markets Authority Order which 
came into effect from 1 January 2015.
Effectiveness of External Auditors
We conducted a review into the effectiveness of the external audit as part 
of the 2015 year end process, in line with previous years. We sought the 
views of key members of the finance management team, considered the 
feedback from this process and shared it with management.
During the year , we also considered the inspection reports from the 
Audit Oversight Boards in the UK and US and determined that we were 
satisfied with the audit quality provided by KPMG.
Overall therefore, we concluded that KPMG had carried out their audit for 
2015 effectively. 
Appointment of External Auditors at Annual General Meeting
Resolutions will be put to the Annual General Meeting to be held 
on 14 April 2016 proposing the re-appointment of KPMG LLP as the 
Company’s Auditor and authorising the Board to determine their 
remuneration, on the recommendation of the Audit Committee.
Disclosure of Information to the Auditor
In accordance with Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006, the Directors 
serving at the time of approving the Directors’ Report confirm that, to the best 
of their knowledge and belief, there is no relevant audit information of which 
the Auditor, KPMG, are unaware and the Directors also confirm that they 
have taken reasonable steps to be aware of any relevant audit information 
and, accordingly , to establish that the Auditor is aware of such information.
Audit and Professional Fees paid to the Auditor
Fees for professional services provided by Ernst & Young LLP and KPMG 
LLP (appointed from 9 April 2015) , the Group’s independent auditors in 
each of the last two fiscal years, in each of the following categories were:
2015 
$ million
2014 
$ million
Audit 4 3
Audit-related fees – –
Tax – 2
Other 1 –
Total 5 5
Any pre-approved aggregate, individual amounts up to $50,000 may be 
authorised by the Tax Director/Group Financial Controller respectively 
and amounts up to $100,000 by the Chief Financial Officer. Any individual 
amount over $100,000 must be pre-approved by myself as Chairman 
of the Audit Committee. If we require additional permitted tax services 
or any which exceed the amounts approved, again pre-approval by the 
Chairman of the Audit Committee is required.
Internal Audit
Our Internal Audit function reports directly to the Audit Committee and 
is headed by Jenny Morgan, Senior Vice President Internal Audit. The 
Internal Audit function carries out work across the Group acting as a third 
line of defence. The audit coverage is based on risk with the focus for 
2015 being Emerging Markets, finance transformation, inventory and core 
financial controls systems.
During the year , they completed 33 reviews across the business. The 
Audit Committee receives a quarterly report of the activities of the Internal 
Audit function and reviews the results of the Internal Audit reports, 
looking in detail at any reports with unsatisfactory ratings. We also receive 
a quarterly report detailing any unremediated and overdue control 
recommendations and oversee the effective and timely remediation of 
any recommendations.
Of particular note in 2015 were the Internal Audit reviews conducted in 
China following the slowdown of the Chinese economy. Each review was 
discussed at The Audit Committee with presentations from Internal Audit 
and Executive Regional management. Remediation of agreed actions is 
monitored by the Audit Committee at each Committee meeting. There 
has been continued focus on Emerging Markets with reviews of Brazil, 
Mexico, India, South Korea, Malaysia and Thailand. Internal Audit also 
performed independent validation reviews of the implementation of the 
Group’s MAPs and programme assurance reviews over the Group’s SAP 
implementation as part of the Finance Transformation.
In 2016, we will continue to monitor Internal Audit’s scope of work and 
operational methods to ensure that it continues to play a full role in 
providing assurance over the Group’s identification and management of 
risk and its associated controls. 
Risk Management Programme
During the year , we reviewed the Financial Reporting Council changes 
to the UK Corporate Governance Code and considered how these 
changes would impact our risk management processes and the work 
that we would need to undertake to enable the Board to make the 
Viability Statement. 
We reviewed our risk management processes at our meetings in 
February, July and October . These reviews included a report from 
Deloitte, which recommended a number of suggestions for improving 
our risk management framework, which we shall be implementing 
over the next six to 12 months. One of these recommendations is the 
development of Key Risk Indicators to enable us to track progress in 
the future. We also considered reviews undertaken by our Internal 
Audit function into specific risks, such as IT Security and Cyber Risk 
and received regular reports from the Group Finance function on their 
findings from reviews with regard to compliance with the Sarbanes 
Oxley Act.
Since the year end, we reviewed a report from the Internal Audit function 
into the effectiveness of the risk management programme throughout the 
year . We considered the principal risks, the actions taken by management 
to manage those risks and the Board risk appetite in respect of each risk. 
Accountability continued

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < We concluded that the risk management process during 2015 and up to 
the date of approval of this Annual Report was effective. Work will continue 
in 2016 and beyond to continue to enhance the process.
We have reviewed the system of internal financial control and satisfied 
ourselves that we are meeting the required standards both for the year 
ended 31 December 2015 and up to the date of approval of this Annual 
Report. No concerns were raised with us in 2015 regarding possible 
improprieties in matters of financial reporting.
See pages 42 to 48 for further information on our risk 
management process.
Viability Statement
We also reviewed management’s work in conducting a robust 
assessment of those risks which would threaten our business model 
and the future performance or liquidity of the Company, including its 
resilience to the threats of viability posed by those risks in severe but 
plausible scenarios. This assessment included stress and sensitivity 
analyses of these risks to enable us to evaluate the impact of a severe 
but plausible combination of risks. We then considered whether 
additional financing would be required in such eventualities. Based on 
this analysis, we recommended to the Board that it could approve and 
make the Viability Statement on page 49 . 
Evaluation of Internal Controls
Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate 
internal control over financial reporting as defined in Rule 13a–15 (f) and 
15d–15(f) under the US Securities Exchange Act of 1934.
There is an established system of internal control throughout the 
Group and our Divisions. The main elements of the internal control 
framework are:
 – The management of each Division is responsible for the establishment 
and review of effective financial controls within their Division.
 – The Group Finance manual sets out, amongst other things, financial 
and accounting policies and MAPS.
 – The Internal Audit function agrees an annual work plan and scope of 
work with the Audit Committee.
 – The Audit Committee reviews reports from Internal Audit on their 
findings on internal financial controls, including compliance with 
MAPS and from the Senior Vice President, Group Finance and 
the heads of the Financial Controls and Compliance, Taxation and 
Treasury functions.
 – The Audit Committee reviews regular reports from the Financial 
Controls and Compliance function with regard to compliance 
with the Sarbanes-Oxley Act including the scope and results of 
managements testing and progress regarding any remediation.
 – The Audit Committee reviews the Group whistle-blower procedures.
 – The Audit Committee received and reviewed a report on the 
progress of the Finance Transformation during 2015 and the 
mitigation of the associated risks.
This system of internal control has been designed to manage rather 
than eliminate material risks to the achievement of our strategic and 
business objectives and can provide only reasonable, and not absolute, 
assurance against material misstatement or loss. Because of inherent 
limitation, our internal controls over financial reporting may not prevent 
or detect all misstatements. In addition, our projections of any evaluation 
of effectiveness in future periods are subject to the risk that controls 
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate. 
Entities where the company does not hold a controlling interest have their 
own process of internal controls similar to that of the Company. 
This process complies with the Financial Reporting Council’s ‘Internal 
Control: Revised Guidance for Directors on the UK corporate 
governance code and additionally contributes to our compliance with 
the obligations under the Sarbanes-Oxley Act 2002 and other internal 
assurance activities. 
There has been no change during the period covered by this Annual 
Report that has materially affected, or is reasonably likely to materially 
affect, the Group’s internal control over financial reporting.
The Board is responsible overall for reviewing and approving the 
adequacy and effectiveness of the risk management framework and 
the system of internal controls over financial, operational including 
quality management and ethical compliance processes operated by the 
Group. The Board has delegated responsibility for this review to the Audit 
Committee. The Audit Committee, through the Internal Audit function, 
reviews the adequacy and effectiveness of internal control procedures 
and identifies any weaknesses and ensures these are remediated 
within agreed timelines. The latest review covered the financial year to 
31 December 2015 and included the period up to the approval of this 
Annual Report. 
The main elements of this annual review are as follows:
 – The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer have 
evaluated the effectiveness of the design and operation of the 
Group’s disclosure controls and procedures as at 31 December 2015. 
Based upon this evaluation, the Chief Executive Officer and Chief 
Financial Officer concluded on 23 February 2016 that the disclosure 
controls were effective as at 31 December 2015.
 – Management is responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Management 
assessed the effectiveness of the Group’s internal control over 
financial reporting as at 31 December 2015 in accordance with 
the requirements in the US under s404 of the Sarbanes-Oxley 
Act. In making that assessment, they used the criteria set forth 
by the Committee of Sponsoring Organisations of the Treadway 
Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework. Based on 
their assessment, management concluded and reported that, as 
at 31 December 2015, the Group’s internal control over financial 
reporting is effective based on those criteria.
 – Having received the report from management, the Audit Committee 
reports to the Board on the effectiveness of controls.
 – KPMG LLP . An independent registered public accounting firm issued 
an audit report on the Group’s internal control over financial reporting 
as at 31 December 2015. This report appears on pages 106 to 110.
Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers
We have adopted a Code of Ethics for Senior Financial Officers, which 
applies to the Chief Executive Officer, the Chief Financial Officer, the 
Senior Vice President Group Finance and the Group’s senior financial 
officers. There have been no waivers to any of the Code’s provisions 
nor have there been any amendments to the Code during 2015 or up 
until 23 February 2016. A copy of the Code of Ethics for Senior Financial 
Officers can be found on our website at www.smith-nephew.com. 
In addition, every individual in the finance function certifies to the 
Chief Financial Officer that they have complied with the Finance Code 
of Conduct. 
Evaluation of Effectiveness of the Audit Committee
The effectiveness of the Audit Committee was evaluated as part of the 
review into the effectiveness of the Board conducted at the end of 2015.
This review found that the Audit Committee was becoming increasingly 
effective, but recognising the increased responsibilities of the Audit 
Committee suggested that the time needed for each meeting could 
be increased.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT Remuneration
Dear Shareholder ,
2015 was a successful year for the Company where we made both 
financial and strategic progress. The increase in underlying revenue 
growth, trading profit margin and adjusted earnings year-on-year reflect 
management’s actions to improve both our commercial performance 
and operational efficiency. Our performance on the measures we use 
in our variable pay plans was as follows:
 – Revenue at $4,634 million showed underlying growth of 4%, 
twice that achieved in 2014;
 – Strong trading profit led to an increase of 80bps in trading 
profit margin;
 – Trading cash flow was $936 million with the year trading 
profit to cash ratio of 85% reflecting a return to stronger cash 
performance levels;
 – Revenues from Emerging Markets at $715 million showed 
underlying growth of 11% in spite of the significant slow down 
in China; 
 – Share price improved from 1060p to 1212p during the year.
On these five financial measures, which are reflected in our Annual 
Incentive Plan and in our Performance Share Plan, the Company 
performed well in 2015. It is against this back drop that I should like to 
present our Remuneration Report for 2015.
Continued Alignment
Throughout 2015, the Remuneration Committee focused on ensuring 
continued alignment of our remuneration arrangements with the 
corporate strategy and performance of the Company. The table overleaf 
summarises how the measures in our incentive arrangements link to 
our corporate objectives, which remain unchanged from last year. 
Changes in 2015
During 2015, changes to the remuneration of the Executive Directors 
were limited to base salary increases of 3% taking effect in April 2015. 
These were in line with average increases awarded across the rest of 
the Group. There were no changes to Annual Incentive or Performance 
Share Plan award levels or measures, although performance targets 
were updated to reflect expectations going into 2015. 
The other change that you will notice, in direct response to feedback 
from our shareholders, is the retrospective disclosure of financial targets 
under the Annual Incentive Plan. 
In respect of performance during the year, Executive Directors received 
cash incentive payments ranging from 104% to 112% of target and 
Equity Incentive Awards ranging from 55% to 65% of salary. The 2013 
Performance Share Awards vested slightly above threshold at 33.5% 
of maximum.
2013 – 2015 PSP Awards
For over 10 years the Smith & Nephew incentive plans have included 
a relative Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) measure, reflecting investor 
preferences, UK market practice and the perceived alignment of 
shareholder and executive interests. Over this time, the level of vesting 
has ranged from 0% to 88%. 
As noted in my introductory comments, the Company delivered excellent 
TSR to our shareholders over the last three years, with an investment of 
£100 at the end of 2012 being worth £180 at the end of 2015. This was 
significantly ahead of broad market indices, both in the UK and the US, 
against which many of our investors compare the Company. However, 
against the small select group of medical devices companies in our peer 
group, the Company’s TSR performance was just below median.
A number of factors have contributed to this result including volatility 
within the peer group, which reduced to just 14 peer companies 
over the performance period due to acquisitions; exchange rate 
movements, which can have a significant impact given all but two of 
the peer companies are US listed; and a reduced correlation between 
the peer companies and Smith & Nephew in terms of size and 
geographic exposure. 
The Remuneration Committee is of the view that this outcome does 
not reflect either the corporate performance delivered over the three-
year performance period or the strong absolute returns experienced 
by shareholders. We have therefore taken the highly unusual step 
of exercising our discretion to permit the TSR element of the 2013 
Performance Share Awards to vest at threshold (25% of the shares 
granted). When combined with the Free Cash Flow achievement, this 
gives a combined vesting of 33.5% for all participants. Further details of 
this decision are set out on page 86.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < I wish to assure shareholders that this decision was not taken lightly 
and the Committee was unanimous in reaching it. We considered many 
factors and also took the opportunity to seek the views of some of our 
largest shareholders towards the end of 2015, which was most helpful. 
Ultimately we have made a decision that we believe to be in the best 
interests of shareholders, reflecting the corporate performance delivered, 
while continuing to engage and incentivise the Company’s senior 
management over the longer term.
On page 86 you will see that we have revised and expanded the TSR 
peer group for the awards to be made in 2016 in an attempt to reduce 
the risk of this situation arising again in 2019. With the continued 
consolidation that is expected within our industry over the coming years, 
this is something that we will consider as part of our review during 2016 
which I discuss overleaf. 
Other Matters
Other matters we considered in 2015 included the remuneration 
arrangements for our new Executive Officers – Elga Lohler and Matt 
Stober. We also looked at benchmarking analyses of the remuneration 
arrangements for our Executive Directors and Executive Officers 
comparing them against the arrangements in place at other companies 
for executives undertaking similar roles in comparable organisations.
Looking Forward
During 2016, we shall be undertaking a thorough review of our 
remuneration arrangements ahead of the shareholder vote in 2017 
on our Remuneration Policy. This review will cover all aspects of our 
remuneration, including the structure of our incentive arrangements 
and the measures we use within our incentive plans, the length of 
vesting and holding periods applicable to our long-term share plan and 
the competitiveness of our remuneration arrangements in attracting 
global talent. 
The Remuneration Committee remains committed to considering and 
approving remuneration arrangements which link executive reward 
to the shareholder experience as far as possible. Thank you for your 
continued support.

Compliance statement
We have prepared this Directors’ Remuneration Report (the ‘Report’) in accordance with The Enterprise and Regulatory Reform Act 2012-2013 (clauses 81-84) and The Large and  
Medium-Sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 (the ‘Regulations’). The Report also meets the relevant requirements of the 
Financial Conduct Authority (‘FCA’) Listing Rules.
The first part of the Report (pages 80 to 93) is the annual report on remuneration (the ‘Implementation Report’). The Implementation Report will be put to shareholders for approval 
as an advisory vote at the Annual General Meeting on 14 April 2016. The Implementation Report explains how the remuneration policy was implemented during 2015 and also how 
it is currently being implemented in 2016. Pages 82 to 86 and 93 have been audited by KPMG LLP, including the tables on pages 87 to 90.
The second part of the Report (pages 94 to 102) is the Directors’ Remuneration Policy Report (the ‘Policy Report’) which was approved by shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting held in 2014. The Policy Report describes our remuneration policy as it relates to the Directors of the Company. All payments we make to any Director of the Company will 
be in accordance with this remuneration policy. We intend that this remuneration policy will remain in place unchanged for the next year and will next be put to shareholder vote at 
the Annual General Meeting to be held in 2017. The level of base salary and benefits paid and performance measures shown in the Policy Report are as at 2014, when the Policy 
Report was approved by shareholders. Full details of any changes to these details since then, in accordance with the Policy Report are given in the Implementation Report.

During the year , the Remuneration Committee received information 
and advice from Willis Towers Watson, an independent executive 
remuneration consultancy firm appointed by the Remuneration 
Committee in 2011 following a full tender process. They provided 
advice on market trends and remuneration issues in general, attended 
Remuneration Committee meetings, assisted in the review of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report, provided market benchmark data, 
undertook calculations relating to the PSP performance conditions and 
supported a review of the TSR peer group. The fees paid to Willis Towers 
Watson for Remuneration Committee advice during 2015, charged on a 
time and expense basis was £186,683.31 in total. Willis Towers Watson 
also provided other human resources and compensation advice to the 
Company for the level below the Board. Willis Towers Watson comply with 
the Code of Conduct in relation to Executive Remuneration Consulting in 
the United Kingdom and the Remuneration Committee is satisfied that 
their advice is objective and independent.

Executive Directors’ base salaries will increase by 3% with effect from 
1 April 2016 to the following:
Olivier Bohuon €1,179,490
Julie Brown £545,303
Payment in lieu of pension
In 2015, both Olivier Bohuon and Julie Brown received a salary 
supplement of 30% of their basic salary to apply towards their retirement 
savings, in lieu of membership of one of the Company’s pension 
schemes. The same arrangement will apply in 2015.
Benefits
In 2015, both Olivier Bohuon and Julie Brown received death in service 
cover of seven times basic salary, of which four times salary is payable 
as a lump sum with the balance used to provide for any spouse and 
dependent persons. They also received health cover for themselves and 
their families, a car allowance and financial consultancy advice. Olivier 
Bohuon also received assistance with travel costs between London and 
Paris. The same arrangements will apply in 2016. The following table 
summarises the value of benefits on an element-by-element basis in 
respect of 2014 and 2015.

Annual Incentive Plan 2015
During 2015, 70% of the Annual Incentive Plan for Executive Directors was 
based on the achievement of specific financial objectives and 30% of the 
award depended on the achievement of specific business objectives.
Financial Objectives
The financial measures on which performance was assessed in 
2015 were revenue, trading profit and trading cash. For each of these 
measures, the Committee determined threshold, target and maximum 
performance in February 2015. In February 2016, the Committee 
reviewed performance against each of these objectives and determined 
the percentage of the award which would vest in respect of each of the 
objectives, all as detailed in the table below.
Threshold Target Maximum Actual

Revenue $4,572m $4,713m $4,854m $4,686m

Trading cash $815m $906m $997m $915m

The Board has determined that the disclosure of performance targets at 
this time is commercially sensitive. These targets are determined within 
the context of a five-year plan and the disclosure of these targets could 
give information to our competitors about details of our strategy which 
would enable them to compete more effectively with us to the detriment 
of our performance. These targets however will be disclosed in next 
year’s Annual Report, when the Committee will discuss performance 
against the targets. For the financial performance measures, ‘Target’ is set 
at target performance as approved by the Board in the Budget for 2016. 
‘Threshold’ and ‘Maximum’ are set at +/–3% from the target for revenue, 
at +/– 5% for the trading profit measure and at +/– 10% for the cash 
flow measure.

Annual Report.
Performance Share Programme – 2015 grants
Performance share awards in 2015 were made to Executive Directors 
under the Global Share Plan 2010 to a maximum value of 190% of 
salary (95% for target performance). Performance will be measured 
over the three financial years beginning in 2015 and will vest subject to 
performance and continued employment in 2018. 50% of the award will 
vest subject to cumulative free cash flow performance, 25% to revenue in 
Emerging Markets and 25% to relative TSR.
Cumulative free cash flow is defined as net cash inflow from operating 
activities, less capital expenditure. Free cash flow is the most appropriate 
measure of cash flow performance because it relates to cash generated 
to finance additional investments in business opportunities, debt 
repayments and distribution to shareholders. This measure includes 
significant elements of operational financial performance and helps to 
align Executive Director awards with shareholder value creation.
The 50% of the award that will be subject to cumulative free cash flow 
performance will vest as follows:
Cumulative free cash flow Award vesting as % of salary
Below $1.578bn Nil
$1.578bn 23.75%
$1.814bn 47 .5%
$2.050bn or more 95%
Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between these points.
Revenue in Emerging Markets is defined as cumulative revenue over a 
three-year period opening 1 January 2015 from our Emerging Markets. 
The 25% of the award that will be subject to revenue in Emerging Market 
performance will vest as follows:
Revenue in Emerging Markets Award vesting as % of salary
Below Threshold Nil
Threshold 11.875%
Target 23.75%
Maximum or above 47 .5%
It is not possible to disclose precise targets for revenue growth in 
Emerging Markets as this will give commercially sensitive information 
to our competitors concerning our growth plans in Emerging Markets, 
which they could use against us to launch new products and enter 
new markets. This would be detrimental to our business in Emerging 
Markets, which are key to our success overall. This target however will be 
disclosed in the 2018 Annual Report, when the Committee will discuss 
performance against the target.
25% of the award will vest based on the Company’s Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR) performance relative to a bespoke peer group of companies 
in the medical devices sector over a three-year period commencing 
1 January 2015 as follows:
Relative TSR ranking Award vesting as % of salary
Below median Nil
Median 11.875%
Upper quartile 47 .5%
Awards will vest on a straight-line basis between these points. If the 
Company’s TSR performance is below median, none of this part of the 
award will vest.
The bespoke peer group for the 2015 awards comprises the following 
companies: Baxter International, Becton, Dickinson and Company, 
Boston Scientific Corporation, C. R. Bard, Coloplast A/S, CONMED 
Corporation, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, Medtronic, NuVasive,

DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION REPORT Orthofix, Stryker, St Jude Medical, Wright Medical and Zimmer. Nobel 
Biocare and Covidien were also part of this peer group when the awards 
were made, but have since delisted following acquisitions.
The Group’s TSR performance and its performance relative to the 
comparator group is independently monitored and reported to the 
Remuneration Committee by Willis Towers Watson.
Performance Share Programme 2016
Performance share awards will be made in 2016 to Executive Directors 
under the Global Share Plan 2010 to a maximum value of 190% of salary 
(95% for target performance). Performance will be measured over the 
three financial years commencing 1 January 2016 and will vest subject to 
performance and continued employment in 2019. Vesting will be subject 
to the same three performance measures as applies to the awards made 
in 2015. 
50% of the award will vest subject to cumulative free cash flow 
performance, 25% to revenue in Emerging Markets and 25% to 
relative TSR.
The 50% of the award that will be subject to cumulative free cash flow 
performance will vest as follows:
Cumulative free cash flow Award vesting as % of salary
Below $1,585bn Nil
$1,585bn 23.75%
$1,822bn 47 .5%
$2,059bn or more 95%
25% of the award will vest subject to revenue in Emerging Markets.
As was the case with the awards in 2015, the precise targets for revenue 
growth in the Emerging Markets are commercially sensitive and will be 
disclosed on vesting in the 2019 Annual Report.
‘Target’ is set at target cumulative revenues from Emerging Markets in the 
corporate plan approved by the Board for the three years commencing 
1 January 2016. ‘Threshold’ and ‘Maximum’ are set at +/– 15% from target. 
In response to the industry dynamics, the Committee undertook a review 
of the peer group to be used for the 25% of the awards subject to TSR, 
having used the same group for a number of years. The Committee 
considered a combination of factors focused on comparability to Smith & 
Nephew, in particular absolute size, industry and geographic presence. 
As a result, six new companies (Essilor International SA, Getinge AB, 
GN Store Nord A/S, Shire plc, Sonova Holding AG and William Demant) 
will be added to the peer group for awards made in 2016, with three 
companies removed (NuVasive, Orthofix and Wright Medical). These 
changes seek to ensure the peer group remains more robust over the 
next three years in the face of inevitable consolidation, while focusing 
on those companies more similar to Smith & Nephew. As part of the 
broader policy review for 2017 , the Committee will undertake a holistic 
review of the remuneration programmes more generally.
The peer group for the purpose of calculating relative TSR performance 
will consist of the following companies: Baxter International, Becton, 
Dickinson and Company, Boston Scientific Corporation, C. R. Bard, 
Coloplast A/S, CONMED Corporation, Edwards Lifesciences Corporation, 
Essilor International SA, Getinge AB, GN Store Nord A/S, Medtronic, 
Stryker, Shire plc, Sonova Holding AG, St Jude Medical, William Demant 
and Zimmer Biomet.
Vesting of Awards made in 2013
Since the end of the year , the Remuneration Committee has reviewed 
the vesting of conditional awards made to Executive Directors under 
the Global Share Plan 2010 in 2013. Vesting of the conditional awards 
made in 2012 was subject to performance conditions based on TSR 
and cumulative free cash flow measured over a three-year period 
commencing 1 January 2013.
50% of the award was based on the Company’s TSR relative to a 
bespoke group of 18 medical devices companies. Our industry is one 
that is fast-paced and highly-evolving, and this was reflected in further 
consolidation during the performance period with three of the peer 
companies delisting due to merger and acquisition activity. This resulted 
in the peer group reducing to just 15 companies, meaning that relatively 
small differences in TSR have a significant impact on the level of vesting.
Over the three years ending 31 December 2015, the Company delivered 
a return of 80%, meaning an investment of £100 would now be worth 
£180, outperforming both the FTSE 100 (£120) and S&P 500 ($154 on 
an investment of $100). Against the peer group however, the Company 
ranked 10th, just below median.
In light of the strong absolute performance and returns delivered 
to shareholders coupled with the industry context, the Committee 
was concerned about the outcome and resolved to undertake a 
comprehensive review. The Committee is aware of shareholder 
sensitivity around the use of discretion. At the same time, the Committee 
recognises the importance of discretion in seeking to ensure any 
payments, or lack thereof, under our incentive plans align with business 
performance and the shareholder experience. Having spoken with some 
of our larger shareholders in December to obtain their views on this 
matter , the following points were considered:
 – TSR was clustered around median, and the Company’s TSR was just 
8.5 percentage points below median, the threshold requirement 
for vesting.
 – The majority of companies in the 2013 peer group are listed in the 
US. By calculating TSR in common currency, the outcome is distorted 
both by the relative performance of the US Dollar and Sterling, but 
also the relative performance of the markets more generally, as 
evidenced by the FTSE 100 and S&P 500 data illustrated on the next 
page. Neither of these items are within the control of management. 
On a local (also referred to as constant) currency basis, the Company 
ranked at median.
 – The Company significantly out-performed broader market indices. 
Against the FTSE 100, an index of particular interest to many of our 
investors, the Company ranked above the upper quartile.

In addition, the Committee took account of the Plan Rules which provide for the replacement of delisted companies with substitutes as the alternative 
to automatic exclusion. While the use of substitutes is uncommon in the market and some of our shareholders interpreted this to be a retrospective 
change, concerned by industry consolidation and reduction of the peer group from 18 to 15, the Committee resolved to consider the outcome under 
this approach. While the Company remained below median, the gap in TSR between the Company and the peer group median reduced to 1.7%. 
On balance, the Committee determined that the default outcome under the plan did not reflect the corporate performance delivered over the three-
year performance period, nor the shareholder experience of absolute returns exceeding 70%. Applying the discretion permitted to the Committee 
under the Plan Rules and Remuneration Policy, it was concluded that the element of the awards subject to TSR performance would be deemed to vest 
at threshold (25%). The Committee recognised that the use of discretion was not something to be taken lightly, but after much debate felt that this was 
appropriate and fair in the circumstances.
This part of the award therefore vested at 25%.
50% of the award was based on cumulative free cash flow performance. The target set in 2013 was $1,780 billion. Over the three-year period, the 
adjusted cumulative cash free cash flow was $1,703 billion. These adjustments include items such as Board approved M&A, including the acquisitions 
of Healthpoint and ArthroCare and Board approved Business Plans such as the Group Optimisation programme, the Regranex hold, the Capex plan 
and metal-on-metal settlements. This part of the award therefore vested at 42%.
Overall therefore, the conditional awards made in 2013 will vest at 33.5% of maximum on 7 March 2016 as follows:

Implementation of remuneration policy in 2016
The Remuneration Committee proposes to make no changes to the way that the remuneration policy is implemented in 2016 from how it was 
implemented in 2015, other than increasing base salaries in line with salary increases across the Group, as explained on pages 83 and 88 and setting 
new targets for the Annual Incentive Plan and the Performance Share Programme, as explained on page 86.

Joseph Papa, Chairman of the Remuneration Committee has met with a number of shareholders in previous years to discuss remuneration matters. 
In December 2015, he met with shareholders holding around 18.4% of the Company’s shares to discuss the following issues:
 – Previously, the Board felt that the disclosure of the financial targets used in our Annual Incentive Plan would be commercially sensitive. However, 
following discussions with shareholders, we agreed to look at ways of disclosing these targets retrospectively without causing us commercial 
concerns. The financial targets we used in our Annual Incentive Plan for 2015 are therefore disclosed on page 83. 
 – We also discussed with shareholders whether the vesting period relating to our long-term share plans should be extended from three to 
five years, by requiring Directors to retain and hold vested shares for a two-year period after vesting. Whilst this is exactly what our Executive 
Directors do, out of choice, this is not something that is currently a condition of the Performance Share Awards. The Committee has considered 
this further and have agreed that this is a matter, which we would prefer to address in the context of a full review of our remuneration policy, 
which we shall be undertaking during 2016 ahead of putting the remuneration policy to shareholders for approval in 2017.

Senior Management remuneration
The Group’s administrative, supervisory and management body (the ‘Senior Management’) is comprised for US reporting purposes, of Executive 
Directors and Executive Officers. Details of the current Executive Directors and Executive Officers are given on pages 54 to 56.
Compensation paid to Senior Management in respect of 2015, 2014 and 2013 was as follows:
2013 2014 2015
Total compensation (excluding pension emoluments, but including cash payments under the 
performance-related incentive plans)
$14,186,000 $12,725,000 $13,971,000
Total compensation for loss of office $0 $2,664,000 0
Aggregate increase in accrued pension scheme benefits $257 ,000 $16,000 0
Aggregate amounts provided for under supplementary schemes $414,000 $507 ,000 $698,000
As at 23 February 2016, the Senior Management owned 528,367 shares and 56,970 ADSs, constituting less than 0.1% of the share capital of 
the Company. 
Details of share awards granted during the year and held as at 23 February 2016 by members of Senior Management are as follows:
Share awards granted during the year Total share awards held as at 23 February 2016

Dilution headroom
The Remuneration Committee ensures that at all times the number of new shares which may be issued under any share-based plans, including 
all-employee plans, does not exceed 10% of the Company’s issued share capital over any rolling ten-year period (of which up to 5% may be issued 
to satisfy awards under the Company’s discretionary plans). The Company monitors headroom closely when granting awards over shares taking into 
account the number of options or shares that might be expected to lapse or be forfeited before vesting or exercise. In the event that insufficient new 
shares are available, there are processes in place to purchase shares in the market to satisfy vesting awards and to net-settle option exercises.
Over the previous 10 years (2006 to 2015), the number of new shares issued under our share plans has been as follows:
All-employee share plans 7 ,530,287 (0.84% of issued share capital as at 23 February 2016)
Discretionary share plans 36,408,270(4.07% of issued share capital as at 23 February 2016)

REMUNERATION REPORT The Policy Report

and long-term strategy of the Company How the component operates Maximum levels of payment Framework in which performance is assessed
BASE SALARY AND BENEFITS
BASE SALARY
We are a FTSE 50 listed company, operating in over 100 countries around 
the world. Our strategy to generate cash from Established Markets in order 
to invest for growth in Emerging Markets means that we are competing 
for international talent and our base salaries therefore need to reflect 
what our Executive Directors would receive if they were to work in another 
international company of a similar size, complexity and geographical scope.
Salaries are normally reviewed annually, with any increase applying from 
1 April.
Salary levels and increases take account of:
 – market movements within a peer group of similarly sized UK 
listed companies
 – scope and responsibility of the position
 – skill/experience and performance of the individual Director
 – general economic conditions in the relevant geographic market, and
 – average increases awarded across the Company, with particular 
regard to increases in the market in which the Executive is based.
The base salary of the Executive Directors with effect from 1 April 2014  
will be as follows:
 – Olivier Bohuon €1,111,782
 – Julie Brown £514,000
The factors noted in the previous column will be taken into consideration 
when making increases to base salary and when appointing a 
new Director.
In normal circumstances, base salary increases for Executive Directors will 
relate to the geographic market and peer group. In addition, the average 
increases for employees across the Group will be taken into account. The 
Remuneration Committee retains the right to approve higher increases 
when there is a substantial change in the scope of the Executive Director’s 
role. A full explanation will be provided in the Implementation Report should 
higher increases be approved in exceptional cases.
Performance in the prior year is one of the factors taken into account and 
poor performance is likely to lead to a zero salary increase.
PAYMENT IN LIEU OF PENSION
In order to attract and retain Executive Directors with the capability of driving 
our corporate strategy, we need to provide market-competitive retirement 
benefits similar to the benefits they would receive if they were to work for 
one of our competitors. 
At the same time, we seek to avoid exposing the Company to defined 
benefit pension risks, and where possible will make payments in lieu of 
providing a pension.
Current Executive Directors receive an allowance in lieu of membership of a 
Company-run pension scheme.
Base salary is the only component of remuneration that is pensionable.
Up to 30% of base salary . The level of payment in lieu of a pension paid to Executive Directors is not 
dependent on performance.
BENEFITS
In order to attract and retain Executive Directors with the capability of driving 
our corporate strategy, we need to provide a range of market-competitive 
benefits similar to the benefits they would receive if they were to work for 
one of our competitors.
It is important that our Executive Directors are free to focus on the 
Company’s business without being diverted by concerns about medical 
provision, risk benefit cover or, if required, relocation issues.
A wide range of benefits may be provided depending on the benefits 
provided for comparable roles in the location in which the Executive 
Director is based. These benefits will include, as a minimum, healthcare 
cover , life assurance, long-term disability, annual medical examinations, 
company car or car allowance. The Committee retains the discretion to 
provide additional benefits where necessary or relevant in the context of 
the Executive’s location.
Where applicable, relocation costs may be provided in line with Company’s 
relocation policy for employees, which may include removal costs, 
assistance with accommodation, living expenses for self and family and 
financial consultancy advice. In some cases such payments may be 
grossed up. 
The policy is framed by the nature of the benefits that the Remuneration 
Committee is willing to provide to Executive Directors. The maximum 
amount payable will depend on the cost of providing such benefits to 
an employee in the location at which the Executive Director is based. 
Shareholders should note that the cost of providing comparable benefits  
in different jurisdictions may vary widely .
As an indication, the cost of such benefits provided in 2013 was as follows:
 – Olivier Bohuon €80,705
 – Julie Brown £14,400
The maximum amount payable in benefits to an Executive Director, in 
normal circumstances, will not be significantly more than amounts paid 
in 2013 (or equivalent in local currency). The Remuneration Committee 
retains the right to pay more than this should the cost of providing the 
same underlying benefits increase or in the event of a relocation. A full 
explanation will be provided in the Implementation Report should the cost 
of benefits provided be significantly higher.
The level and cost of benefits provided to Executive Directors is not 
dependent on performance but on the package of benefits provided to 
comparable roles within the relevant location.
ALL-EMPLOYEE ARRANGEMENTS
ALL-EMPLOYEE SHARE PLANS
To enable Executive Directors to participate in all-employee share plans on 
the same basis as other employees.
ShareSave Plans are operated in the UK and 27 other countries 
internationally . In the US, an Employee Stock Purchase Plan is operated. 
These plans enable employees to save on a regular basis and then buy 
shares in the Company . Executive Directors are able to participate in such 
plans on a similar basis to other employees, depending on where they 
are located.
Executive Directors may currently invest up to £250 per month in the UK 
ShareSave Plan. The Remuneration Committee may exercise its discretion 
to increase this amount up to the maximum permitted by the HM Revenue 
& Customs. Similar limits will apply in different locations.
The potential gains from all-employee plans are not based on performance 
but are linked to growth in the share price.

ANNUAL INCENTIVES
ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN – CASH INCENTIVE
To motivate and reward the achievement of specific annual financial and 
business objectives related to the Company’s strategy and sustained 
through a clawback mechanism explained more fully in the notes.
The objectives which determine the payment of the annual cash 
incentive and the level of the annual equity award are linked closely to the 
Group strategy .
The financial measures of revenue, trading profit and cash flow underlie our 
strategy for growth and the need to generate cash to fund future growth.
The business objectives are also linked to the Group strategy . These 
change from year to year to reflect the evolving strategy, but will typically 
be linked to the Strategic Priorities set out in this Annual Report. The 
Implementation Report each year will explain how each objective is linked 
to a specific strategic priority.
For example, a Reinvestment objective links to the priority of improving 
the efficiency of the business model and investment in higher growth 
segments and geographies and Processes and People objectives link to 
developing the right organisation.
The Annual Incentive Plan comprises a cash and an equity component, 
both based on the achievement of financial and business objectives set at 
the start of the year .
The cash component is paid in full after the end of the performance year .
At the end of the year , the Remuneration Committee determines the extent 
to which performance against these has been achieved and sets the 
award level.
The total maximum payable under the Annual Incentive Plan is 215% of 
base salary (150% Cash Incentive and 65% Equity Incentive).
50% salary awarded for threshold performance.
100% salary awarded for target performance.
150% salary awarded for maximum performance.
Performance assessed against individual objectives and Group 
financial targets.
The cash and share awards are subject to malus and clawback as detailed 
in the notes following this table. 
70% of the cash component is based on financial performance measures, 
which currently include revenue, trading profit and trading cash. The 
Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adopt any financial 
performance measure that is relevant to the Company .
30% of the cash component is based on other business goals linked 
to the Company’s strategy, which could include financial and non-
financial measures.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to apply a multiplier , 
adjusting the outcome up or down by 10% to reward or penalise conduct 
in respect of leadership, corporate reputation, ethics, organisational 
behaviours and representing the Company both internally and externally .
The maximum opportunity shown to the left cannot be exceeded through 
the application of the multiplier .
ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN – EQUITY INCENTIVE
To drive share ownership and encourage sustained high standards through 
the application of a ‘malus’ provision over three years, explained more fully 
in the notes.
The equity award component comprises conditional share awards (made 
at the time of the cash award), with vesting phased over the following 
three years.
The equity component vests 1⁄3, 1⁄3, 1⁄3 on successive award anniversaries, 
only if performance remains satisfactory over each of these three years; 
otherwise the award will lapse.
Participants will receive an additional number of shares equivalent to 
the amount of dividend payable per vested share during the relevant 
performance period.
0% of salary awarded for performance below target.
50% of salary awarded for target performance.
65% of salary awarded for maximum performance.
Performance assessed against individual performance which includes an 
element of Group financial targets.
The Remuneration Committee will use their judgement of the individual’s 
performance in determining the level of equity award that may be awarded 
within the range of 50% to 65% of salary .
The equity component will vest in three equal tranches over a three-
year period, provided that the annual performance conditions set at the 
beginning of each year continue to be met.

Our strategy requires the generation of cash in order to invest for growth. 
Cash flow is therefore a key performance measure in our performance

Growth in our Emerging & International Markets is a key part of our strategy . 
Revenue in our Emerging & International Markets is therefore included as

share plan. 
The Performance Share Programme comprises conditional share awards 
which vest after three years, subject to the achievement of stretching 
performance targets linked to the Company’s strategy .
Awards may be subject to clawback in the event of material financial 
misstatement or misconduct.
Participants will receive an additional number of shares equivalent to 
the amount of dividend payable per vested share during the relevant 
performance period.
Annual awards:
 – 47 .5% of salary for threshold performance.
 – 95% of salary for target performance.
 – 190% of salary for maximum performance.
Currently:
 – 50% of the award vests on achievement of a three-year cumulative 
free cash flow target.
 – 25% of the award vests subject to three-year Total Shareholder Return 
(‘TSR’) at median performance relative to industry peers.
 – 25% of the award vests subject to the achievement of revenue targets

 – These measures are described in more detail in the notes and 
the targets and performance against them will be disclosed in the 
Implementation Report if appropriate.
 – The Performance Share Award will vest on the third anniversary of 
the date of grant, depending on the extent to which the performance 
conditions are met over the three-year period commencing in the year 
the award was made.
 – The Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to change the 
measures and their respective weightings to ensure continuing 
alignment with the Company’s strategy.
 – The cash and share awards are subject to malus and clawback as 
detailed in the notes following this table.
Awards made prior to 2014 were subject to TSR and cash flow targets.
ONE-OFF SHARE AWARDS
In order to implement our Group strategy, we recognise that it is not always 
possible to promote from within the Company . In the event that we recruit 
an Executive Director who is currently employed by another company, we 
recognise that we might be required to compensate that Executive Director 
for cash or share awards, they may forfeit on leaving their former employer . 
Our policy regarding such awards is detailed in the notes.
One-off share awards may be made under the provisions of Listing 
Rule 9 .4.2 to facilitate the appointment of a new Executive Director . 
Such awards will be made on a case-by-case basis depending on the 
circumstances at the time to take account of amounts forfeited elsewhere 
on accepting appointment.
Each award will be determined on a case-by-case basis. In normal 
circumstances such awards will be no more beneficial than the value of 
amounts forfeited by the Executive Director on leaving a previous company 
to join the Board.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to apply performance 
conditions to one-off awards if appropriate. However , if it is impossible 
to replicate the vesting conditions applicable to awards granted by other 
companies, awards may be made without performance conditions.

ANNUAL INCENTIVES
ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN – CASH INCENTIVE
To motivate and reward the achievement of specific annual financial and 
business objectives related to the Company’s strategy and sustained 
through a clawback mechanism explained more fully in the notes.
The objectives which determine the payment of the annual cash 
incentive and the level of the annual equity award are linked closely to the 
Group strategy .
The financial measures of revenue, trading profit and cash flow underlie our 
strategy for growth and the need to generate cash to fund future growth.
The business objectives are also linked to the Group strategy . These 
change from year to year to reflect the evolving strategy, but will typically 
be linked to the Strategic Priorities set out in this Annual Report. The 
Implementation Report each year will explain how each objective is linked 
to a specific strategic priority.
For example, a Reinvestment objective links to the priority of improving 
the efficiency of the business model and investment in higher growth 
segments and geographies and Processes and People objectives link to 
developing the right organisation.
The Annual Incentive Plan comprises a cash and an equity component, 
both based on the achievement of financial and business objectives set at 
the start of the year .
The cash component is paid in full after the end of the performance year .
At the end of the year , the Remuneration Committee determines the extent 
to which performance against these has been achieved and sets the 
award level.
The total maximum payable under the Annual Incentive Plan is 215% of 
base salary (150% Cash Incentive and 65% Equity Incentive).
50% salary awarded for threshold performance.
100% salary awarded for target performance.
150% salary awarded for maximum performance.
Performance assessed against individual objectives and Group 
financial targets.
The cash and share awards are subject to malus and clawback as detailed 
in the notes following this table. 
70% of the cash component is based on financial performance measures, 
which currently include revenue, trading profit and trading cash. The 
Remuneration Committee retains the discretion to adopt any financial 
performance measure that is relevant to the Company .
30% of the cash component is based on other business goals linked 
to the Company’s strategy, which could include financial and non-
financial measures.
The Remuneration Committee has the discretion to apply a multiplier , 
adjusting the outcome up or down by 10% to reward or penalise conduct 
in respect of leadership, corporate reputation, ethics, organisational 
behaviours and representing the Company both internally and externally .
The maximum opportunity shown to the left cannot be exceeded through 
the application of the multiplier .
ANNUAL INCENTIVE PLAN – EQUITY INCENTIVE
To drive share ownership and encourage sustained high standards through 
the application of a ‘malus’ provision over three years, explained more fully 
in the notes.
The equity award component comprises conditional share awards (made 
at the time of the cash award), with vesting phased over the following 
three years.
The equity component vests 1⁄3, 1⁄3, 1⁄3 on successive award anniversaries, 
only if performance remains satisfactory over each of these three years; 
otherwise the award will lapse.
Participants will receive an additional number of shares equivalent to 
the amount of dividend payable per vested share during the relevant 
performance period.
0% of salary awarded for performance below target.
50% of salary awarded for target performance.
65% of salary awarded for maximum performance.
Performance assessed against individual performance which includes an 
element of Group financial targets.
The Remuneration Committee will use their judgement of the individual’s 
performance in determining the level of equity award that may be awarded 
within the range of 50% to 65% of salary .
The equity component will vest in three equal tranches over a three-
year period, provided that the annual performance conditions set at the 
beginning of each year continue to be met.

Executive Directors
Changes to remuneration policy
The remuneration policy described in the future policy table – Executive 
Directors is the same remuneration policy in respect of Executive 
Directors that has been in force since the beginning of 2012. It is 
anticipated that this policy will apply at least until the Annual General 
Meeting in 2017 . The only changes made have been to introduce a third 
performance measure to our Performance Share Programme and to 
increase the maximum monthly contribution under the UK  
ShareSave Plan to £500 in line with the maximum permitted by  
HM Customs & Excise.
Performance measures – Annual Incentive Plan
The performance measures which apply to the Annual Incentive Plan for 
Executive Directors comprise 70% financial measures and 30% business 
goals linked to the Company’s strategy, which could include financial and 
non-financial measures.
The financial measures may differ from year to year to provide continued 
alignment with the Company strategy. Measures to be used in 2014 
are detailed in the Implementation Report. Each year the measures are 
chosen in order to relate to our Strategic Priorities and in turn to our key 
performance indicators, which are set out in this Annual Report. The 
performance targets are set by taking into account the strategy of the 
Company and are designed to be realistic yet stretching.
The business measures will differ from year to year as the evolving 
corporate strategy means that we will wish to set Executive Directors 
different business objectives in order to meet the current corporate 
needs. The business objectives are personal to each Executive Director , 
and are tailored to reflect their role and responsibilities during the year. 
These are set at the start of the year and reflect the most important areas 
of strategic focus for the Company. The Remuneration Committee sets 
annual measurement criteria (performance targets) that are appropriate 
to motivate and measure an Executive Director’s performance in any one 
year . The factors taken into consideration include the three-year strategic 
plan, prior years’ delivered performance and budgeted performance. In 
the past, measures have included R&D investment, succession planning, 
employee engagement, compliance, development of product portfolio, 
M&A activity and shared services implementation.
Performance measures – Performance Share Programme
The performance measures which apply to the Performance Share 
Programme awards made in 2014 relate to cumulative free cash flow, 
revenue in Emerging & International Markets and Total Shareholder 
Return. We have chosen three measures which are relevant for the long-
term success of the Company. 
The free cash flow measure is important for us in a period of 
growth, when we need to generate cash to fund both organic and 
inorganic investment.
Revenue in Emerging & International Markets is important for us when 
we are seeking to generate profitable revenue in new markets and from 
new products. 
The Total Shareholder Return measure, which compares our long-term 
performance against that of our peers, seeks to align the payout of the 
Performance Share Programme with the experience of our shareholders. 
This helps Executive Directors relate to the shareholder experience and 
ensure that vesting is aligned to the out-performance of our sector .
The Remuneration Committee will keep these performance measures 
under review and retains the discretion to alter the measures or 
their respective weightings to ensure continuing alignment to the 
corporate strategy.
Malus and clawback
The Remuneration Committee may determine that an unvested award 
or part of an award may not vest (regardless of whether or not the 
performance conditions have been met) or may determine that any cash 
bonus, vested shares, or their equivalent value in cash be returned to the 
Company in the event that any of the following matters is discovered:
 – A material misstatement of the Company’s financial results; or
 – A material error in determining the extent to which any performance 
condition has been satisfied; or
 – A significant adverse change in the financial performance of the 
Company, or a significant loss at a general level or at the division or 
function in which a participant worked; or
 – Inappropriate conduct (for example reputational issues), capability 
or performance by a participant, or within a team business area or 
profit centre.
These provisions apply to share awards under the Global Share Plan 
2010 and cash amounts under the Annual Cash Incentive Plan.

Policy on recruitment arrangements
Our policy on the recruitment of Executive Directors is to pay a fair 
remuneration package for the role being undertaken and the experience 
of the Executive Director appointed. In terms of base salary, we will seek 
to pay a salary comparable, in the opinion of the Committee, to that which 
would be paid for an equivalent position elsewhere. The Remuneration 
Committee will determine a base salary in line with the policy and having 
regard to the parameters set out on in the future policy table. Incoming 
Executive Directors will be entitled to pension, benefit and incentive 
arrangements which are the same as provided to existing Executive 
Directors. On that basis, awards would not exceed 405% of base salary.
We recognise that in the event that we require a new Executive Director 
to relocate to take up a position with the Company, we will also pay 
relocation and related costs as described in the future policy table, which 
is in line with the relocation arrangements we operate across the Group.
We also recognise that in many cases, an external appointee may forfeit 
sizeable cash bonuses and share awards if they choose to leave their 
former employer and join us. The Remuneration Committee therefore 
believes that we need the ability to compensate new hires for incentive 
awards they give up on joining us. The Committee will use its discretion 
in setting any such compensation, which will be decided on a case-
by-case basis. We will only provide compensation which is no more 
beneficial than that given up by the new appointee and we will seek 
evidence from the previous employer to confirm the full details of bonus 
or share awards being forfeited. As far as possible, we will seek to 
replicate forfeited share awards using Smith & Nephew incentive plans 
or through reliance on 9 .4.2 in the Listing Rules, whilst at the same time 
aiming for simplicity. 
If we appoint an existing employee as an Executive Director of the 
Company, pre-existing obligations with respect to remuneration, such 
as pension, benefits and legacy share awards, will be honoured. Should 
these differ materially from current arrangements, these will be disclosed 
in the next Implementation Report. 
We will supply details via an announcement to the London Stock 
Exchange of an incoming Executive Director’s remuneration 
arrangements at the time of their appointment.
Service contracts
We employ Executive Directors on rolling service contracts with notice 
periods of up to 12 months from the Company and six months from 
the Executive Director. On termination of the contract, we may require 
the Executive Director not to work their notice period and pay them an 
amount equivalent to the base salary and payment in lieu of pension and 
benefits they would have received if they had been required to work their 
notice period. 
Under the terms of the Executive Director’s service contract, Executive 
Directors are restricted for a period of 12 months after leaving the 
employment of the Company from working for a competitor , soliciting 
orders from customers and offering employment to employees of Smith 
& Nephew. The Company retains the right to waive these provisions in 
certain circumstances. In the event that these provisions are waived and 
the former Executive Director commences employment earlier than at the 
end of the notice period, no further payments shall be made in respect 
of the portion of notice period not worked. Directors’ service contracts 
are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office: 15 Adam 
Street, London WC2N 6LA.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > <
DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION REPORT Policy on payment for loss of office
Our policy regarding termination payments to departing Executive 
Directors is to limit severance payments to pre-established contractual 
arrangements. In the event that the employment of an Executive 
Director is terminated, any compensation payable will be determined in 
accordance with the terms of the service contract between the Company 
and the Executive Director , as well as the rules of any incentive plans.
Under normal circumstances (excluding termination for gross 
misconduct) all leavers are entitled to receive termination payments 
in lieu of notice equal to base salary, payment in lieu of pension, and 
benefits. In some circumstances additional benefits may become 
payable to cover reimbursement of untaken holiday leave, repatriation 
and outplacement fees, legal and financial advice. 
In addition, we may also in exceptional circumstances exercise our 
discretion to pay the Executive Director a proportion of the annual cash 
incentive they would have received had they been required to work their 
notice period. Any entitlement or discretionary payment may be reduced 
in line with the Executive Director’s duty to mitigate losses, subject to 
applying our non-compete clause.
We will supply details via an announcement to the London Stock 
Exchange of a departing Executive Director’s termination arrangements 
at the time of departure.
In the case of a change of control which results in the termination of 
an Executive Director or a material alteration to their responsibilities or 
duties, within 12 months of the event, the Executive Director would be 
entitled to receive 12 months’ base salary plus payment in lieu of pension 
and benefits. In addition, the Remuneration Committee has discretion 
to pay an Executive Director in these circumstances an annual cash 
incentive. For Directors appointed prior to 1 November 2012, an automatic 
annual cash incentive is payable at target.
In the event that an Executive Director leaves for reasons of ill-health, 
death, redundancy or retirement in agreement with the Company, then 
the vesting of any outstanding annual cash incentive and equity incentive 
awards will generally depend on the Remuneration Committee’s 
assessment of performance to date. Performance share awards will be 
pro-rated for the time worked during the relevant performance period, 
and will remain subject to performance over the full performance period.
For all other leavers, the annual cash incentive will generally be forfeited 
and outstanding equity incentive awards and performance share awards 
will lapse.
One-off awards granted on appointment will normally lapse on leaving 
except in cases of death, retirement, redundancy, or ill-health. The 
Remuneration Committee has discretion to permit such awards to vest 
in other circumstances and will be subject to satisfactorily meeting 
performance conditions if applicable.
The Remuneration Committee retains discretion to alter these provisions 
on a case-by-case basis following a review of circumstances and to 
ensure fairness for both shareholders and Executive Directors.
We will supply details via an announcement to the London Stock 
Exchange of an out-going Executive Director’s remuneration 
arrangements around the time of leaving.
Policy on shareholding requirements
The Remuneration Committee believes that one of the best ways our 
Executive Directors can have a greater alignment with shareholders 
is for them to hold a significant number of shares in the Company. 
Executive Directors are therefore expected to build up a holding of 
Smith & Nephew shares worth two times their base salary. In order to 
reinforce this expectation, we require them to retain 50% of all shares 
vesting under the Company share plans (after tax) until this holding 
has been met recognising that differing international tax regimes affect 
the pace at which an Executive Director may fulfil the shareholding 
requirement. When calculating whether or not this requirement has 
been met, we will include ordinary shares or ADRs held by the Executive 
Director and their immediate family and the intrinsic value of any vested 
but unexercised options.
Statement of consideration of employment conditions 
elsewhere in the Company and differences to the 
Executive Director Policy
All employees across the Group including the Executive Directors are 
incentivised in a similar manner . Although the salary levels and maximum 
opportunities under bonus and share plans differ , generally speaking 
the same targets and performance conditions relating to the Company’s 
strategy apply throughout the organisation.
Executive Director base salaries will generally increase at a rate in line 
with the average salary increases awarded across the Company. Given 
the diverse geographic markets within which the Company operates, the 
Committee will generally be informed by the average salary increase in 
both the market local to the Executive and the UK, recognising the 
Company’s place of listing, and will also consider market data periodically .
A range of different pension arrangements operate across the Group 
depending on location and/or length of service. Executive Directors and 
Executive Officers either participate in the legacy pension arrangements 
relevant to their local market or receive a cash payment of 30% of salary 
in lieu of a pension. Senior Executives who do not participate in a local 
Company pension plan receive a cash payment of 20% of salary in lieu 
of pension. Differing amounts apply for lower levels within the Company.
The Company has established a benefits framework under which the 
nature of benefits varies by geography. Executive Directors participate in 
benefit arrangements similar to those applied for employees within the 
applicable location.
All employees are set objectives at the beginning of each year , which 
link through to the objectives set for the Executive Directors. Annual 
cash incentives payable to employees across the Company depend on 
the satisfactory completion of these objectives as well as performance 
against relevant Group and divisional financial targets relating to revenue, 
trading profit and trading cash, similar to the financial targets set for the 
Executive Directors.
Executive Officers and Senior Executives (72 as at 2014) participate 
in the annual Equity Incentive Programme and the Performance 
Share Programme. The maximum amounts payable are lower , but 
the performance conditions are the same as those that apply to the 
Executive Directors.
No specific consultation with employees has been undertaken relating 
to Director remuneration. However , regular employee surveys are 
conducted across the Group, which cover a wide range of issues relating 
to local employment conditions and an understanding of Group-wide 
strategic matters. As at 2014, over 4,500 employees in 32 countries 
participate in one or more of our global share plans.

ANNUAL FEES
BASIC ANNUAL FEE
To attract and retain Directors by setting fees at 
rates comparable to what would be paid in an 
equivalent position elsewhere.
A proportion of the fees are paid in shares in 
the third quarter of each year in order to align 
Non-Executive Directors’ fees with the interest 
of shareholders.
Fees will be reviewed periodically . In future, any 
increase will be paid in shares until 25% of the 
total fee is paid in shares.
Fees are set in line with market practice for fees 
paid by similarly sized UK listed companies. 
Annual fees are set and paid in UK Sterling or 
US Dollars depending on the location of the 
Non-Executive Director . If appropriate, fees may 
be set and paid in alternative currencies.

DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION REPORT Notes to Future policy table –  
Non-Executive Directors
Changes to remuneration policy
The Board has altered the policy regarding the payment of Non-Executive 
Directors and to the Chairman in one respect in 2013, by introducing the 
payment of a proportion of the fees in the form of shares. The fees paid 
to the Non-Executive Directors and to the Chairman were reviewed in 
July 2013 and it was agreed that the basic fee should be increased by 5% 
(there having been no increase to these fees since August 2011) and that 
the increase be paid in the form of shares. The amount of the increase 
less applicable taxes was used to purchase shares in the market on 
15 August 2013. Going forward, any increase in the level of fees paid to a 
Non-Executive Director will be paid in the form of shares until 25% of the 
Non-Executive Director’s fee is paid in the form of shares. We have made 
this change in order to align the fees paid to Non-Executive Directors with 
the experience of our shareholders. With the appointment of Roberto 
Quarta as Chairman of the Company with effect from the Annual General 
Meeting, we have taken the opportunity to pay 25% of his fees in the 
form of shares immediately.
Policy on recruitment arrangements
Any new Non-Executive Director shall be paid in accordance with the 
current fee levels on appointment, in line with the policy set out above. 
With respect to the appointment of a new Chairman, fee levels will take 
into account market rates, the individual’s profile and experience, the 
time required to undertake the role and general business conditions. 
In addition, the Remuneration Committee retains the right to authorise 
the payment of relocation assistance or an accommodation allowance 
in the event of the appointment of a Chairman not based within the UK.
Letters of appointment
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment 
which set out the terms under which they provide their services to the 
Company and are available for inspection at the Company’s registered 
office: 15 Adam Street, London WC2N 6LA. The appointment of Non-
Executive Directors is not subject to a notice period, nor is there any 
compensation payable on loss of office, for example, should they not 
be re-elected at an Annual General Meeting. The appointment of the 
Chairman is subject to a notice period of six months.
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors are required to acquire a 
shareholding in the Company equivalent in value to one times their basic 
fee within two years of their appointment to the Board.
Statement of consideration of shareholder views
This Policy Report sets out the remuneration policy in relation to Executive 
Directors, which has been in place since 2012. As this policy evolved at 
the end of 2011 and during 2012, we engaged actively with shareholders 
to explain our remuneration arrangements and to discuss their views 
on our proposals. At the time, Joseph Papa, the Chairman of the 
Remuneration Committee and members of the Senior Executive Team 
met with the holders of around 30% of our shares, including collectively 
with a number of smaller engaged investors, as well as shareholder 
advisory bodies. We discussed the structure of our remuneration 
package, our policies on termination, recruitment, shareholding 
requirements and the operation of Annual Incentive Plan. The Directors’ 
Remuneration Report was approved by 96% of shareholders who voted 
at the Annual General Meeting in 2013 and we received feedback from 
shareholders around the time of this meeting that they understood and 
approved of our remuneration arrangements. Although the remuneration 
policy has remained essentially unchanged as in previous years, 
given the changes in remuneration reporting, we also conducted an 
engagement programme with our larger shareholders in 2013. Joseph 
Papa met with the holders of around 20% of our shares, and with a 
number of shareholder advisory bodies. He has also been available to 
discuss any aspect of our remuneration programme with shareholders 
throughout the year . The shareholders who have engaged with us have 
all been supportive of our approach to remuneration, recognising the link 
between the corporate strategy and executive reward.

> > < GROUP 
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing this Annual Report and 
Form 20-F Information and the Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements, in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare group and parent 
company financial statements for each financial year; the Group 
financial statements are required to be prepared in accordance with 
IFRSs, as adopted by the EU, and applicable law and the Directors 
have elected to prepare the Parent Company Financial Statements 
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including FRS 101 
Reduced Disclosure Framework.
Under company law directors must not approve financial statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of a group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that 
period. In preparing each of the Group and Parent Company Financial 
Statements, the Directors are required to: 
 − select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 − make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent; 
 − for the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have been 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs, as adopted by the EU; 
 − for the Parent Company Financial Statements, state whether 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to 
any material departures disclosed and explained in the Parent 
Company Financial Statements; and
 − prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless 
it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the Parent 
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records 
that are sufficient to show and explain the Parent Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Parent Company and enable them to ensure 
that its Financial Statements comply with the Companies Act. They have 
general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably open to 
them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect 
fraud and other irregularities. 
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also 
responsible for preparing a compliant Strategic Report, Directors’ 
Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate 
Governance Statement. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK governing the preparation and dissemination of 
financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement of the Directors in respect 
of the Annual Report
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
 − the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable 
set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the Group; and
 − the Strategic Report and Directors’ Report includes a fair review of 
the development and performance of the business and the financial 
position of the Group, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face.
We consider the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s position 
and performance, business model and strategy.

Directors’ Responsibilities for, and Report on, Internal 
Control over Financial Reporting
The Directors are responsible for establishing and maintaining 
adequate internal control over financial reporting. Smith & Nephew’s 
internal control over financial reporting is designed to provide 
reasonable assurance over the reliability of financial reporting and the 
preparation of consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with 
generally accepted accounting principles.
Due to its inherent limitations, internal control over financial reporting 
may not prevent or detect misstatements. Projections of any evaluation 
of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risks that controls 
may become inadequate because of changes in conditions or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies or procedures may deteriorate.
The Directors assessed the effectiveness of Smith & Nephew’s internal 
control over financial reporting as at 31 December 2015 based on the 
criteria set forth by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the 
Treadway Commission in Internal Control-Integrated Framework (2013). 
Based on this assessment, the Directors believe that, as at 
31 December 2015, the internal control over financial reporting is 
effective based on those criteria.
KPMG LLP , an independent registered public accounting firm, has 
audited the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting as 
at 31 December 2015 and, as explained on page 105, has issued an 
unqualified report thereon.

Report of Independent Registered Public 
Accounting firms
The Board of Directors and Shareholders Smith & Nephew plc:
We have audited the accompanying Group balance sheet of Smith & 
Nephew plc and subsidiaries as of 31 December 2015 and the related 
Group income statement, Group statement of comprehensive income, 
Group cash flow statement and Group statement of changes in equity, 
for the year then ended. We also have audited Smith & Nephew plc’s 
internal control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2015, based 
on criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (‘COSO’). Smith & Nephew plc’s management is 
responsible for these Group financial statements, for maintaining 
effective internal control over financial reporting, and for its assessment 
of the effectiveness of internal control over financial reporting, included 
in the accompanying Evaluation of Internal Controls. Our responsibility 
is to express an opinion on these Group financial statements and an 
opinion on the Company’s internal control over financial reporting 
based on our audits.
We conducted our audits in accordance with the standards of the 
Public Company Accounting Oversight Board (United States). 
Those standards require that we plan and perform the audits to obtain 
reasonable assurance about whether the financial statements are free 
of material misstatement and whether effective internal control over 
financial reporting was maintained in all material respects. Our audits 
of the Group financial statements included examining, on a test basis, 
evidence supporting the amounts and disclosures in the financial 
statements, assessing the accounting principles used and significant 
estimates made by management, and evaluating the overall financial 
statement presentation. Our audit of internal control over financial 
reporting included obtaining an understanding of internal control over 
financial reporting, assessing the risk that a material weakness exists, 
and testing and evaluating the design and operating effectiveness of 
internal control based on the assessed risk. Our audits also included 
performing such other procedures as we considered necessary in the 
circumstances. We believe that our audits provide a reasonable basis 
for our opinions.
A company’s internal control over financial reporting is a process 
designed to provide reasonable assurance regarding the reliability of 
financial reporting and the preparation of financial statements for 
external purposes in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles. A company’s internal control over financial reporting includes 
those policies and procedures that (i) pertain to the maintenance of 
records that, in reasonable detail, accurately and fairly reflect the 
transactions and dispositions of the assets of the company; (ii) provide 
reasonable assurance that transactions are recorded as necessary to 
permit preparation of financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles, and that receipts and expenditures of 
the company are being made only in accordance with authorisations of 
management and directors of the company; and (iii) provide reasonable 
assurance regarding prevention or timely detection of unauthorised 
acquisition, use, or disposition of the company’s assets that could have 
a material effect on the financial statements.
Because of its inherent limitations, internal control over financial 
reporting may not prevent or detect misstatements. Also, projections of 
any evaluation of effectiveness to future periods are subject to the risk 
that controls may become inadequate because of changes in 
conditions, or that the degree of compliance with the policies or 
procedures may deteriorate.
In our opinion, the Group financial statements referred to above present 
fairly, in all material respects, the financial position of Smith & Nephew 
plc and subsidiaries as of 31 December 2015, and the results of their 
operations and their cash flows for the year then ended, in conformity 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board and in conformity with IFRS 
as adopted by the European Union. Also in our opinion, Smith & 
Nephew plc maintained, in all material respects, effective internal 
control over financial reporting as of 31 December 2015, based on 
criteria established in Internal Control – Integrated Framework (2013) 
issued by the Committee of Sponsoring Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (‘COSO’).
As discussed in Note 2 to the Group financial statements, in 2015 
Smith & Nephew plc elected to change the composition of its 
reportable segments. We also have audited the adjustments to the 
2014 and 2013 Group financial statements to retrospectively reflect the 
change in composition of reportable segments. In our opinion, such 
adjustments are appropriate and have been properly applied. We were 
not engaged to audit, review, or apply any procedures to the 2014 or 
2013 Group financial statements of Smith & Nephew plc and 
subsidiaries other than with respect to the adjustments and, accordingly, 
we do not express an opinion or any other form of assurance on the 
2014 or 2013 Group financial statements taken as a whole.

Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of Smith & Nephew plc for 
the year ended 31 December 2015 set out on pages 111 to 170. 
In our opinion: 
The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2015 
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended:
 − The Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the European Union; 
 − The parent company financial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards, including 
FRS 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework; and
 − The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006; and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Separate opinion in relation to IFRS as issued by the 
International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) 
As explained in the accounting policies set out in the Group Financial 
Statements, the Group, in addition to complying with its legal obligation 
to apply IFRS as adopted by the EU, has also applied IFRS as issued by 
the IASB. In our opinion, the Consolidated Financial Statements comply 
with IFRS as issued by the IASB.
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In light of this being the first year of our audit we familiarised ourselves 
with the business by spending a significant amount of time both at the 
Company’s head office in London and key operating locations around 
the world. Our primary objective during this phase was to understand 
the business model of the Group, the risks inherent in that business 
model and how these are mitigated.
We also met with key functional leaders including: legal; IT; compliance; 
human resources; and business development to understand the 
priorities, challenges and risks inherent in the changes arising from 
the ongoing simplification programme of the Group. 
We considered the strength of the Group’s control environment, 
the relative maturity and sophistication of the IT infrastructure and 
the impact of the simplification programme on financial controls over 
key processes and transactions. 
These assessments highlighted the key areas of financial statement risk 
that our audit was focused on. Those that had the greatest effect on our 
audit are set out below, together with our procedures to address these 
areas. Any comments that we make on the results of our procedures 
should be read in the context of our opinion on the financial statements 
as a whole.
Inventory valuation: $1,217 million 
THE RISK OUR RESPONSE AND CONCLUSIONS
The Group has high levels of finished goods some of which are located 
at customer premises to be available for immediate use. Complete sets 
of products, including outsizes, have to be made available in this way, 
with these sizes used less frequently. Towards the end of a product’s 
life cycle, these inventory levels are more than is required and therefore 
excess to requirements.
In estimating the net realisable value for inventory, management has to 
apply judgement on how much of the inventory on hand will ultimately 
be used.
The key inputs used in estimating the Excess and Obsolescence (E&O) 
provision include historic sales for significant product lines and 
expected future usage of inventory. 
On a sample basis we corroborated historic sales back to underlying 
source data. We also corroborated on a sample basis the expected 
usage of inventory with the Director’s plans for launching new product 
lines or discontinuing product lines. 
We considered the historical accuracy of the provision against actual 
inventory write-offs.
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of inventory valuation.
As a result, we satisfied ourselves that inventory provisions have been 
prepared in line with policy and are supportable on the basis of 
historical trends as well as management’s expectations for future sales 
and inventory management plans.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < Revenue: $4,634 million 
THE RISK OUR RESPONSE AND CONCLUSIONS
Revenue is recognised when the risks and rewards are passed to 
the customer. 
Revenue recognition is one of the key judgemental areas for our audit, 
particularly in respect of estimates made for contractual rebates, 
chargebacks and returns which are deducted in arriving at revenue 
from wholesale customers and distributors.
Our principal audit procedures included: testing the Group’s controls 
surrounding revenue recognition and key controls in the order-to-cash 
transaction cycle. This included reconciliations between sales systems 
and the general ledger; assessing whether appropriate revenue 
recognition policies are applied through comparison with accounting 
standards; and performing testing over revenue at significant 
components, which included analysis of product sales year-on-year, 
corroborating movements compared with expectations and inspection 
of contracts with customers. 
Our audit work in respect of the accrual rebates, chargebacks and 
returns involved testing key controls including the Group’s review of 
chargebacks, returns and rebates. 
We also assessed the accuracy of the accrual calculation, corroborated 
inputs and key assumptions, both to source documents, and 
considered the historical accuracy of the accrual.
We also assessed the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures of its 
revenue recognition policy, the judgment involved and other 
related disclosures.
The results of our testing were satisfactory and we concur that revenue 
recognition is appropriate.

(ACCOUNTING POLICY AND FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES)
Litigation reserves and contingent liabilities ($303 million included in provisions)
THE RISK OUR RESPONSE AND CONCLUSIONS
The development, manufacture and sale of medical devices entails risk 
of product liability claims and patent infringement issues due to the 
technological nature of the products and the competitive nature of the 
industry. Determining the impact and likely outcome of any litigation 
matters is inherently subjective and the amounts involved are 
potentially material.
As disclosed in Note 17 a provision of $185 million has been 
recognised in the year in respect of potential liabilities arising from the 
ongoing exposure for Metal on Metal implants.
We tested the Group’s controls surrounding litigation and contingent 
liabilities, inspected legal invoices and corresponded directly with 
external legal advisers to understand the fact patterns and ensure that 
all significant cases had been adequately considered. 
We tested the estimates of provisions, including their assessment of 
potential royalties payable for past sales, and expected settlement of 
product liability cases. We challenged the assumptions made based 
on the fact pattern of similar historic cases.
For the liability recognised in respect of the expected payouts for Metal 
on Metal cases we involved our actuarial specialists to review the 
critical assumptions used in statistical projections in determining the 
estimate. The key assumptions included: expected number of 
claimants; projected value of each settlement; and the likely time 
period expected for settlement. 
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of litigation reserves and contingent liabilities.
The results of our testing were satisfactory and we concur that the 
costs in respect of litigation and contingent liabilities is appropriate.

Valuation of acquired intangible assets (included in intangible assets of $1,502 million) 
THE RISK OUR RESPONSE AND CONCLUSIONS
The Group has capitalised acquired intangibles of which the most 
significant relate to recent acquisitions in respect of ArthroCare 
(acquired in 2014) and Healthpoint (acquired in 2012).
There is a risk that due to changes in the competitive landscape, 
regulatory or other external factors the acquired assets underperform 
in comparison to their original investment case and that the carrying 
value may be impaired. 
An impairment charge of $40 million has been recognised in the 
current year in relation to an acquired brand, Oasis, from the 
Healthpoint acquisition which has underperformed against the original 
investment case.
Our audit procedures included testing the principles and integrity of 
the Group’s discounted cash flow models and corroborating the 
assumptions made on revenue and profitability projections.
We tested the sensitivity of key assumptions to the value in use 
calculated. We also assessed whether the Group’s disclosures about 
the sensitivity of the outcome of the impairment assessment to 
changes in key assumptions reflected the key risks inherent in the 
valuation of acquired intangibles.
As a result of our work, we determined that the quantum of impairment 
recognised in 2015 was appropriate. For those intangible assets, where 
management determined no impairment was required, we found that 
these judgements were supported by reasonable assumptions.

(ACCOUNTING POLICY) AND PAGES 133 TO 134 (FINANCIAL DISCLOSURES) 
Tax provisioning (included in current tax payable of $ 263 million)
THE RISK OUR RESPONSE AND CONCLUSIONS
Accruals for tax contingencies require the Directors to make 
judgements and estimates in relation to tax issues and exposures 
given that the Group operates in a number of tax jurisdictions, the 
complexities of transfer pricing and other international tax legislation 
and the time taken for tax matters to be agreed with the tax authorities.
In this area our audit procedures included the use of our own 
international and local tax specialists to assess the Group’s tax 
positions, its correspondence with the relevant tax authorities, and to 
analyse and challenge the assumptions used to determine tax 
provisions based on our knowledge and experiences of the 
application of the international and local legislation by the relevant 
authorities and courts. 
We also considered the adequacy of the Group’s disclosures in 
respect of tax and uncertain tax positions.
From the evidence obtained, we considered the level of provisioning to 
be acceptable in the context of the Group financial statements taken 
as a whole.

our audit
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole was set at 
$44 million, determined with reference to a benchmark of 5% of Group 
profit before tax normalised to exclude acquisition related costs of 
$12 million, impairment charges of $51 million, restructuring and 
rationalisation expenses of $65 million and legal and other charges of 
$190 million as disclosed in Note 3. We believe that pre-tax profit 
excluding these items provides us with a consistent year-on-year basis 
for determining materiality and is the most relevant performance 
measure to the shareholders of the entity.

Of the Group’s 143 reporting components, we subjected 60 to full 
scope audits for Group reporting purposes, nine to audits of specific 
account balances. The latter were not individually financially significant 
to require an audit for Group reporting purposes, but were included in 
the scope of our Group reporting work in order to provide further 
coverage over the identified risks and the Group’s results.
The remaining 22% of total Group revenue, 5% of Group profit before 
tax and 13% of total Group assets is represented by 74 reporting 
components, none of which individually represented more than 5% of 
any of total Group revenue, Group profit before tax or total Group 
assets. For these remaining components, we performed analysis at an 
aggregated Group level to re-examine our assessment that there were 
no significant risks of material misstatement within these. 
The Group audit team instructed component auditors as to the 
significant areas to be covered, including the relevant risks detailed 
above and the information to be reported back. The Group audit team 
approved the component materialities which ranged from $5 million to 
$35 million, having regard to the mix of size and risk profile of the Group 
across the components. The work on 32 of the 69 components was 
performed by component auditors and the rest by the Group 
audit team.
The Group audit team visited 24 components in USA, China, UK, Brazil, 
Australia, Italy, Germany and Switzerland. Telephone conference 
meetings were also held with these component auditors and the 
majority of the others that were not physically visited. At these visits 
and meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit team were 
discussed in more detail, and any further work required by the Group 
audit team was then performed by the component auditor.

Act 2006 is unmodified

 − The part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
 − The information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ 
Report for the financial year for which the financial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

5 We have nothing to report on the disclosures of principal risks
Based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
nothing material to add or draw attention to in relation to: 
 − The Directors’ statement of viability statement on page 49, concerning 
the principal risks, their management, and, based on that, the 
Directors’ assessment and expectations of the Group’s continuing in 
operation over the three years to December 2018; or 
 − The disclosures in Note 1 of the financial statements concerning the 
use of the going concern basis of accounting.
6 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on which 
we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, based 
on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have identified 
other information in the Annual Report that contains a material 
inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial statements, 
a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
 − We have identified material inconsistencies between the knowledge 
we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ statement that they 
consider that the Annual Report and financial statements taken as 
a whole is fair, balanced and understandable and provides the 
information necessary for shareholders to assess the Group’s 
position and performance, business model and strategy; or
 − The Audit Committee report does not appropriately address matters 
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
 − Adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
 − The parent company financial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
 − Certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < The Group prepares its consolidated financial statements in 
accordance with IFRS as issued by the IASB and IFRS as adopted by the 
EU, the application of which often requires judgements to be made by 
management when formulating the Group’s financial position and 
results. Under IFRS, the Directors are required to adopt those 
accounting policies most appropriate to the Group’s circumstances for 
the purpose of presenting fairly the Group’s financial position, financial 
performance and cash flows.
In determining and applying accounting policies, judgement is often 
required in respect of items where the choice of specific policy, 
accounting estimate or assumption to be followed could materially 
affect the reported results or net asset position of the Group; it may later 
be determined that a different choice would have been 
more appropriate.
The Group’s significant accounting policies are set out in Notes 1 to 23 
of the Notes to the Group accounts. Of those, the policies which require 
the most use of management’s judgement are as follows:
Valuation of inventories
A feature of the Orthopaedic Reconstruction and Trauma & Extremities 
franchise (whose finished goods inventory make up approximately 79% 
of the Group’s total finished goods inventory) is the high level of product 
inventory required, some of which is located at customer premises and 
is available for customers’ immediate use. Complete sets of products, 
including large and small sizes, have to be made available in this way. 
These sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards 
the end of the product life cycle are inevitably in excess of 
requirements. Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required to 
be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this situation. 
These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based 
on levels of inventory compared with historical usage. This formula is 
applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a 
product group has been on the market for two years. This method of 
calculation is considered appropriate based on experience, but it does 
involve management judgement on customer demand, effectiveness of 
inventory deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old 
products and efficiency of manufacturing planning systems.
Impairment
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill, intangible assets and 
property, plant and equipment, a number of significant assumptions 
have to be made when preparing cash flow projections. These include 
the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for 
the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired businesses or 
products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory 
approvals. If actual results should differ or changes in expectations 
arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely 
impact operating results.
Liability provisioning
The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant 
degree of estimation. Provision is made for loss contingencies when it 
is considered probable that an adverse outcome will occur and the 
amount of the loss can be reasonably estimated. In making its 
estimates, management takes into account the advice of internal and 
external legal counsel. Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts 
updated where necessary to reflect developments in the disputes. 
The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on 
the outcome of court proceedings and settlement negotiations or if 
investigations brings to light new facts.
Taxation
The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world. 
Although it is Group policy to submit its tax returns to the relevant tax 
authorities as promptly as possible, at any given time the Group has 
years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax audits. 
Significant issues may take several years to resolve. In estimating the 
probability and amount of any tax charge, management takes into 
account the views of internal and external advisers and updates the 
amount of provision whenever necessary. The ultimate tax liability may 
differ from the amount provided depending on interpretations of tax 
law, settlement negotiations or changes in legislation.
Business combinations
The Group has identified ‘growth through acquisitions’ as one of its 
Strategic Priorities. During 2014, we acquired ArthroCare Corporation; 
the determination of the balance sheet fair value acquired is dependent 
upon the understanding of the circumstances at acquisition and 
estimates of the future results of the acquired business and 
management judgement is a factor in making these determinations.
Operating segments
In making decisions about the prioritisation and allocation of the 
Group’s resources, the Commercial Operations team (‘CommOps’, 
the body considered to be the Chief Operating Decision Maker) review 
financial information on an integrated basis for the Group as a whole 
and determines the best allocation of resources to group-wide projects. 
In assessing performance, CommOps also consider financial 
information presented on a geographical selling region and product 
franchise basis for revenue. Financial information for corporate and 
functional costs in presented on a Group-wide basis.
In applying the requirements of IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, the Group 
considers the fact that the prioritisation and allocation of resources by 
CommOps being determined at Group level on a project by basis 
results in the Group having one operating segment.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < Commentary on the Group income statement  
and Group statement of comprehensive income
Revenue
Group revenue increased by $17m, 0% on a reported basis, from 
$4,617m in 2014 to $4,634m in 2015.
The underlying increase is 4%, after adjusting for the 4% impact of 
acquisitions and the 8% attributable to the unfavourable impact of 
currency movements.
Established Markets had an underlying growth of 3% and Emerging 
Markets had an underlying growth of 11%, both of which contributed to 
the Group increase of 4%.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold decreased by $19m, 2% on a reported basis, from 
$1,162m in 2014 to $1,143m in 2015. The movement is primarily due to 
the strengthening of the US Dollar which more than offsets the increase 
in volume from acquisitions and underlying trading.
During 2015, no restructuring and rationalisation expenses (2014 – 
$12m) and acquisition related costs (2014 – $23m) were charged to cost 
of goods sold.
Selling, general and administrative expenses 
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $170m  
(7% on a reported basis) from $2,471m in 2014 to $2,641m in 2015. 
The underlying movement is 7% after adjusting for net impact of 7% 
from acquisitions and unfavourable currency movements of 7%.
In 2015, administrative expenses included amortisation of software and 
other intangible assets of $66m (2014 – $62m), $65m of restructuring 
and rationalisation expenses (2014 – $49m), an amount of $204m 
relating to amortisation and impairment of acquired intangibles (2014 – 
$129m), $12m of acquisition related costs (2014 – $95m) and $203m 
relating to anticipated and settled metal-on-metal hip claims and 
additional expenses primarily relating to the RENASYS distribution hold 
in the US. These expenses were offset by a net gain of $33m relating to 
a patent litigation and past service and curtailment gains of $19m  
(2014 – $46m) arising on US and UK post-retirement benefits.
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenditure as a percentage of revenue 
remained broadly consistent at 4.8% in 2015 (2014 – 5.1%). 
Actual expenditure was $222m in 2015 compared to $235m in 2014. 
The Group continues to invest in innovative technologies and products 
to differentiate it from competitors.
Operating profit
Operating profit decreased by $121m from $749m in 2014 to $628m 
in 2015.
This movement was primarily driven by the benefits of the Group 
Optimisation programme and synergies from the ArthroCare acquisition 
in 2014, offset by the costs relating to anticipated and settled metal-on-
metal hip claims.
Interest income/(expense)
Net interest expense increased by $16m from a net $22m expense in 
2014 to a net $38m expense in 2015. This movement is primarily due to 
an increase in interest expense due to the financing of the ArthroCare 
acquisition in 2014.
Other finance costs
Other finance costs in 2015 increased by $4m and principally relates to 
costs associated with the Group’s retirement benefit schemes.
Taxation
The taxation charge decreased by $64m to $149m from $213m in 2014.
After adjusting for specific transactions that management considers 
affect the Group’s short-term profitability (restructuring and 
rationalisation expenses, amortisation of acquisition intangibles, 
acquisition related costs and legal and other items) the tax rate on 
trading profit was 26.8% (2014 – 27.7%).

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < Commentary on the Group balance sheet
Non-current assets
Non-current assets decreased by $174m to $4,692m in 2015 from 
$4,866m in 2014. This is principally attributable to the following:
 − Property, plant and equipment increased by $41m from $891m in 
2014 to $932m in 2015. There were $303m of additions together with 
$6m acquired with the Colombia and Russia acquisitions which were 
offset by $11m of assets disposed. Depreciation of $226m was 
charged during 2015 and there were unfavourable currency 
movements of $31m.
 − Goodwill decreased by $15m from $2,027m in 2014 to $2,012 in 2015. 
This movement relates to additions of $10m from the acquisition in 
Colombia and $24m from the acquisition in Russia. This was offset 
by unfavourable currency movements of $49m which decreased the 
overall goodwill balance.
 − Intangible assets decreased by $245m from $1,747m in 2014 to 
$1,502 in 2015. There were additions of $55m in 2015 relating to 
intellectual property, distribution rights and software acquired 
together with $19m acquired with the Colombia and Russia 
acquisitions. Amortisation and impairment during 2015 was $270m 
and there were unfavourable currency movements of $45m.
 − Investments in associates increased to $115m from $112m in 2014. 
The increase was attributable to a capital contribution to Bioventus of 
$25m and other investment gains of $2m, offset by an investment 
loss in Bioventus of $18m and a reclassification of an associate to 
investments of $6m due to a change in shareholding.
 − Deferred tax assets increased by $28m in the year from $77m in 
2014 to $105m in 2015. The net deferred tax position has changed 
from a liability of $21m in 2014 to an asset of $28m in 2015. The net 
movement of $49m is mainly due to the creation of the metal-on-
metal hip claim provision and amortisation of certain acquired 
intangibles, offset by a reduction in retirement benefit obligations.
Current assets
Current assets increased by $35m to $2,475m from $2,440m in 2014. 
The movement relates to the following:
 − Inventories rose by $36m to $1,217m in 2015 from $1,181 in 2014. 
This movement is driven by inventory acquired with the Colombia 
and Russia acquisitions and a general increase across the Emerging 
Markets. This was offset by unfavourable currency movements 
of $63m.
 − The level of trade and other receivables decreased by $28m to 
$1,138m in 2015 from $1,166m in 2014. The movement primarily 
relates to the $17m increase in the bad debt provision as well as 
unfavourable currency movements.
 − Cash at bank has increased by $27m from $93m in 2014 to $120m 
in 2015. Refer to the Group cash flow statement and related 
commentary on pages 116 and 117 for further detail.
Non-current liabilities
Non-current liabilities decreased by $247m from $2,104m in 2014 to 
$1,857m in 2015. This movement principally relates to:
 − Long-term borrowing decreased from $1,666m in 2014 to $1,434m 
in 2015 principally due to repayments of bank debt.
 − The retirement benefit obligation decreased from $233m in 2014 to 
$184m in 2015 due to past cost adjustments arising from plan 
amendments in the UK and US, increases in discount rates and 
supplementary cash contributions.
 − Deferred tax liabilities decreased by $21m from $98m in 2014 to 
$77m in 2015. Refer to commentary within non-current assets for 
explanation of the net deferred tax position movement.
 − The impact of the above was partly offset by an increase in 
non-current provisions, primarily relating to the estimated costs to 
resolve all future known and anticipated metal-on-metal hip claims.
Current liabilities
Current liabilities increased by $182m from $1,162m in 2014 and 
$1,344m in 2015. This movement is attributable to:
 − Bank overdrafts and loans increased by $7m from $39m in 2014 to 
$46m in 2015.
 − Provisions increased by $126m from $67m in 2014 to $193m in 2015 
primarily due to an increase in legal provision for known and 
anticipated metal-on-metal hip claims.
 − Current tax payables increased by $45m from $218m in 2014 to 
$263m, mainly attributable to differences in the timing of cash tax 
payments year-on-year .
Total equity
Total equity decreased by $74m from $4,040m in 2014 to $3,966m 
in 2015. The principal movements were:

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < Commentary on the Group cash flow statement
The main elements of the Group’s cash flow and movements in net 
debt can be summarised as follows:
Net cash inflow from operating activities
Cash generated from operations in 2015 of $1,203m (2014 – $961m, 
2013 – $1,138m) is after paying out $36m (2014 – $112m, 2013 – $25m) 
of acquisition-related costs, $52m (2014 – $60m, 2013 – $54m) of 
restructuring and rationalisation expenses and $3m (2014 – $23m, 
2013 – $nil) relating to legal and other costs.
Capital expenditure
The Group’s ongoing capital expenditure and working capital 
requirements were financed through cash flow generated by business 
operations and, where necessary, through short-term committed and 
uncommitted bank facilities. In 2015, capital expenditure on tangible 
and intangible fixed assets represented approximately 8% of continuing 
Group revenue (2014 – 8%, 2013 – 8%).
In 2015, capital expenditure amounted to $358m (2014 – $375m, 
2013 – $340m). The principal areas of investment were the placement 
of orthopaedic instruments with customers, patents and licences, plant 
and equipment and information technology.
At 31 December 2015, $24m (2014 – $34m, 2013 – $41m) of capital 
expenditure had been contracted but not provided for which will be 
funded from cash inflows.
Acquisitions and disposals
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group acquired 
businesses in Colombia and Russia for consideration, net of cash 
acquired, of $44m. In November 2015, the Group invested $25m 
in its associate, Bioventus. 
During 2014, the Group received repayment of the $160m loan note 
to Bioventus and $28m of accrued interest. Proceeds of $20m were 
received on the disposal of the Group’s manufacturing plant in 
Gilberdyke, UK.
Dividends
The 2014 final dividend of 18.6 US cents per ordinary share totalling 
$166m was paid on 6 May 2015. The 2015 interim dividend of 11.8 US 
cents per ordinary share totalling $106m was paid on 27 October 2015.
Share buy-backs
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group purchased a total 
of 4.4m (2014 – 4.6m) ordinary shares at a cost of $77m (2014 – $75m).
Liquidity and capital resources
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it has sufficient funding and 
facilities in place to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements.
At 31 December 2015, the Group held $102m (2014 – $65m, 2013 – 
$126m) in cash net of bank overdrafts. The Group had committed 
facilities available of $2,425m at 31 December 2015 of which $1,425m 
was drawn. Smith & Nephew intends to repay the amounts due within 
one year by using available cash and drawing down on the longer-term 
facilities. In addition, Smith & Nephew has finance lease commitments 
of $10m.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group refinanced its 
principal banking facilities. The Group signed a new five-year 
committed $1bn multi-currency revolving credit facility with a maturity 
date of March 2019. This maturity date has since been extended to 
March 2020. In April 2015, the Group signed a new three-year, $300m 
bilateral term loan with one of its relationship banks. The new term loan 
has a maturity date of April 2018. The proceeds of this new loan were 
used to repay the remaining outstanding amount on the committed 
term loan used to fund the acquisition of ArthroCare.
The principal variations in the Group’s borrowing requirements result 
from the timing of dividend payments, acquisitions and disposals of 
businesses, timing of capital expenditure and working capital 
fluctuations. Smith & Nephew believes that its capital expenditure 
needs and its working capital funding for 2016, as well as its other 
known or expected commitments or liabilities, can be met from its 
existing resources and facilities. The Group’s net debt decreased from 
$1,613m at the beginning of 2015 to $1,361m at the end of 2015, 
representing an overall decrease of $252m.
The Group’s planned future contributions are considered adequate 
to cover the current underfunded position in the Group’s defined 
benefit plans.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < 1 Basis of preparation
Smith & Nephew plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company 
incorporated in England and Wales. In these accounts, the ‘Group’ 
means the Company and all its subsidiaries. The principal activities 
of the Group are to develop, manufacture, market and sell medical 
devices and services.
As required by the European Union’s IAS Regulation and the 
Companies Act 2006, the Group has prepared its accounts in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’) as 
adopted by the European Union (‘EU’) effective as at 31 December 2015. 
The Group has also prepared its accounts in accordance with IFRS as 
issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (‘IASB’) 
effective as at 31 December 2015. IFRS as adopted by the EU differs in 
certain respects from IFRS as issued by the IASB. However, the 
differences have no impact for the periods presented.
The preparation of accounts in conformity with IFRS requires 
management to use estimates and assumptions that affect the 
reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent 
assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported 
amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
The accounting policies requiring management to use significant 
estimates and assumptions are: inventories, impairment, taxation, 
liability provisions, business combinations and disclosures in segmental 
reporting. These are discussed under Critical accounting policies on 
page 111. Although these estimates are based on management’s best 
knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately may 
differ from those estimates. Estimates and underlying assumptions are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to estimates are 
recognised prospectively. 
The Directors continue to adopt the going concern basis for accounting 
in preparing the annual financial statements. The Directors have a 
reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future.
As described in Note 15, the Group meets its funding requirements 
through a mixture of shareholders’ funds, bank borrowings and private 
placement notes. At 31 December 2015, the Group had committed 
borrowing facilities of $2.4bn and total liquidity of $1.1bn, including net 
cash and cash equivalents of $102m and undrawn committed 
borrowing facilities of $1bn. The earliest expiry date of the Group’s 
committed borrowing facilities is in respect of a $300m bilateral term 
loan facility due to expire in April 2018.
The Group’s forecasts and projections, taking into account reasonably 
possible changes in trading performance, show that the Group has 
sufficient financial resources. The Directors have reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group are well placed to 
manage their business risks and to continue in operational existence 
for a period of at least three years from the date of the approval of the 
financial statements. Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the 
going concern basis (in accordance with the guidance ‘Going Concern 
and Liquidity Risk: Guidance for Directors of UK Companies 2009’ 
issued by the FRC) in preparing the consolidated financial statements.
There have been no new accounting pronouncements impacting the 
Group in 2015.
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and 
interpretations are effective for the Group’s annual periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2016, and have not been applied in preparing 
these consolidated accounts. With the exception of the new leasing 
standard IFRS 16 Leases, which was issued on 13 January 2016 and will 
become effective from 1 January 2019, for which the extent of the 
impact is still being determined, none of these are expected to have a 
significant effect on the consolidated accounts of the Group.
1.1 Consolidation
The Group accounts include the accounts of Smith & Nephew plc and 
its subsidiaries for the periods during which they were members of 
the Group.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an 
entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns from its 
involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns 
through its power over the entity. Subsidiaries are consolidated in the 
Group accounts from the date that the Group obtains control, and 
continue to be consolidated until the date that such control ceases. 
Intra-group balances and transactions, and any unrealised income and 
expenses arising from intra-group transactions, are eliminated on 
consolidation. All subsidiaries have year ends which are co-terminus 
with the Groups, with the exception of jurisdictions whereby a different 
year end is required by local legislation.
When the Group loses control over a subsidiary, it derecognises the 
assets and liabilities of the subsidiary and any related components 
of equity. Any resulting gain or loss is recognised in profit or loss. 
Any retained interest in the former subsidiary is measured at fair value.
1.2 Foreign currencies
Functional and presentation currency
The Group accounts are presented in US Dollars, which is the 
Company’s functional currency.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the respective 
functional currencies of Group companies at exchange rates at the 
dates of the transactions. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are retranslated to the functional currency as at the 
exchange rate at the reporting date. Non-monetary items are 
not retranslated.
Foreign operations
Balance sheet items of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair 
value adjustments arising on acquisition are translated into US Dollars 
on consolidation at the exchange rates at the reporting date. 
Income statement items and the cash flows of foreign operations are 
translated at average rates as an approximation to actual transaction 
rates, with actual transaction rates used for large one off transactions.
Foreign currency differences are recognised in Other comprehensive 
income and accumulated in ‘Other reserves’ within equity. 
These include: exchange differences on the translation at closing rates 
of exchange of non-US Dollar opening net assets; the differences 
arising between the translation of profits into US Dollars at actual 
(or average, as an approximation) and closing exchange rates; to the 
extent that the hedging relationship is effective, the difference on 
translation of foreign currency borrowings or swaps that are used to 
finance or hedge the Group’s net investments in foreign operations; and 
the movement in the fair value of forward foreign exchange contracts 
used to hedge forecast foreign exchange cash flows.
The exchange rates used for the translation of currencies into US 
Dollars that have the most significant impact on the Group results were:
2015 2014 2013
Average rates 
Sterling 1.53 1.65 1.56

2 Business segment information
The Group has historically reported two operating segments, Advanced Surgical Devices (‘ASD’) and Advanced Wound Management (‘AWM’). 
On 1 January 2015, the Group completed its transition to a new commercial organisational structure as part of the Group Optimisation programme. 
The resultant effect of these restructuring activities is that the Group is now engaged in a single business activity, being the development, 
manufacture and sales of medical technology products and services.
Development, manufacturing, supply chain and central functions are managed globally for the Group as a whole. Sales are managed through six 
geographical selling regions, with each having a president who is responsible for the commercial review of that region. The Commercial Operations 
team (‘CommOps’), comprises geographical presidents and certain heads of function and is chaired by the Chief Executive Officer (‘CEO’). 
CommOps is the body through which the CEO uses the authority delegated to him by the Board of Directors to manage the operations and 
performance of the Group. All significant operating decisions regarding the allocation and prioritisation of the Group’s resources and assessment 
of the Group’s performance are made by CommOps, and whilst the members have individual responsibility for the implementation of decisions 
within their respective areas, it is at the CommOps level that these decisions are made. Accordingly, CommOps is considered to be the Group’s 
Chief Operating Decision Maker (‘CODM’) as defined by IFRS 8 Operating Segments.
In making decisions about the prioritisation and allocation of the Group’s resources, CommOps review financial information on an integrated basis 
for the Group as a whole and determines the best allocation of resources to Group-wide projects. This information is prepared substantially on the 
same basis as the Group’s IFRS financial statements aside from the adjustments described in Note 2.2. In assessing performance, CommOps also 
consider financial information presented on a geographical selling region and product franchise basis for revenue. Financial information for 
corporate and functional costs is presented on a Group-wide basis. 
The types of products and services offered by the Group’s global business segment are as follows:
 − Sports Medicine Joint Repair, which offers surgeons a broad array of instruments, technologies and implants necessary to perform minimally 
invasive surgery of the joints;
 − Arthroscopy Enabling Technologies, which offers healthcare providers a variety of technologies such as fluid management equipment for 
surgical access, high definition cameras, digital image capture, scopes, light sources and monitors to assist with visualisation inside the joints, 
radio frequency wands, electromechanical and mechanical blades, and hand instruments for removing damaged tissue;
 − Trauma & Extremities, consisting of internal and external devices used in the stabilisation of severe fractures and deformity 
correction procedures;
 − Other Surgical Businesses, which includes gynaecological instrumentation as well as various products and technologies to assist in surgical 
treatment of the ear, nose and throat;
 − Knee Implants, which offers an innovative range of products for specialised knee replacement procedures;
 − Hip Implants, which offers a range of specialist products for reconstruction of the hip joint;
 − Advanced Wound Care, which includes products for the treatment of acute and chronic wounds, including leg, diabetic and pressure ulcers, 
burns and post-operative wounds;
 − Advanced Wound Devices, which consists of traditional and single-use Negative Pressure Wound Therapy and hydrosurgery systems; and
 − Advanced Wound Bioactives, which includes biologics and other bioactive technologies that provide unique approaches to debridement and 
dermal repair/regeneration.
The segment information is prepared in conformity with the accounting policies of the Group and the accounting standard IFRS 8 
Operating Segments.
The segment profit measure reported to CommOps for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment is trading profit before interest, and 
related income tax expense and excludes the effects of non-recurring income and expenditure from one-off items as discussed in Note 2.2 below. 
Group financing (including interest receivable and payable) is managed on a net basis outside of the business segment.
The results and other information as required of the single segment are shown below. Segment information from the prior year has been restated 
to conform to the one global segment view, in order to provide more meaningful comparison.

> > < 2.1 Revenue by business segment and geography
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Revenue comprises sales of products and services to third parties at amounts invoiced net of trade discounts and rebates, excluding taxes on 
revenue. Revenue from the sale of products is recognised upon transfer to the customer of the significant risks and rewards of ownership. 
This is generally when goods are delivered to customers. There is no significant revenue associated with the provision of discrete services. 
Sales of inventory located at customer premises and available for customers’ immediate use are recognised when notification is received that 
the product has been implanted or used. Appropriate provisions for returns, trade discounts and rebates are deducted from revenue. 
Rebates comprise retrospective volume discounts granted to certain customers on attainment of certain levels of purchases from the Group. 
These are accrued over the course of the arrangement based on estimates of the level of business expected and adjusted at the end of the 
arrangement to reflect actual volumes.
Segment revenue reconciles to statutory revenues and other income from continuing operations as follows:

Trading profit is a trend measure which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific transactions that 
management considers affects the Group’s short-term profitability. The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their understanding of 
trends. The Group has identified the following items, where material, as those to be excluded from operating profit when arriving at trading profit: 
acquisition and disposal-related items including amortisation of acquisition intangibles and impairments; significant restructuring events; gains and 
losses arising from legal disputes; and significant uninsured losses. Further detail is provided in Notes 3.3, 3.4 and 3.5. Operating profit reconciles

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Research and development
Research expenditure is expensed as incurred. Internal development expenditure is only capitalised if the recognition criteria in IAS 38 
Intangible Assets have been satisfied. The Group considers that the regulatory, technical and market uncertainties inherent in the development 
of new products mean that in most cases development costs should not be capitalised as intangible assets until products receive approval from 
the appropriate regulatory body. 
Payments to third parties for research and development projects are accounted for based on the substance of the arrangement. If the 
arrangement represents outsourced research and development activities the payments are generally expensed except in limited circumstances 
where the respective development expenditure would be capitalised under the principles established in IAS 38. By contrast, the payments are 
capitalised if the arrangement represents consideration for the acquisition of intellectual property developed at the risk of the third party. 
Capitalised development expenditures are amortised on a straight-line basis over their useful economic lives from product launch.
Advertising costs
Advertising costs are expensed as incurred.

manage this currency risk.
5 Taxation
ACCOUNTING POLICY
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-assessable or disallowed. It is calculated 
using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
The Group operates in multiple tax jurisdictions around the world and records provisions for taxation liabilities and tax audits when it is 
considered probable that a tax charge will arise and the amount can be reliably estimated. Although Group policy is to submit its tax returns to 
the relevant tax authorities as promptly as possible, at any time the Group has years outstanding and is involved in disputes and tax audits. 
Significant issues may take many years to resolve. In estimating the probability and amount of any tax charge, management takes into account 
the views of internal and external advisers and updates the amount of the provision whenever necessary. The ultimate tax liability may differ 
from the amount provided depending on interpretations of tax law, settlement negotiations or changes in legislation.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes. 
Deferred tax is not recognised for: temporary differences related to investments in subsidiaries and associates where the Group is able to 
control the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that this will not reverse in the foreseeable future; on the initial 
recognition of non-deductible goodwill; and on the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination 
and that, at the time of the transaction, does not affect the accounting or taxable profit.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which they can be used. 
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date. 
Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis, and at the tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date 
that are expected to apply in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. It is recognised in the income statement except when it relates 
to items credited or charged directly to other comprehensive income or equity, in which case the deferred tax is also recognised within other 
comprehensive income or equity respectively.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority, when the Group intends to 
settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis and that authority permits the Group to make a single net payment.

deferred taxation adjustments mainly relate to a reclassification from current to deferred taxation and tax accrual to tax return adjustments.
The tax charge was reduced by $130m (2014 – $71m reduction and 2013 – $40m reduction) as a consequence of acquisition-related costs, 
restructuring and rationalisation costs, amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles, and legal and other.
Factors affecting future tax charges
The Group operates in numerous tax jurisdictions around the world and is subject to factors that may affect future tax charges, including tax rate 
changes, tax legislation changes and resolution of tax audits and disputes. At any given time the Group has years outstanding in various countries 
and is involved in tax audits and disputes, some of which may take several years to resolve. The ultimate tax liability may differ from the amount 
provided depending on interpretations of tax law, settlement negotiations or changes in legislation.
In 2015, the UK Government enacted legislation to reduce the main rate of UK statutory corporation tax to 19.0% from 1 April 2017 and 18.0% from 
1 April 2020.
The UK standard rate of corporation tax for 2015 is 20.3% (2014 – 21.5%, 2013 – 23.3%). Overseas taxation is calculated at the rates prevailing in the

The Group has unused gross tax losses of $125m (2014 – $92m) available for offset against future profits. A deferred tax asset has been 
recognised in respect of $29m (2014 – $47m) of these losses. No deferred tax asset has been recognised on the remaining unused tax losses 
as they are not expected to be realised in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences in respect of investments in 
subsidiaries and associates for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised is approximately $467m (2014 – $449m).

ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the profit attributable to equity holders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in 
issue during the year, excluding shares held by the Company in the Employees’ Share Trust or as treasury shares.
Diluted earnings per share
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the basic earnings per share for the effect of conversion to ordinary shares associated with 
dilutive potential ordinary shares, which comprise share options and awards granted to employees.
Adjusted earnings per share
Adjusted earnings per share is a trend measure, which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the impact of specific 
transactions that management considers affects the Group’s short-term profitability. The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their 
understanding of trends. Adjusted attributable profit is the numerator used for this measure. The Group has identified the following items as 
those to be excluded when arriving at adjusted attributable profit: acquisitions and disposals related items including amortisation of acquisition 
intangible assets and impairments; significant restructuring events; significant gains and losses arising from legal disputes and significant 
uninsured losses; and taxation thereon. 
The calculations of the basic, diluted and adjusted earnings per ordinary share are based on the following attributable profit and numbers

7 Property, plant and equipment
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses.
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost of items of property, plant and equipment less their estimated residual values using the straight-
line method over their estimated useful lives, and is generally recognised in profit or loss. Leased assets are depreciated over the shorter of the 
lease term and their useful lives unless it is reasonably certain that the Group will obtain ownership by the end of the lease term. Freehold land 
is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives of items of property, plant and equipment is 3–20 years and for buildings is 20–50 years. 
Assets in course of construction are not depreciated until they are available for use.
Depreciation methods, useful lives and residual values are reviewed at each reporting date and adjusted if appropriate. 
Finance costs relating to the purchase or construction of property, plant and equipment and intangible assets that take longer than one year to 
complete are capitalised based on the Group weighted average borrowing costs. All other finance costs are expensed as incurred.
Impairment of assets
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the 
carrying value may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent 
of impairment loss. Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing 
value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market 
assessment of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.

book value of $6m (2014 – $8m) are included within land and buildings.
The impairment charge in the prior year relates to certain assets which related to the production of HP802, which the Group decided not 
to continue.
Historically, capital expenditure represents the Group’s expected annual investment in property, plant and equipment and other intangible assets. 
This varies between 6% and 8% (2014 – 6% and 8%) of annual revenue. 
Group capital expenditure relating to property, plant and equipment contracted but not provided for amounted to $20m (2014 – $27m).
The amount of borrowing costs capitalised in 2015 and 2014 was minimal.

8 Goodwill
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment annually. Goodwill is allocated to the cash-generating unit (‘CGU’) that is expected to 
benefit from the acquisition. The recoverable amount of CGUs to which goodwill has been allocated is tested for impairment annually. The CGUs 
identified by management are at the aggregated product franchise levels of Reconstruction, Other Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound 
Management, in the way the business is managed and the way the core assets are used to generate cash flows.
If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount then an impairment loss is determined to have occurred. 
Any impairment losses that arise are recognised immediately in the income statement and are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of 
goodwill and then to the carrying amounts of the other assets of the CGU.
In carrying out impairment reviews of goodwill a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow projections. 
These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability of acquired 
businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals. If actual results should differ, or changes in 
expectations arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results.

The Group has historically identified two CGUs, being Advanced Surgical Devices and Advanced Wound Management, and tested the goodwill 
balance for impairment at this level. Following the completion of the Group’s business reorganisation in 2015, management has identified four 
CGUs in applying the provisions of IAS 36 Impairment of Assets: Reconstruction, Other Surgical Devices, Advanced Wound Care & Devices 
and Bioactives.
For the purpose of goodwill impairment testing, the Advanced Wound Care & Devices and Bioactives CGUs have been aggregated (Advanced 
Wound Management), as this is the level at which goodwill is monitored and level at which the economic benefits relating to the goodwill within 
these CGUs is realised.
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s CGUs as follows:
2015  
$ million
Reconstruction 557
Other Surgical Devices 1,140
Advanced Wound Management 315
2,012
Impairment reviews were performed in September 2015 and 2014 by comparing the recoverable amount of each CGU with its carrying amount, 
including goodwill. These were updated during December, taking into account any significant events that occurred between September 
and December.
For each CGU, the recoverable amounts are based on value-in-use which is calculated from pre-tax cash flow projections for five years using data 
from the Group’s budget and strategic planning process, the results of which are reviewed and approved by the Board. These projections exclude 
any estimated future cash inflows or outflows expected to arise from future restructurings. The five-year period is in-line with the Group’s strategic 
planning process.
In determining the growth rates used in the calculations of the value-in-use, management considered annual revenue growth. Projections are 
based on anticipated volume and value growth in the markets served by the Group and assumptions as to market share movements. Each year 
the projections for the previous year are compared to actual results and variances are factored into the assumptions used in the current year. 
The discount rates used in the value-in-use calculations reflect management’s assessment of risks specific to the assets of each CGU.
8.1 Reconstruction CGU
The sales growth and trading profit margin used in the value-in-use calculation for the Reconstruction CGU reflects management’s distinctive 
orthopaedic reconstruction strategy, which combines cutting edge innovation, disruptive business models and a strong Emerging Markets platform 
to drive outperformance.
Revenue growth rates for the five-year period ranged from 2.1% to 8.6% for the various components of the Reconstruction CGU. The weighted 
average growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the five-year period in calculating the terminal value is 5.6%. The pre-tax discount 
rate used in the Reconstruction CGU value-in-use calculation is 10.3%.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < 8.2 Other Surgical Devices CGU
The value-in-use calculation for the Other Surgical Devices CGU reflects growth rates and trading profit margins consistent with management’s 
strategy to rebalance Smith & Nephew towards higher growth areas such as, for example, Sports Medicine.
Revenue growth rates for the five-year period ranged from 1.2% to 13.5% for the various components of the Other Surgical Devices CGU. 
The weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the five-year period in calculating the terminal value is 5.6%. 
The pre-tax discount rate used in the Other Surgical Devices CGU value-in-use calculation is 10.3%.
8.3 Advanced Wound Management CGU
The aggregated Advanced Wound Management CGU comprises the Advanced Wound Care & Devices and Bioactives CGUs.
In performing the value-in-use calculation for this combined CGU, management considered the Group’s focus across the wound product 
franchises, focusing on widening access to the customer, the higher added value sectors of healing chronic wounds and tissue repair using 
bioactives, and by continuing to improve efficiency.
Revenue growth rates for the five-year period ranged from 3.8% to 20.5% for the various components of the Advanced Wound Management CGU. 
The weighted average growth rate used to extrapolate the cash flows beyond the five-year period in calculating the terminal value is 6.7%. 
The pre-tax discount rate used in the Advanced Wound Management CGU value-in-use calculation is 10.3%.
8.4 Sensitivity to changes in assumptions used in value-in-use calculations
The calculations of value-in-use for the identified CGUs are most sensitive to changes in discount and growth rates. Management’s consideration 
of these sensitivities is set out below:
 − Growth of market and market share – Management has considered the impact of a variance in market growth and market share. The value-in-
use calculations shows that if the assumed long-term growth rates were reduced to nil, the recoverable amount of each CGU would still be 
greater than its carrying value.
 − Discount rate – Management has considered the impact of an increase in the discount rate applied to the value-in-use calculations. 
This sensitivity analysis shows that for the recoverable amount of each CGU to be less than its carrying value, the discount rate would have to be 
increased to 23.2% for the Reconstruction CGU, 28.1% for the Other Surgical Devices CGU and 28.5% for the Advanced Wound Products CGU.
9 Intangible assets
ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business combination (including purchased patents, know-how, trademarks, licences and 
distribution rights) are initially measured at cost. The cost of intangible assets acquired in a material business combination (referred to as 
acquisition intangibles) is the fair value as at the date of acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less any 
accumulated amortisation and any accumulated impairment losses. All intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
estimated useful economic lives. The estimated useful economic life of an intangible asset ranges between three and 20 years depending on 
its nature. Internally-generated intangible assets are expensed in the income statement as incurred.
Purchased computer software and certain costs of information technology projects are capitalised as intangible assets. Software that is integral 
to computer hardware is capitalised as plant and equipment.
Impairment of intangible assets
The carrying values of intangible assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate the carrying value may 
be impaired. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of impairment loss. 
Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the 
cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
An asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s or cash-generating unit’s fair value less costs to sell and its value-in-use. In assessing 
value-in-use, its estimated future cash flow is discounted to its present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects the current market 
assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the asset.
In carrying out impairment reviews of intangible assets a number of significant assumptions have to be made when preparing cash flow 
projections. These include the future rate of market growth, discount rates, the market demand for the products acquired, the future profitability 
of acquired businesses or products, levels of reimbursement and success in obtaining regulatory approvals. If actual results should differ, 
or changes in expectations should arise, impairment charges may be required which would adversely impact operating results.

The carrying values of intangible assets are considered for indicators of impairment and where an indicator, such as declining revenues, is present 
a full impairment review comparing value in use to carrying value is performed.
Two product-related intangible assets were determined to have value in use below carrying value, resulting in an impairment charge being 
recognised. The impairment charge primarily relates to $40m from Oasis, calculated using a discount rate of 11.2% (2014 – 10.2%), a product right 
acquired with the Healthpoint acquisition in 2012. During the year, continued reimbursement pressure has resulted in revenues not increasing at 
the previously expected rate. The remaining carrying value of $45m is supported by the present value of anticipated future cash flows.

> > < 10 Investments
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Investments, other than those related to associates, are initially recorded at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs on the trade 
date. The Group has an investments in an entity that holds mainly unquoted equity securities, which by their nature have no fixed maturity date 
or coupon rate. These investments are classed as ‘available-for-sale’ carried at fair value. The fair value of these investments are based on the 
underlying fair value of the equity securities: marketable securities are valued by reference to closing prices in the market; and non-marketable 
securities are estimated considering factors including the purchase price; prices of recent significant private placements of securities of the 
same issuer and estimates of liquidation value. Changes in fair value are recognised in other comprehensive income except where 
management considers that there is objective evidence of an impairment of the underlying equity securities. Objective evidence would 
include a significant or prolonged decline in the fair value of the investment below its cost less any impairment loss previously recognised. 
Impairment losses are recognised by reclassifying the losses accumulated in other reserves to profit or loss.

11 Investments in associates
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Investments in associates, being those entities over which the Group has a significant influence and which is neither a subsidiary nor a 
joint venture, are accounted for using the equity method, with the Group recording its share of the associates’ profit and loss and other 
comprehensive income. The Group’s share of associates’ profit or loss is included in one separate income statement line and is calculated 
after deduction of their respective taxes. 
At 31 December 2015 and 31 December 2014, the Group holds 49% of Bioventus LLC (‘Bioventus’). Bioventus is a limited liability company operating 
as a partnership. The Company’s headquarters is located in Durham, North Carolina, US. Bioventus focuses its medical product development 
around its core competencies of orthobiologic therapies and orthopaedic diagnostics from which it develops and markets clinically proven 
orthopaedic therapies and diagnostic tools, including osteoarthritis pain treatments, bone growth stimulators and ultrasound devices. 
Bioventus sells bone stimulation devices and is a provider of osteoarthritis injection therapies. The loss after taxation recognised in the income 
statement relating to Bioventus was $18m (2014 – loss after taxation $2m). Of this loss, $11m relates to a change in the acquisition fair value of the 
OsteoAMP liability.
In November 2015, the Group contributed $25m of capital to Bioventus as part of a rights issue, following which the Group’s shareholding in 
Bioventus remained at 49%. The rights issue was to fund the acquisition of Biostructures LLC, a leading medical device company focused on 
developing bioresorbable bone graft products for a broad range of spinal and orthopaedic fusion procedures.
The carrying amount of this investment was reviewed for impairment as at the balance sheet date. For the purposes of impairment testing the 
recoverable amount of this investment was based on its fair value less cost to sell, estimated using discounted cash flows. The fair value 
measurement was categorised as a level 3 fair value based on the inputs and valuation technique used.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet and income statement for associates are as follows:

The Group’s other associate was re-classified to an investment during the year.
12 Inventories
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Finished goods and work-in-progress are valued at factory cost, including appropriate overheads, on a first-in first-out basis. Raw materials and 
bought-in finished goods are valued at purchase price. All inventories are reduced to net realisable value where lower than cost. 
Inventory acquired as part of a business acquisition is valued at selling price less costs of disposal and a profit allowance for selling efforts.
Orthopaedic instruments are generally not sold but provided to customers and distributors for use in surgery. They are recorded as inventory 
until they are deployed at which point they are transferred to plant and equipment and depreciated over their useful economic lives of between 
three and five years.
A feature of the orthopaedic business is the high level of product inventory required, some of which is located at customer premises and is 
available for customers’ immediate use (referred to as consignment inventory). Complete sets of product, including large and small sizes, have to 
be made available in this way. These outer sizes are used less frequently than standard sizes and towards the end of the product life cycle are 
inevitably in excess of requirements. Adjustments to carrying value are therefore required to be made to orthopaedic inventory to anticipate this 
situation. These adjustments are calculated in accordance with a formula based on levels of inventory compared with historical or forecast 
usage. This formula is applied on an individual product line basis and is first applied when a product group has been on the market for two 
years. This method of calculation is considered appropriate based on experience but it involves management judgements on effectiveness of 
inventory deployment, length of product lives, phase-out of old products and efficiency of manufacturing planning systems.

Reserves for excess and obsolete inventories were $322m (2014 – $317m, 2013 – $354m). The increase in reserves of $5m in the year comprised 
$17m charged to the reserve on the write-down of inventory and $3m attributable to business combinations during the year, partially offset by 
foreign exchange movements of $15m.
The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of goods sold amounted to $961m (2014 – $1,013m, 2013 – $958m). 
In addition, $73m was recognised as an expense within cost of goods sold resulting from inventory write-offs (2014 – $55m, 2013 – $73m). 
Notwithstanding inventory acquired within acquisitions, no inventory is carried at fair value less costs to sell in any year.

> > < 13 Trade and other receivables
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Trade and other receivables are carried at amortised cost, less any allowances for uncollectible amounts. They are included in current assets, 
except for maturities greater than 12 months after the balance sheet date. These are classified as non-current assets.
The Group manages credit risk through credit limits which require authorisation commensurate with the size of the limit and which are regularly 
reviewed. Credit limit decisions are made based on available financial information and the business case. Significant receivables are regularly 
reviewed and monitored at Group level. The Group has no significant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of 
customers and geographies. Furthermore, the Group’s principal customers are backed by government and public or private medical insurance 
funding, which historically represent a lower risk of default. The maximum exposure to credit risk at the reporting date is the fair value of each 
class of receivable. The Group does not hold any collateral as security.

Management considers that the carrying amount of trade and other receivables approximates to the fair value.
The provision for bad and doubtful debts is based on specific assessments of risk and reference to past default experience. The bad debt 
expense for the year was $25m (2014 –$4m credit, 2013 – $15m expense). Amounts due from insurers in respect of the macro textured claim of 
$144m (2014 – $143m, 2013 – $138m) are included within other receivables and have been provided in full.

15.3 Liquidity risk exposures 2015
The Board has established a set of policies to manage funding and currency risks. The Group uses derivative financial instruments only to manage 
the financial risks associated with underlying business activities and their financing.
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group is not able to settle or meet its obligations on time or at a reasonable price. The Group’s policy is to ensure 
that there is sufficient funding and facilities in place to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements. The Group manages and monitors liquidity risk 
through regular reporting of current cash and borrowing balances and periodic preparation and review of short and medium-term cash forecasts, 
having regard to the maturities of investments and borrowing facilities.
The Group has available committed facilities of $2.4bn (2014 – $2.5bn). The interest payable on borrowings under committed facilities is either at 
fixed or floating rates. Floating rates are typically based on the LIBOR (or other reference rate) relevant to the term and currency concerned.
The Company is subject to restrictive covenants under its principal facility agreements. These financial covenants are tested at the end of each 
half year for the 12 months ending on the last day of the testing period. As of 31 December 2015, the Company was in compliance with these 
covenants. The facilities are also subject to customary events of default, none of which are currently anticipated to occur.
The Group’s principal facilities are:

15.5 Finance leases
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Leases are classified as finance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. 
All other leases are classified as operating leases.
The leased assets are measured initially at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease 
payments. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised as property, plant or equipment and depreciated accordingly. Minimum lease 
payments are apportioned between the finance expense and the reduction in the outstanding liability. The finance expense is allocated to each 
period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.

years and $nil (2014– $nil) due after five years.
Liquidity and capital resources
The Group’s policy is to ensure that it has sufficient funding and facilities to meet foreseeable borrowing requirements.
At 31 December 2015, the Group held $102m (2014 – $65m, 2013 – $126m) in cash net of bank overdrafts. The Group had committed facilities 
available of $2,425m at 31 December 2015 of which $1,425m was drawn. Smith & Nephew intends to repay the amounts due within one year using 
available cash and drawing down on the longer-term facilities. In addition, the Group has finance lease commitments of $10m.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group refinanced its principal banking facilities. The Group signed a new five-year committed $1bn 
multi-currency revolving credit facility with a maturity date of March 2019. This maturity date has since been extended to March 2020. In April 2015, 
the Group signed a new three year, $300m bilateral term loan with one of its relationship banks. The new term loan has a maturity date of April 
2018. The proceeds of this new loan were used to repay the remaining outstanding amount on the committed term loan used to fund the 
ArthroCare acquisition. 
The principal variations in the Group’s borrowing requirements result from the timing of dividend payments, acquisitions and disposals of 
businesses, timing of capital expenditure and working capital fluctuations. Smith & Nephew believes that its capital expenditure needs and its 
working capital funding for 2016, as well as its other known or expected commitments or liabilities, can be met from its existing resources and 
facilities. The Group’s net debt decreased from $1,613m at the beginning of 2015 to $1,361m at the end of 2015, representing an overall decrease  
of $252m. 
The Group’s planned future contributions are considered adequate to cover the current underfunded position in the Group’s defined benefit plans.
16 Financial instruments and risk management
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
re-measured at their fair value at subsequent balance sheet dates.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are designated and effective as cash flow hedges of forecast third party and 
intercompany transactions are recognised in other comprehensive income until the associated asset or liability is recognised. Amounts taken to 
other comprehensive income are transferred to the income statement in the period in which the hedged transaction affects profit and loss. 
Where the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset, the amounts taken to other comprehensive income are transferred to the initial 
carrying value of the asset.
Currency swaps to match foreign currency net assets with foreign currency liabilities are fair valued at year end. Changes in the fair values of 
currency swaps that are designated and effective as net investment hedges are matched in other comprehensive income against changes in 
value of the related net assets.
Interest rate derivatives transacted to fix interest rates on floating rate borrowings are accounted for as cash flow hedges and changes in the fair 
values resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in other comprehensive income. Amounts taken to other comprehensive 
income are transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects profit and loss.
Interest rate derivatives transacted to convert fixed rate borrowings into floating rate borrowings are accounted for as fair value hedges and 
changes in the fair values resulting from changes in market interest rates are recognised in the income statement.
Any ineffectiveness on hedging instruments and changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting are recognised in the income statement within other finance income/(costs) as they arise.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument recognised in other comprehensive income is retained 
there until the forecast transaction occurs. If a hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in 
other comprehensive income is transferred.

The Group operates in over 100 countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange exposure. It is Group policy 
for operating units not to hold material unhedged monetary assets or liabilities other than in their functional currencies.
Foreign exchange variations affect trading results in two ways. Firstly, on translation of overseas sales and profits into US Dollars and secondly, 
transactional exposures arising where some or all of the costs of sale are incurred in a different currency from the sale. The principal transactional 
exposures arise as the proportion of costs in US Dollars, Sterling and Swiss Francs exceed the proportion of sales in each of these currencies and 
correspondingly the proportion of sales in Euros exceeds the proportion of costs in Euros.
The impact of currency movements on the cost of purchases is partly mitigated by the use of forward foreign exchange contracts. The Group uses 
forward foreign exchange contracts, designated as cash flow hedges, to hedge forecast third party and intercompany trading cash flows up to one 
year. When a commitment is entered into, forward foreign exchange contracts are normally used to increase the hedge to 100% of the exposure. 
Cash flows relating to cash flow hedges are expected to occur within 12 months of inception and profits and losses on hedges are expected to 
enter into the determination of profit (within cost of goods sold) within a further 12-month period. The principal currencies hedged by forward foreign 
exchange contracts are US Dollars, Euros and Sterling. At 31 December 2015, the Group had contracted to exchange within one year the equivalent 
of $1.9bn (2014 – $1.5bn). Based on the Group’s net borrowings as at 31 December 2015, if the US Dollar were to weaken against all currencies by 
10%, the Group’s net borrowings would decrease by $1m (2014 – decrease by $6m) as the Group held a higher amount of foreign denominated 
cash than foreign denominated borrowings.
If the US Dollar were to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 
2015 would have been $42m lower (2014 – $37m). Similarly, if the Euro was to weaken by 10% against all other currencies, then the fair value of the 
forward foreign exchange contracts as at 31 December 2015 would have been $16m higher (2014 – $26m). Movements in the fair value of forward 
foreign exchange contracts would be recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve.
A 10% strengthening of the US Dollar or Euro against all other currencies at 31 December 2015 would have had the equal but opposite effect to the 
amounts shown above, on the basis that all other variables remain constant.
The Group’s policy is to hedge all actual foreign exchange exposures and the Group’s forward foreign exchange contracts are designated as cash 
flow hedges. The net impact of transaction related foreign exchange on the income statement from a movement in exchange rates on the value of 
forward foreign exchange contracts is not significant. In addition, the movements in the fair value of other financial instruments used for hedging 
such as currency swaps for which hedge accounting is not applied, offset movements in the values of assets and liabilities and are recognised 
through the income statement.
16.2 Interest rate exposures
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk on cash, borrowings and certain currency and interest rate swaps which are at floating rates. 
When required the Group uses interest rate derivatives to meet its objective of protecting borrowing costs within parameters set by the Board. 
These interest rate derivatives are accounted for as cash flow hedges and, as such, changes in fair value resulting from changes in market interest 
rates are recognised in other comprehensive income and accumulated in the hedging reserve, with the fair value of the interest rate derivatives 
recorded in the balance sheet.
Additionally, the Group uses interest rate swaps to reduce the overall level of fixed rate debt, within parameters set by the Board. When used in this 
way, interest rate derivatives are accounted for as fair value hedges. The fair value movement of the derivative is offset in the income statement 
against the fair value movement in the underlying fixed rate debt.
Based on the Group’s gross borrowings as at 31 December 2015, if interest rates were to increase by 100 basis points in all currencies then the 
annual net interest charge would increase by $6m (2014 – $6m). A decrease in interest rates by 100 basis points in all currencies would have an 
equal but opposite effect to the amounts shown above.
16.3 Credit risk exposures
The Group limits exposure to credit risk on counterparties used for financial instruments through a system of internal credit limits. The financial 
exposure of a counterparty is determined as the total of cash and deposits, plus the risk on derivative instruments, assessed as the fair value of the 
instrument plus a risk element based on the nominal value and the historic volatility of the market value of the instrument. The Group does not 
anticipate non-performance of counterparties and believes it is not subject to material concentration of credit risk as the Group operates within a 
policy of counterparty limits designed to reduce exposure to any single counterparty.
The maximum credit risk exposure on derivatives at 31 December 2015 was $33m (2014 – $49m), being the total debit fair values on forward 
foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps. The maximum credit risk exposure on cash at bank at 31 December 2015 was $120m (2014 – 
$93m). The Group’s exposure to credit risk is not material as the amounts are held in a wide number of banks in a number of different countries.
Credit risk on trade receivables is detailed in Note 13.

16.5 Fair value of financial assets and liabilities
ACCOUNTING POLICY
Measurement of fair values
A number of the Group’s accounting policies and disclosures require the measurement of fair values, for both financial assets and liabilities and 
non-financial assets acquired in a business combination (see Note 21).
When measuring the fair value of an asset or liability, the Group uses market observable data as far as possible. Fair values are categorised into 
different levels in the fair value hierarchy based on the inputs used in the valuation techniques as follows: Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in 
active markets for identical assets or liabilities; Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that are observable for the asset or 
liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and Level 3: inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable data (unobservable inputs).
The Group recognises transfers between the levels of the fair value hierarchy at the end of the reporting period during which the change 
has occurred.
The following table shows the carrying amounts and fair values of financial assets and financial liabilities, including their levels in the fair value 
hierarchy. It does not include fair value information for financial assets and financial liabilities not measured at fair value if the carrying amount is a 
reasonable approximation of fair value.

There has been no change in the classification of financial assets and liabilities, the method and assumptions used in determining fair value and 
the categorisation of financial assets and liabilities within the fair value hierarchy from those disclosed in the Annual Report for the year ended 
31 December 2014, other than the representation of $98m of prepayments and accrued income which is no longer presented as a financial asset.
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments with financial institutions with investment grade credit ratings. The fair value of forward 
foreign exchange contracts is calculated by reference to quoted market forward exchange rates for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair 
value of currency swaps is determined by reference to quoted market spot rates. As a result, foreign forward exchange contracts and currency 
swaps are classified as Level 2 within the fair value hierarchy. 
The changes in counterparty credit risk had no material effect on the hedge effectiveness for derivatives designated in hedge relationships and 
other financial instruments recognised at fair value.
The fair value of contingent consideration is estimated using a discounted cash flow model. The valuation model considers the present value of 
expected payment, discounted using a risk-adjusted discount rate. The expected payment is determined by considering the possible scenarios, 
which relate to the achievement of established milestones and targets, the amount to be paid under each scenario and the probability of each 
scenario. As a result, contingent consideration is classified as Level 3 within the fair value hierarchy. 
There were no transfers between Levels 1, 2 and 3 during 2015 and 2014. 
For cash and cash equivalents, short-term loans and receivables, overdrafts and other short-term liabilities which have a maturity of less than three 
months, the book values approximate the fair values because of their short-term nature.
Long-term borrowings are measured in the balance sheet at amortised cost. As the Group’s long-term borrowings are not quoted publicly and as 
market prices are not available, their fair values are estimated by discounting future contractual cash flows to net present values at the current 
market interest rates available to the Group for similar financial instruments as at the year end.

17 Provisions and contingencies
ACCOUNTING POLICY
In the normal course of business the Group is involved in various legal disputes. Provisions are made for loss contingencies when it is deemed 
probable that an adverse outcome will occur and the amount of the losses can be reasonably estimated. Where the Group is the plaintiff in 
pursuing claims against third parties, legal and associated expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
The recognition of provisions for legal disputes is subject to a significant degree of estimation. In making its estimates management takes into 
account the advice of internal and external legal counsel. Provisions are reviewed regularly and amounts updated where necessary to reflect 
developments in the disputes. The ultimate liability may differ from the amount provided depending on the outcome of court proceedings or 
settlement negotiations or as new facts emerge.
A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the 
unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. For the purpose of calculating any onerous lease provision, the Group takes the 
discounted future lease payments (if any), net of expected rental income. Before a provision is established, the Group recognises any 
impairment loss on the assets associated with that contract.
A provision for rationalisation is recognised when the Group has approved a detailed and formal restructuring plan, and the restructuring either 
has commenced or has been announced publicly. Future operating losses are not provided for.

The principal elements within rationalisation provisions relate to the Group Optimisation programme (mainly severance) announced in May 2014 
and people costs associated with the structural and efficiency programme announced in August 2011.
Following the settlement of the majority of US metal-on-metal hip claims (discussed below) the Group has estimated a provision of $185m  
2014 – $nil) relating to the present value at 31 December of the estimated costs to resolve all other known and anticipated metal-on-metal hip claims. 
The estimated value of the provision has been determined using an actuarial model. Given the inherent uncertainty in assumptions relating to 
factors such as the number of claims and outcome the actual costs may differ significantly from this estimate. The provision does not include any 
possible insurance recoveries on these claims or legal fees associated with defending claims. The Group carries considerable product liability 
insurance, and will continue to defend claims vigorously.
Furthermore, for the year to 31 December 2015, included within legal and other provisions are:
 − A provision of $5m (2014: $10m) relating to the RENASYS distribution hold.
 − A provision of $4m (2014: $7m) relating to the HP802 programme which was stopped during the fourth quarter of 2014.
The remaining balance largely represents provisions for various other litigation matters.
All provisions are expected to be substantially utilised within five years of 31 December 2015 and none are treated as financial instruments.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < 17 .2 Contingencies
The Company and its subsidiaries are parties to various legal proceedings, some of which include claims for substantial damages. The outcome 
of these proceedings cannot readily be foreseen, but management believes none of them is likely to result in a material adverse effect on the 
financial position of the Group. The Group provides for outcomes that are deemed to be probable and can be reliably estimated. There is no 
assurance that losses will not exceed provisions or will not have a significant impact on the Group’s results of operations in the period in which 
they are realised.
In August 2003, the Group withdrew voluntarily from all markets the macrotextured versions of its OXINIUM femoral knee components. A charge 
of $154m was recorded in 2004 for anticipated expenses in connection with macrotexture claims. Most of that amount has since been applied to 
settlements of such claims, and almost all have been resolved. The aggregate cost at 31 December 2015 related to this matter is approximately 
$205m. The Group has sought recovery from its primary and excess insurers for costs of resolving the claims. The primary insurance carrier has 
paid $60m in full settlement of its policy liability. However, the excess carriers have denied coverage, citing defences relating to the wording of the 
insurance policies and other matters. In December 2004, the Group brought suit against them in the US district court for the Western District of 
Tennessee, for which a trial has not yet begun. An additional $22m was received during 2007 from a successful settlement with a third party.
17 .3 Legal proceedings
Product liability claims
The Group faces claims from time to time for alleged defects in its products and has on occasion recalled or withdrawn products from the market. 
Such claims are endemic to the medical device industry. The Group maintains product liability insurance subject to limits and deductibles that 
management believes are reasonable. All policies contain exclusions and limitations, however, and there can be no assurance that insurance will 
be available or adequate to cover all claims.
In recent years, there has been heightened concern about possible adverse effects of hip implant products with metal-on-metal bearing surfaces, 
and the Group has incurred and will continue to incur expenses to defend claims in this area. As of February 2016, and giving effect to the US 
settlement described below, approximately 718 such claims were pending with the Group around the world, of which 388 had given rise to 
pending legal proceedings. The Group has requested indemnity from its product liability insurers for most of these metal-on-metal hip implant 
claims. Most claims relate to the Group’s Birmingham Hip Resurfacing (‘BHR’) product and its two modular metal-on-metal components: the 
Birmingham Hip Modular Head (‘BHMH’) and the optional metal liner component of the R3 Acetabular System (‘R3ML’). The BHMH and R3ML are 
no longer on the market: the R3ML was withdrawn in 2012 and the BHMH was phased out in 2014. In 2015, the Group ceased offering smaller sizes 
of the BHR and restricted instructions for BHR use in female patients. These actions were taken to ensure that the BHR is only used in those patient 
groups where it continues to demonstrate strong performance. These represent the vast majority of current patients.
In 2015 the Group’s US subsidiary settled the majority of its US metal-on-metal hip lawsuits, without admitting liability. Insurance receipts covered 
more than half of the gross settlement, with the net cash cost being $25 million. These cases had been consolidated in a state court in Memphis, 
Tennessee and principally related to the Group’s modular metal-on-metal hip components, which are no longer on the market. Litigation outcomes 
are difficult to predict and defence costs can be significant. The Group takes care to monitor the clinical evidence relating to its metal hip implant 
products and ensure that its product offerings are designed to serve patients’ interests.
Business practice investigations
Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to regulation and review by various government authorities. From time to time authorities 
undertake investigations of the Group’s activities to verify compliance. 
In January 2014, before agreeing to be acquired by the Group, ArthroCare announced a settlement of charges by the US Department of Justice 
relating to securities fraud in which certain members of prior management were implicated. ArthroCare paid a $30m fine and signed a deferred 
prosecution agreement that imposed reporting, compliance and other requirements on ArthroCare for a two-year term. That agreement expired 
in January 2016, and the related complaint against ArthroCare was dismissed.
Intellectual property disputes
The Group is engaged, as both plaintiff and defendant, in litigation with various competitors and others over claims of patent infringement and other 
intellectual property matters. These disputes are being heard in courts in the US and other jurisdictions and also before agencies that examine 
patents. Outcomes are rarely certain and costs are often significant. 
The Group won a jury verdict in the US district court for Oregon against Arthrex Inc. in 2011 for infringement of the Group’s patent relating to suture 
anchors. A number of issues have been disputed and appealed since the case was first filed in 2003; Arthrex paid $99m in June 2015, and most 
of that award (net of various expenses) was recognised in the Group’s trading profit at that time. A follow-up trial asserting the same patent against 
additional Arthrex products is in progress in the Oregon court. Arthrex asserted other patents against the Group in 2014 and 2015 in the US district 
court for the Eastern District of Texas. 
Other matters
In April 2009, the Group was served with a subpoena by the US Department of Justice in Massachusetts requiring the production of documents 
from 1995 to 2009 associated with the marketing and sale of a bone growth stimulation product that the Group has since divested. Similar  
subpoenas had been served on a number of competitors in the bone growth stimulator market, and a qui tam or ‘whistle-blower’ complaint had 
been filed in federal court in Boston, Massachusetts. The Group cooperated with the government inquiry, defended the qui tam action, and agreed 
in principle to settle the latter in 2015 without admitting any liability.

18 Retirement benefit obligations
ACCOUNTING POLICY
The Group sponsors defined benefit plans in a number of countries. A defined benefit pension plan defines an amount of pension benefit that 
an employee will receive on retirement, which is dependent on various factors such as age, years of service and final salary. The Group’s 
obligation is calculated separately for each plan by discounting the estimated future benefit that employees have earned in return for their 
service in the current and prior periods. The fair value of any plan assets is deducted to arrive at the net liability.
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is performed annually by external actuaries using the projected unit credit method.  
Re-measurements arising from defined benefit plans comprise actuarial gains and losses and the return on the plan assets net of the costs 
of managing the plan assets. The Group recognises these immediately in other comprehensive income (‘OCI’) and all other expenses, such as 
service cost, net interest cost, administration costs and taxes, are recognised in the income statement.
A number of key assumptions are made when calculating the fair value of the Group’s defined benefit pension plans. These assumptions 
impact the balance sheet asset and liabilities, operating profit and finance income/costs. The most critical assumptions are the discount rate, 
the rate of inflation and mortality assumptions to be applied to future pension plan liabilities. The discount rate is based on the yield at the 
reporting date on bonds that have a credit rating of AA, denominated in the currency in which the benefits are expected to be paid and have a 
maturity profile approximately the same as the Group’s obligations. In determining these assumptions management take into account the 
advice of professional external actuaries and benchmarks its assumptions against external data.
The Group determines the net interest expense/(income) on the net defined benefit liability/(asset) for the period by applying the discount rate 
used to measure the defined benefit obligation at the beginning of the annual period to the net defined benefit liability/(asset).
The Group also operates a number of defined contribution plans. A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group and 
employees pay fixed contributions to a third party financial provider. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have 
been paid. Contributions are recognised as an employee benefit expense when they are due.

The Group sponsors pension plans for its employees in 16 countries and these are established under the laws of the relevant country. 
Funded plans are funded by the payment of contributions and the assets are held by separate trust funds or insurance companies. In countries 
where there is no Company-sponsored pension plan, state benefits are considered by management to be adequate. Employees’ retirement 
benefits are the subject of regular management review. The Group’s defined benefit plans provide employees with an entitlement to retirement 
benefits varying between 1.3% and 66.7% of final salary on attainment of retirement age. The level of entitlement is dependent on the years of 
service of the employee.
The Group’s two major defined benefit pension plans are in the UK and US. Both these plans were closed to new employees in 2003 and defined 
contribution plans are offered to new joiners. The US Plan was closed to future accrual in March 2014.
The UK Plan operates under trust law and responsibility for its governance lies with a Board of Trustees. This Board is composed of representatives 
of the Group, plan participants and an independent trustee, who act on behalf of members in accordance with the terms of the Trust Deed and 
Rules and relevant legislation. The UK Plan’s assets are held by the trust. Annual increases on benefits in payment are dependent on inflation. 
The main uncertainties affecting the level of benefits payable under the UK Plan are future inflation levels (including the impact of inflation on future 
salary increase) and the actual longevity of the membership. There is no legislative minimum funding requirement in the UK, however the Group 
has agreed with the Board of Trustees to pay a schedule of supplementary payments (see Note 18.8). The Trust Deed of the UK Plan states that any 
surplus is ultimately accessible by the Group as a refund. As a result the Group has recognised a surplus for the UK Plan of $7m in 2015.
The US Plan is governed by a US Pension Committee which is composed of both plan participants and representatives of the Group. In the US, the 
Pension Protection Act (2006) established both a minimum required contribution and a maximum deductible contribution. Failure to contribute at 
least the minimum required amount will subject the Company to significant penalties, and contributions in excess of the maximum deductible have 
negative tax consequences. The minimum funding requirement is intended to fully fund the present value of accrued benefits over seven years.

No plans invest directly in property occupied by the Group or in financial securities issued by the Group.
The US and UK Plan assets are invested in a diversified range of industries across a broad range of geographies. These assets include liability 
matching assets and annuity policies purchased by the trustees of each plan, which aim to match the benefits to be paid to certain members from 
the plan and therefore remove the investment, inflation and demographic risks in relation to those liabilities. 
In December 2014, the low risk asset portfolio held by the UK Plan was transferred into liability driven investments (‘LDI’) in order to maintain the 
same level of hedging against interest rate and inflation risks.
The UK Plan also has an insurance contract with Rothesay Life covering a subset of the UK Plan pensioner liabilities. The terms of this policy 
define that the contract value exactly matches the amount and timing of the pensioner obligations covered by the contract. In accordance with 
IAS19R Employee Benefits , the fair value of the insurance contract is deemed to be the present value of the related obligations which is discounted 
at the AA corporate bond rate.

> > < 18.4 Expenses recognised in the income statement
The total expense relating to retirement benefits recognised for the year is $58m (2014 – $17m, 2013 – $72m). Of this cost recognised for the year, 
$49m (2014 – $32m, 2013 – $32m) relates to defined contributions and $9m net expense (2014 – $15m net credit, 2013 – $40m expense) relates to 
defined benefit plans.
The cost charged in respect of the Group’s defined contribution plans represents contributions payable to these plans by the Group at rates 
specified in the rules of the plans. These were charged to operating profit in selling, general and administrative expenses. There were $nil 
outstanding payments as at 31 December 2015 due to be paid over to the plans (2014 – $nil, 2013 – $nil).
The $9m net expense for the year includes a $16m past service cost credit arising from amendments to the US Retirement Healthcare plan and a 
$5m gain arising from benefit options offered to members of the UK Plan, which is detailed under Inflation risk in Note 18.7. 
In 2014, the $15m net credit for defined benefits plans includes a $35m past service cost credit which arose on the closure of the US Plan to future 
accrual and a $11m gain on settlement of benefits as a result of a member buyout.
Defined benefit plan costs comprise service cost which is charged to operating profit in selling, general and administrative expenses and net 
interest cost and administration costs and taxes which are reported as other finance costs. The $3m net interest cost, administration and taxes 
recognised for the UK Plan includes $2m fees paid directly by the Group relating to the de-risking options offered to members in 2015.

Actuarial assumptions regarding future mortality are based on mortality tables. The UK uses the S1NA with projections in line with the CMI 2011 
table and the US uses the RP2014 table with MP2014 scale. The current longevities underlying the values of the obligations in the defined benefit 
plans are as follows:

18.6 Sensitivity analysis
The calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions used. The following table summarises the increase/decrease on 
the UK and US defined benefit obligation and pension costs as a result of reasonably possible changes in some of the assumptions while holding 
all other assumptions consistent. The sensitivity to the inflation assumption change includes corresponding changes to the future salary increases 
and future pension increase assumptions. The analysis does not take into account the full distribution of cash flows expected under the plan.
Changes to the inflation assumption will not have any affect on the US Pension Plan as it was closed to future accrual in 2014.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < 18.7 Risk
The pension plans expose the Group to the following risks:
Interest rate risk Volatility in financial markets can change the calculations of the obligation significantly as the calculation of the 
obligation is linked to yields on AA-rated corporate bonds. A decrease in the bond yield will increase the measure of 
plan liabilities, although this will be partially offset by increases in the value of matching plan assets such as bonds 
and insurance contracts.
In the UK, the liability matching portfolio held in conventional and index-linked gilts was transferred into liability 
driven investments in order to reduce interest rate risk.
Inflation risk The UK Plan is linked to inflation. A high rate of inflation will lead to a higher liability. This risk is managed by holding 
inflation-linked bonds and an inflation-linked insurance contract in respect of some of the obligation. In the UK, the 
liability matching portfolio held in conventional and index-linked gilts was transferred into liability driven investments 
in order to reduce inflation risk. 
During 2015, the Trustees of the UK Plan offered eligible retired and deferred members three benefit options which 
would provide them with greater flexibility to manage their final benefit. The three options further minimised the 
exposure of the UK Plan to inflation risk and were:
 − an option to exchange future increases on pension benefits for a higher level of pension with no increases;
 − an option to take a transfer and draw their pension in a more flexible form; and
 − an option to take a transfer in excess of a standard cash equivalent transfer which could be taken to another 
pension arrangement. 
The US Plan has been closed to future accrual which eliminates the exposure to this risk.
Investment risk If the return on plan assets is below the discount rate, all else being equal, there will be an increase in the 
plan deficit.
In the UK, this risk is partially managed by a portfolio of liability matching assets and a bulk annuity, together with a 
dynamic de-risking policy to switch growth assets into liability matching assets over time.
The US Plan has a dynamic de-risking policy to shift plan assets into longer-term stable asset classes. The policy 
established 10 pre-determined funded status levels and when each trigger point is reached, the plan assets are 
re-balanced accordingly.
Longevity risk The present value of the plans defined benefit liability is calculated by reference to the best estimate of the mortality 
of the plan participants both during and after their employment. An increase in the life expectancy of plan 
participants above that assumed will increase the benefit obligation.
The UK Plan, in order to minimise longevity risk, has entered into an insurance contract which covers a portion of 
pensioner obligations. 
The three options offered to members in the UK during 2015 further minimised the exposure to longevity risk (see 
Inflation risk above).
Salary risk The calculation of the defined benefit obligation uses the future estimated salaries of plan participants. Increases in 
the salary of plan participants above that assumed will increase the benefit obligation.
The exposure to salary risk in the US has been eliminated with the closure of the US Plan to future accrual.
18.8 Funding
A full valuation is performed by actuaries for the Trustees of each plan to determine the level of funding required. Employer contributions rates, 
based on these full valuations, are agreed between the trustees of each plan and the Group. The assumptions used in the funding actuarial 
valuations may differ from those assumptions above.
UK Plan
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the UK Plan is being undertaken as at 30 September 2015. Contributions to the UK Plan in 2015 were 
$37m (2014 – $33m, 2013 – $37m). This included supplementary payments of $29m (2014 – $23m, 2013 – $31m).
The Group has currently agreed to pay supplementary payments until 2017 and the agreed supplementary contribution for 2016 is $29m. A new 
schedule of contributions will be agreed in 2016.
US Plan
Full actuarial valuations were performed annually for the US Plan with the last undertaken as at 20 September 2013 before the closure of the  
Plan to future accrual. Contributions to the US Plan were $20m (2014 – $22m, 2013 – $20m) which included supplementary payments of $20m. 
The planned contribution for 2016 is $20m.

Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of ordinary shares, net of any tax effects, are recognised as a deduction from equity.
When shares recognised as equity are repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, which includes directly attributable costs, net of any 
tax effects, is recognised as a deduction from equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury shares and are presented in the treasury 
share reserve. When treasury shares are sold or reissued subsequently, the amount received is recognised as an increase in equity and the 
resulting surplus or deficit on the transaction is presented within share premium.

The deferred shares were issued in 2006 in order to comply with English Company law. They are not listed on any stock exchange and have 
extremely limited rights and effectively have no value. These rights are summarised as follows:
 − The holder shall not be entitled to participate in the profits of the Company;
 − The holder shall not have any right to participate in any distribution of the Company’s assets on a winding up or other distribution except that 
after the return of the nominal amount paid up on each share in the capital of the Company of any class other than the deferred shares and the 
distribution of a further $1,000 in respect of each such share there shall be distributed to a holder of a deferred share (for each deferred share 
held by him) an amount equal to the nominal value of the deferred share;
 − The holder shall not be entitled to receive notice, attend, speak or vote at any general meeting of the Company; and
 − The Company may create, allot and issue further shares or reduce or repay the whole or any part of its share capital or other capital reserves 
without obtaining the consent of the holders of the deferred shares.
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to ensure the Group has adequate funds to continue as a going concern and sufficient flexibility 
within the capital structure to fund the ongoing growth of the business and to take advantage of business development opportunities 
including acquisitions.
The Group determines the amount of capital taking into account changes in business risks and future cash requirements. The Group reviews its 
capital structure on an ongoing basis and uses share buy-backs, dividends and the issue of new shares to adjust the retained capital.

Treasury shares represents the holding of the Company’s own shares in respect of the Smith & Nephew Employee’s Share Trust and shares 
bought back as part of the share buy-back programme. On 2 May 2013, as part of the new Capital Allocation Framework, the Group announced 
the start of a new share buy-back programme to return $300m of surplus capital to its shareholders. The programme was suspended in February 
2014 following the announcement of the ArthroCare acquisition. Shares issued in connection with the Group’s share incentive plans are bought 
back on a quarterly basis. During 2015, a total of 4.4m ordinary shares (0.5%) had been purchased at a cost of $77m and 4.4m (0.5%) had been 
cancelled. During 2014, a total of 4.4m ordinary shares (0.5%) had been purchased at a cost of $72m and 4.4m ordinary shares (0.5%) had been 
cancelled. The maximum number of ordinary shares held in treasury during 2015 was 25.0m (2.7%) with a nominal value of $5.0m. 
The Smith & Nephew 2004 Employees’ Share Trust (‘Trust’) was established to hold shares relating to the long-term incentive plans referred to in 
the ‘Directors’ Remuneration Report’. The Trust is administered by an independent professional trust company resident in Jersey and is funded by a 
loan from the Company. The cost of the Trust is charged to the income statement as it accrues. A partial dividend waiver is in place in respect of 
those shares held under the long-term incentive plans. The Trust only accepts dividends in respect of nil-cost options and deferred bonus plan 
shares. The waiver represents less than 1% of the total dividends paid.

impairment. Any gain on a bargain purchase is recognised in profit or loss immediately. Transaction costs are expensed as incurred, except if 
related to the issue of debt or equity securities.
Any contingent consideration payable is measured at fair value at the acquisition date. If the contingent consideration is classified as equity, 
then it is not re-measured and settlement is accounted for within equity. Otherwise, subsequent changes in the fair value of the contingent 
consideration are recognised in profit or loss.
21.1 Acquisitions
Year ended 31 December 2015
During the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group acquired its distributor in Colombia and its distributor and a manufacturer in Russia. 
The acquisitions are deemed to be business combinations within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations .
The aggregated total estimated fair value of the consideration is $68m and included $23m of contingent consideration and $13m through the 
settlement of working capital commitments. The fair values shown below have been determined on a provisional basis. If new information is 
obtained within the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date, the acquisition accounting will 
be revised.
The following table summarises the aggregate consideration transferred and the aggregate amounts of assets acquired and liabilities assumed at 
the acquisition date:

Intangible assets 19
Other assets

29
Liabilities (14)
Net assets 34
Goodwill 34
Cost of acquisition 68
1 Including net cash of $1m.
The provisional aggregated estimate of goodwill arising on the acquisitions is $34m. This is attributable to the additional economic benefits 
expected from the transactions, including the assembled workforces, which have been transferred as part of the acquisitions. The goodwill 
recognised is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.
The contribution to revenue and attributable profit from these acquisitions for the year ended 31 December 2015 was immaterial. If the acquisitions 
had occurred at the beginning of the year, their contributions to revenue and attributable profit for the year ended 31 December 2015 would also 
have been immaterial.
Year ended 31 December 2014
Acquisition of ArthroCare
On 29 May 2014, the Group acquired 100% of the shares of ArthroCare Corporation, an innovative medical device company with a highly 
complementary sports medicine portfolio. The purchase price was $48.25 per share, paid in cash with the fair value of the total consideration 
equalling $1,715m. The acquisition was financed through existing debt facilities and cash balances, including an existing $1bn revolving credit 
facility and a new two-year $1.4bn term loan facility, established in February 2014.
The acquisition is deemed to be a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3 Business Combinations . The acquisition accounting was 
completed during 2015. The fair values shown below include measurement period adjustments recognised during the period. The goodwill arising 
on the acquisition is $829m. It relates to the value of the additional economic benefits expected from the transaction, including synergies and the 
assembled workforce. The goodwill recognised is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes.

For the year ended 31 December 2014, ArthroCare’s contribution to Group revenue was $207m representing approximately seven months of sales. 
This gave rise to a pre-tax profit of $28m after amortisation of acquisition intangibles. Had ArthroCare been acquired on 1 January 2014, the 
Group’s revenues for 2014 would have been $147m higher and pre-tax profit would have been $5m higher.
Acquisition of Brazilian distributor
On 17 March 2014, the Group acquired certain assets and liabilities related to the distribution business for its sports medicine, orthopaedic 
reconstruction, and trauma products in Brazil. The acquisition was deemed to be a business combination within the scope of IFRS 3 Business 
Combinations. The acquisition date fair value of the consideration was $31m and included deferred consideration of $26m and $5m in relation 
to the settlement of working capital commitments. The deferred consideration was subsequently settled during the second quarter of 2014.
The acquisition accounting was completed during 2015. As at the acquisition date, the fair value of the net assets acquired, which includes 
measurement period adjustments recognised during the period, was $16m. This includes trade and other receivables of $12m, identifiable 
intangible assets of $16m, inventory of $4m, property, plant and equipment of $2m, trade payables of $1m, provisions of $5m, current tax payable 
of $4m and deferred tax liabilities of $8m. As a result, the goodwill arising on the acquisition was $15m. This is attributable to the additional 
economic benefits expected from the acquisition, including the assembled workforce, which has been transferred as part of the acquisition. 
The goodwill is not expected to be deductible for tax purposes. 
The contribution to revenue and attributable profit from this acquisition for the year ended 31 December 2014 was immaterial. If the acquisition had 
occurred at the beginning of the year its contribution to revenue and attributable profit for the year ended 31 December 2014 would also have 
been immaterial. 
21.2 Disposal of business
For the year ended 31 December 2015, the Group did not dispose of any businesses.
During 2014, the Group disposed of a manufacturing facility in the UK for cash consideration of $20m, resulting in a pre-tax gain on disposal 
of $9m. The 2014 revenue and profit contribution of the disposed business was immaterial.

23.1 Share-based payments
ACCOUNTING POLICY
The Group operates a number of equity-settled executive and employee share plans. For all grants of share options and awards, the fair value 
at the grant date is calculated using appropriate option pricing models. The grant date fair value is recognised over the vesting period as an 
expense, with a corresponding increase in retained earnings.
Employee plans
The Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan (2002) (adopted by shareholders on 3 April 2002) (the Save As You Earn (‘SAYE’) plan), the Smith & Nephew 
International Sharesave Plan (2002), Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan (2002), Smith & Nephew Sharesave Plan (2012) (the Save As You 
Earn (‘SAYE 2012’) plan) (adopted by shareholders on 12 April 2012), Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan (2012) (adopted by shareholders 
on 12 April 2012) and Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plan (2012) (adopted by shareholders on 12 April 2012) are together termed the 
‘Employee Plans’.
The SAYE and SAYE 2012 plans are available to all employees in the UK employed by participating Group companies, subject to three months’ 
service. The schemes enable employees to save up to £250 per month on plans up to 2014 and £500 per month from 2015 onwards and give 
them an option to acquire shares based on the committed amount to be saved. The option price is not less than 80% of the average of middle 
market quotations of the ordinary shares on the three dealing days preceding the date of invitation. The Smith & Nephew International Sharesave 
Plan (2002) and Smith & Nephew International Sharesave Plan (2012) are available to employees in Australia, Austria, Belgium, Canada, China, 
Denmark, Finland, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Ireland, Italy, Japan, South Korea, Mexico, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Norway, Poland, 
Portugal, Singapore, South Africa, Spain, Sweden, Switzerland and the United Arab Emirates. Employees in Malaysia and Costa Rica became 
eligible to join the plan in 2015. Puerto Rico participants were eligible to receive options under the International Plans up to 2011 and are eligible to 
receive phantom options from 2013 onwards. The Smith & Nephew France Sharesave Plans were available to all employees in France up to 2012. 
The International and French plans operate on a substantially similar basis to the SAYE plans. 
Employees in the US are able to participate in the Employee Stock Purchase Plan, which gives them the opportunity to acquire shares, in the form of 
ADSs, at a discount of 15% (or more if the shares appreciate in value during the plan’s quarterly purchase period) to the market price, through a 
regular savings plan.
Executive plans
The Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Approved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan, the Smith & Nephew 
2001 US Share Plan (adopted by shareholders on 4 April 2001), the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan (adopted by shareholders 
on 6 May 2004) and the Smith & Nephew Global Share Plan 2010 (adopted by shareholders on 6 May 2010) are together termed the 
‘Executive Plans’.
Under the terms of the Executive Plans, the Remuneration Committee, consisting of Non-Executive Directors, may at their discretion approve the 
grant of options to employees of the Group to acquire ordinary shares in the Company. Options granted under the Smith & Nephew 2001 US Share 
Plan (the ‘US Plan’) and the Smith & Nephew 2004 Executive Share Option Plan are to acquire ADSs or ordinary shares. For Executive Plans 
adopted in 2001 and 2004, the market value is the average quoted price of an ordinary share for the three business days preceding the date of 
grant or the average quoted price of an ADS or ordinary share, for the three business days preceding the date of grant or the quoted price on the 
date of grant if higher. For the Global Share Plan adopted in 2010, the market value is the closing price of an ordinary share or ADS on the last 
trading day prior to the grant date. With the exception of options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share Plan 2010, the vesting of 
options granted from 2001 is subject to achievement of a performance condition. Options granted under the 2001 US Plan and the Global Share 
Plan 2010 are not subject to any performance conditions. Prior to 2008, the 2001 US Plan options became cumulatively exercisable as to 10% after 
one year, 30% after two years, 60% after three years and the remaining balance after four years. With effect from 2008, options granted under the 
2001 US Plan became cumulatively exercisable as to 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third year. 
The 2001 UK Unapproved Share Option Plan was open to certain employees outside the US and the US Plan was open to certain employees in the 
US, Canada, Mexico and Puerto Rico. The Global Share Plan 2010 is open to employees globally. The 2004 Plan was open to Senior 
Executives only.
The maximum term of options granted, under all plans, is 10 years from the date of grant. All share option plans are settled in shares.
From 2012 onwards, Senior Executives were granted share awards instead of share options and from 2013 executives were granted conditional 
share awards instead of share options. The awards vest 33.3% after one year, 66.7% after two years and the remaining balance after the third year 
subject to continued employment. There are no performance conditions for executives. Vesting for Senior Executives is subject to personal 
performance levels. The market value used to calculate the number of awards is the closing price of an ordinary share on the last trading day prior 
to the grant date.

The weighted average fair value of options granted under Employee Plans during 2014 was 255.8p (2013 – 203.9p) and those under Executive 
Plans during 2014 was nil (2013 – nil).
Options granted under Employee Plans are valued using the Black-Scholes option model as management consider that options granted under 
these plans are exercised within a short period of time after the vesting date.
For all plans the inputs to the option pricing models are reassessed for each grant. The following assumptions were used in calculating the fair 
value of options granted:
Employee Plans
2015 2014 2013
Dividend yield % 2.0 2.0 2.0
Expected volatility %
1
25.0 20.0 25.0
Risk free interest rate %
2
1.3 1.3 1.3
Expected life in years 3.8 3.9 3.8
1 Volatility is assessed on a historic basis primarily based on past share price movements over the expected life of the options.
2 The risk free interest rate reflects the yields available on zero coupon government bonds over the option term and currency.
Share-based payments – long-term incentive plans
In 2004, a share-based incentive plan was introduced for Executive Directors, Executive Officers and the next level of Senior Executives. The plan 
included a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) and a Bonus Co-Investment Plan (‘CIP’).
Vesting of the PSP awards is dependent upon performance relative to the FTSE 100 and an index based on major international companies in the 
medical devices industry.
Under the CIP , participants could elect to use up to a maximum of one-half of their annual bonus to purchase shares. If the shares are held for 
three years and the Group’s EPSA growth targets are achieved, participants receive an award of matching shares for each share purchased.
From 2009, the CIP was replaced by the Deferred Bonus Plan. This plan was designed to encourage Executives to build up and maintain a 
significant shareholding in the Company. Under the plan, up to one-third of any bonus earned at target level or above by an eligible employee was 
compulsorily deferred into shares which vested, subject to continued employment, in equal annual tranches over three years (i.e. one-third each 
year). No further performance conditions applied to the deferred shares.
From 2010, Performance Share awards were granted under the Global Share Plan 2010 for all Executives other than Executive Directors. 
Awards granted under both plans are combined to provide the figures below.
From 2012, Deferred Bonus Plan and GSP 2010 options for Executive Directors, Executive Officers and the next level of Senior Executives were 
replaced by Equity Incentive Awards (‘EIA’). EIA are designed to encourage Executives to build up and maintain a significant shareholding in the 
Company. EIA will vest, in equal annual tranches over three years (i.e. one-third each year), subject to continued employment and personal 
performance. No further performance conditions apply to the EIA.
The fair values of awards granted under long-term incentive plans are calculated using a binomial model. Performance Share awards under both 
the PSP and Global Share Plan 2010 contain vesting conditions based on TSR versus a comparator group which represent market-based 
performance conditions for valuation purposes and an assessment of vesting probability is therefore factored into the award date calculations. 
The assumptions include the volatilities for the comparator groups. A correlation of 35% (2014 – 40%, 2013 – 40%) has also been assumed for the 
companies in the medical devices sector as they are impacted by similar factors. The Performance Target for the Global Share Plan 2010 is a 
combination of Free Cash Flow growth, Revenue in Emerging & International Markets and the Group’s TSR performance over the three-year 
performance period.
The other assumptions used are consistent with the Executive scheme assumptions disclosed earlier in this Note.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < 1 Basis of preparation
Smith & Nephew plc (the ‘Company’) is a public limited company incorporated in England and Wales.
The separate accounts of the Company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. On 1 January 2015, the Company transitioned from 
previously extant UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practices to Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (‘Reduced 
Disclosure Framework’). These financial statements and accompanying notes have been prepared in accordance with the Reduced Disclosure 
Framework for all periods presented. There were no transitional adjustments required on adoption of the new standard. The financial information 
for the Company has been prepared on the same basis as the consolidated financial statements, applying identical accounting policies as outlined 
throughout the Notes to the Group accounts. 
In applying these policies, management is required to make estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities 
and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the accounts and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best knowledge of current events and actions, actual results ultimately 
may differ from those estimates.
In these financial statements, the Company has applied the exemptions available under FRS 101 in respect of the following disclosures:
 − A Cash Flow Statement and related notes; 
 − Comparative period reconciliations for share capital and tangible fixed assets;
 − Disclosures in respect of transactions with wholly-owned subsidiaries;
 − Disclosures in respect of capital management;
 − The effects of new but not yet effective IFRSs; and 
 − Disclosures in respect of the compensation of Key Management Personnel; 
As the consolidated financial statements include the equivalent disclosures, the Company has also taken the exemptions under FRS 101 available 
in respect of the following disclosures:
 − FRS 2 Share Based Payments in respect of group settled share based payments; and
 − Certain disclosures required by IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement and the disclosures required by IFRS 7 Financial Instrument Disclosures.
The Company proposes to continue to adopt the reduced disclosure framework of FRS 101 in its next financial statements.
2 Results for the year
As permitted by Section 408(4) of the Companies Act 2006, the Company has not presented its own profit and loss account. Profit for the year was 
$107m (2014 – $922m).

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < Business overview and Group history
Smith & Nephew’s operations are organised into geographical selling regions and product franchises within the medical technology industry.
The Group has a history dating back over 150 years to the family enterprise of Thomas James Smith who opened a small pharmacy in Hull,  
UK in 1856. Following his death in 1896, his nephew Horatio Nelson Smith took over the management of the business.
By the late 1990s, Smith & Nephew had expanded into being a diverse healthcare conglomerate with operations across the globe, producing 
various medical devices, personal care products and traditional and advanced wound care treatments. In 1998, Smith & Nephew announced a 
major restructuring to focus management attention and investment on three global business units – Advanced Wound Management, Endoscopy 
and Orthopaedics – which offered high growth and margin opportunities. In 2011, the Endoscopy and Orthopaedics businesses were brought 
together to create an Advanced Surgical Devices division.
Smith & Nephew was incorporated and listed on the London Stock Exchange in 1937 and in 1999 the Group was also listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange. In 2001, Smith & Nephew became a constituent member of the FTSE 100 index in the UK. This means that Smith & Nephew is included 
in the top 100 companies traded on the London Stock Exchange measured in terms of market capitalisation.
Today, Smith & Nephew is a public limited company incorporated and headquartered in the UK and carries out business around the world.

The Group Global Operations strategy includes ongoing assessment of the optimal facility footprint. The Advanced Surgical Devices manufacturing 
facilities in Memphis, Tennessee are largely freehold, a portion of Tuttlingen and the Advanced Wound Management facilities in Hull are freehold 
while other principal locations are leasehold. The Group has freehold and leasehold interests in real estate in other countries throughout the world, 
but no other is individually significant to the Group. Where required, the appropriate governmental authorities have approved the facilities.
Off-balance sheet arrangements
Management believes that the Group does not have any off-balance sheet arrangements, as defined by the SEC in item 5E of Form 20-F, that have 
or are reasonably likely to have a current or future effect on the Group’s financial condition, changes in financial condition, revenues or expenses, 
results of operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources that is material to investors.
Related party transactions
Except for transactions with associates (see Note 23.2 of Notes to the Group accounts), no other related party had material transactions or loans 
with Smith & Nephew over the last three financial years.
Risk factors
There are known and unknown risks and uncertainties relating to Smith & Nephew’s business. The factors listed on pages 172 to 174 could cause 
the Group’s business, financial position and results of operations to differ materially and adversely from expected and historical levels. In addition, 
other factors not listed here that Smith & Nephew cannot presently identify or does not believe to be equally significant could also materially 
adversely affect Smith & Nephew’s business, financial position or results of operations.

GROUP 
INFORMATION GROUP 
INFORMATION
Highly competitive markets
The Group competes across a diverse range of geographic and product markets. Each market in which the Group operates contains a number of 
different competitors, including specialised and international corporations. Significant product innovations, technical advances or the intensification 
of price competition by competitors could adversely affect the Group’s operating results.
Some of these competitors may have greater financial, marketing and other resources than Smith & Nephew. These competitors may be able to 
initiate technological advances in the field, deliver products on more attractive terms, more aggressively market their products or invest larger 
amounts of capital and research and development (‘R&D’) into their businesses.
There is a possibility of further consolidation of competitors, which could adversely affect the Group’s ability to compete with larger companies due 
to insufficient financial resources. If any of the Group’s businesses were to lose market share or achieve lower than expected revenue growth, 
there could be a disproportionate adverse impact on the Group’s share price and its strategic options.
Competition exists among healthcare providers to gain patients on the basis of quality, service and price. There has been some consolidation in 
the Group’s customer base and this trend is expected to continue. Some customers have joined group purchasing organisations or introduced 
other cost containment measures that could lead to downward pressure on prices or limit the number of suppliers in certain business areas, 
which could adversely affect Smith & Nephew’s results of operations and hinder its growth potential.
Continual development and introduction of new products 
The medical devices industry has a rapid rate of new product introduction. In order to remain competitive, the Group must continue to develop 
innovative products that satisfy customer needs and preferences or provide cost or other advantages. Developing new products is a costly, lengthy 
and uncertain process. The Group may fail to innovate due to low R&D investment, a R&D skills gap or poor product development. A potential 
product may not be brought to market or not succeed in the market for any number of reasons, including failure to work optimally, failure to receive 
regulatory approval, failure to be cost-competitive, infringement of patents or other intellectual property rights and changes in consumer demand. 
The Group’s products and technologies are also subject to marketing attack by competitors. Furthermore, new products that are developed and 
marketed by the Group’s competitors may affect price levels in the various markets in which the Group operates. If the Group’s new products do 
not remain competitive with those of competitors, the Group’s revenue could decline.
The Group maintains reserves for excess and obsolete inventory resulting from the potential inability to sell its products at prices in excess of 
current carrying costs. Marketplace changes resulting from the introduction of new products or surgical procedures may cause some of the 
Group’s products to become obsolete. The Group makes estimates regarding the future recoverability of the costs of these products and records a 
provision for excess and obsolete inventories based on historical experience, expiration of sterilisation dates and expected future trends. If actual 
product life cycles, product demand or acceptance of new product introductions are less favourable than projected by management, additional 
inventory write-downs may be required.
Dependence on government and other funding
In most markets throughout the world, expenditure on medical devices is ultimately controlled to a large extent by governments. Funds may be 
made available or withdrawn from healthcare budgets depending on government policy. The Group is therefore largely dependent on future 
governments providing increased funds commensurate with the increased demand arising from demographic trends.
Pricing of the Group’s products is largely governed in most markets by governmental reimbursement authorities. Initiatives sponsored by 
government agencies, legislative bodies and the private sector to limit the growth of healthcare costs, including price regulation, excise taxes and 
competitive pricing, are ongoing in markets where the Group has operations. This control may be exercised by determining prices for an individual 
product or for an entire procedure. The Group is exposed to government policies favouring locally sourced products. The Group is also exposed to 
changes in reimbursement policy, tax policy and pricing which may have an adverse impact on revenue and operating profit. Provisions in US 
healthcare legislation which previously imposed significant taxes on medical device manufacturers have been suspended for two years but may 
be reinstated. There may be an increased risk of adverse changes to government funding policies arising from deterioration in macro-economic 
conditions from time to time in the Group’s markets.
The Group must adhere to the rules laid down by government agencies that fund or regulate healthcare, including extensive and complex rules in 
the US. Failure to do so could result in fines or loss of future funding.
World economic conditions
Demand for the Group’s products is driven by demographic trends, including the ageing population and the incidence of osteoporosis and obesity. 
Supply of, use of and payment for the Group’s products are also influenced by world economic conditions which could place increased pressure 
on demand and pricing, adversely impacting the Group’s ability to deliver revenue and margin growth. The conditions could favour larger, better 
capitalised groups, with higher market shares and margins. As a consequence, the Group’s prosperity is linked to general economic conditions 
and there is a risk of deterioration of the Group’s performance and finances during adverse macro-economic conditions.
During 2015, economic conditions worldwide continued to create several challenges for the Group, including deferrals of joint replacement 
procedures, heightened pricing pressure, significant declines in capital equipment expenditures at hospitals (notably in China) and increased 
uncertainty over the collectability of government debt, particularly those in the Emerging Markets and certain parts of southern Europe. 
These factors tempered the overall growth of the Group’s global markets and could have an increased impact on growth in the future.
Political uncertainties
The Group operates on a worldwide basis and has distribution channels, purchasing agents and buying entities in over 100 countries. 
Political upheaval in some of those countries or in surrounding regions may impact the Group’s results of operations. Political changes in a country 
could prevent the Group from receiving remittances of profit from a member of the Group located in that country or from selling its products or 
investments in that country. Furthermore, changes in government policy regarding preference for local suppliers, import quotas, taxation or other 
matters could adversely affect the Group’s revenue and operating profit. War, economic sanctions, terrorist activities or other conflict could also 
adversely impact the Group. These risks may be greater in Emerging Markets, which account for an increasing portion of the Group’s business.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com
> > < Currency fluctuations
Smith & Nephew’s results of operations are affected by transactional exchange rate movements in that they are subject to exposures arising from 
revenue in a currency different from the related costs and expenses. The Group’s manufacturing cost base is situated principally in the US, the UK, 
China and Switzerland, from which finished products are exported to the Group’s selling operations worldwide. Thus, the Group is exposed to 
fluctuations in exchange rates between the US Dollar, Sterling and Swiss Franc and the currency of the Group’s selling operations, particularly the 
Euro, Australian Dollar and Japanese Yen. If the US Dollar, Sterling or Swiss Franc should strengthen against the Euro, Australian Dollar and the 
Japanese Yen, the Group’s trading margin could be adversely affected.
The Group manages the impact of exchange rate movements on revenue and cost of goods sold by a policy of transacting forward foreign 
currency commitments when firm purchase orders are placed. In addition, the Group’s policy is for forecast transactions to be covered between 
50% and 90% for up to one year. However, the Group is exposed to medium to long-term adverse movements in the strength of currencies 
compared to the US Dollar.
The Group uses the US Dollar as its reporting currency and the US Dollar is the functional currency of Smith & Nephew plc. The Group’s revenues, 
profits and earnings are also affected by exchange rate movements on the translation of results of operations in foreign subsidiaries for financial 
reporting purposes. See ‘Liquidity and capital resources’ on page 117 .
Manufacturing and supply
The Group’s manufacturing production is concentrated at main facilities in Memphis, Mansfield and Oklahoma City in the US, Hull and Warwick in 
the UK, Aarau in Switzerland, Tuttlingen in Germany, Sangameshwar in India, Suzhou and Beijing in China, La Aurora in Costa Rica, Puschino in 
Russia and Curaçao. If major physical disruption took place at any of these sites, it could adversely affect the results of operations. Physical loss and 
consequential loss insurance is carried to cover such risks but is subject to limits and deductibles and may not be sufficient to cover catastrophic 
loss. Management of orthopaedic inventory is complex, particularly forecasting and production planning. There is a risk that failures in operational 
execution could lead to excess inventory or individual product shortages.
The Group is reliant on certain key suppliers of raw materials, components, finished products and packaging materials or in some cases on a 
single supplier. These suppliers must provide the materials and perform the activities to the Group’s standard of quality requirements. 
A supplier’s failure to meet expected quality standards could create liability for the Group and adversely affect sales of the Group’s related products. 
The Group may be forced to pay higher prices to obtain raw materials, which it may not be able to pass on to its customers in the form of increased 
prices for its finished products. In addition, some of the raw materials used may become unavailable, and there can be no assurance that the 
Group will be able to obtain suitable and cost effective substitutes. Any interruption of supply caused by these or other factors could negatively 
impact Smith & Nephew’s revenue and operating profit.
The Group will, from time to time, outsource the manufacture of components and finished products to third parties and will periodically relocate the 
manufacture of product and/or processes between existing facilities. While these are planned activities, with these transfers there is a risk of 
disruption to supply.
Attracting and retaining key personnel
The Group’s continued development depends on its ability to hire and retain highly-skilled personnel with particular expertise. This is critical, 
particularly in general management, research, new product development and in the sales forces. If Smith & Nephew is unable to retain key 
personnel in general management, research and new product development or if its largest sales forces suffer disruption or upheaval, its revenue 
and operating profit would be adversely affected. Additionally, if the Group is unable to recruit, hire, develop and retain a talented, competitive 
workforce, it may not be able to meet its strategic business objectives.
Proprietary rights and patents
Due to the technological nature of medical devices and the Group’s emphasis on serving its customers with innovative products, the Group has 
been subject to patent infringement claims and is subject to the potential for additional claims.
Claims asserted by third parties regarding infringement of their intellectual property rights, if successful, could require the Group to expend time 
and significant resources to pay damages, develop non-infringing products or obtain licences to the products which are the subject of such 
litigation, thereby affecting the Group’s growth and profitability. Smith & Nephew attempts to protect its intellectual property and regularly opposes 
third party patents and trademarks where appropriate in those areas that might conflict with the Group’s business interests. If Smith & Nephew fails 
to protect and enforce its intellectual property rights successfully, its competitive position could suffer, which could harm its results of operations.
Product liability claims and loss of reputation
The development, manufacture and sale of medical devices entail risk of product liability claims or recalls. Design and manufacturing defects with 
respect to products sold by the Group or by companies it has acquired could damage, or impair the repair of, body functions. The Group may 
become subject to liability, which could be substantial, because of actual or alleged defects in its products. In addition, product defects could lead 
to the need to recall from the market existing products, which may be costly and harmful to the Group’s reputation.
There can be no assurance that customers, particularly in the US, the Group’s largest geographical market, will not bring product liability or related 
claims that would have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position or results of operations in the future, or that the Group will be able 
to resolve such claims within insurance limits. During 2015, developments in the Group’s metal-on-metal hip implant claims led to a $203m charge 
being recognised relating to known and future claims.
Regulatory standards and compliance in the healthcare industry
Business practices in the healthcare industry are subject to regulation and review by various government authorities. In general, the trend in many 
countries in which the Group does business is towards higher expectations and increased enforcement activity by governmental authorities. 
While the Group is committed to doing business with integrity and welcomes the trend to higher standards in the healthcare industry, the Group 
and other companies in the industry have been subject to investigations and other enforcement activity that have incurred and may continue 
to incur significant expense. Under certain circumstances, if the Group were found to have violated the law, its ability to sell its products to certain 
customers could be restricted.

GROUP 
INFORMATION GROUP 
INFORMATION
International regulation
The Group operates across the world and is subject to extensive legislation, including anti-bribery and corruption and data protection, in each 
country in which we operate. Our international operations are governed in part by the UK Bribery Act and the US Foreign Corrupt Practices Act 
(‘FCPA’) which prohibit us or our agents from making, or offering, improper payments to government officials and other persons for the purpose 
of obtaining or maintaining business or product approvals. Enforcement of such legislation has increased in recent years with significant fines and 
penalties being imposed on companies and individuals. Our international operations, particularly in the Emerging Markets, expose the Group to 
the risk that our employees or agents will engage in prohibited activities.
Regulatory approval
The international medical device industry is highly regulated. Regulatory requirements are a major factor in determining whether substances and 
materials can be developed into marketable products and the amount of time and expense that should be allotted to such development.
National regulatory authorities administer and enforce a complex series of laws and regulations that govern the design, development, approval, 
manufacture, labelling, marketing and sale of healthcare products. They also review data supporting the safety and efficacy of such products. 
Of particular importance is the requirement in many countries that products be authorised or registered prior to manufacture, marketing or sale and 
that such authorisation or registration be subsequently maintained. The major regulatory agencies for Smith & Nephew’s products include the Food 
and Drug Administration (‘FDA’) in the US, the Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency in the UK, the Ministry of Health, Labour and 
Welfare in Japan, the China Food and Drug Administration and the Australian Therapeutic Goods Administration. At any time, the Group is awaiting 
a number of regulatory approvals which, if not received, could adversely affect results of operations.
The trend is towards more stringent regulation and higher standards of technical appraisal. Such controls have become increasingly demanding to 
comply with and management believes that this trend will continue. 
Regulatory requirements may also entail inspections for compliance with appropriate standards, including those relating to Quality Management 
Systems or Good Manufacturing Practices regulations. All manufacturing and other significant facilities within the Group are subject to regular 
internal and external audit for compliance with national and Group medical device regulation and policies.
Payment for medical devices may be governed by reimbursement tariff agencies in a number of countries. Reimbursement rates may be set in 
response to perceived economic value of the devices, based on clinical and other data relating to cost, patient outcomes and comparative 
effectiveness. They may also be affected by overall government budgetary considerations. The Group believes that its emphasis on innovative 
products and services should contribute to success in this environment.
Failure to comply with these regulatory requirements could have a number of adverse consequences, including withdrawal of approval to sell a 
product in a country, temporary closure of a manufacturing facility, fines and potential damage to company reputation.
Failure to make successful acquisitions
A key element of the Group’s strategy for continued growth is to make acquisitions or alliances to complement its existing business. Failure to 
identify appropriate acquisition targets or failure to conduct adequate due diligence or to integrate them successfully would have an adverse impact 
on the Group’s competitive position and profitability. This could result from the diversion of management resources towards the acquisition or 
integration process, challenges of integrating organisations of different geographic, cultural and ethical backgrounds, as well as the prospect of 
taking on unexpected or unknown liabilities. In addition, the availability of global capital may make financing less attainable or more expensive and 
could result in the Group failing in its strategic aim of growth by acquisition or alliance.
Relationships with healthcare professionals
The Group seeks to maintain effective and ethical working relationships with physicians and medical personnel who assist in the research and 
development of new products or improvements to our existing product range or in product training and medical education. If we are unable to 
maintain these relationships our ability to meet the demands of our customers could be diminished and our revenue and profit could be materially 
adversely affected.
Reliance on sophisticated information technology
The Group uses a wide variety of information systems, programmes and technology to manage our business. Our systems are vulnerable to a 
cyber-attack, malicious intrusion, loss of data privacy or any other significant disruption. Our systems have been and will continue to be the target 
of such threats. We have systems in place to minimise the risk and disruption of these intrusions and to monitor our systems on an ongoing basis 
for current or potential threats. There can be no assurance that these measures will prove effective in protecting Smith & Nephew from future 
interruptions and as a result the performance of the Group could be materially adversely affected.
Other risk factors
Smith & Nephew is subject to a number of other risks, which are common to most global medical technology groups and are reviewed as part of 
the Group’s risk management process. 
Factors affecting Smith & Nephew’s results of operations
Government economic, fiscal, monetary and political policies are all factors that materially affect the Group’s operation or investments of 
shareholders. Other factors include sales trends, currency fluctuations and innovation. Each of these factors is discussed further in the ‘Our Global 
Market’ on pages 14 to 15, ‘Financial review’ on pages 40 to 41 and ‘Taxation information for shareholders’ on pages 191 to 192.

These Financial Statements include financial measures that are not prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’). 
These measures, which include trading profit, trading profit margin, EPSA and underlying growth, exclude the effect of certain cash and non-cash 
items that Group management believes are not related to the underlying performance of the Group. These non-IFRS financial measures are also 
used by management to make operating decisions because they facilitate internal comparisons of performance to historical results on both a 
business segment and a consolidated Group basis.
Non-IFRS financial measures are presented in these Financial Statements as the Group’s management believe that they provide investors with a 
means of evaluating performance of the business segment and the consolidated Group on a consistent basis, similar to the way in which the 
Group’s management evaluates performance, that is not otherwise apparent on an IFRS basis, given that certain non-recurring, infrequent or 
non-cash items that management does not otherwise believe are indicative of the underlying performance of the consolidated Group may not be 
excluded when preparing financial measures under IFRS. These non-IFRS measures should not be considered in isolation from, as substitutes for, 
or superior to financial measures prepared in accordance with IFRS.
Revenue
‘Underlying growth in revenue’ is used to compare the revenue in a given year to the previous year on a like-for-like basis. This is achieved by 
adjusting for the impact of sales of products acquired in material business combinations and for movements in exchange rates. Underlying growth 
in revenue is not presented in the accounts prepared in accordance with IFRS and is therefore a measure not in accordance with Generally 
Accepted Accounting Principles (a ‘non-GAAP’ measure).
The Group believes that the tabular presentation and reconciliation of reported revenue growth to underlying revenue growth assists investors 
in their assessment of the Group’s performance in each business segment and for the Group as a whole.
Underlying growth in revenue is considered by the Group to be an important measure of performance in terms of local functional currency since  
it excludes those items considered to be outside the influence of local management. The Group’s management uses this non-GAAP measure  
in its internal financial reporting, budgeting and planning to assess performance on both a business segment and a consolidated Group basis. 
Revenue growth at constant currency is important in measuring business performance compared to competitors and compared to the growth 
of the market itself.
The Group considers that revenue from sales of products acquired in material business combinations results in a step-up in growth in revenue  
in the year of acquisition that cannot be wholly attributed to local management’s efforts with respect to the business in the year of acquisition. 
Depending on the timing of the acquisition, there will usually be a further step change in the following year. A measure of growth excluding the 
effects of business combinations also allows senior management to evaluate the performance and relative impact of growth from the existing 
business and growth from acquisitions. The process of making business acquisitions is directed, approved and funded from the Group corporate 
centre in line with strategic objectives.
The material limitation of the underlying growth in revenue measure is that it excludes certain factors, described above, which ultimately have a 
significant impact on total revenues. The Group compensates for this limitation by taking into account relative movements in exchange rates in its 
investment, strategic planning and resource allocation. In addition, as the evaluation and assessment of business acquisitions is not within the 
control of local management, performance of acquisitions is monitored centrally until the business is integrated. 
The Group’s management considers that the non-GAAP measure of underlying growth in revenue and the GAAP measure of growth in revenue 
are complementary measures, neither of which management uses exclusively.
‘Underlying growth in revenue’ reconciles to growth in revenue reported, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance 
with IFRS by making two adjustments, the ‘constant currency exchange effect’ and the ‘acquisitions and disposals effect’, described below.
The ‘constant currency exchange effect’ is a measure of the increase/decrease in revenue resulting from currency movements on non-US Dollar 
sales and is measured as the difference between: 1) the increase/decrease in the current year revenue translated into US Dollars at the current 
year average exchange rate and the prior revenue translated at the prior year rate; and 2) the increase/decrease being measured by translating 
current and prior year revenues into US Dollars using the prior year closing rate.
The ‘acquisitions and disposals effect’ is the measure of the impact on revenue from newly acquired material business combinations and recent 
material business disposals. This is calculated by comparing the current year, constant currency actual revenue (which include acquisitions and 
exclude disposals from the relevant date of completion) with prior year, constant currency actual revenue, adjusted to include the results of 
acquisitions and exclude disposals for the commensurate period in the prior year. These sales are separately tracked in the Group’s internal 
reporting systems and are readily identifiable.
Reported revenue growth, the most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS, reconciles to underlying growth in 
revenue as follows:

Trading profit, trading profit margin and trading cash flow
Trading profit, trading profit margin and trading cash flow are trend measures, which present the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the 
impact of specific transactions that management considers affect the Group’s short-term profitability and cash flows. The Group has identified the 
following items, where material, as those to be excluded from operating profit and cash generated from operations when arriving at trading profit 
and trading cash flow, respectively: acquisition and disposal related items arising in connection with business combinations, including amortisation 
of acquisition intangible assets, impairments and integration costs; restructuring events; gains and losses resulting from legal disputes; and 
significant uninsured losses. In addition to these items, gains or losses that materially impact the Group’s profitability or cash flows on a short-term 
or one-off basis, are excluded from operating profit and cash generated from operations when arriving at trading profit and trading cash flow, 
respectively.
Underlying growth in trading profit and trading profit margin (trading profit expressed as a percentage of revenue and trading cash flow) are 
measures, which present the growth trend in the long-term profitability of the Group. 
Underlying growth in trading profit is used to compare the period-on-period growth in trading profit on a like-for-like basis. This is achieved by 
adjusting for the impact of material business combinations and disposals and for movements in exchange rates in the same manner as underlying 
revenue growth is determined, as described above. 
Adjusted earnings per ordinary share (‘EPSA’)
EPSA is a trend measure, which presents the long-term profitability of the Group excluding the post-tax impact of specific transactions that 
management considers affects the Group’s short-term profitability. The Group presents this measure to assist investors in their understanding of 
trends. Adjusted attributable profit is the numerator used for this measure and is determined by adjusting attributable profit for the items that are 
excluded from operating profit when arriving at trading profit and items that are recognised below operating profit that affect the Group’s short-term 
profitability. The most directly comparable financial measure calculated in accordance with IFRS is earnings per ordinary share (‘EPS’).

Group Optimisation plan that was announced in May 2014. 
Amortisation and impairment of acquisition intangibles: For the year ended 31 December 2015, these charges relate to the amortisation of 
intangible assets acquired in material business combinations and a total impairment of $51m including $40m relating to Oasis, a product acquired 
with the Healthpoint acquisition in 2013.
Legal and other: For the year to 31 December 2015, the net charge primarily relates to $203m for known, anticipated and settled metal on metal 
hip claims and associated legal expenses of $21m. This was offset by a net gain of $33m relating to patent litigation with Arthrex and past service 
and curtailment gains of $19m arising on US and UK post-retirement benefits. 
In addition, a total of $18m charge primarily relates to final costs relating to RENASYS distribution hold and redundancies from the decision to cease 
development of HP802.

Acquisition related costs: For the year ended 31 December 2014, these costs primarily relate to transaction and integration costs associated with 
the ArthroCare acquisition with a small portion of costs relating to the continued integration of Healthpoint and the recent acquisitions in the 
Emerging & International Markets. In addition, trading results eliminate the short-term increase in cost of goods sold from recognising acquired 
inventory at fair value rather than standard cost. For the year ended 31 December 2013, these costs primarily relate to the integration of the 
Healthpoint business. 
Restructuring and rationalisation costs: For the year ended 31 December 2014, these costs relate to the Group Optimisation programme that 
was announced in May 2014 and the structural and efficiency programme announced in August 2011. 
Amortisation of acquisition intangibles: This charge relates to the amortisation of intangible assets acquired in material business combinations.
Legal and other: For the year ended 31 December 2014, this net credit relates to a past service gain and a settlement credit on the closure of US 
Pension Plan of $46m and a gain on disposal of a UK manufacturing facility of $9m, offset by a charge of $25m relating to the likely costs of a 
distribution hold on RENASYS in the US pending new regulatory approvals and a charge of $28m relating to the HP802 programme which was 
stopped in the fourth quarter.

Transactional and translational exchange
The Group’s principal markets outside the US are, in order of significance, Continental Europe, UK, Australia and Japan. Revenues in these markets 
fluctuate when translated into US Dollars on consolidation. During the year, the average rates of exchange against the US Dollar used to translate 
revenues and profits arising in these markets changed compared to the previous year as follows: the Euro weakened from 1.33 to 1.09 (–18%), 
Sterling weakened from 1.65 to 1.48 (–10%), the Swiss Franc weakened from 1.09 to 1.00 (–8%), the Australian Dollar weakened from 0.90 to 0.73 
(–18%) and the Japanese Yen weakened from 105.84 to 120.38 (14%).
The Group’s principal manufacturing locations are in the US, Switzerland, UK and China. The majority of the Group’s selling and distribution 
subsidiaries around the world purchase finished products from these locations. As a result of currency movements compared with the previous 
year, sales from the US became relatively more profitable to all of these countries. The Group’s policy of purchasing forward a proportion of its 
currency requirements and the existence of an inventory pipeline reduce the short-term impact of currency movements.

contractual obligations are not included in the above table.
The agreed contributions for 2016 in respect of the Group’s defined benefits plans are: $36m for the UK (including $29m of supplementary 
payments), $20m for the US Plan and $6m for other funded defined benefit plans. The table above does not include amounts payable in respect of 
2016 and beyond as these are subject to future agreement and amounts cannot be reasonably estimated.
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate upon a change in control of the Company or the Group following a takeover, 
such as bank loan agreements and Company share plans. None of these are deemed to be significant in terms of their potential impact on the 
business of the Group as a whole. In addition, there are service contracts between the Company and its Executive Directors which provide for the 
automatic payment of a bonus following loss of office or employment occurring because of a successful takeover bid. Further details are set out on 
page 100.
The Company does not have contracts or other arrangements which individually are essential to the business.
2014 Financial highlights
Revenue
Group revenue increased by $266m (6% on a reported basis), from $4,351m in 2013 to $4,617m in 2014.
The underlying increase is 2%, after adjusting for the 5% impact of the acquisitions of ArthroCare and a Brazilian distributor and 1% attributable to 
the unfavourable impact of currency movements. Despite flat growth in the Established Markets, growth of 17% in the Emerging & International 
Markets contributed to this underlying increase of 2%.
Cost of goods sold
Cost of goods sold increased by $62m (6% on a reported basis) from $1,100m in 2013 to $1,162m in 2014. The underlying movement is 5% after 
adjusting for the net impact of 4% from the ArthroCare acquisition and 3% attributable to the unfavourable impact of currency movements. 
The movement in underlying costs of goods sold of 5% is largely attributable to the increase in underlying trading.
During 2014, $12m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses (2013 – $12m) and $23m of acquisition related costs (2013 – $5m) were charged to 
cost of goods sold.
Selling, general and administration expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $261m (12% on a reported basis) from $2,210m in 2013 to $2,471m in 2014. 
The underlying movement is 5% after adjusting for the net impact of 7% from the ArthroCare acquisition. Currency movements had no impact.
The underlying increase of 5% is due to the promotion of new product and costs associated with the RENASYS distribution hold and HP802 
termination and the underlying increase in trading.
In 2014, administrative expenses included $62m of amortisation of other intangible assets (2013 – $64m), $49m of restructuring and rationalisation 
expenses (2013 – $46m), an amount of $129m relating to amortisation of acquisition intangibles (2013 – $88m) and $95m of acquisition related 
costs (2013 – $26m).

OTHER FINANCIAL 
INFORMATION OTHER FINANCIAL 
INFORMATION
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenditure as a percentage of revenue remained broadly consistent at 5.1% in 2014 (2013 – 5.3%). Actual expenditure 
was $235m in 2014 compared to $231m in 2013. The Group continues to invest in innovative technologies and products to differentiate it 
from competitors. 
Operating profit
Operating profit decreased by $61m to $749m from $810m in 2013. This comprised an increase of $6m in Advanced Surgical Devices and a 
decrease of $67m in Advanced Wound Management.
The movement in Advanced Surgical Devices is attributable to the continuing pressure on margins and its investment in the  
Emerging & International Markets. Advanced Wound Management has been adversely impacted by the costs associated with the 
RENASYS distribution hold and the impairment and costs associated with the termination of the HP802 programme.
Net interest receivable/(payable)
Net interest receivable increased by $ 26m from net $4m receivable in 2013 to a net receivable of $ 22m in 2014. This movement is primarily due to 
an increase in interest payable as a result of financing the ArthroCare acquisition. Interest receivable also decreased following the repayment by 
Bioventus LLC of their loan note in October 2014.
Other finance cost
Other finance costs in 2014 remained at $11m and principally relate to costs associated with the Group’s retirement benefit schemes.
Taxation
The taxation charge decreased by $33m to $213m from $246m in 2013. The reported rate of tax was 29.9%, compared with 30.5% in 2013.
After adjusting for specific transactions that management considers affect the Group’s short-term profitability, restructuring and rationalisation 
expenses, amortisation of acquisition intangibles, acquisition related costs and legal and other items, the tax rate on trading profit was 27.7% 
(2013 – 29.2%).
Commentary on the Group balance sheet
Non-current assets
Non-current assets increased by $ 1,303m to $4,866m in 2014 from $3,563m in 2013. This is principally attributable to the following:
 − Property, plant and equipment increased by $ 75m from $816m in 2013 to $891m in 2014. Depreciation of $222m was charged during 2014, 
assets with a net book value of $15m were disposed of and $14m was impaired relating to HP802. These movements were offset by $298m of 
additions relating primarily to instruments and other plant & machinery and $62m of additions arising on acquisitions of ArthroCare. The balance 
relates to unfavourable currency movements totalling $34m.
 − Goodwill increased by $771m from $1,256m in 2013 to $2,027m in 2014. Of this movement, $829m arose on the acquisition of ArthroCare and 
$15m on the acquisition in Brazil. The remaining balance relates to favourable currency movements totalling $73m.
 − Intangible assets decreased by $693m from $1,054m in 2013 to $1,747m in 2014. Intangible assets totalling $817m and $16m arose on the 
acquisition of ArthroCare and Brazil respectively. Amortisation of $191m was charged during the year and assets with a net book value of $1m 
were disposed of. A total of $77m relates to the cost of intellectual property, distribution rights and software acquired. The balance relates to 
unfavourable currency movements totalling $25m.
 − Investment in associates of $112m in 2014 has increased from $107m in 2013. The loan to the associate was fully repaid in the year.
 − Deferred tax assets decreased by $68m in the year from $145m in 2013 to $77m in 2014.
Current assets
Current assets increased by $184m to $2,440m from $2,256m in 2013. The movement relates to the following:
 − Inventories rose by $175m to $1,181m in 2014 from $1,006m in 2013. This movement is principally attributable to the acquisitions of ArthroCare 
and distributor in Brazil which increased inventory by $70m and $36m relating to the purchase of an advanced quantity of an ingredient to 
ensure continued supply of REGRANEX.
 − The level of trade and other receivables increased by $53m to $1,166m in 2014 from $1,113m in 2013. The movement primarily relates to the 
increase in underlying revenues and $54m from the ArthroCare acquisition offset by $75m of unfavourable currency movements.
 − Cash at bank has fallen by $44m to $93m from $137m in 2013.
Non-current liabilities
Non-current liabilities increased by $1,405m from $699m in 2013 to $2,104m in 2014. This movement relates to the following items:
 − Long-term borrowings have increased from $347m in 2013 to $1,666m in 2014 as a result of the $1.1bn private placements and $400m additional 
long-term facility use to fund the acquisition of ArthroCare.
 − The Retirement benefit obligation increased by $3m to $233m in 2014 from $230m in 2013.
 − Deferred tax liabilities increased by $48m in the year from $50m in 2013 to $98m in 2014.
Current liabilities
Current liabilities increased by $89m from $1,073m in 2013 to $1,162m in 2014. This movement is attributable to:
 − Bank overdrafts and current borrowings have decreased by $5m from $44m in 2013 to $39m in 2014.
 − Trade and other payables have increased by $53m to $838m in 2014 from $785m in 2013. This increase includes $75m of trade and other 
payables arising on the acquisition of ArthroCare and distributor in Brazil offset by $34m of favourable currency movements.
 − Current tax payable is $218m at the end of 2014 compared to $184m in 2013.

Revenue
Group revenue increased by $214m (5% on a reported basis), from $4,137m in 2012 to $4,351 in 2013. The underlying increase is 4% after adjusting 
for the net impact of 2% on the Healthpoint acquisition and Clinical Therapies disposal and 1% attributable to the unfavourable impact of 
currency movements.
Costs of goods sold
Costs of goods sold increased by $30m (3% on a reported basis) from $1,070m in 2012 to $1,100m in 2013. The underlying movement is 2% after 
adjusting for the net impact of 2% on the Healthpoint acquisition and Clinical Therapies disposal and 1% attributable to the favourable impact of 
currency movements. The movement in underlying costs of goods sold of 2% is largely attributable to the increase in underlying trading.
During 2013, $12m of restructuring and rationalisation expenses (2012 – $3m) and $5m of acquisition related costs (2012 – $nil) were charged to 
costs of goods sold.
Selling, general and administration expenses
Selling, general and administrative expenses increased by $160m (8% on a reported basis) from $2,050m in 2012 to $2,210m in 2013. 
The underlying movement is 6% after adjusting for the net impact of 3% on the Healthpoint acquisition and Clinical Therapies disposal and 1% 
attributable to the favourable impact of currency movements.
The underlying increase of 6% is due to the continuing investment in Emerging & International Markets, promotion of new products in ASD and 
AWM and the underlying increase in trading.
In 2013, administrative expenses included $64m of amortisation of other intangible assets (2012 – $51m), $46m of restructuring and rationalisation 
expenses (2012 – $62m), an amount of $88m relating to amortisation of acquisition intangibles (2012 – $43m) and $26m of acquisition related 
costs (2012 – $11m).
Research and development expenses
Research and development expenditure as a percentage of revenue increased by 1.2% to 5.3% in 2013 (2012 – 4.1%). Actual expenditure  
was $231m in 2013 compared to $171m in 2012. The Group continues to invest in innovative technologies and products to differentiate it

Operating profit
Operating profit decreased by $36m to $810m from $846m in 2012. This comprised a decrease of $12m in Advanced Surgical Devices and a

Net interest receivable/(payable)
Net interest receivable increased by $2m from net $2m receivable in 2012 to a net receivable of $4m in 2013. This increase is principally a 
consequence of the interest receivable on the Bioventus LLC (‘Bioventus’) loan note issued following the disposal of the Clinical Therapies business 
which has been in place for a full year in 2013 compared to eight months in 2012. This loan note was repaid in full in 2014.

investments. These operations are commonly known as ‘boiler rooms’.

wrong. If you receive any unsolicited investment advice, obtain the correct name of the person and organisation and check that they are properly 
authorised by the FCA by visiting www.fca.org.uk/register/ .
If you think you have been approached by an unauthorised firm you should contact the FCA consumer helpline on 0800 111 6768 or e-mail

Dividend history
Smith & Nephew has paid dividends on its ordinary shares in every year since 1937. Following the capital restructuring and dividend reduction in 
2000, the Group adopted a policy of increasing its dividend cover (the ratio of EPSA, as set out in the ‘Selected financial data’, to ordinary dividends 
declared for the year). This was intended to increase the financing capability of the Group for acquisitions and other investments. From 2000 to 
2004, the dividend increased in line with inflation and, in 2004, dividend cover stood at 4.1 times. Having achieved this level of dividend cover the 
Board changed its policy, from that of increasing dividends in line with inflation, to that of increasing dividends for 2005 and after by 10%. 
Following the redenomination of the Company’s share capital into US Dollars, the Board re-affirmed its policy of increasing the dividend by 10% a 
year in US Dollar terms.
On 2 August 2012, the Board announced its intention to pursue a progressive dividend policy, with the aim of increasing the US Dollar value  
of ordinary dividends over time broadly based on the Group’s underlying growth in earnings, while taking into account capital requirements and 
cash flows.
At the time of the full year results, the Board reviews the appropriate level of total annual dividend each year. The Board intends that the interim 
dividend will be set by a formula and will be equivalent to 40% of the total dividend for the previous year. Dividends will continue to be declared in 
US Dollars with an equivalent amount in Sterling payable to those shareholders whose registered address is in the UK, or who have validly elected 
to receive Sterling dividends.
An interim dividend in respect of each fiscal year is normally declared in August and paid in November. A final dividend will be recommended by 
the Board of Directors and paid subject to approval by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting.
Future dividends of Smith & Nephew will be dependent upon: future earnings; the future financial condition of the Group; the Board’s dividend 
policy; and the additional factors that might affect the business of the Group set out in ‘Special note regarding forward-looking statements’ and 
‘Risk Factors’.

Dividends above include the associated UK tax credit of 10%, but exclude the deduction of withholding taxes, up to and including the interim 
dividend for 2015. From 6 April 2016, please note that dividends below £5,000 per tax year will be tax free and dividends above £5,000 per tax 
year will be subject to personal income tax at the rate of 7.5% for basic rate taxpayers, 32.5% for higher rate taxpayers and 38.1% for additional rate 
taxpayers. A self-assessment form will therefore be required. This will apply to both cash and DRIP dividends, although dividends paid on shares 
held within pensions and ISAs will be unaffected, remaining tax free.
Since the second interim dividend for 2005, all dividends have been declared in US cents per ordinary share.
The 2015 final dividend will be payable on 11 May 2016, subject to shareholder approval.
In respect of the proposed final dividend for the year ended 31 December 2015 of 19.0 US cents per ordinary share, the record date will be 22 April 
2016 and the payment date will be 11 May 2016. The Sterling equivalent per ordinary share will be set following the record date. Shareholders may 
elect to receive their dividend in either Sterling or US Dollars and the last day for election will be 22 April 2016. The ordinary shares will trade 
ex-dividend on both the London and New York Stock Exchanges from 21 April 2016. 
The proposed final dividend of 19.0 US cents per ordinary share, which together with the interim dividend of 11.8 US cents, makes a total for 2015  
of 30.8 US cents.

INFORMATION FOR 
SHAREHOLDERS INFORMATION FOR 
SHAREHOLDERS
Share Capital
The principal trading market for the ordinary shares is the London Stock Exchange. The ordinary shares were listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange on 16 November 1999, trading in the form of ADSs evidenced by ADRs. Each ADS represents two ordinary shares from 14 October 2014, 
before which time one ADS represented five ordinary shares. The ADS facility is sponsored by Deutsche Bank acting as depositary.
All the ordinary shares, including those held by Directors and Executive Officers, rank pari passu with each other. On 23 January 2006, the 
ordinary shares of 12
2
/ 9p were redenominated as ordinary shares of US 20 cents (following approval by shareholders at the Extraordinary General 
Meeting in December 2005). The new US Dollar ordinary shares carry the same rights as the previous ordinary shares. The share price continues 
to be quoted in Sterling. In 2006, the Company issued £50,000 of shares in Sterling in order to comply with English law. These were issued as 
deferred shares, which are not listed on any stock exchange. They have extremely limited rights and therefore effectively have no value. 
These shares were allotted to the Chief Executive Officer, although the Board reserves the right to transfer them to another member of the Board 
should it so wish.
Shareholdings
As at 23 February 2016, to the knowledge of the Group, there were 17,487 registered holders of ordinary shares, of whom 91 had registered 
addresses in the USA and held a total of 187,058 ordinary shares (0.02% of the total issued). Because certain ordinary shares are registered in the 
names of nominees, the number of shareholders with registered addresses in the USA is not representative of the number of beneficial owners of 
ordinary shares resident in the USA.
As at 23 February 2016, 28,257,095 ADSs equivalent to 56,514,190 ordinary shares or approximately 6.31% of the total ordinary shares in issue, 
were outstanding and were held by 87 registered ADS holders.
Major shareholders
As far as is known to Smith & Nephew, the Group is not directly or indirectly owned or controlled by another corporation or by any government and 
the Group has not entered into arrangements, the operation of which may at a subsequent date result in a change in control of the Group.
As at 23 February 2016, no persons are known to Smith & Nephew to have any interest (as defined in the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the 
FCA) in 3% or more of the ordinary shares, other than as shown below. The following tables show changes over the last three years in the 
percentage and numbers of the issued share capital owned by shareholders holding 3% or more of ordinary shares, as notified to the Company

The Company is not aware of any person who has a significant direct or indirect holding of securities in the Company, and is not aware of any 
persons holding securities which may control the Company. There are no securities in issue which have special rights as to the control of 
the Company.
Purchase of ordinary shares on behalf of the Company
At the AGM, the Company will be seeking a renewal of its current permission from shareholders to purchase up to 10% of its own shares. In order 
to avoid shareholder dilution, shares allotted to employees through employee share schemes are bought back on a quarterly basis and 
subsequently cancelled by the Company. From 1 January 2015 to 23 February 2016, in the months listed below, the Company has purchased

> > < Exchange controls and other limitations affecting security holders
There are no UK governmental laws, decrees or regulations that restrict the export or import of capital or that affect the payment of dividends, 
interest or other payments to non-resident holders of Smith & Nephew’s securities, except for certain restrictions imposed from time to time by Her 
Majesty’s Treasury of the United Kingdom pursuant to legislation, such as the United Nations Act 1946 and the Emergency Laws Act 1964, against 
the government or residents of certain countries.
There are no limitations, either under the laws of the UK or under the Articles of Association of Smith & Nephew, restricting the right of non-UK 
residents to hold or to exercise voting rights in respect of ordinary shares, except that where any overseas shareholder has not provided to the 
Company a UK address for the service of notices, the Company is under no obligation to send any notice or other document to an overseas 
address. It is, however, the current practice of the Company to send every notice or other document to all shareholders regardless of the country 
recorded in the register of members, with the exception of details of the Company’s dividend reinvestment plan, which are not sent to shareholders 
with recorded addresses in the USA and Canada.
Taxation information for shareholders
The comments below are of a general and summary nature and are based on the Group’s understanding of certain aspects of current UK and US 
federal income tax law and practice relevant to the ADSs and ordinary shares not in ADS form. The comments address the material US and UK tax 
consequences generally applicable to a person who is the beneficial owner of ADSs or ordinary shares and who, for US federal income tax 
purposes, is a citizen or resident of the USA, a corporation (or other entity taxable as a corporation) created or organised in or under the laws of the 
USA (or any State therein), or an estate or trust the income of which is included in gross income for US federal income tax purposes regardless of its 
source (each a ‘US Holder’). The comments set out below do not purport to address all tax consequences of the ownership of ADSs or ordinary 
shares that may be material to a particular holder and in particular do not deal with the position of shareholders who directly or indirectly own 10% 
or more of the Company’s issued ordinary shares. This discussion does not apply to (i) persons whose holding of ADSs or ordinary shares is 
effectively connected with or pertains to either a permanent establishment in the UK through which a US Holder carries on a business in the UK or 
a fixed base from which a US Holder performs independent personal services in the UK, or (ii) persons whose registered address is inside the UK. 
This discussion does not apply to certain investors subject to special rules, such as certain financial institutions, tax-exempt entities, insurance 
companies, broker-dealers and traders in securities that elect to use the mark-to-market method of tax accounting, partnerships or other entities 
treated as partnerships for US federal income tax purposes, US Holders holding ADSs or ordinary shares as part of a hedging, conversion or other 
integrated transaction or whose functional currency for US federal income tax purposes is other than the US Dollar and US Holders liable for 
alternative minimum tax. In addition, the comments below do not address the potential application of the provisions of the United States Internal 
Revenue Code, known as the Medicare contribution tax, or any US state, local or non-US (other than UK) taxes. The summary deals only with US 
Holders who hold ADSs or ordinary shares as capital assets. The summary is based on current UK and US law and practice which is subject to 
change, possibly with retroactive effect. US Holders are recommended to consult their own tax advisers as to the particular tax consequences to 
them of the ownership of ADSs or ordinary shares. The Company believes, and this discussion assumes, that the Company was not a passive 
foreign investment company for its taxable year ended 31 December 2015.
This discussion is based in part on representations by the depositary and assumes that each obligation under the deposit agreement and any 
related agreement will be performed in accordance with its terms. For purposes of US federal income tax law, US Holders of ADSs will generally be 
treated as owners of the ordinary shares represented by the ADSs. However, the US Treasury has expressed concerns that parties to whom 
depositary shares are released before shares are delivered to the depositary (‘pre-released’) may be taking actions that are inconsistent with the 
claiming of foreign tax credits by owners of depositary shares. Such actions would also be inconsistent with the claiming of the reduced rate of tax, 
described below, applicable to dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders. Accordingly, the availability of the reduced tax rate for 
dividends received by certain non-corporate US Holders of ADSs could be affected by actions that may be taken by parties to whom ADSs are 
pre-released.
Taxation of dividends in the UK and the USA
The UK does not currently impose a withholding tax on dividends paid by a UK corporation, such as the Company.
Distributions paid by the Company will be treated for US federal income tax purposes as foreign source ordinary dividend income to a US Holder to 
the extent paid out of the Company’s current or accumulated earnings and profits as determined for US federal income tax purposes. Because the 
Company does not maintain calculations of its earnings and profits under US federal income tax principles, it is expected that distributions 
generally will be reported to US Holders as dividends. Such dividends will not be eligible for the dividends-received deduction generally allowed to 
corporate US Holders.
Dividends paid to certain non-corporate US Holders of ordinary shares or ADSs may be subject to US federal income tax at lower rates than those 
applicable to other types of ordinary income if certain conditions are met. Non-corporate US Holders should consult their own tax advisers to 
determine whether they are subject to any special rules that limit their ability to be taxed at these favourable rates.

INFORMATION FOR 
SHAREHOLDERS INFORMATION FOR 
SHAREHOLDERS
Taxation of capital gains
US Holders, who are not resident or ordinarily resident for tax purposes in the UK, will not generally be liable for UK capital gains tax on any capital 
gain realised upon the sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares unless the ADSs or ordinary shares are held in connection with a trade 
carried on in the UK through a permanent establishment (or in the case of individuals, through a branch or agency). Furthermore, UK resident 
individuals who acquire ADSs or ordinary shares before becoming temporarily non-UK residents may remain subject to UK taxation of capital gains 
on gains realised while non-resident.
For US federal income tax purposes, gains or losses realised upon a taxable sale or other disposition of ADSs or ordinary shares by US Holders 
generally will be US source capital gains or losses and will be long-term capital gains or losses if the ADSs or ordinary shares were held for more 
than one year. The amount of a US Holder’s gain or loss will be equal to the difference between the amount realised on the sale or other disposition 
and such holder’s tax basis in the ADSs, or ordinary shares, each determined in US Dollars.
Inheritance and estate taxes
The HM Revenue & Customs imposes inheritance tax on capital transfers which occur on death, and in the seven years preceding death. The HM 
Revenue & Customs considers that the US/UK Double Taxation Convention on Estate and Gift Tax applies to inheritance tax. Consequently, a US 
citizen who is domiciled in the USA and is not a UK national or domiciled in the UK will not be subject to UK inheritance tax in respect of ADSs and 
ordinary shares. A UK national who is domiciled in the USA will be subject to both UK inheritance tax and US federal estate tax but will be entitled 
to a credit for US federal estate tax charged in respect of ADSs and ordinary shares in computing the liability to UK inheritance tax. Conversely, a US 
citizen who is domiciled or deemed domiciled in the UK will be entitled to a credit for UK inheritance tax charged in respect of ADSs and ordinary 
shares in computing the liability for US federal estate tax. Special rules apply where ADSs and ordinary shares are business property of a 
permanent establishment of an enterprise situated in the UK.
US information reporting and backup withholding
Payments of dividends on, or proceeds from the sale of, ADSs or ordinary shares that are made within the USA or through certain US-related 
financial intermediaries generally will be subject to US information reporting, and may be subject to backup withholding, unless a US Holder is an 
exempt recipient or, in the case of backup withholding, provides a correct US taxpayer identification number and certain other conditions are met. 
US backup withholding may apply if there has been a notification from the US Internal Revenue Service of a failure to report all interest or dividends.
Any backup withholding deducted may be credited against the US Holder’s US federal income tax liability, and, where the backup withholding 
exceeds the actual liability, the US Holder may obtain a refund by timely filing the appropriate refund claim with the US Internal Revenue Service.
Certain US Holders who are individuals (and under proposed Treasury regulations, certain entities) may be required to report information relating to 
securities issued by a non-US person (or foreign accounts through which the securities are held), subject to certain exceptions (including an 
exception for securities held in accounts maintained by US financial institutions). US Holders should consult their tax advisers regarding their 
reporting obligations with respect to the ordinary shares or ADSs.
UK stamp duty and stamp duty reserve tax
UK stamp duty is charged on documents and in particular instruments for the transfer of registered ownership of ordinary shares. Transfers of 
ordinary shares in certificated form will generally be subject to UK stamp duty at the rate of ½% of the consideration given for the transfer with the 
duty rounded up to the nearest £5.
UK stamp duty reserve tax (‘SDRT’) arises when there is an agreement to transfer shares in UK companies ‘for consideration in money or money’s 
worth’, and so an agreement to transfer ordinary shares for money or other consideration may give rise to a charge to SDRT at the rate of ½% 
(rounded up to the nearest penny). The charge of SDRT will be cancelled, and any SDRT already paid will be refunded, if within six years of the 
agreement an instrument of transfer is produced to HM Revenue & Customs and the appropriate stamp duty paid.
Transfers of ordinary shares into CREST (an electronic transfer system) are exempt from stamp duty so long as the transferee is a member of CREST 
who will hold the ordinary shares as a nominee for the transferor and the transfer is in a form that will ensure that the securities become held in 
uncertificated form within CREST. Paperless transfers of ordinary shares within CREST for consideration in money or money’s worth are liable to 
SDRT rather than stamp duty. SDRT on relevant transactions will be collected by CREST at ½%, and this will apply whether or not the transfer is 
effected in the UK and whether or not the parties to it are resident or situated in the UK.
A charge of stamp duty or SDRT at the rate of 1½% of the consideration (or, in some circumstances, the value of the shares concerned) will arise on 
a transfer or issue of ordinary shares to the depositary or to certain persons providing a clearance service (or their nominees or agents) for the 
conversion into ADRs and will generally be payable by the depositary or person providing clearance service. In accordance with the terms of the 
Deposit Agreement, any tax or duty payable by the depositary on deposits of ordinary shares will be charged by the depositary to the party to 
whom ADRs are delivered against such deposits.
No liability for stamp duty or SDRT will arise on any transfer of, or agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS, provided that 
the ADS and any instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer remains at all times outside the UK, and provided further that any 
instrument of transfer or written agreement to transfer is not executed in the UK and the transfer does not relate to any matter or thing done or to be 
done in the UK (the location of the custodian as a holder of ordinary shares not being relevant in this context). In any other case, any transfer of, or 
agreement to transfer, an ADS or beneficial ownership of an ADS could, depending on all the circumstances of the transfer, give rise to a charge to 
stamp duty or SDRT.

Articles of Association and English law. This summary is qualified in its entirety by reference to the Companies Act and the Company’s Articles of 
Association. In the following description, a ‘shareholder’ is the person registered in the Company’s register of members as the holder of an 
ordinary share.
The Company is incorporated under the name Smith & Nephew plc and is registered in England and Wales with registered number 324357.
The Company’s ordinary shares may be held in certificated or uncertificated form. No holder of the Company’s shares will be required to make

Company. This is subject to certain exceptions relating to proposals (a) indemnifying him in respect of obligations incurred on behalf of the 
Company, (b) indemnifying a third party in respect of obligations of the Company for which the Director has assumed responsibility under an 
indemnity or guarantee, (c) relating to an offer of securities in which he will be interested as an underwriter, (d) concerning another body corporate 
in which the Director is beneficially interested in less than 1% of the issued shares of any class of shares of such a body corporate, (e) relating to an 
employee benefit in which the Director will share equally with other employees and (f) relating to any insurance that the Company is empowered to 
purchase for the benefit of Directors of the Company in respect of actions undertaken as Directors (and/or officers) of the Company.
A Director shall not vote or be counted in any quorum present at a meeting in relation to a resolution on which he is not entitled to vote.
The Directors are empowered to exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money, subject to the limitation that the aggregate amount 
of all monies borrowed after deducting cash and current asset investments by the Company and its subsidiaries shall not exceed the sum 
of $6,500,000,000.
Any Director who has been appointed by the Directors since the previous Annual General Meeting of shareholders, either to fill a casual vacancy 
or as an additional Director holds office only until the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting and then shall be eligible for re-election by 
the shareholders. The other Directors retire and are eligible for re-appointment at the third Annual General Meeting after the meeting at which they 
were last re-appointed. If not re-appointed, a Director retiring at a meeting shall retain office until the meeting appoints someone in his place, or if it 
does not do so, until the conclusion of the meeting. The Directors are subject to removal with or without cause by the Board or the shareholders. 
Directors are not required to hold any shares of the Company by way of qualification.
Under the Company’s Articles of Association and English law, a Director may be indemnified out of the assets of the Company against liabilities he 
may sustain or incur in the execution of his duties.
Rights attaching to ordinary shares
Under English law, dividends are payable on the Company’s ordinary shares only out of profits available for distribution, as determined in 
accordance with accounting principles generally accepted in the UK and by the Companies Act 2006. Holders of the Company’s ordinary shares 
are entitled to receive final dividends as may be declared by the Directors and approved by the shareholders in general meeting, rateable 
according to the amounts paid up on such shares, provided that the dividend cannot exceed the amount recommended by the Directors.
The Company’s Board of Directors may declare such interim dividends as appear to them to be justified by the Company’s financial position. 
If authorised by an ordinary resolution of the shareholders, the Board may also direct payment of a dividend in whole or in part by the distribution of 
specific assets (and in particular of paid up shares or debentures of the Company).
Any dividend unclaimed after 12 years from the date the dividend was declared, or became due for payment, will be forfeited and will revert to 
the Company.
There were no material modifications to the rights of shareholders under the Articles during 2016.
Voting rights of ordinary shares
Voting at any general meeting of shareholders is by a show of hands unless a poll, which is a written vote, is duly demanded and held. On a show 
of hands, every shareholder who is present in person at a general meeting has one vote regardless of the number of shares held. On a poll, every 
shareholder who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for each ordinary share held by that shareholder. A poll may be demanded by any 
of the following:
 − the chairman of the meeting;
 − at least five shareholders present or by proxy entitled to vote on the resolution;
 − any shareholder or shareholders representing in the aggregate not less than one-tenth of the total voting rights of all shareholders entitled to vote 
on the resolution; or
 − any shareholder or shareholders holding shares conferring a right to vote on the resolution on which there have been paid-up sums in 
aggregate equal to not less than one-tenth of the total sum paid up on all the shares conferring that right.
A form of proxy will be treated as giving the proxy the authority to demand a poll, or to join others in demanding one, as above.
The necessary quorum for a general meeting is two shareholders present in person or by proxy carrying the right to vote upon the business to 
be transacted.

SMITH & NEPHEW ANNUAL REPORT 2015 www.smith-nephew.com

INFORMATION FOR 
SHAREHOLDERS INFORMATION FOR 
SHAREHOLDERS
Matters are transacted at general meetings of the Company by the processing and passing of resolutions of which there are two kinds; ordinary or 
special resolutions:
 − Ordinary resolutions include resolutions for the re-election of Directors, the approval of financial statements, the declaration of dividends (other 
than interim dividends), the appointment and re-appointment of auditors or the grant of authority to allot shares. An ordinary resolution requires 
the affirmative vote of a majority of the votes of those persons voting at the meetings at which there is a quorum.
 − Special resolutions include resolutions amending the Company’s Articles of Association, dis-applying statutory pre-emption rights or changing 
the Company’s name; modifying the rights of any class of the Company’s shares at a meeting of the holders of such class or relating to certain 
matters concerning the Company’s winding up. A special resolution requires the affirmative vote of not less than three-quarters of the votes of 
the persons voting at the meeting at which there is a quorum.
Annual General Meetings must be convened upon advance written notice of 21 days. Other general meetings must be convened upon advance 
written notice of at least 14 clear days. The days of delivery or receipt of notice are not included. The notice must specify the nature of the business 
to be transacted. Meetings are convened by the Board of Directors. Members with 5% of the ordinary share capital of the Company may requisition 
the Board to convene a meeting.
Variation of rights
If, at any time, the Company’s share capital is divided into different classes of shares, the rights attached to any class may be varied, subject to the 
provisions of the Companies Act, with the consent in writing of holders of three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class or upon 
the adoption of a special resolution passed at a separate meeting of the holders of the shares of that class. At every such separate meeting, all the 
provisions of the articles of association relating to proceedings at a general meeting apply, except that the quorum is to be the number of persons 
(which must be two or more) who hold or represent by proxy not less than one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class and at any 
such meeting a poll may be demanded in writing by any person or their proxy who hold shares of that class. Where a person is present by proxy or 
proxies, he is treated as holding only the shares in respect of which the proxies are authorised to exercise voting rights.
Rights in a winding up
Except as the Company’s shareholders have agreed or may otherwise agree, upon the Company’s winding up, the balance of assets available 
for distribution:
 − after the payment of all creditors including certain preferential creditors, whether statutorily preferred creditors or normal creditors; and
 − subject to any special rights attaching to any other class of shares;
 − is to be distributed among the holders of ordinary shares according to the amounts paid-up on the shares held by them. This distribution is 
generally to be made in US Dollars. A liquidator may, however, upon the adoption of any extraordinary resolution of the shareholders and any 
other sanction required by law, divide among the shareholders the whole or any part of the Company’s assets in kind.
Limitations on voting and shareholding
There are no limitations imposed by English law or the Company’s Articles of Association on the right of non-residents or foreign persons 
to hold or vote the Company’s ordinary shares or ADSs, other than the limitations that would generally apply to all of the Company’s 
shareholders.
Transfers of shares
The Board may refuse to register the transfer of shares held in certificated form which:
 − are not fully paid (provided that it shall not exercise this discretion in such a way as to prevent stock market dealings in the shares of that class 
from taking place on an open and proper basis);
 − are not duly stamped or duly certified or otherwise shown to the satisfaction of the Board to be exempt from stamp duty, lodged at the Transfer 
Office or at such other place as the Board may appoint and (save in the case of a transfer by a person to whom no certificate was issued in 
respect of the shares in question) accompanied by the certificate for the shares to which it relates, and such other evidence as the Board may 
reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to make the transfer and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some other person on 
his behalf, the authority of that person so to do;
 − are in respect of more than one class of shares; or
 − are in favour of more than four transferees.
Deferred shares
Following the re-denomination of share capital on 23 January 2006, the ordinary shares’ nominal value became 20 US cents each. There were no 
changes to the rights or obligations of the ordinary shares. In order to comply with the Companies Act 2006, a new class of Sterling shares was 
created, deferred shares, of which £50,000 were issued and allotted in 2006 as fully paid to the Chief Executive Officer though the Board reserves 
the right to transfer them to another member of the Board should it so wish. These deferred shares have no voting or dividend rights and on 
winding up only are entitled to repayment at nominal value only if all ordinary shareholders have received the nominal value of their shares plus an 
additional $1,000 each.
Amendments
The Company does not have any special rules about amendments to its Articles of Association beyond those imposed by law.

company of the Group. It is an English public limited company with its 
shares listed on the premium list of the UK Listing Authority and traded 
on the London Stock Exchange. Shares are also traded on the New

This is the Annual Report of Smith & Nephew plc for the year ended 
31 December 2015. It comprises, in a single document, the Annual

presented in US Dollars. Solely for the convenience of the reader, 
certain parts of this Annual Report contain translations of amounts in US

The Group’s reports filed with, or furnished to, the US Securities and

information released, or oral statements made, to the public in the 
future by or on behalf of the Group, contain ‘forward-looking statements’ 
within the meaning of the US Private Securities Litigation Reform Act of 
1995, that may or may not prove accurate. For example, statements 
regarding expected revenue growth and trading profit margins 
discussed under ‘Outlook’, ‘Global Outlook’ and ‘Strategic performance’, 
market trends and our product pipeline are forward-looking statements. 
Phrases such as ‘aim’, ‘plan’, ‘intend’, ‘anticipate’, ‘well-placed’, ‘believe’, 
‘estimate’, ‘expect’, ‘target’, ‘consider’ and similar expressions are 
generally intended to identify forward-looking statements. Forward-
looking statements involve known and unknown risks, uncertainties 
and other important factors that could cause actual results, to differ 
materially from what is expressed or implied by the statements. 
For Smith & Nephew, these factors include: economic and financial 
conditions in the markets we serve, especially those affecting health 
care providers, payers and customers; price levels for established and 
innovative medical devices; developments in medical technology; 
regulatory approvals, reimbursement decisions or other government 
actions; product defects or recalls; litigation relating to patent or other 
claims; legal compliance risks and related investigative, remedial or 
enforcement actions; strategic actions, including acquisitions and 
dispositions and our success in performing due diligence, valuing and 
integrating acquired businesses; disruption that may result from 
transactions or other changes we make in our business plans or 
organisation to adapt to market developments and numerous other 
matters that affect us or our markets, including those of a political, 
economic, business, competitive or reputational nature; relationships 
with healthcare professionals; reliance on information technology. 
Specific risks faced by the Group are described under ‘Risk factors’ on 
pages 171to 174 of this Annual Report. Any forward-looking statement is 
based on information available to Smith & Nephew as of the date of the 
statement. All written or oral forward-looking statements attributable to 
Smith & Nephew are qualified by this caution. Smith & Nephew does 
not undertake any obligation to update or revise any forward-looking 
statement to reflect any change in circumstances or 
in Smith & Nephew’s expectations.

> > < The inks used are renewable, biodegradable and emit fewer Volatile Organic Compounds (VOCs) than mineral-oil inks. 
They are based on high levels of renewable raw materials such as vegetable oils and naturally occurring resin. 
The inks do not contain any toxic heavy metals and therefore, do not pose a problem if placed in landfill.

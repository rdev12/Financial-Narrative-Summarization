*before amortisation of goodwill
Country & Metropolitan is a leading developer of urban regeneration projects throughout the UK.
Over 85% of our homes are built on brownfield sites comfortably exceeding the governments
target of 60%. The Group has a highly skilled team dedicated to maximising returns whilst
creating developments which add real value to communities and the environment.

Financial Highlights Country & Metropolitan has delivered another set of outstanding
results in what is a shortened ten month period to 30 June 2003.
Profit before tax and amortisation of goodwill rose to £6.85m. This
record result confirms the Board’s confidence expressed in the
interim statement and I am positive that the Group is well placed
to continue such progress.
Results and dividend
The Group changed its financial year to 30 June following the
acquisition of NorthCountry Homes Group Limited (“NorthCountry”)
and during this shortened ten month period to 30 June 2003 it has
achieved an increase in pre-tax profits before amortisation of
goodwill of 72% to £6.85m (2002: £3.99m).  Operating profit
before amortisation of goodwill rose by 76% to £8.94m (2002:
£5.07m), which resulted in basic earnings per share before
amortisation of goodwill increasing by 56% to 25.91p (2002:
16.56p) per share.  As a consequence, I am pleased to report that
the Board is proposing to increase the final dividend by 21.5% to
2.60p (2002: 2.14p) per share bringing the total for the period to
3.30p (2002: 2.75p).  The final dividend will be paid on 9 January
2004 to shareholders on the register on 12 December 2003.
The Group’s net gearing has reduced from 150% to 139% at the
period end with interest cover increasing from 2.86 to a
comfortable level at 4.28 which is also cushioned by the current
annual rental income of £890,000.  Net asset value per share has
increased to 123.5p per share (2002: 102.7p) representing
shareholders’ funds of £23.3m (2002: £19.4m).
Operating review
As expressed last year and at the interim stage, the Group has
withdrawn from the more difficult luxury homes market in the
South East with only two such units available for sale.  We are
focused primarily to provide homes that are priced at levels which
are affordable in the relevant markets and have commenced some
new initiatives in the South East to achieve this objective.  These
initiatives are in line with the government’s aspirations and also
serve the requirements of local authorities.
However, an exception to the above is our ownership in what we
believe to be one of the most prime sites in London, opposite
Hampton Court Palace, with a direct frontage to the River Thames.
We have now signed heads of agreement with Network Rail for a
major mixed use development of the adjoining Hampton Court
Station and work is progressing for a joint planning application to
be submitted following formal agreement being concluded with
Network Rail.
The Southern Region has sold all the units at the development in
Moseley, Birmingham and has acquired further sites in
Wolverhampton suitable for regeneration.  The development in
Moseley has won the Birmingham Post & Mail Award for Best
Starter Home.
Our city centre development known as "Blue" at Granary Wharf in
Leeds is 50% sold with further units now released for sale.
Construction is expected to be completed in summer 2004.
Development of 43 units at our site at Poole Hospital in
Middlesborough has commenced and we have secured 9
reservations off plan at prices in excess of budget.  A planning
application has been submitted for the conversion of approximately
240,000 square feet of listed buildings, 368,000 square feet of new
build homes and 150,000 square feet of commercial space at High
Royds Hospital in Menston near Leeds and consent is expected later
in the year.  The Group has a 50% interest in this project via a joint
venture company.  The North West region is growing steadily and
Chairman’s Statement
2 Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2003
“The Group is now playing a leading role in urban redevelopment in the UK, with
a particular focus on affordable homes in the north of England.”
David Laing
Chairman has sold 31 of the 42 units at Jackson’s Warehouse in Manchester
with healthy margins and has secured approximately 300 plots for
future development.
NorthCountry’s five regions operating in the North of England have
had a successful period with 542 units sold during the ten months
to 30 June 2003.  It has now secured a resolution to grant planning
consent for approximately 250 units at Havelock Hospital in
Sunderland and construction is expected to commence shortly.
NorthCountry is focused on increasing its land bank suitable for the
first time buyer market and is continuing to achieve this at very
competitive prices. One of its key objectives is to increase the
number of outlets which has been thwarted by the nationwide
frustration in the planning system.  I am pleased to report that to
support the continuing growth of NorthCountry, the management
team led by Jolyon Harrison has been strengthened by the
appointment of Steve Murray as managing director.  Steve Murray
has 20 years experience in the house building sector and was an
executive director of Beazer Group PLC for 6 years.
The Group currently owns or controls 4,200 plots of which 1,790
plots have planning consent.  In addition it owns or controls
strategic land representing potential for a further 1,800 units.
Board Appointment
This year the Group also announced the appointment of Terry
Roydon as Non-Executive Director. I would like to take this
opportunity of formally welcoming Terry to the Board.
Terry has over 35 years experience in the house building industry
and has held a number of board positions in the building sector,
most notably as Chief Executive of Prowting PLC and more recently
as Chairman of Banner Homes Limited. During his time at Prowting,
the Company floated on the London Stock Market and generated an
annual turnover of £150m producing 1,600 homes annually.
Corporate activity
We sold part of our interest in Headway PLC to one of our
substantial shareholders, Allied Commercial Exporters Limited and
as a result our holding has reduced to 8.6%.  We continue to hold
our interest as a trade investment.
Prospects
Since the acquisition of NorthCountry our geographic spread has
increased significantly as has our product range and skill set.  As a
result the enlarged Group is well positioned for further growth,
especially in the current climate of low inflation and low interest
rates, which has provided much needed stability in the housing
market.  
By developing a diverse product portfolio and maintaining our
strong track record in land acquisition we continued to achieve a
record forward order book with contracted sales of £26.7m and
forward reservations of £18.6m as at 30 September 2003.      
I remain confident that Country & Metropolitan will deliver another
impressive set of results in the current year.  On behalf of the
Board, I should like to thank all members of staff for their immense
effort and support for the Group.
David Laing
Chairman
6 October 2003
Country & Metropolitan PLC   Annual Report & Accounts 2003 3 I am delighted to report we have had our most successful year over
the last 13 years. 
Turnover was up by 94% to £62.8m with pre-tax profit before
amortisation of goodwill up by 72% to £6.85m. 
The results are even more impressive given that they are for a
shorter accounting period of ten months to 30 June 2003. Our 
year-end was changed to align with that of NorthCountry Homes
Group Ltd, which was acquired in August 2002. 
The NorthCountry Group has fitted seamlessly into the Group with
their skills in the development of affordable new homes on
environmentally challenging sites, complementing our wider
experience in mixed-use urban renewal projects in city centres and
conversions of listed buildings. 
The enlarged group sold 643 homes in the period at an average
price of £85,000 trading from 28 outlets. 
Our land teams have been working hard to increase our Land Bank
and I am pleased to say we now own or control 4,200 plots of
which 1,790 plots have planning consent. In addition we control
strategic land representing approximately 1,800 plots.
Our forward order book as at 30 September 2003 is £45.3m
comprising 394 units, which is a very satisfactory position. 
The housing market in the South East of England has continued to
slow down, due in part to the inability of first time buyers to be
able to afford to purchase. Prices had become over heated and I
am sure most people will welcome a return to a more stable
marketplace. 
Our Southern Division has started a programme of lower cost flats
and houses of which some will be created from the conversion of
former office blocks.
We are at the early stages of discussions with a number of
landowners within areas being promoted by the Office of the
Deputy Prime Minister to promote low cost housing in the Thames
Gateway and the South Midlands.
Our industry suffers from a dreadful planning system which we
have to endure where, with few exceptions, planning departments
find more and more spurious reasons to delay and prevent us
getting on with the job. Despite this continuing irritation our land
teams, led by my colleague David Foster, are still however
producing the plots as evidenced by our increasing Land Bank.
The Group has proved, with these results, its ability to grow all
aspects of the business and I remain confident that this can be
continued in the future.

The site was subject to an archaeological dig which is
becoming a more common requirement of the
planning process and whilst this is understandable for
conservation it can cause substantial delays to the
development programme.

- Regional Offices   Profit and loss account
The Group’s turnover for the short 10 month period ended 30 June
2003 increased by 94% from £32.3m to £62.8m and included a full
contribution from NorthCountry. Gross margin has been maintained
at 28% with gross profit rising to £17.5m (2002: £9.0m). Operating
profit before amortisation of goodwill has increased from £5.1m to
£8.9m. Profit on ordinary activities before tax and amortisation of
goodwill has increased by 72% to £6.85m (2002: £3.99m). 
Basic earnings per share before amortisation of goodwill has risen
by 56% to 25.91p (2001: 16.56p) in the shorter accounting period.
In line with the progressive dividend policy the directors have
proposed a final dividend of 2.6p per share, an increase of 21.5%
over the previous year, resulting in a total of 3.30p for the period.  
Capital structure and treasury policy
The Group’s overall policy is to finance its operations through a
combination of shareholders’ funds, long term loans, bank loans
and cash in hand and at bank. Wherever possible the Group also
tries to secure deferred terms on acquisition of land.
The gearing at the end of the period has dropped to 139% from
150%. Total net borrowings increased from £29.1m to £32.5m at
the period end. Against this the Group has forward reservations and
contracted sales of £45.3m as at 30 September 2003.  
The Group’s facilities with its principal bankers, Royal Bank of
Scotland, were reviewed in September 2003 and the Group
currently has two year committed revolving credit facilities totalling
£37m primarily for core borrowing requirements. The Group also
has an acquisition facility of £6.0m which was fully utilised upon
the acquisition of NorthCountry and expires in July 2005.
An overall offset arrangement between any cash and loan balances
exists for the calculation of interest. Interest rates are either linked 
to LIBOR or base rates. The Group’s policy, which is reviewed and
agreed by the Board, is to be in a position to take advantage of
floating rates on part of the debt but also to be protected against
significant increases in interest rates by the use of fixed rate loans
or suitable hedging instruments. In accordance with this policy the
Group has a mixture of floating rate debt and fixed rate hedging as
shown in note 20 to the accounts. No new fixed rate hedging was
entered into during the period. 
The Group does not have any foreign exchange exposure.
Cash flows
The Group policy is to write off interest as it is incurred and the
charge for the period was £2.1m (2002: £2.3m). The interest
charges partially covered by current gross annual rental income of
£890,000. The net cash inflow from operations was £2.4m after an
increase of stocks and work in progress of £8.2m and an increase in
debtors of £2.3m which were offset by an increase in creditors of
£4.0m. Having maximised the value from one of the mixed use
developments, the Group sold the relevant investment properties,
thus generating a £1.9m cash inflow. In addition it reduced its
interest in Headway PLC to 8.6% which reduced gearing.
Balance Sheet
The reduction in tangible fixed assets is primarily due to the sale of
two investment properties referred to above. Freehold and
investment properties valued by the directors amount to £10.2m.
Properties valued by professional valuers amount to £2.7m. 
The Group’s net current asset position has improved over the
previous year end and shareholders’ funds have increased to
£23.3m from £19.4m resulting in net asset value per share of
123.5p compared to 102.7p at 31 August 2002.

Country & Metropolitan PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2003 21
Directors and Advisors The Directors present their report and audited accounts for the 
10 months ended 30 June 2003. All comparitives are for the year
ended 31 August 2002.
Business activities and business review
The principal activities of the Group during the period under
review covered various property projects primarily in the
residential property field. These included land acquisition and the
promotion of urban villages together with the construction of new
homes for open market sale. A detailed report is given in the
Operational Review on pages 6 to 15.
Results
The audited accounts for the period ended 30 June 2003 are set
out on pages 26 to 46. The Group achieved a profit before taxation
and amortisation of goodwill of £6.85 million (2002: £3.99
million). The retained profit of £3.83 million (2002: £2.19 million)
will be transferred to reserves.
Dividends
The Directors recommend a final dividend of 2.6p per ordinary
share to be paid on 9 January 2004 to ordinary shareholders on
the register on 12 December 2003 which, together with the
interim dividend of 0.7p paid on 11 July 2003 makes a total of
3.3p for the period (2002: 2.75p).
Fixed assets
In the opinion of the Directors the current open market value of
the Group’s fixed asset interests in land and buildings amounts to
£12.9 million. There is no material difference between the book
and the current open market value of fixed asset interests in land
and buildings.
Directors and their interests in the share capital
of the Company
The Directors who served during the year are listed together with
their biographical details on page 20. The Directors’ beneficial
interests in the ordinary shares of the Company are given in the
Remuneration Report on pages 24 to 25.
In accordance with the Articles of Association, Mr N Malde and Mr
SD Wicks will retire by rotation at the next Annual General
Meeting and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election. Mr T
RRoydon will also retire at the next Annual General Meeting,
having been appointed a director on 19 April 2003, and being
eligible, offers himself for re-election.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 15 October 2003 the Company had been notified of the
following interests that represent 3% or more of the issued share
capital of the Company:

Employees
The Group is an equal opportunities employer and the importance
of good communications with employees is recognised by the
Directors. Each region maintains employee relations appropriate to
its own particular needs. Various benefit schemes are available to
employees all of whom are encouraged to participate subject to
eligibility. Equal opportunities for training, career development and
promotion are available to all employees regardless of disability,
age, sex, race, religion, colour, nationality or sexual orientation.
Applications for employment by disabled persons are always fully
and fairly considered with appropriate regard to the aptitudes and
abilities of the applicant concerned. In the event of a person
becoming disabled during their employment, the Group will
endeavour to continue their employment and arrange appropriate
training and or adjustments to the working environment where
possible.
Policy for payment of creditors
It is the Company’s payment policy to negotiate the best possible
terms for all business and therefore there is no consistent policy
as to the terms used. We make sure that suppliers know the terms
on which business will take place and it is our policy to abide by
the terms. At 30 June 2003, the trade creditors of the Company
represented 27 days (2002: 125 days) of purchases made by the
Company.
Charitable donations
During the period the Group made various charitable donations
totalling £9,000 (2002: £2,000). No political donations were made
in either period.
Auditors
A resolution to reappoint Nexia Audit Limited will be proposed at
the next Annual General Meeting.

Responsibilities of the Directors
in respect of the preparation of the accounts
Company law requires directors to prepare accounts for each
financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of
the Group for that period. In preparing those accounts, the
directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them
consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and
prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and
explained in the accounts; and
• prepare the accounts on the going concern basis unless it is
inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in
business.
The Directors of Country & Metropolitan PLC are responsible for
keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable
accuracy, at any time, the financial position of the Company and
the Group and to enable them to ensure that the accounts comply
with the Companies Act 1985. They have general responsibility for
taking such steps as are reasonably open to them to safeguard the
assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other
irregularities.
22 Country & Metropolitan PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Directors’ Report for the period ended 30 June 2003 The Board has considered the requirements of the Combined Code
adopted by the London Stock Exchange in performing the
Corporate Governance of the Group. The Company has complied,
except where noted, throughout the period ended 30 June 2003,
with the provisions of Section 1 of the Combined Code which
relate to the principles of Good Governance and Code of Best
Practice.
The Board comprises of three Executive Directors and three Non-
Executive Directors. The Non-Executive Directors are considered to
be totally independent within the meaning of provision A.3.2 of
the Combined Code. In view of the size and composition of the
Board it is considered to be inappropriate to recognise a senior
independent Director as required by provision A.2.1 and for a
Nomination Committee to be established under provision A.5.1.
Under the Articles of Association of the Company at least one third
of the Board is required to retire by rotation and offer for re-
election.
Mr D E Laing and Mr J M Van Gelder have a letter of appointment
which is terminable upon not less than six months written notice
by either party. Mr T R Roydon has a contract for services between
his company, Hansom Property Company Limited and Country &
Metropolitan PLC which is terminable by either party giving three
months notice.
Board and Committees
All members of the Board are equally accountable under the law
for the proper stewardship of the Company’s affairs. The roles of
the Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and clearly defined.
The Chairman is primarily responsible for the running of the Board
and the Chief Executive is responsible for the running of the
business of the Group.
The Board meets regularly on a formal basis and is supplied with
appropriate information to enable it to discharge its duties. There
is an agreed schedule of matters reserved for the Board for
collective decision. The Executive Directors meet informally between
formal Board meetings to focus on strategy, cash management,
financial performance, major transactions and control of operations
generally.  
The Board has delegated specific responsibilities to the Audit and
Remuneration Committees.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Mr D E Laing, Mr J M Van Gelder
and Mr T R Roydon. It meets once a year with the auditors and is
responsible for ensuring that the financial performance of the
Group is properly reported on and monitored. In particular it
focuses on accounting policies, compliance and internal control. It
also reviews the scope and results of the audit and its cost
effectiveness and the independence and objectivity of the
auditors.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Mr D E Laing, Mr J M Van
Gelder and Mr T R Roydon. Mr T R Roydon replaced Mr S D Wicks
on the Remuneration Committee upon his appointment as Non-
Executive Director. The Committee meets at least once each year
and reviews remuneration and terms of employment of Executive
Directors and certain senior employees. In particular, the
Committee determines specific remuneration packages for each
Executive Director. The fees for the Non-Executive Directors are
decided by a committee of the Board comprising all the Executive
Directors. The Directors’ Remuneration Report is set out on pages
24 to 25.
Investor Relations
The Company meets with its institutional shareholders as
appropriate. All shareholders are kept up to date with the affairs
of the Group through the Annual and Interim Reports. Save in
exceptional circumstances, all members of the Board attend the
Annual General Meeting ("AGM") which is used to communicate
with private and institutional shareholders. The chairmen of the
Audit and Remuneration Committees are also available at the AGM
to answer questions.
Internal Control
In applying the principle that the Board should maintain a sound
system of internal control to safeguard shareholders’ investment
and the assets of the Group, the Directors recognise that they have
overall responsibility for ensuring that the Group maintains a
system of internal control to provide them with reasonable
assurance regarding effective and efficient operations, internal
financial control and compliance with laws and regulations. The
Group has a process for identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks the Group faces. The Board reviews this process on
an ongoing basis, which has been in place throughout the period
and up to the date of approval of the accounts and which is in
accordance with Internal Control: Guidance for Directors on the
Combined Code published in September 1999. Such a system is
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to
achieve business objectives, and can only provide reasonable and
not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The key features of the control system that operated throughout
the period covered by the accounts are described below.  
- The Group has a defined organisation and management
structure to ensure a proper division of responsibility and
authority.
-The Board has identified areas of risk which are reviewed on a
regular basis for their relevance and appropriateness to the
business.
-Control procedures are in place to address key areas of risk.
These include authorisation procedures over land purchases
which are considered and approved by the Board before
contracts are entered into. Controls are also in place to cover
other areas such as payment of invoices, cash control and
expansion of the business.   
- The Group’s systems provide weekly updates on key statistics in
relation to sales. Detailed short term and two year cash flow
forecasts are also used by the Board and the Executive Directors
to control the cash requirements of the Group.
Going Concern
After making enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the accounts.

packages at all levels in order to attract, retain and motivate staff.
Basic salaries and benefits are reviewed annually and bonuses are
awarded for achieving high levels of performance. 
The principal terms of reference of the Committee are as follows:

share options should be granted in order to align their interests
with those of shareholders.

The remuneration of the Non-Executive Directors, who are
members of the Committee, is a matter reserved for the Executive
Directors who take account of practices in other companies.
Service contracts
The Executive Directors have service contracts with the Company
which may be terminated by the Company upon 24 months notice
and by the Director upon 6 months notice. The service contracts do
not include provision for pre-determined compensation for early
termination.
Incentive schemes - audited information
Annual bonuses are subject to achieving Group performance
targets and the Committee has the right to award discretionary
bonuses based on individual performance.
The Company has in place the Country & Metropolitan PLC 1999
Approved Share Option Scheme and the Country & Metropolitan
PLC 1999 Unapproved Share Option Scheme.
At 30 June 2003, options had been granted over 1,422,627 shares
to the Executive Directors and over 423,752 shares to senior
employees and staff. The exercise of the options granted to the
Executive Directors is subject to objective performance conditions
determined by the Remuneration Committee prior to the grant of
an option. The current performance criterion is that, over a three
year period, the Company’s performance in respect of earnings per
share growth, must exceed the growth in the Retail Price Index by
an average of 2% per annum.

Performance graphs
The Remuneration Report Regulations provide that the Company
must provide a graph comparing the total shareholder return
(“TSR“) performance of a hypothetical holding of shares in the
Company with a broad equity market index over a five year period
- the ‘Compliance Graph’. In this context, the Directors have chosen
to illustrate the performance of TSR against the FTSE Actuaries
Fledgling Index over a period commencing on 9 December 1999,
being the date on which the Company’s ordinary shares were listed
on the London Stock Exchange. In the opinion of the Directors, the
FTSE Actuaries Fledgling Index is the most appropriate index against
which TSR should be measured because it is a widely used and
understood index of broadly similar sized UK companies to the
Company. The Compliance Graph is shown below.

28 Country & Metropolitan PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Consolidated Cash Flow Statement for the period ended 30 June 2003 Accounting Policies
The principal accounting policies of the Group which have been consistently applied in dealing with items which are considered material
in relation to the Group’s accounts are as follows:-
(a) Basis of accounting
The accounts have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under the historical cost basis of
accounting as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The Group accounts consolidate the accounts of the Company and all its subsidiary undertakings from the date on which control of each
undertaking passes to the Group. Acquisitions are accounted for under the acquisition method.
In accordance with Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has not presented a separate profit and loss account.
Undertakings, other than subsidiary undertakings, in which the Group has an investment representing not less than 20% of the voting
rights and over which it exerts significant influence are treated as associated undertakings. The Group accounts include the appropriate
share of these undertakings’ results, on an equity accounting basis in accordance with FRS9.
(c) Turnover
Turnover comprises amounts receivable from house sales, the total value of contracting work executed during the period, amounts
receivable and related fees from project management services, proceeds from disposal of sites assembled for resale, rental income
and amounts invoiced by the Group in respect of other services rendered during the period excluding value added tax.
(d) Recognition of income on property activities
Disposals of properties are accounted for at the date of exchange, where there is a legally binding, unconditional, irrevocable
contract and where the property is substantially built and legal completion takes place by the date of approval of the accounts.
Where the Group undertakes developments with other investors and profits are shared and paid by way of a development fee,
income is recognised when individual units within the development are sold.
(e) Cost of letting new developments
All costs incurred in the initial letting of development properties are capitalised. Any subsequent costs expended on re-letting the
properties are charged to the profit and loss account in the year they are incurred.
(f) Investments
Investments are valued at cost less provision for impairment in value.
(g) Investment properties
Investment properties are stated at their open market value at the balance sheet date. Surpluses or deficits on individual properties are
transferred to the investment revaluation reserve, except that a deficit which is expected to be permanent and which is in excess of
any previously recognised surplus over cost relating to the same property, or the reversal of such a deficit, is charged (or credited) to
the profit and loss account. Other deficits on revaluation not expected to be permanent are taken to the statement of total
recognised gains and losses.
In accordance with SSAP 19, no depreciation or amortisation is provided in respect of freehold and leasehold investment properties
where the unexpired term of the lease is more than 20 years. This treatment for certain of the Group’s investment properties is a
departure from the requirements of the Companies Act 1985 concerning depreciation of fixed assets. However, these properties are
not held for consumption but for investment and the Directors consider that systematic annual depreciation would be inappropriate.
The accounting policy adopted is therefore necessary for the accounts to give a true and fair view. Depreciation or amortisation is
only one of the factors reflected in the annual valuation, and the amount which might otherwise have been shown cannot be
separately identified or quantified.
(h) Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost or valuation less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed assets on a straight line
basis over their useful economic lives at the following annual rates:
Plant and equipment 25%
Furniture, fixtures and fittings 20% - 25%
Motor Vehicles 25%

Notes to the Accounts for the period ended 30 June 2003 30 Country & Metropolitan PLC Annual Report & Accounts 2003
Notes to the Accounts for the period ended 30 June 2003 continued
Freehold properties are not depreciated in the accounts of the Group.  The Directors consider that freehold properties are maintained
in such a state of repair that their residual value is at least equal to their net book value. As a result the corresponding depreciation
would not be material and therefore is not charged in the profit and loss account. The Directors perform annual impairment reviews
in accordance with the requirements of FRS15 and FRS11 to ensure that the carrying value is not lower than the recoverable amount.
(i) Intangible assets - goodwill
Goodwill arising on the acquisition of subsidiary undertakings, representing any excess of the fair value of the consideration given
over the fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired, is capitalised and written off on a straight line basis over its
useful economic life. The useful economic life of goodwill is assessed separately for each acquisition and is currently 10 years.
Provision is made for any impairment.
(j) Stocks and work in progress
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises all expenditure directly related to
development or land assembly projects. Net realisable value represents the Directors’ estimate of the net proceeds receivable after
taking account of market conditions prevailing at the date of approval of the accounts.
(k) Long term contracts
Profit on long term contracts is taken as the work is carried out if the outcome can be assessed with reasonable certainty.  The profit
included is calculated on a prudent basis to reflect the proportion of the work carried out at the period end, by recording turnover
and related costs as contract activity progresses. Turnover is calculated by reference to valuation of the work carried out to date. Full
provision is made for losses on all contracts in the period in which they are first foreseen.
(l) Taxation
The charge for taxation is based on the result for the period, which takes account of taxation deferred because of timing differences
between the treatment of certain items for taxation purposes and the treatment under the Group’s accounting policies.  
Deferred tax is provided for on a full provision basis on all timing differences, which have arisen but not reversed at the balance
sheet date. No timing differnces are recognised in respect of gains on sale of assets where those gains have been rolled over into
replacement assets. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that they are recoverable, that is, on the basis of all available
evidence, it is more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from which the future reversal of the underlying timing
differences can be deducted. Any assets and liabilities recognised have not been discounted.
(m)Leased assets
Fixed assets that are the subject of finance leases or hire purchase contracts are capitalised and included in tangible fixed assets. The
corresponding liability is included in creditors.  The finance cost element of the lease or hire purchase contracts is charged to the
profit and loss account over the period of the lease.
Expenditure on leases other than finance leases ("operating leases") is charged to the profit and loss account in the period it is
incurred.
(n) Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution pension scheme and contributes into a small self administered scheme for two of its
directors. Contributions payable for the period are charged to the profit and loss account.
The Group also operates a defined benefit scheme. The expected cost of providing pensions under this scheme, as calculated
periodically by professionally qualified actuaries, is charged to the profit and loss account so as to spread the cost over the service
lives of employees in the scheme in such a way that the pension cost is substantially level percentage of current and expected future
pensionable payroll.
(o) Treasury instruments
The Group uses interest rate swaps to manage financial risk. Interest charges and financial liabilities are stated after taking account of
these swaps. 1. Turnover and segmental analysis

The Financial Review on page 18 includes an explanation of the role that financial instruments have had during the period in creating or
changing the risks the Group faces in its activities. The explanation summarises the objectives and policies for holding or issuing financial
instruments and similar contracts, and the strategy for achieving those objectives that have been followed during the period.
The numerical disclosures required by FRS13 are set out below.
Short term debtors together with short term creditors, and amounts due in respect of land, are excluded from the analysis.
The Group’s financial assets comprise fixed asset investments, long term debtors and cash at bank and in hand. For interest calculation
purposes there is an overall offset arrangement between cash at bank and bank loans and overdrafts. Long term debtor balances and
fixed asset investments are non-interest bearing.
The Group’s financial liabilities comprise bank and other borrowings and hire purchase creditors.
a) Interest rate risk
At 30 June 2003 the Group had total bank borrowing facilities of £50.7m, representing £37.0m committed facilities, £11.6m of term
loans and £2.1m of uncommitted facilities.
After taking into account interest rate swaps entered into by the Group, the interest rate profile of the Group’s financial liabilities, all
denominated in sterling was as follows:
31 August
2003 2002
£’000 £’000
Fixed rate 11,505 12,592
Floating rate 26,455 23,306
37,960 37,898
Floating rate liabilities relate to certain bank loans and bank overdrafts which attract interest at floating rates between 1.75% and
3.5% above the relevant bank’s base rate or in some cases LIBOR.
The fixed rate borrowings have a weighted average fixed rate of 7.61% (2002: 8.55%) and weighted average period to maturity of 
4.35 years (2002: 4.67 years). The weighted average period for which the rates are fixed is 4.35 years (2002: 4.67 years).
The Company has entered into a £10 million 7 year interest rate swap fixing the base rate at 5.66%. The swap expires on 4 June 2008
but could be extended to 4 June 2011 at the bank’s option.
b) Maturity of financial liabilities

30. Pensions
The Group operates defined contribution pension schemes for some of its Directors and employees. The assets of the schemes are held
separately from those of the Company in independently administered funds. The contributions made during the period amounted to
£196,000 (2002: £104,000).
NorthCountry Homes Group Ltd (“NCH”) also operates a funded defined benefit pension scheme. The scheme was closed to new members
on 15 October 2001. The assets are all held in separate trustee administered funds. The scheme is subject to triennial valuation by
independent actuaries using the projected unit method. The most recent valuation was conducted at 1 July 2001, assuming that the real
valuation rate of investment return would be 6.5% per annum and that the real rate of salary increases would average 5% per annum. The
rate of contribution by NCH is 12.9% (2002: 12.9%). The contribution by NCH for the period was £107,000 (2002: £14,000).
The valuation at 1 July 2001 showed that the market value of the scheme assets amounted to £272,000 and the actuarial value of these
assets represented 88% of the benefits that had accrued to members. The actuarial valuation at 1 July 2001 showed a deficit of £38,000
after allowing for future increases in earnings. 
The valuation used for FRS 17 disclosures has been based on the most recent actuarial valuation at July 2001 and updated by Scottish Life
to take account of the requirements of FRS 17 in order to assess the liabilities of the scheme at 30 June 2003. Scheme assets are stated at
their market value at 30 June 2003. The comparitives are based on the previous valuation update undertaken by Scottish Life at 30 June
2002, the balance sheet date of NCH. The financial assumptions used to calculate scheme liabilities under FRS 17 are: 
Valuation method 30 June 30 June
2003 2002
Discount rate 5.2% 5.7%
Increase in pensionable salaries 4.1% 5.0%
Inflation assumption 2.6% 3.0%

31. Related Party Transactions
During the period the Group received development fees of £319,000 (2002: £163,000) from the associated undertaking, Country &
Metropolitan VCT Limited.
Mrs M Malde received fees totalling £8,000 (2002: £15,000) for services provided in respect of design, configuration, development
and maintenance of the Company’s website.  We have audited the accounts of Country and Metropolitan PLC for the period ended 30 June 2003 on pages 26 to 46. These accounts have
been prepared under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of certain fixed assets and the accounting policies set out
therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work
has been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
company and the company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the accounts in accordance with
applicable law and United Kingdom Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal
and regulatory requirements, United Kingdom Auditing Standards and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the accounts give a true and fair view and whether the accounts and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in
our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the accounts, if the company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not
received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if the information specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and transactions with the company and other members of the Group is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statements reflect the company’s compliance with the seven provisions of the Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the
Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited accounts. This other
information comprises only the unaudited part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s
Review, Operational Review, Financial Review and the Corporate Governance Statements. We consider the implications for our report if we
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the accounts. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other
information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the accounts and the part of the Directors’
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the directors in the
preparation of the accounts, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s and the Group’s circumstances,
consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
• the accounts give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the Group as at 30 June 2003 and of the profit of the
Group for the period then ended; and
• the accounts and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985.

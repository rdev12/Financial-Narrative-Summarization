Microsaic_pp01_07_Microsaic_01_07  07/05/2014  10:38  Page 1 I am pleased to present the Company’s
Annual Report & Financial Statements for
the year ended 31 December 2013. 
2013 was a year where Microsaic
achieved a number of key milestones, most
notably the launch of the 4000 MiD
®
.
It also saw the launch of the first OEM
product to contain the 4000 MiD
®
, the
Biotage Isolera™ Dalton. The Company’s
product development program continued
apace with the more recent release of the
MiDas™, which will extend the reach of
Microsaic’s technology into a wider range
of applications and environments.
The 4000 MiD
®
and the MiDas™ together
form the core technologies behind our
successful recent signing of a further
commercial agreement for the detection of
proteins. We are excited by the opportunity
to work with a major global healthcare
equipment company. The opportunities
provided by our ‘chip’ based technologies
and ‘plug and play’ offering will continue
to grow, as we extend the capabilities of
our technology and product range over the
years to come.
Our relationship with Biotage AB has moved forward and
we continue to work closely with them. In addition to this
relationship, we are excited by the size and quality of
companies that continue to approach us to discuss
commercial opportunities. These relate to opportunities for
our single quad technology, but also our in development
triple quad where a number of major global companies are
expressing a keen interest. This product has undergone
successful prototype demonstrations and continues to make
positive progress towards completion. 
Over the last few years there has been a tangible
transformation in the nature of our business. The evolution
from a university spinout into a quoted commercial
enterprise is evident. The Company’s strategy, structure,
culture, and infrastructure have all developed significantly
which has led to a growing level of public and industry
recognitions. 
In the past 12 months there have been two changes to the
Board. Last summer Eric Yeatman stood down from the role
of Chairman. I would like to thank Eric for his invaluable
input during his nine year tenure as Chairman. During this
time the Company has achieved a growing reputation in
pioneering mass spectrometry miniaturisation. We are
pleased that Eric continues to serve as a member of the
Board and brings expertise to bear on the advancement
of our unique technology. 
More recently we announced the resignation of Malcolm
Bateman who has stepped down as Finance Director and
will leave the Company at the end of April 2014 to pursue
his other interests. Malcolm joined Microsaic in 2006 as
Financial Controller and was appointed to the Board in
2011. He played a major part in the 2011 IPO and has
been an important member of the management team over
the past eight years. We would like to thank him for his
contribution in securing Microsaic’s development, and wish
him well in the next stage of his career. We are pleased to
welcome Andrew Darby ACA as our new Finance Director.
I would again like to thank our shareholders for their
support during the last year. Over 2014 we shall continue
to build upon the achievements already made and continue
to capitalise on the opportunities that are becoming
increasingly evident.

for the year ended 31 December 2013
Microsaic_pp01_07_Microsaic_01_07  07/05/2014  10:38  Page 2 Microsaic Systems plc develops
microengineered analytical instruments that
are based on the scientific technique of
mass spectrometry (MS). MS is widely
accepted as one of the most reliable
methods for identifying the chemical
make-up of substances and Microsaic is
the first and only company to have
commercialised and patented chip-based
MS technology using silicon
microengineering (MEMS).
The analysis method of choice
Mass spectrometry is an established analytical technique
used in many laboratories which enables the accurate
identification and quantification of trace levels of chemical
or biological compounds by recording their unique
molecular weight. Today, MS is the standard means of
measuring the composition of samples in pharmaceuticals
and biotechnology, but is also widely used in a variety of
other industries including healthcare, environmental, food
and drink, security, petrochemicals and mining.
By miniaturising MS to desk-top size, Microsaic has made
it practical for a much wider range of users and
applications within these fields and opens up new
opportunities for the growing $3 billion MS market.
A step change in laboratory capability
The Company’s first product, the Microsaic 3500 MiD
®
,
was launched in January 2011 and became the world’s
smallest MS system. Users are particularly impressed by the
self-contained nature of the system – no other mass
spectrometer for liquid analysis has eliminated external
pumps and computers – and this gives the MiD
®
a
revolutionary advantage in deployability, ease of use and
cost of ownership. These advantages have been recognised
within the wider industry too. The 3500 MiD
®
gained the
New Product Award from the US Society of Laboratory
Automation and Screening in 2011 and a prestigious
R&D 100 award in 2012 as one of the most technologically
significant products to enter the marketplace globally.
Several articles have been published in scientific journals
citing new discoveries made using the MiD
®
.
Continuing evolution
The Microsaic 4000 MiD
®
has an even smaller footprint
than the 3500 MiD
®
and fits even more comfortably into
a standard laboratory fume hood. Its ‘plug & play’
components also enable users to maintain the system
themselves, resulting in less down-time and greater flexibility
within the laboratory. The 4000 MiD
®
was launched in
March at Pittcon 2013, the world’s largest annual
conference and exposition on laboratory science and
scientific instrumentation. 
We have an on-going R&D programme building on the
achievements already made and focused on increasing the
reach of our core Ionchip
®
technology, which underpins the
MiD
®
. Our product pipeline includes more complex MS
systems which will allow us to address more technically
demanding market areas, such as food and drink, and
environmental safety. 
Tapping into established sales channels through
value-added partnerships
The Company’s strategy is to generate revenue streams by
introducing compact, deployable MS products, based on its
patented chip technologies, into a series of markets and
applications by selling through partnerships with existing
sales channels. Typically these sales channels will be
international suppliers of complementary equipment. 
In 2012 a partnership was formed with Biotage AB, a well
established supplier in the areas of analytical and medicinal
chemistry. Microsaic is providing its 4000 MiD
®
as an
Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM) as part of an
integrated solution for mass-directed flash purification that
is enabling a leap forward in chemists’ work flow and
productivity.
Further similar relationships are planned with other leading
suppliers of scientific equipment, which will enable the
Company to build up volume sales. Direct sales to end
users in niche application areas will also continue in
parallel.
Quality innovation moving forward
Microsaic Systems was established in 2001 from the highly
regarded Optical and Semiconductor Devices Group at
Imperial College London. It has been based at
headquarters in Woking, UK since September 2004 and
was admitted to AIM, a market of the London Stock
Exchange, in April 2011 (ticker: MSYS).
Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 3
Strategic report – Company overview and business model
for the year ended 31 December 2013
Microsaic_pp01_07_Microsaic_01_07  07/05/2014  10:38  Page 3 4 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Microsaic has enjoyed a highly productive
year in 2013, making notable progress in
our on-going evolution into a successful
commercial business. We continue to
execute our strategy of developing
commercial partnerships, whilst at the
same time growing direct sales to end
users. In parallel, we have continued to
make significant technological advances
that will in time give us the capability
needed for our next generation of
products. This will further broaden the
range of applications that our miniaturised
mass spectrometry (MS) instruments can
address.
Microsaic’s chip-based technology has allowed us to
miniaturise the mass spectrometer – the gold standard for
chemical analysis – far beyond any other product on the
market. This miniaturisation greatly simplifies deployment,
drastically cutting power consumption and other running
costs, and makes MS much more accessible to lab scientists
than it has ever been before. 
Our lead MS instrument, the Microsaic 4000 MiD
®
, was
officially launched in March 2013 at Pittcon, the major
annual international trade fair focused on scientific and
laboratory equipment, which took place in Philadelphia,
USA. The market’s response and subsequent acceptance
of the 4000 MiD
®
has been enthusiastic and through
a combination of direct sales and shipments to our OEM
partner we achieved a near doubling of our revenue for
the full year 2013 to £1.17 million (£0.61 million in 2012). 
Commercial strategy
Our main route to market for our product is as an original
equipment manufacturer (OEM) through partnerships with
companies that have established global sales channels.
These companies also have complementary products that
when combined with our product can deliver synergistic
benefits for the end users. During the year, we strengthened
our relationship with our existing OEM partner, Biotage AB.
In June Biotage AB launched its fully integrated system for
flash chromatography and mass identification which
incorporated our core MS instrument, the 4000 MiD
®
.
Demand for the integrated product, the Isolera™ Dalton,
has been good and shipments of the 4000 MiD
®
to Biotage
are in line with expectations.
We continue to develop relationships with new potential
commercial partners in the pharma, biotech and other
related sectors. In this regard we were pleased to announce
in April 2013 the signing of an OEM agreement for the
global, non-exclusive marketing and sale of the 4000 MiD
®
as a stand-alone instrument for use in direct and rapid MS
analysis. Successful trials have also been completed with
a number of other potential partners and discussions are
advancing with several of these aimed at securing
commercial agreements. 
Strategic report – Chief Executive’s review
for the year ended 31 December 2013
Microsaic_pp01_07_Microsaic_01_07  07/05/2014  10:38  Page 4 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 5
We were pleased to announce on 14 April 2014 the
signing of a pre-contract commercial agreement to provide
the miniature mass spectrometer – the Microsaic 4000
MiD
®
– as an Original Equipment Manufacturer (OEM).
The agreement is for the global, exclusive marketing and
sale of the 4000 MiD
®
, along with the recently released
MiDas™ interface unit, as a stand-alone instrument for use
in protein separation applications. The partner is a major
international healthcare equipment company.
The agreement is focused on the use of the 4000 MiD
®
in conjunction with protein separation, a major application
that is used globally and has increasing market demand.
It follows a period of R&D collaboration in which Microsaic
has successfully adapted and enhanced the 4000 MiD
®
to address this new application. 
We will work towards completion and signing of a full
commercial contract, which is anticipated to include a
commitment to purchase up to 50 units and consumables
of the 4000 MiD
®
in the first year, increasing to over
200 units and consumables from the fourth year onwards.
The initial period of the contract is expected to be
48 months. The selling price is in line with the Board’s
expectations. Shipments under the agreement are
anticipated to commence in Q1 2015.
In addition to OEM agreements for our products in the
major MS application areas, we achieved a number of
direct sales to customers in new and high-value application
areas. Direct contact with users is proving to be valuable as
a means of prioritising future product development and
R&D programmes. A number of key direct sales have
already been achieved and a pipeline has been established
for the coming year.
The 4000 MiD
®
is currently manufactured at our facility in
Woking, but in line with our commercial strategy, and as
sales increase in 2014, we will be outsourcing the
production of the units to an accredited third-party supplier.
New technologies
Our marketing plan for 2013 has been directed towards
positioning Microsaic as a solution provider for chemical
analysis, rather than simply as a mass spectrometer vendor.
In line with this plan, we have been leveraging our technical
expertise to develop next-generation products that we
believe will significantly expand the range of applications
that our innovative MS instruments can address and that
end-users will increasingly demand.
In January 2014, we launched the MiDas™ compact
interface module. The MiDas™ unit has been designed to
extend the use of MS in the laboratory from specialist
analytical chemists to the wider research community.
It connects to the 4000 MiD
®
and offers automated sample
preparation and injection for direct MS analysis in real-time
at the lab bench or in the fume hood.
Our strategy is to commercialise MiDas™ alongside the
4000 MiD
®
through partnerships with well-established
suppliers in the areas of analytical and medicinal chemistry,
and directly to customers in niche application areas.
In June 2013, we presented a working prototype of our
chip-based triple quadrupole mass spectrometer for the first
time, at the American Society of Mass Spectrometry (ASMS).
This new technology can analyse more complex materials,
such as medical (e.g. blood or saliva) or environmental
samples, and is an important achievement that has the
potential to further extend Microsaic’s leading position in
miniaturised MS instrumentation. We recently exhibited our
latest progress with this system at the major trade fair
Pittcon in March 2014, where the reception from delegates
was very encouraging. Negotiations are on-going with
a number of possible key MS instrument partners to develop
the triple quadrupole into a fully commercial product, with
an expected launch date in 2015. 
At the same event, we displayed our concept product, 4500
MiD
®
instrument for the first time. This system is an
extension of the 4000 MiD
®
and has been designed for the
mass identification of larger molecules in sample mixtures,
such as proteins and peptides. We intend to launch this
product in the next twelve months and are already engaged
in discussions with potential OEM partners to develop this
system further for commercialisation in several areas.
Microsaic_pp01_07_Microsaic_01_07  07/05/2014  10:38  Page 5 Financial results
Revenues increased 92% to £1,165,235 in 2013 (2012:
£606,281). OEM sales volumes of the 4000 MiD
®
have
been the principal contributor to this rise, with regular
monthly shipments being made. Sales of consumables are
also rising, and will become more significant over time as
the installed base grows. 
Research and development revenue streams are becoming
a less significant proportion of the total company income,
but continue to make a contribution. Spending on R&D
amounted to £927,379 and was focused on product
enhancements in order to open up new application
opportunities for the MiD
®
and on our triple quadrupole
mass spectrometer.
The total comprehensive loss for the year was £2,285,158
compared to £1,867,069 in the previous year. Excluding
the effects of share-based payments accounting, the
operating expenses for 2013 and 2012 were £1,462,395
and £1,228,084 – the increase arising from business
development and marketing activities and augmenting the
business infrastructure as commercial operations ramp up.
In May, the Company placed 9,951,443 ordinary shares
with new and existing shareholders. This represented a 23%
increase in the Company’s issued share capital. We wish to
thank our investors for supporting this placing, which will
enable the Company to execute its organic revenue growth
plans, as well as allow investment in the development and
production of instruments and technologies. The gross
proceeds raised from the issue amounted to £4.28 million.
Cash in hand at 31 December 2013 was £3.24 million.
As with previous years, the going concern basis has
continued to be adopted in preparing the financial
statements. Following the progress made by the Company
to date and the progress anticipated in the near term, the
Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company
will have access to adequate funds to continue operations
for at least twelve months. Further details are provided in
the notes to the financial statements.
Enhancing the team
To ensure the Company is equipped with the necessary skills
and personnel to drive continuing revenue growth and to
support the transition into a successful commercial business,
we have made a number of new hires during the year.
We have created a new business development team, whose
objective is to grow direct sales and establish new
commercial relationships and routes to market. Our
customer services team has been enhanced significantly and
the engineering team has been expanded in order to ensure
our OEM and direct customers have the technical support
they require. I am now confident that we have the
commercial and technical personnel in place to support
senior management as we look to drive the growth of the
business in the years ahead.
I am delighted to report the appointment of Andrew Darby
as Finance Director. Andrew Darby has over 17 years of
experience in senior finance, strategic and operational roles
within quoted companies in the information technology
sector. He joins Microsaic from Active Risk Group plc,
formerly an AIM-listed company specialising in enterprise
risk management software solutions. 
In October, we announced the formation of the Company’s
first Scientific Advisory Group. Members of the Group have
impressive credentials across a wide range of areas in
industry and research, and will be able to advise us on
future applications for our chip-based technology.

for the year ended 31 December 2013
Microsaic_pp01_07_Microsaic_01_07  07/05/2014  10:38  Page 6 Outlook 
I am very pleased with the progress that Microsaic made
across all areas of its business in 2013. We have built
a strong foundation around the 4000 MiD
®
though our
OEM partnerships and are confident of signing further
agreements with other interested OEM partners who have
established global sales distribution channels. Sales are
building and we are gaining increasing recognition for the
potential of our innovative MS technologies and new
products within the scientific analytical instrumentation
market, where we believe we have an opportunity to make
MS accessible across a broader range of applications and
to a much larger number of lab scientists than ever before.
We now have the team in place needed to support the
expected growth and development of our business.
We are focused on three business strategies that underpin
our ambitions for 2014 and beyond:
• Developing OEM partnerships with synergistic
companies, which can provide Microsaic with access
to enhanced sales distribution channels alongside our
own direct sales channel.
• Stepping up marketing communications and the
promotion of the core brand values of Microsaic.
• Outsourcing the manufacture of the main product
ensuring high-quality build, reliability and high volume
capacity.
All our activities are aligned to these three priorities. Our
‘plug & play’ usability designs remain unique and the
increasing market acceptance of our chip-based technology
will provide the platform for further growth and
differentiation from competitors. We remain intent on
broadening the application base and enhancing user
experience of the MiD
®
in order to make it the benchtop
analytical tool of choice for chemists. It is my belief that
these strengths, and focused strategy puts Microsaic
Systems in a strong position to capitalise in an evolving
market.

Microsaic_pp01_07_Microsaic_01_07  07/05/2014  10:38  Page 7 Strategic report – Risks and uncertainties
for the year ended 31 December 2013
8 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
In common with other small companies developing new technologies, the Company is subject to a number of risks and
uncertainties, which principally include:
Risk area Key risks
Company development — The early stage development of the business and its evolution into a successful
trading Company with all the operational requirements that this entails
— Current operating losses depleting the Company’s capital and cash 
— The availability and terms of capital needed for continued business development and
expansion
— Recruitment and retention of personnel and requisite skills to run and build the
business
Customer markets — Market acceptance of the Company’s revolutionary products
— Competing products emerging from other companies
— The ability of the Company to generate sufficient revenue from the sale of its
products
— The economic environment and recessionary effects that may restrict customer
spending on capital equipment 
— Establishing and maintaining a high reputation as a supplier of equipment
Technical — The product’s technical performance and specification meeting customer
requirements
— The reproducibility of the Company’s products as production volumes increase
— The ability to protect Company intellectual property and defend infringement claims
by others
Financial — Sufficient cash flow liquidity
— Credit risk attributable to trade receivables and cash deposits
— Exchange rate risk on currency exposures
The main financial risks arising from the Company’s activities are liquidity risk and credit risk.  The Company seeks to
manage liquidity by ensuring sufficient funds are available to meet expected needs and to invest cash assets safely and
profitably. In order to minimise risk to the Company’s capital, funds are invested with financial institutions with strong credit
ratings. Cash forecasts are updated regularly to ensure that there is sufficient cash available for foreseeable requirements.
The Company has no external financing facilities therefore its interest rate risk is limited to the level of interest received on
its cash surpluses.
There is further explanation of the financial risks in note 23 to the financial statements.
This Annual Report contains certain forward looking statements that have been made by the Directors in good faith based
on the information available at the time of the approval of the Annual Report. By their nature, such forward looking
statements involve risks and uncertainties because they relate to events and depend on circumstances that may or may not
occur in the future. Actual results may differ from those expressed in such statements.

Strategic report – Performance measurement
for the year ended 31 December 2013
The ongoing performance of the Company is managed and monitored using a number of key performance indicators,
both financial and qualitative.
Whilst there are many financial and operating measures regularly monitored by the Company, the primary financial metrics
are:
Year to Year to
31 December 31 December
2013 2012
£ £
Revenue 1,165,235 606,281
Loss before tax and share based payments (2,331,671) (2,097,800)
Cash used in operating and investing activities (2,552,302) (1,476,565)
Cash and cash equivalents 3,239,283 1,788,579
Revenues comprise sales of products and income from development projects. Product sales now form the majority of the
Company’s revenue. Product launch is a key driver of our product revenue and 2013 saw both the launch of the Microsaic
4000 MiD
®
chip based mass spectrometer and the first OEM product incorporating the 4000 MiD
®
, namely the Isolera™
Dalton from Biotage AB, a fully integrated system for flash chromatography and mass identification.
Maintaining tight control over costs is another key objective in managing the developing business. This is monitored
through monthly management accounts for each cost type and in the overall trading results (which are calculated
excluding share based payments).
The Company is not yet profitable and utilises cash for its operational activities. The forecasting and monitoring of the
Company’s cash resources is therefore critical in terms of the efficient allocation of those resources and in predicting
future cash requirements. A key feature of the Company’s internal management reporting is therefore an emphasis
on operational cash flow forecasts, which are monitored at both management and Board level on a monthly basis. 
In terms of the Company’s wider performance, the progress of its research and development programmes are reviewed
against key qualitative milestones on a monthly basis by the Board. The more detailed aspects of these programmes are
also discussed and monitored through separate project reviews. Research and development programmes which feed into
the Company’s product pipeline are planned and executed against identified objectives and timelines. The Company’s
intellectual property rights provide an indicator of the success of its R&D activities and the protection of its technology from
competitors. Microsaic maintains a large portfolio of patents, of which 52 are granted.
This Strategic Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 29 April 2014 and signed on its behalf.

Employees
The Company regards the expertise and contributions of its employees as crucial to the future success of the business.
The Company engages its employees to understand all aspects of the business and seeks to remunerate its employees fairly.
The Company gives full and fair consideration to applications for employment received regardless of age, gender, colour,
ethnicity, disability, nationality, religious beliefs or sexual orientation. The Board takes account of employees’ interests when
making decisions and suggestions from employees aimed at improving the Company’s performance are encouraged.
Company share ownership plans
The Company operates two Share Ownership Plans for the benefit of its employees and Directors, an Employee Share
Option Scheme (ESOS) and a Share Incentive Plan (SIP).
The ESOS was formed in 2006 to enable the incentivisation of key employees to be aligned to the performance of
the Company. Under the ESOS the Company grants to employees options to acquire the Company’s ordinary shares
subject to:
— vesting periods (normally 5 years for new grants)
— a total exercise period of 10 years from date of grant
— the exercise price normally being the market price of the ordinary shares at the date of grant
— performance conditions, as appropriate 
Options are granted to the maximum amount allowed under the limits of the Enterprise Management Incentive (‘EMI’)
Scheme – these options are called ‘Approved Options’. The EMI scheme is subject to the provisions of Schedule 5 of the
Income Tax (Earnings and Pensions) Act 2003. Any options granted above EMI limits are ‘Unapproved Options’.
The SIP enables all employees (subject to minimum service criteria) the opportunity to take a continuing stake in the
Company. It was approved by HMRC in November 2012 and operated for the first time in 2013. A Plan Trust has been
established for the purposes of acquiring the Company’s shares. In accordance with SIP regulation employees can invest up
to £1,500 from gross pay in any one year which is used to acquire shares known as ‘Partnership Shares’ and held within the
Plan Trust. The Company may issue ‘Matching Shares’ in proportion to the Partnership Shares and also award employees
with ‘Free Shares’. Matching Shares and Free Shares vest on the completion by the participating employee of a further three
years’ service (and certain other events), and can be withdrawn from the plan tax-free after five years’ service.
Health and safety and the environment
The Company is committed to providing a safe environment for its staff and other parties for whom it has a responsibility.
It has set up systems and processes to ensure compliance with health and safety legislation and the Board considers health
and safety matters at its regular monthly meetings.
The Company is also mindful of its corporate responsibilities concerning the impact of its activities on the environment and
seeks to minimise this impact wherever possible.
Microsaic_pp08_19_Microsaic_pp08_19  07/05/2014  10:36  Page 12 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 13
Directors’ indemnity and insurance
The Company has granted an indemnity to its Directors under which the Company will indemnify them, subject to the terms
of the deed of indemnity, against all costs, charges, losses, damages and liabilities incurred by them in performance of
their duties.
The Company also maintains insurance for its Directors and Officers against the consequences of actions brought against
them in relation to their duties for the Company.
Payment of creditors
The Company’s policy for payment of suppliers is to agree payment terms in advance of the supply and to adhere to those
payment terms. The trade creditors of the Company at the year end as a proportion of amounts invoiced by suppliers
during the year represent 47 days’ purchases (2012: 48 days).
Related party transactions
The interests of the Directors are shown above and their remuneration is detailed in the Directors’ remuneration report.
There were no other related party transactions.
Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time
the financial position of the Company, for safeguarding the assets of the Company, for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities and for the preparation of a Directors’ report which complies
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
The Directors are responsible for preparing the annual report and the financial statements in accordance with the
Companies Act 2006. The Directors have chosen to prepare financial statements for the Company in accordance with
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted for use in the European Union.
International Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Company’s
financial position, financial performance and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of
transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities,
income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the preparation and
presentation of financial statements’. In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with
all applicable IFRSs. A fair presentation also requires the Directors to:
— consistently select and apply appropriate accounting policies;
— present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and
understandable information; and
— provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs is insufficient to enable users
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and
financial performance. 
Statement of disclosure to auditors
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware.
Additionally the Directors have taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as Directors in order to make themselves
aware of any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware of that information.
Auditors
Saffery Champness have expressed their willingness to remain in office as auditors of the Company, and a resolution for
their re-appointment will be proposed at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
This Directors’ Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 29 April 2014 and signed on its behalf.

This report on the Directors’ remuneration sets out the Company’s policy on the remuneration of Executive and
Non-executive Directors, together with details of Directors’ remuneration packages and service contracts.
Remuneration Committee
The remuneration policy for Executive Directors, determination of their individual remuneration packages and their
performance appraisals have been delegated to the Board’s Remuneration Committee comprising three Non-executive
Directors.
In setting the remuneration levels, the Remuneration Committee considers a number of factors including:
— the basic salaries and benefits available to Executive Directors of comparable companies;
— the need to attract and retain Directors of an appropriate calibre;
— the need to ensure Executive Directors’ commitment to the continued success of the Company by means of incentive
schemes; and
— the need for the remuneration awarded to reflect performance.
Remuneration of the Non-executive Directors
The remuneration of the Non-executive Directors is agreed by the Board following recommendation by the Remuneration
Committee, having a view to rates paid in comparable organisations and appointments. The Non-executive Directors did
not receive any pension, bonus or other benefits from the Company. Since becoming a public limited company, no share
options have been issued to Non-executive Directors. Non-executive Directors may participate in Company share
ownership plans on the same terms as other staff.
Remuneration policy for Executive Directors
The Company’s remuneration policy for Executive Directors is to:
— have regard to the Directors’ experience and the nature and complexity of their work in order to pay a competitive
salary that attracts and retains management of the quality required to serve the business;
— link individual remuneration packages to the Company’s performance through the award of discretionary bonus
schemes; and
— provide employment-related benefits including life assurance and insurance relating to the Directors’ duties.

Corporate governance report
for the year ended 31 December 2013
As an AIM-listed company, Microsaic Systems plc is not required to comply with the UK Corporate Governance Code
(2010), a set of recommended corporate governance principles for UK public companies issued by the Financial Reporting
Council. However, the Directors support high standards of corporate governance and have established a set of corporate
governance principles which they regard as appropriate for the size, nature and stage of development of the Company
based on the QCA Guidelines. 
The Board
In July 2013 Colin Nicholl became Chairman of the Board in succession to Eric Yeatman, who continues to serve as
a Non-executive Director.
Role of the Board
The Board is responsible, inter alia, for strategy, budget, performance, approval of major capital expenditure and the
framework of internal controls.
Board processes
The Board has established an Audit Committee and a Remuneration Committee with formally delegated responsibilities to
assist with the execution of its responsibilities.
The full Board holds regular meetings on a monthly basis and additional meetings at any other times as may be necessary
to deal with any urgent matters that arise. The agenda for Board meetings is prepared in conjunction with the Chairman
and submissions are circulated in advance. The Company management team prepares regular reports which allow the
Board to assess the Company’s activities and review its performance and the Board has clearly specified the levels of
authority delegated to management. Members of the Company’s management team are regularly involved in Board
discussions and Directors are able to have discussions with other employees where appropriate.
The Board is ultimately responsible for the Company’s system of internal control and for reviewing its effectiveness.
This includes financial, operational and compliance controls and risk-management systems. Internal control systems are
designed to meet the Company’s particular needs and the risks to which it is exposed. The internal control systems are
designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives, and by their nature can only
provide reasonable and not absolute assurance against misstatement and loss.
Composition of the Board
The Board currently comprises seven Directors. 
The role of the Chairman is filled by a Non-executive Director.
Directors appointed by the Board are subject to re-election by shareholders at the following Annual General Meeting and
thereafter Directors are subject to re-election at least every three years.
Conflicts of interest
Directors must keep the Board advised of any interest that could potentially conflict with those of the Company.
Where a conflict exists, the Director concerned is not present at the meeting whilst the relevant matter is considered.
Directors’ attendance record
The following table shows the attendance at the meetings of the Board of Directors during 2013:

Audit Committee
The remit of the Audit Committee is documented in its terms of reference which were adopted by the Board of Directors
on 31 March 2011.
The purpose of the Committee is to assist the Board in the effective discharge of its responsibilities for corporate
governance, financial reporting, corporate control and risk management. The Audit Committee normally meets at least
twice a year and, amongst other things, reviews the annual report and accounts and interim statements with the external
auditors. The Committee also approves external auditors’ fees and ensures auditors’ independence as well as focusing
on compliance with legal requirements and accounting standards. The ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving
the annual financial statements and interim statements remains with the Board.
The members of the Audit Committee for 2013 were E M Yeatman (from July 2013, Committee Chairman), C J Nicholl
(Committee Chairman until June 2013), J C Ramage and A S Holmes. The external auditors, the Chief Executive Officer,
Finance Director and other executives may be invited to the Audit Committee meetings at the discretion of the
Committee. 
The Audit Committee met three times in 2013.
Remuneration Committee
The remit of the Remuneration Committee is documented in its terms of reference which were adopted by the Board of
Directors on 31 March 2011.
The Remuneration Committee meets as required and at least once a year. Its responsibilities include reviewing the
performance of the Executive Directors, setting their remuneration levels, determining the payment of bonuses and other
benefits and considering the grant of options under the Company share option schemes.
The members of the Remuneration Committee for 2013 were J C Ramage (Committee Chairman), C J Nicholl (until June
2013), A S Holmes and E M Yeatman (from July 2013). 
The Remuneration Committee met four times in 2013.
Board nominations
The appointment of replacement or additional Directors is the responsibility of the Board as a whole. 
At this stage, it is not considered appropriate for the Company to have a formally constituted Nominations Committee,
however this will be kept under review.
Communications with shareholders
The Board aims to keep shareholders informed of all major developments concerning the Company. Information is
communicated through the following channels:
— The release of announcements, trading updates and interim financial statements through the Regulatory News Service
of the London Stock Exchange and on the Company’s website,
— The annual report and financial statements are sent to all registered shareholders,
— Notices of all meetings of shareholders are also sent to all registered shareholders.
Microsaic_pp08_19_Microsaic_pp08_19  07/05/2014  10:36  Page 17 18 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
We have audited the financial statements of Microsaic Systems plc for the year ended 31 December 2013 on pages 20
to 39. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union as applied in accordance with the provisions
of the Companies Act 2006.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those
matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by
law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s members as
a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Directors’ responsibilities statement set out on page 13, the Directors are responsible for
the preparation of the financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is
to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards
on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards
for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give
reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error.
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and have
been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the
Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial
information in the annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any
information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us
in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we
consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on financial statements
In our opinion the financial statements:
— give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company as at 31 December 2013 and of its loss for the year
then ended; and 
— have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and as applied in
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006; and
— have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Strategic report and Directors’ report for the financial period for which the
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the financial statements.

Microsaic_pp08_19_Microsaic_pp08_19  07/05/2014  10:36  Page 18 Emphasis of matter – going concern
In forming our opinion, we have considered the adequacy of the disclosures made in note 3 to the financial statements
concerning the Company’s ability to meet its future working capital needs. In view of the significance of this uncertainty
we consider that it should be drawn to your attention but our opinion is not modified in this respect. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you
if, in our opinion:
— adequate accounting records have not been kept, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from
branches not visited by us; or
— the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
— certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are not made; or
— we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

1. Accounting policies
The following principal accounting policies have been used consistently in the preparation of these financial
statements. 
Basis of preparation
These financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS)
and the interpretations of the International Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) as adopted by the
European Union, and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS.
These financial statements have been prepared on the historic cost basis except where financial instruments are
required to be carried at fair value under IFRS. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents amounts receivable from the sale of goods and services and from development contracts, net
of value added tax and trade discounts.
Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised when the risks and rewards of ownership of the goods passes to the
customer, which is normally upon delivery.
Revenue from rendering services is recognised in the period in which the service is provided. 
Revenue from development contracts is recognised under the percentage-of-completion method.
Income receivable in respect of government grants is included within revenue and is recognised in the same period
as the related costs.
Segmental reporting
The Company currently has one business segment, being the research, development and commercialisation of
scientific instruments. This is undertaken wholly within the United Kingdom and therefore a segmental analysis of
turnover, profits/losses on ordinary activities before tax and net assets has not been presented. The Company is
managed on the basis of its performance as a whole and not by any segments.
Intangible assets
Trademarks and patents are stated at historic cost of registration less accumulated amortisation and any accumulated
impairment losses. Amortisation is calculated to write off the cost in equal annual instalments over five years, which is
considered to be a prudent estimate of their useful economic lives.
Property, plant and equipment
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost of acquisition or production costs less accumulated
depreciation and impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis to write-off the carrying
value of each asset to residual value over its estimated useful economic life as follows:
Plant and equipment – 20% to 33.3% on a straight line basis
Fixtures and fittings – 33.3% on a straight line basis
Pensions
The Company operates a defined contribution retirement benefit scheme for its employees. Contributions are charged
to the statement of comprehensive income in the period they are payable.
Notes to the financial statements
for the year ended 31 December 2013
Microsaic_pp20_44_Microsaic_pp20-44  07/05/2014  10:35  Page 24 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013 25
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is based on the first-in first-out principle and
includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them into their present locations and
condition. The cost of finished goods and work in progress comprises raw materials, direct labour and other direct
costs. Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course of business less applicable selling
expenses.
Taxation
Current taxes are based on the results of the Company and are calculated according to local tax rules, using the tax
rates that have been enacted by the balance sheet date. 
The Company recognises research and development tax credits receivable in cash as a current asset under the
heading corporation tax receivable. Any difference with amounts actually received are dealt with as adjustments
to prior period tax.
Deferred tax is provided in full using the balance sheet liability method for all taxable temporary differences arising
between the tax bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying values for financial reporting purposes. Deferred tax
is measured using currently enacted or substantially enacted tax rates. 
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent the temporary difference will reverse in the foreseeable future and that
it is probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the asset can be utilised.
Foreign currency translation
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange
ruling at the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of
transaction, or forward contract rate, if applicable. All differences are taken to the statement of comprehensive
income.
Government grants
Grants towards revenue expenditure are released to the statement of comprehensive income as the related
expenditure is incurred.
Financial instruments
The Company has adopted both IAS 32 and IAS 39.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised on the Company’s statement of financial position when the
Company becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Cash and cash equivalents
The fair value of cash and cash equivalents is considered to be their carrying amount due to their short term maturity.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables do not carry interest and are stated at their nominal value as reduced by appropriate allowances for
estimated irrecoverable amounts.
Financial liability and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified according to the substance of the contractual arrangements
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company after
deducting all of its liabilities.
Bank borrowings
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded as the proceeds received, net of direct issue costs. Finance
charges, including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are accounted for on an
accrual basis to the statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method and are added to the
carrying amount of the instrument to the extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.

Notes to the financial statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 2013
1. Accounting policies (continued)
Financial instruments (continued)
Trade payables
Trade payables are not interest bearing and are stated at their nominal value.
Equity instruments
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded at the value of the proceeds received net of direct issue costs.
Leases
Assets obtained under hire purchase contracts and finance leases are capitalised and depreciated over their useful
lives. Obligations under such agreements are included in liabilities net of the finance charges allocated to future
periods.
All other leases are considered operating leases, the costs of which are expensed on a straight line basis over the
lease term. Rent free periods and other incentives are spread on a straight line basis over the lease term.
Research and development
Expenditure on research is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Development costs incurred on specific projects are capitalised when all the following conditions are satisfied:
• completion of the intangible asset is technically feasible so that it will be available for use or sale
• the Company intends to complete the intangible asset and use or sell it
• the Company has the ability to use or sell the intangible asset
• the intangible asset will generate probable future economic benefits. Among other things, this requires that there
is a market for the output from the intangible asset or for the intangible asset itself, or, if it is to be used internally,
the asset will be used in generating such benefits
• there are adequate technical, financial and other resources to complete the development and to use or sell the
intangible asset, and
• the expenditure attributable to the intangible asset during its development can be measured reliably
Costs incurred which do not meet the above criteria are expensed as incurred. No development costs have been
capitalised to date.
Share based payments
In accordance with IFRS 2 “Share-based payments”, the Company reflects the economic cost of awarding shares and
share options to directors, employees and advisors by recording an expense in the statement of comprehensive
income equal to the fair value of the benefit awarded, fair value being determined by reference to option pricing
models. The expense is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income over the vesting period of the award.

2. Application of new EU endorsed accounting standards, amendments to existing EU endorsed
standards and interpretations (continued)
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures
Amendments require entities to disclose gross amounts subject to rights of set-off, amounts set off in accordance
with the accounting standards followed, and the related net credit exposure. This information will help investors
understand the extent to which an entity has set off in its balance sheet and the effects of rights of set-off on the

IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements – Effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2014:
New standard that deals with the accounting for joint arrangements and focuses on the rights and obligations
of the arrangement, rather than its legal form. The standard requires a single method for accounting for
interests in jointly controlled entities.
Amendments to the transition guidance of IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements, IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
and IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in Other Entities limiting the requirements to provide adjusted comparative

3. Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that sufficient funds will
be available for the Company to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months from the date of signing.
The Company’s business activities together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and
position are set out in the strategic review sections within the annual report. 
The Company has been developing its technologies for the market place and as such has been absorbing funds.
The Company is now in the commercialisation phase of its development, and the financing of operations in the future
will be from employment of existing cash reserves and revenue from product sales. 
The Directors have prepared trading and cash flow projections that extend beyond 12 months from the date of this
report. These include increasing revenue levels which the Directors believe will be derived from the sale of its products
and are supported by market feedback that has been received. There is no certainty that the expected level of sales
will be achieved and if there were a significant shortfall it may be necessary for the Company to secure alternative
sources of funding to enable it to remain a going concern. Whilst the Company has been successful securing funding
in the past, this is no guarantee that it will be possible in the future. However, the Directors have a reasonable
expectation that the Company will have access to sufficient funding to continue operations for at least twelve months
from the signing of this report and therefore they continue to adopt the going concern basis for the preparation of the
financial statements. 
Microsaic_pp20_44_Microsaic_pp20-44  07/05/2014  10:35  Page 29 30 Microsaic Systems plc Annual Report and Financial Statements 2013
Notes to the financial statements (continued)
for the year ended 31 December 2013
4. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
Accounting estimates and judgements are continually evaluated and are based on past experience and other factors,
including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances.
The Company makes estimates and assumptions concerning the future. The resulting accounting estimates could, by
definition, differ from the actual outcome. 
The estimates and assumptions that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts
of assets and liabilities within the next financial year are summarised below:
Going concern
The financial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, which assumes that sufficient funds will
be available for the Company to continue in operational existence for at least 12 months. More details are provided
in note 3.
Revenue recognition 
The revenue recognised from development contracts reflects management’s best estimate about the contract’s
outcome and stage of completion. The Company’s management assesses the contracts at each balance sheet date,
including the costs to completion, which are subject to estimation uncertainty. 
Amortisation of trademarks and patents 
Capitalised costs relating to trademarks and patents are amortised over their estimated useful lives. As the product
development programme is still ongoing and the lifetime of the Company’s intellectual property is difficult to
determine, the Directors have applied a prudent estimate of 5 years. This assumption is reviewed at each balance
sheet date and amended if required.
Share based payments 
The calculation of the share based payments expense utilises assumptions and estimates (for example volatility, future
exercise rates) which may differ from actual results. Details of the assumptions are set out in note 22.
Research and development tax credits
The Company recognises research and development tax credits receivable in cash as a current asset under the
heading corporation tax receivable. These credits are subject to acceptance by HM Revenue & Customs and the
resulting cash receipt from HM Revenue & Customs may be greater or less than this amount.
5. Revenue
Throughout 2013 the Company operated in one business segment, that of research, development and commercialisation
of scientific instruments. All of the Company’s assets are held in the UK and all of its capital expenditure arises in the UK.
The revenue of the Company for the year has been derived from its principal activity undertaken in the United Kingdom.
An analysis of revenue by geographic market has not been presented as many of the Company’s products are sold
through international distribution channels and it is not possible to determine their final destinations. The Directors
consider that an analysis of revenue by geographic market using distributor locations would be misleading.
Government grants
Included within the Company’s revenue for the year ended 31 December 2013 is £157,841 (2012: £294,580) from
UK Government grants and European grant funded projects.
In 2013 the Company was awarded a grant of up to €308,000 under the European Commission’s 7th Framework
Programme as part of a consortium for a research project. Revenue of £26,879 has been recognised to date as the
Company believes it has fulfilled its practical and administrative obligations under this project and is committed to
fulfilling its future obligations, which are subject to European Commission reviews annually and final project sign-off
in 2015.
Microsaic_pp20_44_Microsaic_pp20-44  07/05/2014  10:35  Page 30 In 2010 the Company was awarded a grant of up to €964,000 under the European Commission’s 7th Framework
Programme as part of a consortium for a research project. Revenue of £704,649 has been recognised to date as the
Company believes it has fulfilled its practical and administrative obligations under this project and is committed to
fulfilling its future obligations, which are subject to European Commission reviews annually and final project sign-off
in 2014.

The Company has estimated tax losses of £7,746,000 (2012: £5,758,000) available for carry forward against future
trading profits. A deferred tax asset in respect of these losses has only been recognised to the extent of the deferred
tax liability in respect of accelerated capital allowances (see note 15).

Share Incentive plan (SIP)
All employees are eligible to participate in the Company’s HM Revenue and Customs approved SIP after 12 months’
service. The SIP operated for the first time in 2013. Participating employees made a cash contribution to the plan from
their gross pay which was used by the Plan Trust to purchase Partnership Shares. The Company issued one Matching
Share for each two Partnership Shares. The Matching shares vest on the completion by the participating employee of a
further three years’ service and can be withdrawn from the plan tax-free after five years’ service.
There were 4 participants in the scheme at 31 December 2013. During the year the Company issued 11,457
ordinary shares as Partnership shares into the SIP for consideration of £5,500. 5,728 ordinary shares were issued as
Matching shares with a market value of £2,750. At the year end the SIP held 17,185 ordinary shares (2012: nil) on
behalf of the scheme participants. The fair value of the Matching Shares is taken as the Company share price at the
time of the granting, and this is charged to the statement of income over the three year vesting period. The charge for
2013 was £458 (2012: nil).
23. Financial instruments
The Company’s financial instruments comprise cash and various trade receivables and trade payables that arise
directly from its operations. No trading in financial instruments is undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Company’s financial instruments are liquidity, currency and interest rate. The Board
oversees the management of these risks, which are summarised below.
Liquidity risk
The Company is financing its operations from equity funding provided by shareholders and revenues generated by the
business. The Company seeks to manage liquidity risk to ensure sufficient funds are available to meet requirements. 
The Company invests its cash reserves in bank and money market deposits as a liquid resource to fund its operations.
The Company’s strategy for managing cash is to maximise interest income at low risk whilst ensuring availability to
match the profile of the Company’s cash flows.
Interest rate risk
The Company does not face any significant interest rate risk as it has no borrowings.
Surplus funds are invested to maintain a balance between accessibility of funds and competitive rates of return whilst
investing funds safely.
Credit risk
The Company manages its credit risk in cash and cash equivalents by spreading surplus funds between creditworthy
financial institutions. 
The Company is also exposed to credit risk attributable to trade and other receivables. The maximum credit risk
in respect of the financial assets at each period end is represented by the balance outstanding on trade and other
receivables. The Company has limited exposure to credit risk, as the majority of its trade and other receivables are
due from major international corporations and institutions. 
Foreign currency risk
The Company is based in the United Kingdom and the majority of its transactions are denominated in pounds sterling.
The Company has no long term commitments to purchase goods or services in foreign currencies. Purchases
denominated in foreign currency are expensed at the exchange rate prevailing at the date of the transaction, and
comprise an immaterial proportion of the Company’s total expenditure. 
The only assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies relate to trade receivables and trade payables with
overseas counterparties together with small balances of US dollar and Euro currencies to settle these liabilities.
The risks and sums involved are considered to be immaterial.

for the year ended 31 December 2013
Microsaic_pp20_44_Microsaic_pp20-44  07/05/2014  10:35  Page 38 Where a significant transaction in a foreign currency is anticipated with a high degree of certainty, the Company takes
out a forward exchange contract to mitigate the risk of currency fluctuation. No such instruments were held at
31 December 2013.
Fair values
The Directors consider that there is no material difference between the book value and the fair value of the financial
instruments at 31 December 2013 and 31 December 2012.
Capital management
The Company’s capital base comprises equity attributable to shareholders, particularly as represented by cash. As the
Company’s focus has been on establishing itself as a successful supplier of scientific instruments, the primary objective
in managing cash spend has been to achieve progress on product development and commercialisation in a cost
efficient manner and in managing liquidity risk to ensure the Company continues as a going concern.
24. Related party transactions
The remuneration paid to the Directors is shown in note 20 to the financial statements and in the Directors’ remuneration
report.
There were no other related party transactions.
25. Control
As at 31 December 2013, no individual shareholder had a controlling interest in the Company.
26. Subsequent events
There have been no significant events after the balance sheet date.

Meeting or to appoint someone else to vote on your behalf
Notes
Quorum
1. The quorum for the Meeting shall be two shareholders present in person or by proxy. If, within fifteen minutes from the
appointed time for the Meeting, a quorum is not present, then the Meeting will stand adjourned to the same day in the
next week (or if that day is a public holiday to the next working day thereafter) at the same time and place or to such
other day, time or place as the Directors may determine and no notice of such adjournment need be given. At an
adjourned Meeting, shareholders present in person or by proxy will form a quorum.
Website address
2. Information regarding the Meeting, including information required by section 311A of the Companies Act 2006,
is available from www.microsaic.com
Entitlement to attend and vote
3. Only those holders of ordinary shares of 0.25p each in the capital of the Company (“Shares”) registered on the
Company’s register of members at 6 p.m. on 29 May 2014 shall be entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting.
Appointment of proxies
4. Members entitled to attend, speak and vote at the Meeting (in accordance with Note 3 above) are entitled to appoint
one or more proxies to attend, speak and vote in their place. If you wish to appoint a proxy please use the form of proxy
enclosed with this document (the “Form of Proxy”). In the case of joint members, only one need sign the Form of Proxy.
The vote of the senior joint member will be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint members. For this
purpose, seniority will be determined by the order in which the names of the members appear in the register of members
in respect of the joint shareholding. The completion and return of the Form of Proxy will not stop you attending and
voting in person at the Meeting should you wish to do so. A proxy need not be a member of the Company. You may
appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different share or
shares held by you. If you choose to appoint multiple proxies use a separate copy of this form (which you may
photocopy) for each proxy, and indicate after the proxy’s name the number of shares in relation to which they are
authorised to act (which, in aggregate, should not exceed the number of Shares held by you). Please also indicate if the
proxy instruction is one of multiple instructions being given. All forms must be signed and returned in the same envelope.
5. You can appoint the Chairman of the Meeting, or any other person, as your proxy. If you wish to appoint someone other
than the Chairman, cross out the words “the Chairman of the Meeting” on the Form of Proxy and insert the full name
of your appointee.
6. You can instruct your proxy how to vote on each resolution by ticking the “For” and “Against” boxes as appropriate (or
entering the number of shares which you are entitled to vote). If you wish to abstain from voting on any resolution please
tick the box which is marked “Vote Withheld”. It should be noted that a vote withheld is not a vote in law and will not be
counted in the calculation of the proportion of votes “For” and “Against” a resolution. 
If you do not indicate on the Form of Proxy how your proxy should vote, he/she can exercise his/her discretion as to
whether, and if how so how, he/she votes on each resolution, as he/she will do in respect of any other business (including
amendments to resolutions) which may properly be conducted at the Meeting.
A member that is a company or other organisation not having a physical presence cannot attend in person but can
appoint someone to represent it. This can be done in one of two ways: either by the appointment of a proxy (described
in Notes 4 to 6 above) or of a corporate representative. Members considering the appointment of a corporate
representative should check their own legal position, the Company’s articles of association and the relevant provision
of the Companies Act 2006
A company incorporated in England and Wales or Northern Ireland should execute the Form of Proxy under its common
seal or otherwise in accordance with Section 44 of the Companies Act 2006 or by signature on its behalf by a duly
authorised officer or attorney whose power of attorney or other authority should be enclosed with the Form of Proxy.

executed must be received by Capita Asset Services at PXS1, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, BR3 4ZF , United
Kingdom at 11 a.m. on 29 May 2014 in respect of the Meeting. Any Forms of Proxy received before such time will be
deemed to have been received at such time. In the case of an adjournment, the Form of Proxy must be received by
Capita Asset Services no later than 48 hours before the rescheduled Meeting.
On completing the Form of Proxy, sign it and return it to Capita Asset Services at the address shown on the reverse of the
Form of Proxy. As postage has been prepaid no stamp is required. You may, if you prefer, return the Form of Proxy in
a sealed envelope to the address shown above.
Termination of proxy appointments
8. In order to revoke a proxy instruction you will need to inform the Company. Please send a signed hard copy notice clearly
stating your intention to revoke your proxy appointment to Capita Asset Services at PXS1, 34 Beckenham Road,
Beckenham, BR3 4ZF , United Kingdom.
In the case of a member which is a company incorporated in England and Wales or Northern Ireland, the revocation
notice must be executed under its common seal or otherwise in accordance with section 44 of the Companies Act 2006
or by signature on its behalf by an officer or attorney whose power of attorney or other authority should be included with
the revocation notice. 
If you attempt to revoke your proxy appointment but the revocation is received after the time of the Meeting or the taking
of the vote at which the proxy is used, then, subject to the paragraph directly below, your proxy will remain valid.
If you submit more than one valid proxy appointment in respect of the same Shares, the appointment received last before
the latest time for receipt of proxies will take precedence.
Completion of a Form of Proxy will not preclude a member from attending and voting in person. If you have appointed
a proxy and attend the Meeting in person, your proxy appointment will be automatically terminated.
Issued shares and total voting rights
9. The total number of Shares in issue in the capital of the Company at the date of this notice is 52,508,376 ordinary

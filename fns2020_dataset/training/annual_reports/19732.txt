colleagues – and it is authentic . . .”

our customers. The better and stronger our 
product is, the better and more successful we 
as a business will be. This connection with our 
customers fuels our constant drive to innovate,

Welcome.
“ The Board’s confidence in the underlying 
strengths of the business and its potential 
for the future is indicated by the decision to 
announce a maiden dividend for 2016 and a 
progressive dividend policy. We believe that the 
commercial model of the business allows us 
both to invest in new growth opportunities and 
return cash to shareholders.”

SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Whilst our financial results fell 
short of the expectations that the 
Board and our shareholders had at 
the start of the year, I am confident 
that SuperGroup has finished the 
year in a much stronger position.
The Board and management team have been strengthened 
significantly through a series of changes. Julian Dunkerton’s 
decision to step aside from the role of Chief Executive Officer has 
allowed him, with James Holder, to focus fully on the continued 
development of the Superdry brand and the evolution of our 
ranges. This, together with the appointment of Euan Sutherland 
to that position last October, has brought a new dimension to 
the leadership of the business. The three are working extremely 
well together and the Board is delighted with the progress being 
made. Euan’s move from his non-executive role provided the 
opportunity to appoint Penny Hughes to the Board in April this 
year. Penny brings a huge breadth of experience from a wide 
range of different businesses and boards. Since the year end we 
have confirmed Nick Wharton in the role of Chief Financial Officer. 
Nick, who had been covering the role on an interim basis since 
February, brings deep financial management skills as well as 
broad retail and business experience.
Susanne Given, Hans Schmitt, and Shaun Wills all left the 
Company during the year and I would like to thank them for the 
contributions they made to the development of SuperGroup. 
Since becoming Chief Executive Officer, Euan has worked 
closely with Julian, James and the rest of the management team 
to develop a new strategic framework which was presented to 
analysts and investors in March. This has given a sharp focus 
on the strengths of the brand, the areas requiring improvement, 
and the most important growth opportunities. Central to this 
process was gaining a clearer understanding of the Superdry 
customer base, how it has evolved over time, and the actions 
required to embed the core brand values in the business and 
enhance and extend our ranges. This will enable us to meet  
one of our key strategic challenges of remaining relevant to our 
core customers.
We now have systems which are much more robust and fit  
for purpose. New merchandise management, point of sale,  
HR and finance systems were installed and bedded-in during 
the year providing platforms which will enable future growth  
and efficiencies.
On the international front we opened 40,000 square feet of  
retail space in Germany, while the buy-out of our US licence 
partner in March and the announcement in July of the joint 
venture with Trendy International Group in China also provide 
platforms for significant long-term growth in these three large  
and important markets.
The Board’s confidence in the underlying strengths of the 
business and its potential for the future is indicated by the 
decision to announce a maiden dividend for 2016 and a 
progressive dividend policy. We believe that the commercial 
model of the business allows us both to invest in new growth 
opportunities and return cash to shareholders.
Good governance is essential in enabling us to realise our 
full potential and supports successful execution. We have 
thoroughly reviewed many aspects of the way that the Board, 
Board Committees, and the Executive Committee operate. A 
number of refinements and improvements have been made to 
ensure that management has clear authority to operate within 
the established creative and entrepreneurial culture, while being 
balanced by appropriate challenges, controls and rigorous 
decision-making processes. The Board evaluation confirmed 
that the Board is generally working well but noted that some 
improvements can be made.
SuperGroup has an ambitious and demanding strategy 
for growth and operational improvement. One of the most 
important priorities for us is to ensure that we have the people 
and organisation necessary to lead and manage the execution 
of our strategy. Whilst the last year has seen a number of 
changes to Board composition we will continue to review the 
skills, experience and diversity required to ensure the long-term 
success of our Company. Euan is continuing to build  
and develop the executive team and intends to put greater 
focus on talent management and succession planning 
throughout SuperGroup. 
I would like to thank everyone who has worked so hard in 
the continued development of SuperGroup and all of our 
shareholders for your investment and support.

of the gain/loss recognised on re-measurements (being the fair valuation 
of deferred contingent share consideration and financial derivatives), 
exceptional items and, when appropriate, the related income tax. The 
directors believe that the underlying results provide additional guidance 
to statutory measures to help understand the performance of the Group.

Financial 
Statements. The Journey So Far . 
Superdry was launched in 2003 after 
an inspirational trip to Tokyo and aims 
to create ‘future classic’ garments 
inspired by fusing iconic vintage 
Americana and high-impact Japanese 
graphic imagery with a British twist. 
Superdry is a lifestyle brand designed for attitude not age with 
affordable, premium-quality clothing, accessories, footwear and 
cosmetics. As we develop the breadth and nature of our product range, 
we continue to appeal to a much broader, aspirational age group; those 
who want to feel amazing in what they wear and appreciate style, quality 
and attention to detail. Already well established in the UK, our home 
market, we operate a significant and continually expanding international 
business, selling through our websites, wholesale partners, a network of 
franchise stores and, increasingly, our stores.
We have expanded quickly over the 12 years of our life, fast becoming an 
international brand. There has been no slow down over the past 12 months 
as we have added over 50 points of sale to our portfolio around the world, 
taking our total number of stores and concessions to 573 with a physical 
presence in 45 countries. 
In addition to stores and websites, we have a successful and growing 
wholesale business. In the UK and North America, we sell directly 
to third party retailers and internationally we predominantly use a 
distribution network, taking advantage of local knowledge and expertise 
in each country. We focus on high-quality, contemporary products that, 
in varying degrees, fuse vintage Americana and Japanese-inspired 
graphics with a British style. They are characterised by:
•	 quality fabrics with authentic vintage washes
•	 unique vintage detailing
•	 world leading hand-drawn graphics
•	 tailored fits with diverse styling

Business Model.
Our brand management, and product design and innovation, 
is centralised at our head office in Cheltenham in the 
United Kingdom, along with all the main support functions 
including human resources, merchandising, finance, legal, 
marketing, IT and e-commerce. Whilst design, category 
management and merchandising of our products is done by 
our colleagues, our products are manufactured by partners 
(third party suppliers) predominantly located in Turkey, China 
and India. We have two main distribution centres – one in 
the UK and one in Belgium – which receive and dispatch our 
products across our multi-channel business (wholesale, 
retail and e-commerce – our three routes to customer). 
We plan to open another distribution centre in the US to 
better serve that market and to bring further efficiencies.
We design, produce and sell premium yet affordable clothing and accessories exclusively 
under the Superdry brand in 573 Superdry branded locations as well as online. Our broad 
product range, for men and women, holds wide appeal across a broad age spectrum.

SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 The Wholesale channel consists of:
•	 international franchise partners and individual franchise stores; 
•	 international distribution partners, supplying the independent 
Retail markets in their territories;
•	 key wholesale accounts; and
•	 licensed markets. 
We have accelerated our franchise and licence roll-out over the 
past couple of years to 221 stores. 
Our Retail channel (which includes e-commerce) comprises the 
entire owned store portfolio in the UK, mainland Europe  
and North America together with our websites. There are 
178 owned stores, with total space of 764,000 square feet, 
consisting of smaller boutique stores (usually found in mainland 
Europe), medium-sized stores of around 5,000 to 6,000 square 
feet (principally in the UK and increasingly so in mainland 
Europe), and larger stores, such as our flagship stores in  
Regent Street, London and Munich, Germany. Superdry outlet 
stores offer another opportunity for us to sell our product, 
protecting the brand integrity of our non-outlet stores whilst 
retaining gross margin. 
E-commerce consists of 25 international websites across 18 
countries covering 12 different languages and delivering to over 
169 countries. E-commerce connects our Wholesale and Retail 
channels and includes our partner programme with Zalando, La 
Redoute, The Iconic and TMall.com. We use eBay as another 
sales channel to sell our end of line or discounted products 
whilst maintaining our brand integrity and retaining gross margin. 
An innovative way in which we have brought e-commerce 
and Retail closer together is through our iKiosks which give 
customers access to our full collection through the Superdry 
website, and the opportunity for in-store ordering and free next 
day collection.

We are currently transforming our buying model and stock 
management process to improve speed to market, improve 
efficiency and lower the cost from design to customer. Over 
the next five years, with continued investment in our systems 
and processes, we expect our business model to deliver 
greater efficiencies. Key to this is:
•	 one single integrated range construction so that the 
Wholesale offering is a subset of the Retail range, which 
in turn is a subset of our largest range offered through 
e-commerce. This allows us to optimise our buying 
model across the routes to customer and, in turn, drives 
purchasing economies and enhances sell through; 
•	 increasing our direct sourcing and better phasing product 
buys to ensure newness for our customer and improve 
stock management, product availability, and stock levels; 
and
•	 bringing our distribution centres closer to market, with a 
single pool of stock to maximise availability and achieve 
zonal fulfilment across all routes to customer.

From this established position, we continue to innovate and 
extend our product range to adapt to customer needs and 
market trends. We believe there are very few brands with our 
global reach and diverse customer base. 
We sell our product in stores and through e-commerce 
channels, competing with traditional retailers and brands, 
pure e-commerce and multi-channel businesses. The impact 
of online retailing is becoming more evident as customers’ 
shopping habits change with online channels increasingly used 
to research and purchase products. We are embracing this. For 
more information on our e-commerce strategy, please refer to 
page 28.
Superdry started its international expansion early on in its 
development and now is sold in 69 countries with 55% of total 
sales volume made outside of the UK. We are growing rapidly 
in mainland Europe, particularly in Germany. Given our growing 
presence, specifically in these three territories, we are well-
positioned to take advantage of this growth as we strengthen 
our presence in existing markets and target new markets 
through our Wholesale and Retail channels. 
Our short to medium-term focus is to grow the Retail 
proposition in Western Europe – we expect around 95% of our 
new space in financial year 2016 (“FY16”) will be in markets 
outside the UK.

“ Every colleague at SuperGroup is passionate about the brand 
and focused on our goal of becoming a global lifestyle brand. 
I am pleased to report that we have made good progress this 
year in broadening and strengthening the appeal of the iconic 
Superdry brand. Underpinned by a clear strategy, we are 
improving the efficiency of our business and simultaneously 
capturing significant growth opportunities across the globe

SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Financial year 2015 (“FY15”) was 
a game of two halves
I joined SuperGroup as Chief Executive Officer in October 
2014 during the warmest autumn on record in the UK. These 
extremely mild weather conditions across Europe challenged all 
fashion retailers and hampered sales of Autumn/Winter products. 
This adversely impacted Group revenue in the first half. 
However, in the second half our trading improved significantly as 
our promotional activities, necessary to address the level  
of inventory within the business, renewed focus on product  
with Julian in his new role, and improved processes began to 
gain traction. 
We have been working tirelessly to professionalise our business, 
enabling it to withstand better the factors outside our control. 
Based on a better understanding of our customers and their 
needs, we have gained significant clarity on all aspects of our 
business and each part of the value chain, from the design 
stage of clothing and accessories to the logistics of getting our 
product to the right place at the right time in the right quantities. 
This has allowed us to identify a number of improvements 
required in the business to enhance our customer offer, 
better communicate the appeal of the Superdry brand and 
ensure more efficient processes and controls. We are already 
seeing the benefits, notably from the increased collaboration 
between our sales channels – Wholesale and Retail (including 
e-commerce). Encouragingly, the momentum gained in the 
third quarter of FY15 has continued with growth in e-commerce 
sales accelerating and performance in our Wholesale business 
improving markedly as a consequence of the efficiency 
improvements we have made. 
Overall, notwithstanding the challenges of the first half, we 
delivered healthy sales growth of 12.9% for the year and a 
2.0% improvement in underlying profit before tax. With a clear 
understanding of our brand and customer, we can now drive 
forward and will continue to invest in our infrastructure, product, 
processes and people to deliver long-term, sustainable growth.

www.supergroup.co.uk Chief Executive’s Review.
To track and measure our progress we have identified a number 
of key performance indicators (“KPIs”) (read more on pages 
38 to 39). Our strategy is grounded in extensive research and 
data analysis which shows our brand is in good health in the UK 
and mainland Europe, and there are positive initial indications 
in the US. We have a much broader customer base than many, 
including ourselves, previously thought, which substantially 
increases our target market. 
The two most exciting strategic developments, as we grew our 
global presence in FY15, were the buy-back of the US licence 
through the acquisition of assets from SDUSA LLC, and the 
collaboration with Idris Elba. More recently, we entered into a 
joint venture agreement with Trendy International Group, which 
will allow us to work with an established retail business based in 
China to enter the Chinese market in a controlled and managed 
way, without imposing significant organisational demand. 
We are passionate about product innovation and, with the 
changes in management and investment in people we have 
made, our two founders are now able to focus on extending our 
product capability. Creating a series of perfect, icon products 
and continuous innovation ensures that the link between strong 
brand values and strong product attributes remains robust. 
Our strategy is clear, grounded in a thorough understanding of 
our brand, customer and product.

pillar strategy to 
the market.
SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015

14 Premium.
The two key drivers of our growth are 
international expansion and improving 
efficiency:
International expansion: European 
expansion, buy-back of the US licence and 
the joint venture in China
The majority of future space growth in the near-term will 
come from mainland Europe, which is a market approximately 
five times the size of that in the UK, with our main focus on 
Germany, followed by Austria, Italy, Spain and Poland. Our 
European stores deliver excellent returns on capital with, on 
average, a two year payback. Looking at Germany in particular, 
we are pleased with the overall performance of the store 
portfolio especially given how young most of our stores are. We 
opened our first store in November 2012 and we plan to grow 
our presence from the 18 stores and six franchises we currently 
have to over 50 in the next five years.
In March 2015, we bought back the exclusive rights to sell 
and distribute Superdry products in the USA, Canada and 
Mexico (“North America”) through the acquisition of assets 
from SDUSA LLC, our former licence partner. This follows the 
acquisitions of our Scandinavian, Spanish and German partners 
over the last 18 months. 
Strategically, taking control of our product selection and 
enhancing our presence in North America is an important and 
natural step to realising our global ambition. It gives us the 
opportunity to enhance our brand and significantly build the  
long-term value of our business. 
China is a very exciting market and forecast to overtake the 
US as the largest apparel and footwear market in the world. 
Customer tastes are evolving from luxury brands to brands 
influenced by “pop” culture and we believe that the Superdry 
brand, with the right product, pricing model and infrastructure, 
is well positioned to be successful. The most appropriate 
model for us to enter this market is to join forces with an 
established Chinese company and as such we have agreed a 
10-year minimum 50:50 joint venture with Trendy International 
Group (subject to satisfactory performance). The operation will 
be funded by a combined investment of up to £18m though 
we anticipate that the joint venture will be self-funding within 
two years of operation. We will follow a measured roll-out 
programme with the day-to-day business operations managed 
by Trendy. Our involvement will be focused on strategic brand 
support, design services and marketing.
Improving efficiency: Design to customer 
optimisation, supply chain wins and refining 
Wholesale
The efficiency improvements we are making in the business 
primarily emerge from improvements to our design to customer 
process. As we optimise this process, we improve our speed to 
market and lower our costs. The improvements we are making 
are not ground-breaking initiatives and, to our benefit, many are 
practices already well proven in Retail. Some of the inefficiencies 
we identified include supplier over-concentration, not optimising 
direct sourcing, and committing to our buys too early leaving us 
with very little flexibility to adapt our product range later in the 
season. We also had different ranges for each of our routes to 
market with large discrepancies between the Wholesale and 
Retail ranges, and between different geographies.
15
SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015
www.supergroup.co.uk To remedy these inefficiencies we will be increasing our direct 
sourcing over the next five years and will establish our own 
quality assurance teams in India and China this year. We have 
begun phasing our orders and deliveries, helping not only 
our stock and warehouse management but also providing 
in-season newness in our product offering – critical to the 
success of our womenswear range in particular. Our newly 
appointed womenswear category manager is providing a crucial 
link between design and merchandising, using the insight we 
have gained from our customer and competitor research and 
information from previous buys to help shape and improve the 
range. Ultimately, over the next two years, we will establish an 
integrated approach so that Wholesale products form the core 
of our range and become a subset of Retail, with e-commerce 
offering our complete product range. This integrated approach 
will drive even greater efficiencies and effectiveness through 
our organisation. We provide an illustration of the change in our 
buying model on page 10. 
Over the last two or three years, we have made great strides in 
improving our distribution facilities and processes. ‘The Duke’ 
(the UK distribution centre) which houses product for Retail, 
Wholesale and e-commerce, situated in Burton-upon-Trent 
in the UK, opened in 2013. However, with most of our future 
growth expected to come from the EU, there is a need to 
simplify our stock movement plan. Ultimately we will establish 
‘zonal fulfilment’ with each zone able to fulfil Wholesale, Retail 
and e-commerce in specific markets. That way we better 
manage and balance our stock and we are closer to and better 
able to support our growth plans in each market. The first step 
to achieving zonal fulfilment is a single view of our stock. As 
we move into 2016 and then into 2017, we will create a single 
pick face across Retail and e-commerce at the Duke in the first 
instance and then incorporate Wholesale. This model will be 
replicated in other parts of the world as we expand  
our business.
Our stores too will benefit from ongoing investment over the 
next five years. This will include investment in systems to 
automate our assortment and space planning, and a revised 
grading system where we will have category-specific grading 
driving enhanced product allocation to each store based on its 
size and historical sales profile. 
The performance of our Wholesale channel has been restricted 
by limited investment in the past three years, an unnecessarily 
complex business model which did not leverage the Retail offer, 
and consolidation in the marketplace resulting in the loss of key 
accounts. With Wholesale now being better integrated into the 
rest of our business planning and processes, there are many 
opportunities, centred on the design to customer process, to 
achieve closer alignment between Retail and Wholesale so that, 
in time, we will have a single optimised structure for all routes  
to market.
We have strengthened our team
We acknowledge that the loss of key colleagues is one of 
our biggest potential risks. We have invested in our design 
and buying departments and strengthened our category 
management and merchandising systems so that the two 
founders are entirely focused on design and product. A 
Transformation Director, who will take responsibility for the 
Group’s key development activities and co-ordinate our 
business-wide change programme, will join the business  
this Summer.  
Idris Elba collaboration
Golden Globe winning actor Idris Elba is collaborating with 
Superdry to design and produce a premium line of clothing 
which will be sold globally in stores and online, as well as 
through Wholesale partnerships from Autumn/Winter 2015. 
This new collaboration is part of our strategy to create a global 
lifestyle brand, building on the iconic heritage of Superdry 
to broaden and strengthen customer appeal. Idris, who is 
designing the range with James Holder, will be the face of the 
line. This exciting collaboration will prompt consideration of our 
brand by new customers and is evidence of our commitment to 
innovation and the strengthening of our premium range.

SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015
www.supergroup.co.uk The first pillar of our strategy is to EMBED our founding 
principles and brand values, inspired by Julian and James, 
with every single colleague, every single store and online and 
in every country in which we operate so that there is a real 
understanding and appreciation of what our brand stands for. 
It is also about embedding the extensive knowledge of our 
customer into everything we do so that our customer feels 
valued and is loyal to Superdry.
Our brand is about attitude
Our brand is unique – it is an innovative, British, premium 
lifestyle brand with global appeal. It’s accessible to everyone. 
It’s a democratic brand. Our customer is not defined by age but 
rather by attitude.
E m bed.  
Innovative, 
British, premium 
lifestyle brand 
with global 
appeal.
Our three point brand strategy
There are three principal elements of our brand strategy:
T o build a global lifestyle brand
This encompasses the product, brand and retail 
experience. A global lifestyle brand appeals to 
customers through all life stages and is a way of life 
rather than an individual product. A global lifestyle 
brand has longevity. 
1
T o drive awareness of the breadth of the 
Superdry range
As we constantly innovate our products, there is a 
need to ensure our existing and potential customers 
are aware of and buy into the breadth of our product 
range. This is particularly relevant for products for 
more mature customers and women, and will allow 
us to increase consideration and purchase across a 
broader customer spectrum.
Having a consistent brand proposition globally is key to our 
success. We will achieve consistency by working as one team, 
applying best practice in each market, using global brand icons 
to connect the customer with the brand, and leveraging our 
global capability in merchandising, range selection and a clear 
understanding of how we optimise retail space.
2
T o build a broad cross-channel relationship 
with customers
Our customers interact with us in a multi-channel 
environment (i.e. both in-store and online). A multi-
channel customer is of significantly higher economic 
value to us and we therefore seek to provide a 
consistent multi-channel experience around the world.

20 Our customer profile
We have completed both qualitative and quantitative customer 
research globally over the last 12 months, which has given 
us a greater understanding and insight into our customer 
demographics, their perception of Superdry and their buying 
behaviour.

Opportunities exist to better communicate 
the breadth of our product and extend 
certain categories, in particular 
womenswear
The qualitative insights we have gleaned show what customers 
think of Superdry. This evidences that Superdry is a strong 
brand with considerable democratic appeal. We are renowned 
for high-quality products and iconic styles often associated  
with big logos, but have developed to also produce clothing 
with more subtle branding. However, these qualitative insights 
also show that the brand is still perceived as being rather 
masculine and that womenswear has a narrower appeal to 
younger customers. This is a significant opportunity for us and 
will be a key focus over the coming year. There is also some 
mystery around the brand and whether it is Japanese, American 
or British.
We have embedded this research in our design process and 
range planning as well as our customer communication and 
identified a number of opportunities to improve and extend our 
product range (see more on page 26).

22 The second pillar of our strategy is to ENABLE growth 
by continued investment in our colleagues, systems and 
infrastructure so that we drive more efficiency and greater profit 
opportunity as we grow our business.
Our investment in our colleagues
The entrepreneurial and innovative culture we inherited from 
our founders remains at the heart of our way of work. People 
at SuperGroup bring our brand to life and the success of 
our business is a direct result of the knowledge, skills, drive, 
passion and enthusiasm of our colleagues, wherever they are 
in the world. We believe this is due to the environment we have 
created where individuals can flourish and fulfil their potential.
We now employ in excess of 3,900 people across the UK, 
Europe, US and Asia. Colleague numbers will continue to 
increase as we grow the business. SuperGroup remains an 
attractive place to work and during the year we received  
more than 100,000 applications for roles and recruited in  
excess of 900 temporary workers to support Christmas 2014 
peak trading.
We have further enhanced our suite of tools and learning 
opportunities to better equip colleagues to further the growth 
of our business. The demand for talent is ever greater and the 
ongoing review of our people across the business has enabled 
us to identify colleagues rich in our brand DNA, experience and 
skill set to support business development in new territories. This 
in turn provides colleagues with a more rewarding career. This 
review, conducted twice yearly, helps us to match future talent 
needs with existing talent in the business and supports our 
succession planning. 
Looking ahead
Our focus is on sourcing the best talent and following a strategy 
to develop people ahead of the business’s growth curve. We 
conducted our first engagement survey in June 2015 to help 
identify ways in which we can further support our colleagues to 
be at their best more of the time.
We remain focused 
on sourcing the best 
talent.

Financial 
Statements. Systems and infrastructure
As described on page 15, we are continuously improving the 
efficiency of our business by optimising the design to customer 
process. This has been enabled by the substantial investment 
in our IT systems, including our transactional and internal 
business systems, over the past two years. The end of FY15 
marked a significant change in emphasis for our IT, systems and 
infrastructure teams. With us now having derisked substantially 
our infrastructure, the emphasis is on business-as-usual 
activities and on leveraging the newly  
deployed systems. Investment in our  
systems, infrastructure and processes  
will continue as we move into more  
territories and extend product categories. 
The key system investments and 
improvements we have made this year 
to enhance our efficiency and the overall 
customer experience include:
Merchandise management system 
(Mercatus)
One year after completing the implementation of 
the merchandise management system, we are 
now leveraging the benefits of this fully automated 
system for Retail and e-commerce to manage our 
stock across Europe. We have a much improved 
view of our stock and our allocation and in-store and 
warehouse management of product has therefore 
improved. This has also resulted in more accurate 
reporting of stock availability and we are using the 
data generated by this system to inform range 
planning and stock allocation.
1 1
In-store point of sale system
We began the roll out of a new in-store point of 
sale system at the beginning of the year. This 
involved converting all our stores from a legacy 
Eurostop system to BTE Store 6.3 and new point 
of sale hardware. The benefits have been greater 
consistency across our estate, more and faster 
payment facilities, and near real-time reporting of our 
sales figures.

Financial system (Coda)
Following a rigorous selection process, Coda was 
selected as the Group’s core financial system 
to provide the multi-national and multi-currency 
capability necessary to support the Group’s global 
expansion. The replacement programme started 
in August 2014 with the initial implementation 
completed successfully in the second half of the 
financial year. The current financial year will see 
further enhancements to the system.

Extend.
www.supergroup.co.uk
25
SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 Our third strategic pillar is to EXTEND, through innovation 
of our existing product categories and also through the 
development of new, complementary product ranges. 
Our product opportunities 
We are putting data-driven insight into action by developing 
our product offering and improving our category management. 
Historically, we have been well known for our male outerwear, 
and specifically the upper-half of the body. By focusing 
on the categories and the subcategories that we are 
developing, we will drive the next phase of growth. 
Significant opportunities exist for Superdry in just about every 
category other than male outerwear, particularly in womenswear, 
premium and denim, but also in active sportswear, ski and 
footwear. Our premium range is being refreshed as part of 
the collaboration with Idris Elba and will launch as part of the 
Autumn/Winter 2015 range.
Focusing on capturing the 
opportunity in womenswear
We have made substantial improvements in our womenswear 
over the past five years; however, we have not yet fully captured 
the opportunity. We have relatively low market share other than 
in specific subcategories such as logo t-shirts and logo sweats, 
where we have been very successful. Knitwear, for example, 
accounts for the largest proportion of value and volume in 
womenswear in the UK, a category in which we are growing 
rapidly. Dresses and outerwear, a more valuable category due 
to a higher average selling price, are two subcategories on 
which we are focused using a data-driven approach by, for 
example, adjusting our hem lengths and extending our size 
and colour offering. We aim to maintain our position in our 
strongest categories such as the iconic logo products whilst 
simultaneously growing our market share in knitwear, outerwear, 
tops and shirts, and denim. 
In addition to improving our womenswear offering, our improved 
category management and design to customer process will 
offer newness more frequently as we go through the seasons – 
this is key to the success of our womenswear.

www.supergroup.co.uk
SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015 The fourth pillar of our strategy is EXECUTE, bringing 
together all elements of the first three pillars and expanding  
our business globally, online as well as in our Retail and 
Wholesale channels.
Expanding our Retail estate in 
mainland Europe
A key driver of our growth strategy is the expansion of our 
Retail estate which is, as mentioned on pages 15 and 42, 
predominantly focused in mainland Europe. Our core owned 
estate targets stores between 3,000 to 6,000 square feet 
in major city locations or prime locations in shopping malls. 
Over the next five years we will grow by following a clear and 
systematic approach through a mix of owned retail, franchise 
and wholesale. We continued to make good progress and 
opened 73,000 square feet of new space in mainland Europe, 
including a 10,000 square feet flagship store in Munich, in FY15 
and now operate from 66 owned stores: 20 in Belgium, 18 in 
Germany, seven in the Netherlands, seven in France, four in 
Scandinavia, six in Austria, two in Italy and two in Spain, where 
we also opened a further five El Corte Ingles concessions. 
Together these stores equate to 162,000 square feet of trading 
space, an increase of 82% during the year representing 21% of 
our total Retail estate. 
Looking forward, we see significant opportunity for new Retail 
space in both our key markets and new markets.
The expansion of e-commerce continues
The strong growth in e-commerce continued in FY15 in Europe 
and in the UK, with the rest of the world, where our greatest 
growth opportunity lies, also doing well. Forming a multi-channel 
relationship with our customers is vital as our research suggests 
that multi-channel customers spend about 2.6 times more with 
Superdry compared to single-channel customers; and secondly, 
the retention index amongst multi-channel customers is about 
80% higher than it is for single-channel customers.
The two key building blocks of our e-commerce business are 
being global and being multi-channel. Our philosophy is to 
enable customers to order anywhere, on any device, using any 
payment method, and have their order delivered to wherever 
they choose. As such, through 25 fully localised sites (sites 
that offer local pricing, currency, payment methods, customer 
service hours and content, translated into 12 languages) we are 
a ‘glocalised’ e-commerce business. Our partner programme is 
another important driver generating incremental growth. This is 
where we offer our product for sale on third party retailer sites, 
giving us access to new customers and allowing us to expand 
where we already have a presence whilst controlling the brand 
experience. We have eight partner sites currently, the most 
recent additions being The Iconic in Australia, performing ahead 
of our expectations, and TMall.com in China, which launched 
in March 2015. Whilst our partner programme is currently a 
relatively small part of our e-commerce business (c. 7% of 
e-commerce revenue), it has the potential to grow rapidly. 
A key market development, which commenced in the UK in 
2015, was our click-and-collect offering, ‘Superdry Collect’, 
which allows customers to order up until 10pm and collect 
from 12 noon the next day in any of our UK stores. We have 
complemented this with iKiosk – our in-store ordering on an 
iPad Mini with an integrated chip and pin device. This bespoke 
App gives customers in-store access to the full range from 
Superdry.com helping us capture lost sales from items being out 
of stock. The combination of the iKiosk and Superdry Collect is 
incredibly powerful and we therefore hope to roll this out to more 
stores around the world this year.
Ex ecute.  
Forming a multi-
channel relationship 
with our customers 
is vital.

•	 ensure the welfare of our colleagues
We believe that this approach is not only beneficial to 
stakeholders, but also contributes to the economic sustainability 
of the business itself.
Governance and risk management 
of corporate responsibility
We remain committed to corporate responsibility at all levels 
in our business, with our ethical trading manager and energy 
environmental manager ensuring that the Executive Committee 
and Board are apprised fully on the progress we are making 
against our objectives. This team works with departments 
across the business to identify opportunities for operating in a 
more sustainable manner as well as helping to implement and 
monitor their success.
Issues pertaining to corporate responsibility are reviewed within 
our internal control and risk management processes. Ethical 
trading issues in the supply chain are considered as a risk to the 
business and are reviewed in accordance with risk management 
protocols. You can read more on how we manage our risks on 
pages 46 to 49.
Our role in the community
Youth employment remains an important social issue in the UK 
and in many other countries where we operate. The investment 
in our careers website has received overwhelmingly positive 
feedback from schools and careers advisers as it has raised 
awareness of the variety of careers young people can pursue 
and has shown them how to take that first step in building a 
career in our industry. Our paid intern (sandwich placement) 
programme was very successful and resulted in a number of 
participants joining SuperGroup in permanent roles. In 2015 
we will, together with Gloucestershire College, introduce 
apprenticeships at our head office in Cheltenham.

30 Our collaboration with the University of Gloucestershire and their 
BA Honours in Fashion Design enabled colleagues from our 
in-house design team to support the next generation of 
designers by sharing their knowledge and experience, providing 
work placements and facilitating year one projects. Our 
partnership with the Prince’s Trust, providing work experience 
to young people in our stores, continues and we are delighted 
that this programme has resulted in a number of participants 
becoming permanent colleagues. 
We recognise that diversity contributes to 
our success
Equality and diversity are fundamental values supported 
by SuperGroup. We take our responsibilities under our 
equal opportunities policy seriously and we give full and fair 
consideration to applications for employment by disabled 
people. In the event of a colleague becoming disabled, every 
effort is made to ensure that their employment with us continues 
and that appropriate training is arranged. We respect individuals 
and their rights in the workplace and, with this in mind, 
specific policies are in place to prevent or, where issues are 
raised, address harassment and bullying and to ensure equal 
opportunities. Our whistleblowing policy and hotline continue 
to operate to give visibility to issues that might not have been 
resolved through normal business channels.
Our colleagues are from wide and diverse backgrounds,  
sexual orientations, nationalities and ethnic and religious 
groups. With continued global expansion, diversity amongst our 
colleagues will increase. We respect cultural differences, and 
learn about and embrace these differences in each territory in 
which we operate.
We recognise the benefits of encouraging diversity across the 
business and believe that this will contribute to our continued 
success. All appointments are made based on merit and are 
measured against specific objective criteria including the skills 
and experience needed for the position. We are committed to 
increasing the participation of women at the Board, Executive 
Committee and senior management level. As illustrated in 
the table below, as at 25 April 2015, more than half of our

Human rights and health and safety
We are committed to upholding human rights and we welcome 
the implementation of the United Nations’ Guiding Principles of 
Business and Human Rights. Our Ethical Trading programme 
incorporates the principles of the California Transparency in 
Supply Chains Act by working to prevent human trafficking and 
slave labour in all of our factories around the world.
We recognise the importance of health and safety and are 
committed fully to providing a safe and healthy environment for 
our colleagues and customers. A risk management process 
including monthly inspections, annual auditing, and trend 
analysis is followed to identify hazards or increased risks within 
the Group and ensures that mitigating controls are effective. 
Health and safety policies and procedures are reviewed regularly 
to ensure they are robust and continue to improve further our 
health and safety standards. This, along with the ongoing 
training programme for stores and head office colleagues run 
by our health and safety team, has ensured that the reportable 
accident rate remains extremely low at just four for this financial 
year. Colleagues are encouraged to report any health and safety 
concerns they may have either internally, through an escalation 
procedure, or via the independent whistleblowing hotline. No 
reports or calls regarding health and safety have been made 
in this financial year. We have invested substantial amounts in 
installing and upgrading our physical security and fire detection 
systems to protect colleagues and customers.

Financial 
Statements. Our colleagues share in our success
Sharing in our success is something we value highly and, for 
the fourth year running, colleagues have the opportunity to join 
the Sharesave scheme. At this year’s annual general meeting 
(“AGM”) we will seek approval to offer both a share incentive 
plan and a company share option plan to ensure that a wider 
population of colleagues can benefit from the Group’s success, 
to allow us to recognise personal contribution, and to deepen 
engagement with the Company and brand. 
Integrity of our relationships
We remain focused on the safety of and ensuring fairness  
for all workers in the factories that manufacture Superdry 
products. We seek to ensure that suppliers comply with  
local and international legislation and recognised standards  
of best practice.
Our responsibilities
We are committed to producing high-quality products 
responsibly and our suppliers must sign up to our Ethical 
Trading Code of Practice (“Code of Practice”). Based on the 
conventions of the International Labour Organisation, the Code 
of Practice sets out the minimum standards expected from 
suppliers and their employees and covers safe and fair working 
conditions: no forced labour, child labour, discrimination or 
physical maltreatment; freedom to associate and collectively 
bargain; and fair wages and reasonable working hours. All 
factories participate in our established ethical audit programme 
and are audited regularly by a globally recognised third party 
audit provider. Where factories fall short of the Code of Practice, 
we work with them to achieve sustainable improvement.
Strong collaboration
In any one season we will work with over 130 factories globally 
– most of our production is in Turkey, India and China. Long-
term stable partnerships are critical to our success and many 
of our core suppliers have been our partners for over ten 
years. We work together to encourage transparency and to 
improve continually to achieve a stable supply base. As part 
of this, we have integrated our ethical trading team into the 
sourcing team to form one integrated operational function. 
Combined with regular factory visits by our colleagues, the high 
visibility of ethical trading further reinforces our commitment 
to our suppliers. The new structure also supports a greater 
understanding within the business of challenges faced by 
factories and allows us to focus on core improvement areas 
when working with our suppliers.
Ethical Trading Initiative
As a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative we learn from trade 
unions and non-governmental organisations as well as other 
brands how to address ethical trading issues collectively.
Key initiatives 
We continue to partner with locally based experts, as detailed 
below, to support us where we identify the need for greater 
transparency and improvement. 
•	 Pre-approval: Having integrated our ethical trading team into 
our sourcing team, we have established a comprehensive 
technical and ethical pre-approval review process to ensure 
that any new factories we work with meet our requirements. 
This demonstrates a more proactive approach to improving 
our supplier relationships. 
•	 Improved audit integrity: We are moving to a semi-
announced ethical audit model (this is where factories are 
provided a one month timescale during which an audit will 
take place as opposed to an exact date) to provide us with 
greater visibility on the day-to-day working environment in our 
supply base. We also continue to complete unannounced 
audits to check results where performance is below the 
requisite standards. 154 ethical trading audits across nine 
countries were conducted during the year which enabled us 
to identify issues relevant to particular suppliers and to put in 
place action plans to address these issues.
•	 Supporting improvement: We have been working closely 
with suppliers of our core outerwear and accessories to 
deliver sustainable ethical and productivity improvement. 
Given the success of this in improving core management 
systems, we will roll this programme out to key suppliers over 
the next three years. We are also establishing a team of locally 
based experts to provide corrective action support in key 
sourcing countries.

Environment and Communities
How we create environmental value
Reducing our environmental impact is vital to the economic 
sustainability and success of our business. The SuperGroup 
Environmental Policy, sanctioned by the Chief Executive Officer, 
commits us to reduce greenhouse gas emissions, energy 
consumption and waste. In line with this policy, we continued 
several projects and also introduced new projects (as detailed 
below) to lower our energy and resource consumption.
Energy efficiency: The roll out of automated (‘smart’) meter 
readers for real time monitoring of energy use continued in 
FY15 and 82% of UK stores now have these meters fitted. Any 
abnormal energy consumption is therefore flagged and we  
can promptly investigate and resolve the issue, avoiding  
energy waste.
After successful trials, all new UK and mainland Europe stores 
are being fitted with a building management system so that 
heating and lighting can be controlled and adjusted remotely. 
This maximises energy efficiency – we have already realised 
cost savings of 10% per year versus similar stores without this 
system. The system is currently in 21 stores and we plan to 
retrofit older stores in FY16.
Renewable energy: This financial year, 89% of our UK 
electricity was generated by solar wind and hydro schemes, 
delivered in partnership with a renewable energy supply 
company (an increase of five percentage points on last year). 
During the same period, four stores in the Republic of Ireland 
were also powered by renewables for the first time and other 
Superdry territories will see ‘green energy’ as the primary source 
of power over the coming year.
Lighting: Following a successful trial in our Nottingham store 
in the UK, we upgraded our store lighting systems in 20 stores 
to new energy efficient LED technology. This has reduced total 
electricity consumption in these stores by 20% on average 
achieving a combined annual saving of 660,000 kilowatt  
hours of electricity – enough to power over 150 UK homes.  
It is now standard that all new stores are fitted with LED  
lighting technology.
Textile recycling: Over 80 tonnes of waste textiles from our UK 
design, sampling and warehouse teams was recycled in FY15. 
Carrier 
bag charge
As part of the Welsh and Scottish carrier bag regulation 
we raised approximately £11,000. These funds have 
been donated to our chosen charities, the ‘Marine 
Conservation Society’ to clear litter from Welsh beaches, 
and Scottish charity ‘Trees for Life’ to help restore native 
forests across the Highlands.
SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015

34 We have measured our operational and wider carbon footprint 
for the past five years, identified the largest climate impacts and 
prioritised resources accordingly. Our methodology is to report 
on all of the emission sources required under the Companies 
Act 2006 (Strategic Report and Directors’ Reports) Regulations 
2013. These sources include all of our owned and operated 
Retail stores and office space. We do not have responsibility 
for any emission sources outside this. Data has been prepared 
in accordance with the GHG Protocol Corporate Accounting 
and Reporting Standard (revised edition) and emission factors 
from UK Government’s GHG Conversion Factors for Company 
Reporting 2014.
Working with our communities
Superdry360, our charity and community support programme 
launched in 2014, continues to grow and is a platform 
for charitable projects supporting the local, national and 
international communities in which we operate. In FY15 we 
raised or donated a total of approximately £175,000. In FY15 
our key initiatives included:
Match funding: A five-fold increase from the previous year 
as we matched £8,656 in support of our colleagues’ chosen 
charitable causes. 
Cheltenham Design Festival: This ongoing association saw 
us donate in support of the 20 week Design Academy for local 
14–18 year olds. We offered 17 young people a one day work 
experience taster session at our Cheltenham head office, giving 
them first-hand experience of working for a design-led company.
Prince’s Trust: We provided sponsorship and work placements 
for six young people as part of the ‘Get into Retail’ programme 
run by The Prince’s Trust. This course gives young people aged 
16 to 25, who are work ready but do not have vocational skills, 
a mixture of practical training and work experience. Given its 
success, we plan to run a full ‘Get into Retail’ programme with 
The Prince’s Trust during the summer of 2015.
Charity of the Year – CARE International: Over 50 colleagues 
participated in the CARE Prima Challenge on Exmoor. By 
completing a marathon course on foot, bike and canoe they 
helped CARE generate funds to support some of the world’s 
most vulnerable communities. Further fundraising activities were 
carried out in store and at our head office.

Introduction
We made good progress this year with total retail space 
increasing by 13% (21% inclusive of the USA) and e-commerce 
sales increasing by approximately 40%. Total sales grew by 
12.9% over the year with, encouragingly, each channel also 
delivering positive like-for-like growth.
We continue to invest in our business to support future growth. 
Capital investment, totalled £41.2m (2014: £36.0m) including 
investment in new Retail space of £22.1m (2014: £26.9m) which 
required additional central resources to manage this increased 
scale. The development of our Group infrastructure remains a 
clear priority through the enhancement of our team capability 
and improved systems. At the end of the year, we terminated 
the US licence and purchased the assets of SDUSA LLC for 
total consideration of £22.5m. 
The shape of our financial performance was very different 
in each half year. The first half of the year was impacted by 
unseasonably warm autumn weather conditions which resulted 
in Group Retail like-for-like sales (including e-commerce) 
decreasing by 4.1% and year on year profit before tax 
decreasing by 30.2%. The second half of the year saw a 
marked improvement in performance with significant increases 
in revenue and underlying operating profit. 
The Group’s key performance indicators that are to be adopted 
for future reporting are shown on pages 38 to 39.

39 Our Performance. 
Group profit and loss
Group revenue for the year rose by 12.9% to £486.6m (2014: 
£430.9m), with revenue from newly opened and maturing 
Retail space contributing 8.2% of this growth. The Group gross 
margin rose 120 basis points to 60.9% (2014: 59.7%), reflecting 
the benefit of business acquisitions, sourcing and pricing gains, 
partially offset by a focused promotional programme designed 
to drive customer footfall during key trading periods and to 
reduce surplus inventory. 
Group underlying operating margin declined by 120 basis 
points on last year to 13.1% (2014: 14.3%). Operating 
margins were broadly flat year on year in the second half, with 
operating performance being offset by continued infrastructure 
investment. The decline on a full year basis reflects the 330bps 
decline in the first half driven by significantly reduced sales 
volumes in that period. 
Sales and distribution costs (which include costs associated 
with operating stores (including depreciation) and transporting 
products) totalled £197.4m (2014: £162.7m), an increase of 
21.4%. These costs are primarily driven by our continuing store 
opening programme, where average Retail space increased by 
17.1% during the year. 
A number of business acquisitions were made in the second half 
of FY14, therefore FY15 carries the full year costs of our owned 
operations in Europe and Scandinavia that were previously 
operated as distributors. These costs represent c. 8% of the 
total increase in sales and distribution costs and are more than 
offset by an enhanced gross margin.
Against the benchmark of increased Retail space, store costs 
increased by 17.0%, and were flat year on year as a percentage 
of Retail sales. Distribution costs were also impacted by the 
increased participation of e-commerce, which carries higher unit 
delivery cost, our global expansion and the volume impact of 
the promotional activity. After the benefit of ongoing productivity 
gains delivered by the relocation of our UK distribution centre, 
distribution costs increased in the year by 30.2%, increasing as 
a percentage of sales by 100 basis points. 
Central costs (which include the costs of operating our global 
operations teams and support functions, marketing costs 
and related depreciation) were £40.9m (2014: £37.8m), an 
increase of 8.1%, decreasing as a percentage of sales by 40 
basis points. In addition, the Group continues to invest in key 
infrastructure, particularly in its merchandising, IT and design 
team and in new, more scalable and functional IT platforms to 
support future international expansion. 
Underlying profit before income tax increased by 2% on the 
prior year to £63.2m (2014: £62.0m).

understand the performance of the Group. All references to underlying are after making these adjustments. 
 
For FY15 those items relate to the following:
•	 the gain on financial derivatives of £13.4m (see note 13);
•	 restructuring and reorganisation costs relating to head office of £2.7m (see note 13);
•	 the termination of the US licence and acquisition of assets from SDUSA LLC of £14.9m (see note 13);
•	 the acquisition of the Spanish and UK agents and Scandinavian distributor of £0.5m (gain) (see note 13).

SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015
www.supergroup.co.uk Our Retail division (including e-commerce)
Reflecting the continued expansion of owned stores across the EU together with positive Group 
Retail like-for-like growth in the year of +4.8% (2014: +3.2%), our Retail division delivered revenue 
of £334.1m (2014: £285.5m), up 17.0% on the year. The Retail division now represents 69% of 
total Group revenue (2014: 66%) and added 82,000 square feet of space in the year through 28 
store openings in 8 countries, including importantly 8 in Germany. Group Retail like-for-like sales 
were particularly fuelled by a strong e-commerce performance benefitting from enhancements 
to the on-site customer journey, delivery proposition improvements, the introduction of a greater 
number of localised (local language and check-out) sites and improved and widened product 
availability on our key partner sites. 
The Retail division’s operating profit in FY15 was £62.6m (2014: £49.2m). Underlying operating 
profit in the year was £62.4m (2014: £54.8m), up 13.9% on the year, and underlying operating 
profit margin was 18.7% (2014: 19.2%).
The operating margin decline reflects the net impact of adverse weather trends in the autumn, 
which initially dampened sales and necessitated promotional activity to clear excess stock, and 
the impact of foreign exchange fluctuations, partially offset by continued scale-led efficiencies 
within our store portfolio.

Our Wholesale division delivered revenue of £152.5m, up 4.9% (2014: £145.4m), representing 31% of total Group revenue (2014: 
34%). At the end of the year the Group had Wholesale operations in 69 countries through 212 (2014: 185) Superdry branded 
franchise stores and 9 (2014: 23) licensed stores.
Revenue growth in Wholesale was achieved mainly through territories outside Europe (rest of world) and clearance channels. 
Revenues within the UK were adversely impacted by the failure of a key customer, while revenues within Europe were reduced 
by the strengthening of sterling against the Euro. The rest of world has seen an increase in orders through the existing franchise 
partnership base opening new stores and the addition of new partnership deals.

T axation in the period
Our income tax expense on underlying profit of £14.8m (2014: 
£14.9m) represents an effective tax rate of 23.4% (2014: 
24.0%). This is higher than the statutory rate of 20.9% (2014: 
22.8%) primarily due to the depreciation and amortisation of 
non-qualifying assets and non-allowable expenses. 
The UK corporation tax rate reduced from 23% to 21% with 
effect from 1 April 2014 and will further reduce to 20% with 
effect from 1 April 2015.
During the year we paid £40m (2014: £49m) in UK taxes, which 
includes corporation tax, import duty, business rates, employer’s 
national insurance and stamp duty. 
In preparation for the listing of the business on the London 
Stock Exchange, a substantial reorganisation was undertaken 
with effect from 7 March 2010 and the Group’s subsidiaries 
acquired net assets with a total fair value of £375m. Within 
this amount, £340m was identified as intangible assets and 
goodwill. In previous years we have highlighted the uncertainty 
around the tax deductibility of this goodwill arising and the 
related deferred tax asset. In October 2014 HMRC agreed the 
value of the intangibles held and accordingly the related deferred 
tax assets are now confirmed to be fully recoverable.
Earnings per share
Underlying basic earnings per share is 59.1p (2014: 58.0p), an 
increase of 1.9%. 
Reported basic earnings per share is 56.1p (2014: 34.0p) 
based on a basic weighted average of 80,972,376 shares 
(2014: 80,580,959 shares). The increase in the basic weighted 
average number of shares is predominately due to 441,917 five 
pence ordinary shares being issued during February 2014 in 
accordance with the deferred contingent share consideration 
agreement following the acquisition of SuperGroup Europe 
BVBA in 2011. There was also an increase in share premium 
in the year of £0.2m in respect of 19,818 five pence ordinary 
shares issued as the first tranche of consideration following 
the buy-out of the German agency and franchise agreement in 
October 2013. 
Underlying diluted earnings per share is 58.8p (2014: 57.2p) 
and diluted earnings per share is 55.8p (2014: 33.6p). These 
are based on a diluted weighted average of 81,370,944 (2014: 
81,653,319) shares, with the reduction in the year arising from 
the cancellation of performance-related options granted under 
our performance share plan (for details of this plan please refer 
to page 78). 
Dividends
We have kept our dividend policy under review since listing on 
the London Stock Exchange in 2010. We recently announced 
our intention to commence the payment of ordinary dividends 
with an interim dividend payment in FY16. The introduction of a 
dividend policy acknowledges our confidence in the Superdry 
brand as well as our ability to deliver sustainable profitable 
growth, cash generation and return on capital. The policy also 
recognises the significant range of investment opportunities 
available to us to grow shareholder value and provides flexibility 
for the organic and other opportunities that may require 
investment concentrated within a short time period. 
Key parameters of our dividend policy are as follows:
•	 we intend to adopt a progressive dividend policy at a prudent 
earnings cover targeting 3.0x – 3.5x;
•	 we intend to adopt a dividend formula so that the interim 
dividend will be the equivalent of approximately one-third of 
the total dividend for the previous year; and
•	 if, over an extended period, excess capital has not been 
deployed, we will consider one-off returns to shareholders 
whilst maintaining flexibility through a positive cash balance.
Cash flow, balance sheet and investments
We remain financially strong and highly cash generative, 
retaining net cash balances (including cash equivalents and 
term deposits classified as an other financial asset) of £77.6m 
(2014: £86.2m) as at the end of the year after funding continued 
investment across our business and the buy-back of the US 
operations in March 2015.
Cash generated from operations of £45.5m is reduced versus 
the prior year (2014: £77.9m) due to increases in inventory levels 
beyond that required to support our increased operational scale 
through new stores and sales growth, together with a reduction 
in trade payables as more of our supply is arranged via direct 
relationships with suppliers. 
Investment in inventories, trade receivables and trade payables 
increased by 42.4% during the year to £96.7m (2014: £67.9m) 
and as a proportion of Group revenue was 19.9% (2014: 
15.8%). The increase was predominantly driven by the growth 
of the business, including the increase in the store portfolio, 
the working capital acquired in the USA and residual inventory 
from the Autumn/Winter 2014 trading conditions combined with 
earlier intake of Spring/Summer product. Inventory increased to 
£107.9m (2014: £77.8m), up 38.7% and trade payables were 
£51.2m (2014: £42.4m), an increase of 20.8% on the prior 
year, and represented 10.5% (2014: 9.8%) of Group revenue. 
Reflecting the improvement in the Wholesale business in the 
final quarter of the financial year, trade receivables (excluding 
prepayments and provisions) increased by 23.1% to £40.0m 
(2014: £32.5m) and were 8.2% (2014: 7.5%) of Group revenue. 
We continue to review our supplier base in order to manage risk 
and meet growth expectations. During the year, the number of 
suppliers decreased to 58 (2014: 66) although several of these 
operate from multiple locations. Changes to sourcing in recent 
years have resulted in the supply base being focused in three 
principal territories: Turkey, China and India. The flexible sourcing 
model that we have adopted, in terms of both suppliers and 
territories, enables us to generate competitive tension between 
suppliers and de-risk our sources of supply. 
There has been an increase in acquisitions and investments in 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to £41.2m 
(2014: £36.0m). This has been driven by the termination of the 
US licence, expenditure incurred in opening 94,000 (gross of 
closures) square feet of new Retail space, ongoing information 
technology investments and, recognising the strengthening 
of central capability and the ongoing centralisation of regional 
support functions, and the reconfiguration and expansion of our 
UK head office.
SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015

44 As at 25 April 2015, the net book value of property, plant and 
equipment was £72.3m (2014: £70.3m). During the year,  
£22.1m (2014: £26.9m) of capital additions were made, of which 
£13.0m (2014: £21.8m) relates to leasehold improvements 
across the Group relating to new stores. We continue to generate 
strong returns on these investments with the average payback 
from stores opened in the last three financial years anticipated to 
be 23 months. The balance is made up of furniture, fixtures and 
fittings (£5.1m) and computer equipment (£2.9m). Leasehold 
improvements, furniture and fittings and computers with a value 
of £4.9m were acquired as part of the business combination in 
the USA and Scandinavia.
Landlord contributions of £1.2m (2014: £4.6m) were received 
during the year and will be amortised over the length of the 
respective leases.
Intangible assets, comprising goodwill, lease premiums, 
distribution agreements, trademarks, the website and computer 
software, stood at £52.1m at the year end (2014: £46.7m). 
Acquisitions in the year resulted in £8.8m being added  
to intangibles.

Robust financial management
We believe that robust systems and business and monitoring 
processes allied to a culture of strong cost control are key to 
operating our business effectively and efficiently in both the short 
and long term. Significant improvements to business processes 
and financial controls have been made during the year, aided 
by the replacement of our core finance system and the roll 
out of process improvements related to the implementation 
of enhanced merchandise management systems at a store 
level. Furthermore, in line with best practice and other retail 
businesses, the Group has reviewed its contractual relationships 
with suppliers and can confirm that there are no complex 
supplier arrangements in place.
Outlook
Having delivered a further year of revenue and profit growth 
despite challenging trading conditions in the first half, our focus 
remains on the growth of a global lifestyle brand through the 
extension of the Superdry brand and execution of clear Retail 
growth opportunities, underpinned by continued investment to 
strengthen our business.
We are well placed to continue this growth through a strong 
pipeline of new stores in our targeted European markets, good 
momentum in e-commerce, and the clear opportunity to further 
increase brand awareness through our collaboration with 
Golden Globe winning actor, Idris Elba.

Financial 
Statements. How we Manage our Risks. 
In accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”), we understand the need for a robust 
system of internal control and risk management. Following a review of our risks, we have further assessed 
our key risks and uncertainties which are reviewed by the Executive Committee and Board twice a year. We 
consider the following matters to be the principal risks and uncertainties affecting SuperGroup. These may not 
be exhaustive and there might be additional unknown risks that could have an adverse effect on the business.
Risk Potential impact Mitigation Change
Fashion and design trends may not 
be responded to in a timely manner. 
This could become more significant 
for us as womenswear becomes a 
larger proportion of our sales.
We may experience inventory 
shortages or excesses that could 
result in lower margins, lost revenue 
or customer goodwill.
Our founders are intrinsic to the brand and have a strong understanding of and connection to the 
market and our customers. This knowledge combined with an extensive programme of customer 
research over the past 12 months has provided a clear understanding of our customers. This has 
enabled focused range planning and product development. The introduction of category management 
disciplines for SS16 will further embed this approach.
We continue to develop new product ranges such as the recent Rugby and Superdry Snow launches. 
The upcoming collaboration with Idris Elba is expected to further broaden and strengthen customer 
appeal.
We have made further investment in strengthening the design team in both numbers and experience.


Failure to achieve long-term 
business growth as a result of 
either the lack of an effective 
strategy or the failure to 
successfully implement the 
strategy.
Failure to achieve planned growth 
targets could significantly impact 
on investor sentiment.
The four pillar growth strategy presented in March 2015 sets out how we will create a global lifestyle 
brand. These are:
•	 Embed the Superdry brand to further broaden and strengthen the brand’s appeal;
•	 Enable the business to deliver long-term growth through continued investment in people, 
processes and systems;
•	 Extend the Superdry product range to capture significant growth opportunities; and
•	 Execute global growth opportunities, in new markets and online.
We have strengthened our management team during the year and, combined with the experience and 
knowledge of our founders, our leadership team now has a good mix of capabilities and experience. 
Gaps in the executive team have been identified and are being filled with the planned appointments of 
a Global Retail Director and a Transformation Director who will start in September 2015.
We continue to be strongly cash generative and able to fund our ongoing investment programme.


Failure to deliver on our business 
aspirations in North America.
Failure to improve the performance 
of our North American business 
could result in financial losses 
and/or brand damage, which 
could undermine the strategy of 
becoming a global lifestyle brand.
A combined team of UK and US colleagues will bring a balance of our global strengths with local 
knowledge of existing operations and the North American market.
We have established clear plans to integrate and improve the existing Retail and Wholesale business. 
Key focus areas include improving operational efficiency, selling the full range of Superdry products to 
North American customers and enhancing the overall customer experience, online and in store.

46 Risk Potential impact Mitigation Change
Failure to deliver business critical 
projects.
Failure to deliver key projects could 
impact on the effectiveness and 
efficiency of business operations or 
delay growth opportunities. 
We continue to focus on the delivery of key projects to provide the business with the core 
infrastructure to support future growth. Highlights of the past 12 months include the successful 
implementation of the new finance system and the completion of the transition of the European Retail 
business into a central merchandising system.
Cross-functional projects in the pipeline will be delivered under the guidance of a new central 
programme team providing a more consistent approach to embedding changes across the 
organisation. The standardised project methodology currently being deployed provides a framework 
for improved project delivery, visibility and management of project risks and issues.
This change programme will continue with ongoing systems investments and, in FY17, establishing a 
new European distribution centre. 

Loss of key individuals or the 
inability to attract and retain talent.
Lack of appropriately skilled and 
experienced resource could result 
in a delay in achieving the Group’s 
strategic goals.
Euan Sutherland’s appointment as Chief Executive Officer and Julian Dunkerton’s move to the newly 
created role of Founder and Product and Brand Director provide the necessary leadership skills 
to drive our global strategic goals. Our executive team has undergone significant change in FY15. 
With the recruitment that has already taken place or is in progress, we have a strong and highly 
experienced team in place.
Our ongoing talent review and succession planning process is providing the executive team with the 
necessary data and tools to understand the future skills requirements of the business. This process is 
also helping to ensure that our employees benefit from rewarding careers.
The approach we have taken to increasing our direct recruitment, backed up by a strong recruitment 
website, has successfully supported recruitment at all levels across the Group.


Economic and financial conditions 
result in challenging trading 
conditions or economic instability.
Our results can be affected by  
the impact of economic conditions 
on consumer confidence and 
buying habits. 
Our diversified business model encompassing Retail (including e-commerce) and Wholesale along 
with our increasing global footprint, provides significant counter-economic protection. 
The implementation of new IT systems and the integration of European Retail operations have 
enabled a deeper understanding of the performance of our business. Regular reviews through 
customer research and a review of competitor pricing, together with forecasting disciplines, are in 
place to assess current market conditions and to ensure that any issues are dealt with in a timely 
manner. 
Our Wholesale team manages closely credit terms and use of insurance and bank guarantees with 
their trading partners to balance their ability to purchase goods with managing the risk of bad debts. 
Our treasury function monitors the stability of financial institutions that hold our deposits. Investments 
are spread over a number of institutions to mitigate this risk and ensure competitive terms. The policy 
governing this is laid out in note 31 of this report.

Risk Potential impact Mitigation Change
Failure to ensure that working 
conditions in the supply base are in 
line with our ethical trading policy. 
There is a potential for SuperGroup 
to suffer negative customer and 
investor sentiment.
Ethical trading matters are managed by our Ethical Trading Manager, reporting directly to the Head of 
Sourcing, and we are a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative. 
We engage with our suppliers and expect them to operate in accordance with our Code of Practice. 
We assess the status of operating practices through a schedule of audits and visits and, where 
necessary, work with suppliers on improvement plans. 


Key infrastructure or IT systems 
may be unavailable due to 
operational problems or a major 
incident.
Should any of our IT facilities 
be unavailable for an extended 
period, our ability to trade would 
be impaired. If a major incident 
impacted the peak trading period 
from November to January, then 
the impact on earnings would be 
more severe.
The IT replacement programme has continued to deliver systems with improved reliability and 
availability. During the past 12 months, the store point of sale (“POS”) and finance systems have been 
replaced and major upgrades have been carried out on both the e-commerce platform and core IT 
infrastructure. The overall IT legacy replacement programme will continue through FY16 with ongoing 
investment in new capabilities beyond this date.
Our business continuity planning and disaster recovery capabilities have been enhanced and we 
expect these to be finalised and tested in FY16.

Brand damage may occur due to 
over-exposure of the Superdry 
brand or the existence of 
counterfeit product.
The strength of the Superdry brand 
is fundamental to the success of 
our business. There is a risk that 
our brand may become over-
exposed or damaged by the 
existence of counterfeit products 
with inferior quality and/or design. 
A sustained programme of brand insight analysis over the past 12 months has shown that the 
Superdry brand continues to have strong appeal in the UK and mainland European markets with 
positive indications in the US.
Our in-house brand protection team works closely with third party advisers and customs authorities 
throughout the world to monitor the production and sale of counterfeit product and, where identified, 
remove it (whether it be online or in the marketplace) using all remedies available, including take down 
procedures and issuing proceedings. We also monitor our supply chain to limit the risk of any supplier 
selling unauthorised product directly into the market. 


SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015

48 Risk Potential impact Mitigation Change
Failure to comply with legal and 
regulatory frameworks.
Failure to comply with legal 
obligations or regulatory 
frameworks in the diverse markets 
in which we operate could result 
in financial penalties, the inability 
to enforce contracts and/or 
reputational damage. 
Our tax and in-house legal functions work closely with the business to identify and mitigate legal and 
regulatory risks using both internal resources and external advisers where either specialist or local 
advice is needed. 


We increasingly transmit data 
electronically, creating a growing 
security risk. There is also a risk 
of the loss of controlled data by 
authorised users.
A failure to protect data adequately 
could lead to prosecution 
and reputational damage to 
SuperGroup. 
We continue to invest in new IT systems and infrastructure to enhance our security profile. 
The replacement of the store POS system completed in early 2015 has provided a significant step 
towards compliance with Payment Card Industry standards. Changes to the compliance standard in 
late 2014 require our external systems providers to re-validate their systems against the standard. As 
a result, we anticipate being compliant in the third quarter of 2015. 
We have recently reviewed and strengthened our global data protection training programme. Our legal 
team works closely with the operational teams (particularly Human Resources and IT) to ensure that 
the requirements of data protection legislation are understood and built into operational processes.


Risk of significant changes in 
currency exchange rates. 
Our financial results could be 
impacted by changes in 
exchange rates. 
We maintain constant management oversight, including Board review, of foreign exchange exposure 
and opportunities. 
We use forward foreign exchange contracts to provide planning certainty in the major currencies in 
which we trade and, therefore, mitigate currency translation exposure. This policy is set out in note 31 
of this report.

52 Corporate Governance Report.
Code compliance
The following, together with the directors’ biographies on pages 
51 to 52, the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 64 to 
84, the Directors’ Report on pages 85 to 86, the Nomination 
Committee Report on page 63 and the Audit Committee Report 
on pages 58 to 62 provide an explanation of how the principles 
of the Code have been applied and detail areas of non-
compliance during the year.
We complied throughout the year with the provisions set out 
in the UK Corporate Governance Code issued by the Financial 
Reporting Council in September 2012 (the “Code”) and the UK 
FCA Disclosure and Transparency Rules in all material respects 
other than as set out below. 
The following details areas of non-compliance during the year, all 
of which have now been remedied:
•	 From 1 May 2014 to 25 February 2015, less than half of 
the Board (excluding the Chairman) was considered to be 
independent.
•	 For the period from 21 October 2014 to 30 October 2014, the 
composition of the Audit Committee was not compliant with 
the Code as it had only two members. This was as a result 
of Euan Sutherland resigning from his role as non-executive 
director and assuming the role of Chief Executive Officer and 
was addressed with the appointment of Keith Edelman to the 
Audit Committee on 30 October 2014.
The Board is considered to be of a sufficient size and balance 
to meet the requirements of the business. The composition of 
the Board has been strengthened by the appointment of Penny 
Hughes, who joined the Board on 1 April 2015. She is a highly 
experienced director with extensive public company expertise 
in the consumer sector both as an executive and as a non-
executive director.
The Strategic Report includes the information needed for 
shareholders to assess our performance, business model  
and strategy and is incorporated into the Directors’ Report  
by reference.
The Board
The Board is responsible collectively for promoting our success 
and for implementing the business model and strategy as 
set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 49. The Board 
provides leadership for the Group and concentrates its efforts 
on strategy, performance, governance and internal control, as 
set out in the schedule of matters reserved for the Board.
The Board meets regularly to consider issues relating to our 
overall performance, strategy and future development. In 
accordance with the Code, the schedule of matters reserved for 
the Board has been reviewed and approved.
The principal matters reserved for the Board are:
•	 setting and managing Group strategy;
•	 changes relating to the Group’s capital structure including 
share issues and buy-backs;
•	 reviewing and approving financial reporting;
•	 oversight of maintenance of sound internal controls and risk 
management;
•	 approving capital expenditure and long-term commitments;
•	 Board membership and appointment;
•	 approving remuneration policy for directors, the Company 
Secretary and other senior executives;
•	 delegation of authority; and
•	 approval of corporate governance and Company policies.
The requirement for Board approval on these matters is 
understood by our senior management team and is built into our 
control framework.
The Board receives appropriate and timely information to enable 
it to discharge its duties. 
The division of responsibilities between Chairman and Chief 
Executive Officer, and the role and duties of the Senior 
Independent Director, are set out in writing and agreed by the 
Board. These were reviewed during the year. Keith Edelman is 
the Group’s Senior Independent Director – a summary of his 
responsibilities is available on our website at  
www.supergroup.co.uk.
The non-executive directors meet with the Chairman separately 
on a regular basis (normally the evening before each Board 
meeting) without the executive directors present – there have 
been four such meetings during the year. In addition, the  
non-executive directors have each spoken to the Senior 
Independent Director to appraise the performance of the 
Chairman during the year.
All members of the Board of Directors and the Board 
committees have sufficient resources and budget to allow 
access to independent advice as required. 
All directors have access to the advice and services of the 
Company Secretary, who is responsible for ensuring that Board 
procedures are complied with. The appointment and removal of 
the Company Secretary is a matter for the Board.
Operational matters, trading performance and the development 
of proposals for the Board, where required under the schedule 
of matters reserved for the Board, are controlled by the 
Executive Committee that consists of the Chief Executive Officer, 
Chief Financial Officer, Founder, Product and Brand Director, 
Founder, Brand and Design Director, Sales and Marketing 
Director, Director of HR and Head of Merchandising, advised 
by the Group General Counsel. In addition, in order to facilitate 
effective decision making and communication, the Operating 
Group (comprising the Director of IT, Group Financial Controller, 
Head of Logistics, Head of Sourcing, Head of International 
Development, Head of UK Retail, Head of e-commerce and 
Head of International Retail) joins the Executive Committee 
meeting once each month.

Our 
Governance. The Board has appointed committees to carry out certain 
duties. These committees are detailed below. Each of these 
committees is chaired by a separate chairman and has written 
terms of reference which are available on our website.
Minutes are prepared for each of these committee meetings 
by the Company Secretary and presented at the following 
respective meetings for approval. All committees have sufficient 
resources to undertake their duties.
As at the date of the Annual Report, the Board has nine 
members: the non-executive Chairman, the Chief Executive 
Officer, three other executive directors and four non-executive 
directors. Euan Sutherland was appointed as Chief Executive 
Officer on 22 October 2014, having previously been an 
independent non-executive director of the Company since  
1 December 2012, Penny Hughes was appointed as a 
non-executive director on 1 April 2015 and Nick Wharton 
was appointed as Chief Financial Officer on 24 June 2015. 
Biographies of the directors appear on pages 51 to 52. The 
Nomination Committee continues to monitor Board composition 
and succession with a view to ensuring compliance with  
the Code.  
Non-executive director independence
The independence of the non-executive directors is considered 
annually along with their commitment and performance on the 
Board and relevant committees. All non-executive directors are 
considered by the Board to be independent of management and 
free from any relationship that could interfere materially with the 
exercise of their independent judgement. 
A clause is included in their letters of appointment setting out 
their required time commitment.
Having considered the Chairman’s commitments, the Board  
is satisfied that he has adequate time to be able to act  
as Chairman.
Directors’ conflicts of interest
Our Articles of Association permit the directors to consider 
and, if thought fit, authorise situations where a director has an 
interest that conflicts, or may possibly conflict, with the Group’s 
interests. In deciding whether to authorise a conflict or potential 
conflict, the non-conflicted directors must act in a way they 
consider would be most likely to promote the Group’s success 
and they may impose limits or conditions when giving their 
authorisation, or subsequently, if they think it is appropriate. Any 
authorisation given is recorded in the Board minutes. The Board 
will continue to monitor and review potential conflicts of interest 
on a regular basis.
Relationship agreement 
Any person who exercises or controls, on their own or together 
with any person with whom they are acting in concert, 30% 
or more of the votes able to be cast on all or substantially 
all matters at general meetings of a company are known as 
‘controlling shareholders’. The Listing Rules require companies 
with controlling shareholders to enter into a written and legally 
binding agreement which is intended to ensure that the 
controlling shareholder complies with certain independence 
provisions. The agreement must contain undertakings that:
(a) transactions and arrangements with the controlling 
shareholder (and/or any of its associates) will be conducted 
at arm’s length and on normal commercial terms;
(b) neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates 
will take any action that would have the effect of preventing 
the listed company from complying with its obligations under 
the Listing Rules; and
(c) neither the controlling shareholder nor any of its associates 
will propose or procure the proposal of a shareholder 
resolution which is intended or appears to be intended to 
circumvent the proper application of the Listing Rules.
As reported in our last Annual Report, our single largest 
shareholder is Julian Dunkerton, one of the founders of the 
Company. We and Julian Dunkerton entered into a relationship 
agreement on 12 March 2010 which was amended on 9 July 
2014 to regulate our ongoing relationship in accordance with the 
Listing Rules. The Board confirms that, since the entry into the 
amended Relationship Agreement until 8 July 2015:
(i) we have complied with the independence provisions 
included in the Relationship Agreement;
(ii) so far as we are aware, the independence provision included 
in the Relationship Agreement have been complied with by 
Julian Dunkerton; and
(iii) so far as we are aware, the procurement obligation included 
in the Relationship Agreement has been complied with by 
Julian Dunkerton.
Performance evaluation
Our annual Board evaluation to assess the performance of the 
Board, our non-executive directors and committees was carried 
out between March and May 2015. The Company Secretarial 
team managed this internally using a set of questions covering a 
range of issues including processes, responsibilities, the balance 
of skills, experience, independence and knowledge, diversity 
and a number of other factors relevant to its effectiveness. 
Every third year the evaluation is facilitated by an independent 
external adviser in accordance with the Code. Consequently, 
an independent external evaluation will be undertaken in 2016. 
The performance of the executive directors during the year 
was monitored by the Chief Executive Officer and Nomination 
Committee.
The Board evaluation carried out this year highlighted that 
improvements could be made to the administration of the 
Nomination Committee and Remuneration Committee meetings, 
and there was general consensus that the Board should 
continue to provide sufficient time to focus on strategic matters, 
particularly those associated with international growth (notably in 
the USA and China).

54 Re-election of directors
As at the AGM in 2014, all directors will again offer themselves

During the year, additional ad hoc Board meetings were held as 
required. From time to time, committee meetings are attended 
by non-members by invitation from the relevant Chairman. 
Attendance is set out in the relevant committee minutes.
Information and professional development
Non-executive directors have the opportunity to meet with 
members of the Executive Committee, Operating Group and 
wider management team to gain first-hand experience of the 
business. Senior managers regularly attend Board meetings 
to make presentations to the directors. This year, these 
presentations have included such topics as our approach to 
product development, sourcing strategies, buying product, 
IT projects, corporate social responsibility and environmental 
activities, and logistics strategy. 
In addition, the non-executive directors make site visits to 
ensure that they are kept up to date with developments across 
the Group. In October 2014, the Board visited a number of our 
owned stores in Germany to understand better the strategic 
approach to and operational management of our Retail business 
outside the UK. 
All directors have received instruction on their responsibilities as 
a director and have also received and approved our competition 
law, data protection and information security policies.
Diversity 
We believe in respecting individuals and their rights in the 
workplace. Please see page 31 of the Strategic Report for more 
information about our approach to our people and diversity.

Our 
Governance. Communication with shareholders
We recognise the importance of communicating with our 
shareholders. Communication with institutional shareholders is 
undertaken as part of our investor relations programme in which 
the non-executive directors are encouraged to participate. 
The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial Officer make 
presentations after the preliminary and interim results and 
communicate regularly on developments to our shareholders. 
The Chairman arranges meetings with institutional shareholders 
to gain a balanced understanding of their views and concerns 
and to discuss strategic development and corporate 
governance. The Chairman ensures that the views of 
shareholders are communicated to the Board as a whole.
The Chairman is in regular communication with our significant 
private shareholders, Julian Dunkerton and James Holder. 
During the year, the Chairman has discussed Board 
composition, governance and the strategic approach to  
entering new markets with our shareholders.
Our AGM will be held on 9 September 2015, at which time 
shareholders will have the opportunity to ask questions of 
the Chairmen of the Audit, Remuneration and Nomination 
Committees, together with all other members of the Board  
of Directors.
Our shareholders have the opportunity to meet non-executive 
directors at additional times in the year.
The Annual Report and Financial Statements are made available 
to all of our shareholders and potential investors. Other 
information about us is made available on our website.
Financial Statements
The Board is ultimately responsible for approving the Annual 
Report and Financial Statements and the half year report.
Internal control and risk management
In accordance with the guidance for directors on internal control, 
the Board confirms that there is a process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing the risks we face. This process 
was put in place prior to the IPO in March 2010, underwent 
significant review in 2012, and has continued to be developed 
during the year. We have a Risk Committee that reports into 
the Executive Committee, with oversight provided by the Audit 
Committee, which meets every month to review the risks 
identified, agree mitigating actions and discuss any new risks. 
Where new risks are identified, they are scaled according to 
their likelihood and potential impact, and then monitored. These 
systems are in place to manage rather than eliminate risk and 
can provide only reasonable and not complete assurance 
against material misstatement or loss. The principal risks and 
uncertainties are reviewed twice each year by the Board.
The role of the Executive Committee is to implement Board 
policies on risk and control and the Board has delegated day-
to-day management to the Chief Executive Officer and, through 
him, to the other executive directors and members of the 
Executive Committee and Operating Group. 
During the year, a more comprehensive control framework 
was implemented which delegates authority for both financial 
and operational activities, the aim being to increase the level of 
responsibility and embed a culture of compliance through the 
organisation. The key elements of the control framework and 
review processes in place are as follows: 
•	 The Board sets corporate strategy and business objectives. 
•	 The Executive Committee integrates these objectives into 
their operational and financial business plans.
•	 The Executive Committee meets regularly, together with the 
Operating Group (normally twice each month), to consider 
our operational and financial performance and business 
development. The Chief Executive Officer reports to the Board 
on behalf of the Executive Committee on significant changes 
in the business and the external environment. The Chief 
Financial Officer provides the Board with financial information 
which includes key performance and risk indicators.
•	 We operate a risk management process which is integrated 
within the short and long-term business planning processes.
•	 Our treasury position, including cash and foreign exchange, is 
managed in accordance with our approved treasury policy.
•	 Financial forecasts, providing predicted results with sensitivity 
analysis, are prepared routinely throughout the year for review 
by the Executive Committee and the Board. 
•	 We have established investment appraisal and authorisation 
procedures and our capital expenditure is reviewed against 
budgets which have been approved by the Board.
•	 We assess routinely the capability of our people to deliver 
the business objectives set and respond accordingly. During 
FY15, it was recognised that there is a need to focus on 
succession planning to ensure that, where there is a loss of 
key personnel, we have the ability to operate in both the short 
and long term.
Processes are in place to ensure appropriate action is taken 
where necessary to remedy any deficiencies identified through 
our internal control and risk management processes.
The Audit Committee, on behalf of the Board, has reviewed the 
effectiveness of internal controls during the year and confirms that:
•	 there is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and 
managing our significant risks;
•	 this has been in place for the year and up to the date of 
approval of the Annual Report and Financial Statements; 
•	 the process is regularly reviewed by the Board; and
•	 the process accords with the Code.
In addition, the Board also reviewed the effectiveness of the 
risk management process in the year. Whilst satisfactory, it 
concluded that improvements could be made and further 
enhancements have been made to:
•	 widen the Risk Committee membership to include the Director 
of IT and the Group Programme Manager;
•	 invite the heads of each function to present their risks and 
answer any questions each year; and
•	 ensure there is clear ownership of each risk identified.
Our directors’ powers
Our directors have delegated authority to manage the 
operations of SuperGroup subject to the limitations contained 
in the schedule of matters reserved for the Board, the terms of 
reference of the Board committees and our Group delegated

56 Political contributions
We have not made any political donations during the year.
Directors’ indemnity insurance
We maintain directors’ and officers’ liability insurance which 
gives appropriate cover for any legal action brought against our 
directors and/or officers. In accordance with section 236 of the 
Companies Act 2006, qualifying third party indemnity provisions 
are in place for the directors in respect of liabilities incurred as 
a result of their office, as far as is permitted by law. Both the 
insurance and indemnities applied throughout the year and 
continue through to the date of this Directors’ Report. 
Change of control
The provisions of our employee share plans may cause  
options and awards granted under such plans to vest upon a 
change of control.
Substantial shareholdings
As at 6 July 2015, we had been notified, in accordance with

The Directors’ Report was approved by the Board of Directors 
on 8 July 2015.
Going concern 
Our business activities and growth strategy, together with 
factors likely to affect our future development, performance and 
position, are set out in the Strategic Report on pages 1 to 49 
and Performance section on pages 36 to 45.
The directors have reviewed our forecasts and projections. 
These include assumptions around our products, expenditure 
commitments and expected cash flows. Taking into account 
possible changes in trading performance and after making 
enquiries, the directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company has adequate resources to continue our operations 
for the foreseeable future. For this reason, we have continued 
to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial 
Statements.
Independent auditors
On the recommendation of the Audit Committee, the 
directors will put a resolution before the AGM to reappoint 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP as auditors for the ensuing year. 
Annual General Meeting 
Our AGM will be held at Cheltenham Ladies’ College, Bayshill 
Road, Cheltenham, Gloucestershire, GL50 3EP on 9 September 
2015 commencing at 11.30am. The notice of this year’s AGM is 
included in a separate circular to shareholders and will be sent 
out at least 20 working days before the meeting. This notice is 
available to view under the ‘Investors’ section of our website 
www.supergroup.co.uk. In accordance with the Code, all valid 
proxy appointments are properly recorded and counted, are 
made available at the AGM and published on our website after 
the meeting. 
The notice of this year’s AGM sets out why we believe the 
directors should be re-elected. Details of the directors’ service 
agreements and letters of appointment are given in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages 64 to 84.
The directors consider that each of the proposed resolutions 
to be presented at the AGM is in our best interests and those 
of our shareholders and employees as a whole and is most 
likely to promote the success of the Company for the benefit 
of its shareholders as a whole. The directors unanimously 
recommend that shareholders vote in favour of each of the 
proposed resolutions, as the directors intend to do in respect of 
their own shareholdings.
Approved and signed on behalf of the Board.

Governance. Audit Committee Report.
Dear shareholder,
I am pleased to present my report to shareholders on the key 
activities undertaken by the Audit Committee during the year in 
accordance with its principal responsibilities which are to:
•	 monitor the integrity of the Group’s Financial Statements, 
the half year report and any formal announcements relating 
to the Group’s financial performance, reviewing significant 
financial reporting judgements contained therein, together 
with compliance with accounting standards and other legal 
and regulatory requirements;
•	 review the Group’s internal financial controls and internal 
control and risk management systems, by considering reports 
on their effectiveness from the Chief Financial Officer and, 
when in role, the Chief Operating Officer, together with reports 
from both the internal and external auditors;
•	 review the Group’s controls and systems to ensure 
compliance with the provisions of the Bribery Act 2010 and 
the Group’s whistleblowing policy;
•	 review the effectiveness of the Group’s internal audit function 
and ensure that it is adequately resourced;
•	 recommend to the Board the appointment, reappointment 
and removal of the external auditors and to approve their 
remuneration and terms of their engagement;
•	 review and monitor the external auditors’ independence and 
objectivity, the effectiveness of the external audit process and 
the audit plan; and
•	 review the engagement of the external auditors to ensure that 
the provision of non-audit services by the external audit firm 
does not impair its independence or objectivity.
The Audit Committee has a standing agenda of areas to be 
covered at each meeting based on its terms of reference and 
in addition it considers relevant matters as they arise. The Audit 
Committee has met seven times during the year and reports 
were provided to the subsequent Board meeting.
I am satisfied that the Audit Committee was presented with 
papers of good quality during the year, provided in a timely 
fashion to allow due consideration of the subjects under 
review. I am also satisfied that meetings were scheduled to 
allow sufficient time to enable full and informed debate. We 
also reviewed our terms of reference during the year, including 
comparing them against the Code, and these were approved by 
the Board. These are available at www.supergroup.co.uk.
No significant matters were raised in the annual evaluation of 
the Audit Committee’s performance, although as the control 
environment matures we plan to reduce the number of meetings 
in the future.
The qualifications of each of the Audit Committee members  
are set out in the details of the Board of Directors on pages  
51 to 52.

All of the Audit Committee members are non-executive 
directors. The Board considers them all to be independent 
and the biographies of each of the members are set out in 
pages 51 to 52. At least one member (Minnow Powell, the 
Audit Committee Chairman) has recent and relevant financial 
experience.
By invitation of the Chairman, the Chief Executive Officer, the 
Chief Financial Officer, Head of Internal Audit (outsourced to 
KPMG LLP), other senior managers, external auditors and 
formerly the Chief Operating Officer also attend Audit Committee 
meetings. 
The role of the Audit Committee secretary is performed by the 
Company Secretary. 
At least once a year the Committee meets separately with 
the external auditors and Head of Internal Audit without 
management present.
The principal matters under consideration during the year are 
set out below.
Internal control and risk management
The Audit Committee has continued to review and discuss 
with management the Group’s process for and evaluation and 
assessment of its internal controls and management of risk. The 
review focuses on the effectiveness of the risk management 
process including financial, operational, technical and 
compliance risks and related controls which are described on 
page 56. The Audit Committee has noted the continued focus 
and improvement in the risk management process and the 
strengthening of internal controls during the year.
Risk management process
The identification and management of key risks for the Group is 
achieved through a risk register which is formally reviewed and 
updated by management on a regular basis to ensure that it is 
focused on real, current and significant business risks and that 
mitigating actions are feasible. The internal Risk Committee, 
whose members include the Chief Financial Officer, Group 
General Counsel, Director of IT and Group Programme Manager, 
meets on a monthly basis to review the risk register, assess the 
appropriateness of key risks and then make recommendations 
to the Board and Audit Committee. In 2015 the process has 
been reviewed and re-positioned to reflect the growing scale, 
maturity and complexity of the Group. The key advantages are:
•	 heightened awareness of risk and greater accountability for 
management of risk at all levels within the organisation;
•	 robust assessment and identification of mid-tier risks; and
•	 improved integration of risk, mitigation and key business 
continuity processes.
The Audit Committee has reviewed the revised risk management 
process and recommended to the Board that the process be 
adopted.
IT
The upgrade of the core business infrastructure was a 
significant investment programme approved by the Board to 
be completed by 2015. The programme covered new systems, 
and replacement or upgrades to a number of the Group’s 
core existing systems and facilities. The programme has been 
substantially delivered and, during the year, the following key 
projects were successfully completed:
•	 the new point of sale (POS) system was rolled out across UK 
and European Retail stores; 
•	 upgrade to the integrated system (Styleman) for production 
orders, sales orders and sales ledger; and
•	 the replacement finance system was operational from August 
2014 and is now being rolled out across our European 
subsidiaries. The implementation of the business information 
reporting system will be completed by the end of 2015. 
Given the significant IT improvements being undertaken by the 
Group, the Audit Committee has continued to focus on the 
development of the IT control environment. Senior management 
have also provided reports on the Group’s compliance with the 
Payment Card Industry Data Security Standard (PCI DSS), and IT 
security risks, key issues and development of the related controls. 
A business continuity planning (BCP) programme has been 
developed and will continue to be enhanced over the remainder 
of 2015. A disaster recovery (DR) plan which focuses on the major 
IT components critical to business operations is now in place with 
the final areas due to be completed by the end of 2015. 
Delegated authorities
We have developed a delegated authority framework to allow 
the business to make operational decisions and sign contracts 
within agreed authority levels. The Audit Committee reviewed 
and challenged the framework prior to Board approval in 
December 2014.
Other
The Audit Committee has continued to review other key 
areas of risk and internal controls including accounts payable, 
intercompany, treasury, tax and credit control management 
with presentations given by the manager responsible. The 
Audit Committee also discussed with management the risk and 
controls over fraud, and the risk of financial misstatements by 
the breaching of laws and regulations.
Following the nature of the departure of the previous Chief 
Financial Officer in February 2015, the Board commissioned 
KPMG to provide independent assurance that there was no 
related breakdown of financial controls, and KMPG confirmed 
that, based on agreed procedures performed, there was no 
evidence of a related breakdown.

Our 
Governance. Financial reporting and accounting judgements 
The Audit Committee reviewed and approved the Financial Statements of the Group and all formal announcements relating to the Group’s financial performance. The review considers the integrity of 
the reporting, the appropriateness and acceptability of accounting policies and practices, and compliance with financial reporting standards and requirements. 
For accounting judgements, the Committee considered detailed papers from management and the views of the external auditors. The Audit Committee considers that the Group has adopted 
appropriate accounting policies and made appropriate estimates and judgements where required.
The primary area of accounting judgements and issues reviewed by the Audit Committee for the current year are set out below:
Area Issue How addressed
Acquisition accounting, 
licence and contract 
termination, and 
other exceptional and 
remeasurement items
Material items are outside the 
normal course of business and are 
adequately disclosed.
Fair values are appropriately 
determined at the date of 
acquisition.
The Committee reviewed management’s assessment of the acquisition accounting for the purchase of the assets of SDUSA LLC 
and the acquisition of the SMAC group of companies (SMAC A/S, SMAC Retail A/S and SMAC Norge A/S) including judgements 
taken in relation to forecasts used, fair values ascribed to assets and liabilities acquired, identification of intangible assets and 
resulting goodwill/bargain purchase.
The Committee considered the nature and size of costs categorised as exceptional to include whether they met the definition of 
an exceptional, being material in size, unusual, or infrequent in nature, or are remeasurements.
The Committee has reviewed the exceptional and remeasurement items as disclosed in Note 13 to the Financial Statements and 
is satisfied that the categorisation is appropriate.
Deferred tax assets are not considered a primary area of judgement for 2015 as the tax benefit in relation to the Wholesale business and the non-recognition for the Retail business has now been 
agreed with HM Revenue and Customs.
Other areas that have been discussed and considered by the Audit Committee in relation to the 2015 Annual Report are:
Area Issue How addressed
Provisions for inventory, 
returns, receivables and 
property
Management judgement is 
required and estimates are used 
to support the provisions.
For each provision, the Committee considered and challenged the judgements made by management and assessed the available 
evidence, including historic trends, and concluded that the provisions were appropriate. 
Goodwill reallocation 
review
The goodwill allocation between 
Cash Generating Units (CGUs) is 
based on judgement.
In respect of goodwill, the Committee considered and challenged the basis of allocation between the Wholesale and Retail CGUs, 
and concluded that the judgements used were suitable for use in the goodwill allocation.

60 Fraud, whistleblowing and bribery
The Group has a policy and process in place for fraud, security 
and whistleblowing and the Audit Committee is satisfied that 
employees have the opportunity to raise concerns in confidence 
about possible fraudulent activity and any other concerns 
that arise within the organisation. The Committee is also 
satisfied that arrangements are in place for proportionate and 
independent investigation of such matters, including appropriate 
follow-up action.
During the year the Audit Committee received an update on 
instances of fraud within the Group and a summary of the calls 
to the whistleblowing helpline together with follow up actions 
that were undertaken.
Controls and procedures surrounding anti-bribery monitoring 
to ensure compliance with the Bribery Act 2010 were put in 
place by the Group in 2014 and the Audit Committee receives 
a regular report on the Group’s gift register which includes 
any gifts and hospitality received by employees from external 
business relationships above an agreed threshold.
Internal audit effectiveness
The internal audit function has continued to develop and 
improve its effectiveness during the year. The ongoing review 
of an audit universe, and the outputs from the Risk Committee, 
has enabled the role of internal audit and scope of its work to 
continue to evolve to take account of changes within the Group 
and emerging best practice. The annual review of the internal 
audit plan ensures that the coming year is planned and following 
two years agreed in outline so that areas of focus are audited 
at least once over the course of the three year plan. During the 
year, internal audit has delivered ten audits including coverage of 
the following areas: European subsidiaries, treasury, expenses, 
HR and payroll, IT, trade marks and intellectual property, pricing, 
public reporting, and follow up reports on retail operations, 
product development, IT and e-commerce.
The effectiveness of internal audit is reviewed on an ongoing 
basis by the Audit Committee, by discussion and assessment 
with senior management on the issues identified by the internal 
audit reports, and through the regular follow up at meetings on 
progress on the recommended actions. A formal review was 
undertaken in September 2014 and no significant concerns 
were identified.
External audit effectiveness and integrity of 
the Group’s relationship
The Audit Committee reviews, with the external auditors, the 
audit plan and the outcome and findings of the annual external 
audit. In reviewing the audit plan the Audit Committee:
•	 noted and challenged the key areas of risk raised by 
PricewaterhouseCoopers (“PwC”);
•	 understood the basis of materiality and requested that all 
potential adjustments and errors above £0.1m be reported to 
the Audit Committee; and
•	 ensured, as part of their procedures, that the auditor 
understood the nature of each balance sheet account. 
In addition, the Committee approves the scope and fees for 
the external audit and is responsible for recommending the 
appointment, reappointment and removal of external auditors.
Effectiveness of external audit
A review of the effectiveness of external audit in September 
2014 was undertaken by an internal survey of members of 
the Audit Committee, Chief Financial Officer, and the internal 
finance team. The Committee noted that areas for improvement 
identified in 2013 had been addressed. We also reviewed the 
AQRT report on PwC as a firm and noted the key findings. We 
were satisfied that our external auditors continued to perform 
effectively and will use the new FRC guidance on effectiveness 
when we carry out the 2015 review. 
Supervision of the external auditors 
The Audit Committee oversees the external auditors by 
reviewing and approving the audit plan and ensuring that it 
is consistent with the scope of the audit engagement. The 
Committee meets regularly with the external auditors, both with 
and without management present. During the review of the 
audit plan, the Committee discussed and agreed those financial 
statement risk areas identified by the auditors that required 
additional audit emphasis and discussed and challenged the 
auditors’ assessment of materiality. The audit opinion on pages 
88 to 94 provides a full explanation of the auditors’ assessment 
of material misstatement, concept of materiality and scope of 
the audit. 
Reappointment of external auditors
Based on the assessment of effectiveness and independence of 
the external auditors, the Audit Committee has recommended 
the reappointment of  for the next financial year. The 
appointment of PwC the external auditors will continue to be 
reviewed annually and a tendering process will be undertaken 
if the Committee considers it appropriate. PwC have been 
the Group’s auditors since the IPO in 2010, and, prior to this, 
auditors to the legacy SuperGroup companies since 2008. The 
Committee notes that under current regulations, the audit will 
need to be tendered in time for the audit for the year ended 
2018.

Our 
Governance. Independence 
Auditor independence is maintained by reviewing PwC’s 
confirmation of their independence and the threat thereto, 
monitoring the nature and value of non-audit services carried 
out, and ensuring that employees of the external auditors 
who have worked on the audit in the past two years are not 
appointed, without prior approval of the Audit Committee, to 
senior financial positions within the Company. In addition, the 
rotation of the lead partner occurs every five years. 
The Audit Committee assessed the independence of the 
external auditors and concluded that they were independent.
Non-audit services
The general policy in respect of non-audit work by the external 
auditors is that they should not be requested to carry out 
non-audit services on any material activity of the Group where 
they may, in the future, be required to give an audit opinion or 
act as management, in accordance with the Audit Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. In certain limited areas 
it is in the Group’s and its shareholders’ interests to engage the 
external audit firm to deliver certain services. To protect auditor 
objectivity and independence the Audit Committee approves 
each individual non-audit service above £20,000 in value and 
every piece of work once an agreed threshold is reached.
Details of all non-audit services provided during the year are set 
out within the note on auditors’ remuneration on page 117 and 
are summarised in the table below:
2015 
£m
2014 
£m
Audit fees 0.3 0.3
Non-audit fees
Tax compliance and advisory 0.1 0.3
Other 0.1 0.1
Total non-audit fees 0.2 0.4
Non-audit fees as a percentage of audit fees 74% 150%
Non-audit fees were 100% or above in 2014 primarily due to 
ongoing tax advisory services and the appointment of PwC for 
other work, including due-diligence on the acquisition of US 
assets from SDUSA LLC, where an experienced understanding 
of the Group’s structure and business was required to be able to 
provide appropriate assurance work. Tax advisory services were 
tendered during the year and Grant Thornton was appointed as 
the Group’s tax adviser in October 2014, which has reduced the 
threat to independence for PwC as external auditors.
The Committee has reviewed and agreed the non-audit services 
as set out above provided by the external auditors, together with 
the associated fees, and is satisfied that these did not prejudice 
the external auditors’ independence or objectivity.

62 Nomination Committee Report.
Principal functions
The Nomination Committee is responsible for nominating 
candidates for Board positions and ensuring that the Company 
has the leadership and senior management to meet its growth 
ambitions. The principal functions of the Nomination Committee 
are:
•	 to review the structure, size, composition and balance of the 
Board and recommend changes where appropriate;
•	 to consider and recommend succession planning for 
executive and non-executive directors;
•	 to identify and nominate candidates for approval of the Board 
to fill Board vacancies or new positions as and when they arise; 
•	 to approve appointments to the Executive Committee; and
•	 to evaluate the skills, experience and knowledge of Board 
members.
The role of secretary to the Nomination Committee is performed 
by the Company Secretary. 
Activities during the year
The Nomination Committee met nine times during the year. In 
addition to the members of the Nomination Committee, the 
Director of HR attended each of the meetings. 
The prime focus this year has been on the selection and 
appointment of a new Chief Executive Officer, overseeing a 
series of changes to Board composition and ensuring that the 
Company has the right talent in key roles to realise its growth 
potential in existing and new markets. 
During the year, the Nomination Committee monitored the 
performance of the senior team and reviewed the organisational 
structure. It also ensured that key individuals were given support 
and mentoring where appropriate. 
Key talent risks and succession plans for the executive directors 
and senior leaders were reviewed in both October 2014 and in 
April 2015 and actions put in place to mitigate identified risks.
Director changes 
In October 2014, following a review of potential external 
candidates proposed by an independent external search 
consultancy, the Committee recommended to the Board that 
Euan Sutherland should be appointed as Chief Executive Officer 
and his appointment to the Board was approved. 
Following Euan’s move from a non-executive director to his 
executive role, the Committee launched a recruitment process 
using an independent external search consultancy (Egon 
Zehnder) for a replacement and Penny Hughes was appointed 
as a non-executive director in April 2015. 
As a consequence of the above appointments a number of 
changes were made to committee memberships during the 
year. Euan Sutherland and Julian Dunkerton resigned from 
the Nomination Committee in October 2014. Minnow Powell 
was appointed to the Nomination Committee in October 2014 
and resigned in April 2015; Ken McCall was appointed to the 
Remuneration Committee in October 2014; Keith Edelman 
was appointed to the Audit Committee in October 2014 
and resigned in April 2015 when the Board approved the 
appointment of Penny Hughes to the Board, the Nomination 
Committee and Audit Committee. 
Hans Schmitt, Susanne Given and Shaun Wills all left the 
Company during the year. Neither Hans Schmitt nor Susanne 
Given have been replaced as their responsibilities have 
been reorganised following Euan’s appointment as Chief 
Executive Officer. The Nomination Committee launched a full 
recruitment process to fill the role of Chief Financial Officer and 
recommended the appointment of Nick Wharton, who was 
appointed on 24 June 2015. Nick, who had been covering the 
role on an interim basis since February, brings deep financial 
management skills as well as broad retail and business 
experience from his roles with various retailers.
None of the existing executive directors hold non-executive 
directorships with companies outside the Group. Nick Wharton 
will continue to be a non-executive director of Mothercare Plc.
Euan and the Committee have conducted a review of the 
executive team structure to define clear accountability for 
delivery of the five year strategic plan and to ensure the right 
leadership structure is in place to lead the business through a 
complex period of growth in new territories. The need for two 
new Executive Committee roles has been identified: a Retail 
Director, harmonising the leadership of our Retail businesses 
across the world; and a Transformation Director, leading 
strategic infrastructure programmes and the development of 
Retail and Wholesale business in new territories. Paula Kerrigan 
will join the Group in September 2015 as Transformation 
Director. Paula previously held senior leadership roles with 
Kingfisher Plc and the Co-operative Group.
Composition and diversity
The Nomination Committee continues to review the composition 
of the Board and membership of Board Committees and has 
agreed a plan of action to address succession and diversity. 
In particular, the Nomination Committee takes the view that 
the role of women is important at all levels in SuperGroup. At 
the end of the year, 12% of the Board, 38% of the Executive 
Committee and 44% of senior managers were female. This 
demonstrates an improvement in gender diversity at every 
level of leadership across the organisation, which we seek to 
continue.

Governance. Remuneration Report.
1.  Remuneration Committee Chairman’s 
Annual Statement (unaudited)
This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with 
Part 3 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and 
9.8.8R of the Listing Rules.
The Directors’ Remuneration Report has been divided into the 
following three sections:
1. This Remuneration Committee Chairman’s Annual 
Statement: This summarises and explains the major 
decisions taken by the Committee, how the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy was operated in the year just ended 
and how it will operate for the current year.
2. Directors’ Remuneration Policy: This sets out the basis 
of remuneration for our directors which was approved 
by shareholders at the AGM in September 2014 and is 
unchanged. Although not required to be included in the 
report this year, the policy has been included in line with 
best practice and to assist the reader.
3. Annual Report on Remuneration: This sets out the 
remuneration earned by our directors in the year ended  
25 April 2015 and explains how the remuneration policy will 
be implemented in the current financial year.
The approach of our Remuneration Committee has remained 
consistent with previous years; executive directors receive a 
mix of annual and long-term incentives which reward strong 
business and financial performance in line with our strategy 
and which are measured against robust benchmarks. The 
Committee considers that the remuneration arrangements 
promote our long-term success within a suitable risk framework, 
are suitably aligned to enhancing shareholder value and that the 
actual remuneration earned by the executive directors continues 
to be a good reflection of their and our overall performance. 
The year under review
Our remuneration policy was approved in September 2014 
with 94% of votes cast in favour. The Committee gave full 
consideration to the operation of the policy prior to proposing it 
to shareholders at the AGM and considers the level of support 
obtained to be a strong endorsement. The Remuneration 
Committee has reviewed the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
during the year and remains of the view that it promotes the 
attraction, motivation and retention of the executives required 
to successfully drive our strategy. As such, the Committee has 
decided that no changes to the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
are required.
In addition to reviewing the Directors’ Remuneration Policy and 
how it operated during the year just ended, the Committee 
determined the remuneration arrangements in respect of  
Euan Sutherland’s appointment as Chief Executive Officer on 
22 October 2014.  The package reflects his significant levels of 
experience in international and online expansion obtained from 
senior executive positions in a number of leading retailers and 
has been focused towards long-term share-based performance-
linked remuneration to reflect our ambitions for growth. Details 
of the remuneration package, which is within the shareholder 
approved policy, were announced on his appointment and are 
set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Hans Schmitt (December 2014), Shaun Wills (February 2015) 
and Susanne Given (February 2015) all left the Company during 
FY15. Details of their termination arrangements are presented in 
the Annual Report on Remuneration on page 78.
Performance and reward
As a result of this year’s financial performance target not having 
been met there will be no annual bonus payments made to 
executive directors for the year ended 25 April 2015 in respect 
of Group financial performance. However, having met the 
personal/strategic objectives agreed at appointment in October 
2014, Euan Sutherland will receive an amount equal to 50% of 
his pro rated salary in respect of the non-financial targets of the 
annual bonus.
The performance share plan (“PSP”) award granted in 2012 in 
respect of the three year performance period which ended on 
25 April 2015 is due to vest in August 2015 and is expected 
to vest at 32.4% of the original award. This is based on 46.2% 
vesting against the earnings per share (“EPS”) targets (70% 
of awards) and 0% against the relative total shareholder return 
(“TSR”) targets (30% of awards). Further details about our share 
schemes can be found on pages 67 to 68.
The year ahead
As explained, no changes will be made to the Directors’ 
Remuneration Policy for FY16. No base salary increases were 
awarded to executive directors with effect from 26 April 2015, 
the annual bonus will continue to be capped at 100% of base 
salary (150% of base salary for the Chief Executive Officer with 
any award in excess of 100% being awarded in deferred shares) 
and PSP awards will continue to be based 70% on EPS and 30% 
on relative TSR. The Chief Executive Officer and Chief Financial 
Officer will receive awards of 200% of salary (award levels for 
the Chief Financial Officer are expected to be 100% of salary 
thereafter). Malus and clawback provisions will continue to apply.
The Remuneration Committee is confident that the actions 
during FY15 and the continuation of the previously approved 
Directors’ Remuneration Policy will continue to ensure that the 
executive directors are properly incentivised to deliver strong 
and sustainable growth.
Approved and signed on behalf of the Board.

64 2. Directors’ Remuneration Policy (unaudited)
In formulating the remuneration policy, full consideration has been given to the principles set out in the Code. The Remuneration Committee regularly reviews the policy to ensure it takes account of 
best practice and serves our needs. As part of the regular review, the Remuneration Committee encourages dialogue with major shareholders and considers their feedback, alongside guidance from 
the major shareholder representative bodies. Details of votes cast for and against the resolution to approve last year’s remuneration report and any matters discussed with shareholders during the year 
are set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
This section sets out the Directors’ Remuneration Policy which was approved by shareholders at the AGM on 19 September 2014 in accordance with section 439A of the Companies Act 2006. There 
are no proposed changes to this policy.
Policy overview
We aim to provide a remuneration structure and approach that enables the attraction, retention and motivation of high calibre people with the capability to drive continued growth of the business and 
which is aligned to shareholder interests. Where the Remuneration Committee has discretion in implementing the remuneration policy, that discretion will be exercised diligently and in a manner aligned 
with shareholder interests. Discretion will only be exercised within the boundaries and limits set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Policy.
The Remuneration Committee will not seek to make changes to any element of executive director remuneration to compensate participants for changes in their personal tax status. 
Summary of the Executive Director Remuneration Policy
Element Base Salary
Purpose and link to strategy Set at levels to attract and retain talented executive directors of the high calibre required to develop and deliver the growth strategy. Base salary will 
reflect the individual skill, experience and role of the executive within the Group whilst reflecting that paid to executives of comparable companies.
Operation When determining base salary the Committee typically takes into account:
•	 business and individual performance;
•	 salary levels at companies of a similar size, industry, global scope and complexity; and
•	 the salaries paid to other employees across the Group. 
Base salary is normally paid on a monthly basis in cash. The base salary for each executive director is normally reviewed annually in May by the 
Remuneration Committee although an out of cycle review may be conducted if the Remuneration Committee determines it appropriate. A salary 
review will not necessarily lead to an increase in salary. 
Maximum opportunity There is no prescribed maximum base salary level or maximum annual increase.
Salary increases will typically be in line with the general level of increase awarded to other employees in the Group and/or the director’s country of 
employment.
In exceptional circumstances (e.g. where there is an increase in scale, scope and/or responsibility, to reflect the development and success of the 
individual within the role, and/or to take account of relevant levels/market movements) a higher increase may be awarded.
Current salaries are detailed in the Annual Report on Remuneration.
Performance measures Individual and business performance is taken into consideration when deciding salary levels.

Our 
Governance. Element Retirement Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy To provide retirement benefits which are market competitive and to enable us to attract and retain executive directors of the right calibre.
Operation Executive directors can choose to participate in the personal pension plan relevant to the country where they are employed, or to receive a cash 
allowance, or a combination of the two. Our Group personal pension plan is a defined contribution plan.
Maximum opportunity The maximum Company contribution to an executive director’s pension (or equivalent cash allowance) may not exceed 15% of base salary.
Element Other Benefits
Purpose and link to strategy To ensure a competitiveness with broader market practice.
To support personal health and well-being.
Operation Benefit provision is set at an appropriate market level taking into account the executive director’s home jurisdiction, the jurisdiction where they are 
based, market practices at similar companies and the level/type of benefits provided elsewhere in the Group.
The benefits to which executive directors are entitled include (but are not limited to) a biannual health assessment, private medical insurance (for the 
individual and their family), company sick pay, holiday pay, life assurance, car allowance and staff discount on Superdry products. Other benefits may 
be provided where appropriate.
In country and global relocation support may also be provided where appropriate. 
Executive directors are eligible to participate, on the same basis as other employees, in our Sharesave scheme and will be entitled to participate in 
any other all-employee share plan operated in the future.
Maximum opportunity There is no maximum level of benefits provided to an individual executive director.
Participation by executive directors in the Sharesave scheme, and any other all-employee share plan operated in the future, is limited to the 
maximum award levels permitted by HM Revenue and Customs.

66 Element Annual Performance Bonus
Purpose and link to strategy To encourage and reward the achievement of challenging financial and strategic performance targets during a financial year. The performance 
measures set each year align to our strategy and shareholder value creation.
Operation Bonus payments are normally awarded in cash and are not pensionable. An individual executive director may choose to defer bonus awarded into 
our Group personal pension plan.
The Remuneration Committee may defer part of an executive director’s annual bonus into SuperGroup shares for a specified period of time.
Maximum opportunity Up to 150% of base salary. 
Performance measures
Performance is normally assessed over one financial year.
The annual performance bonus may be based on a mix of financial, personal and/or strategic business objectives relevant to the particular 
performance year and is aimed at securing a sustainable long-term business model. 
The performance criteria and performance targets are determined by the Remuneration Committee each year and include threshold levels for 
minimum award (below which no bonus will be awarded), on-target award and maximum award. 
The Remuneration Committee will set demanding performance targets to encourage stretch performance. These targets are considered to be 
commercially confidential and will therefore be disclosed in due course after the performance period has ended.
A straight-line sliding scale between threshold (0% of opportunity), target (50% of opportunity) and maximum (100% of opportunity) is used to 
determine the level of award.
Malus and clawback provisions apply.
Element Performance Share Plan (“PSP”)
Purpose and link to strategy To incentivise and reward executive directors to develop and deliver strategic plans that create long-term value through the setting of strategic 
targets; and to ensure a strong link between reward, underlying Group financial performance and total shareholder returns.
To support recruitment, long-term retention and collaborative working through share ownership.
Operation Awards are granted on a discretionary basis and normally vest subject to performance and continued employment at the end of a three year 
performance and vesting period. Awards may be structured as conditional awards or nil or nominal cost options.
Executive directors may benefit, in the form of cash or shares, from the value of any dividend paid over the vesting period to the extent that  
awards vest.
Maximum opportunity Maximum award limit: 200% of salary.
Exceptional circumstances* award limit: 300% of salary (*for recruitment or retention).
Performance measures Normally based on a three year performance period.
Performance measures will be based on financial metrics – (e.g. Earnings Per Share (“EPS”)) and/or relative total shareholder return (“TSR”).
25% of an award vests for threshold performance increasing to 100% vesting for maximum performance.
Malus and clawback provisions will apply.

Our 
Governance. Element Share Ownership Guidelines
Purpose and link to strategy To increase alignment between management and shareholders.
Operation Executive directors not holding shares worth at least 100% of their base salary will be expected to retain 50% of any PSP awards which vest (net of 
tax) until such time as this level of holding is met.
Maximum opportunity Minimum of 100% of base salary.
Financial performance measures (e.g. EPS) and TSR are 
used for the PSP’s performance criteria. The Group’s key 
performance indicators, as set out in the Strategic Report, 
contribute to the delivery of profit before tax, EPS and TSR. 
The combination of EPS and TSR performance conditions for 
the PSP provides a balance between rewarding management 
for growth in sustainable profitability and stock market 
outperformance. TSR is a clear indicator of the relative 
success of the Group in delivering shareholder value and, as 
a performance measure, firmly aligns the interests of directors 
and shareholders. The EPS target range will require significant 
levels of growth and the TSR condition will be based on relative 
outperformance of selected listed companies. Performance 
against the TSR and EPS targets will be independently 
calculated and reviewed by the Remuneration Committee.
In approving this Directors’ Remuneration Policy, authority was 
given to the Company to honour any commitments entered 
into with current or former directors. Details of any payments 
to former directors will be set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration as they arise. 
Remuneration arrangements across 
the Group
The reward philosophy is consistent across the Group, namely 
that reward should support our business strategy and be 
sufficient to attract and retain high performing individuals. Within 
this framework, there are differences for a range of objective 
reasons, including global location, culture, best practice, 
employment regulation and the local talent market.
•	 Salaries and benefits – a range of factors are considered 
including business performance, individual capability and 
performance, the pay of other employees and external  
market data.
•	 Annual performance bonus – consistent with the policy for 
executive directors, annual bonuses that are in place across 
the Group are typically linked to business performance with a 
focus on underlying Group profit, although we retain the right 
to void a bonus award in circumstances where we deem an 
individual has not performed to an acceptable level or has 
acted inappropriately during the performance period.
•	 PSP – a small number of the management team who provide 
significant strategic input or lead a significant function within 
the Company, and more junior employees who have made an 
exceptional contribution, may be invited to participate in the 
PSP in any year.
•	 All employee share schemes – in the UK the Company 
operates a Sharesave scheme which is open to all eligible 
employees. Employees can elect to save up to £500 each 
month for a fixed period of three years. At the end of the 
savings period, individuals may use their savings to buy 
ordinary SuperGroup shares at a discount capped at up to 
20% of the market price set at the launch of each scheme. 
Shareholder approval will be sought for the introduction of a 
share incentive plan and company share option plan at the 
forth-coming AGM (see notice of AGM for further details).
•	 Retirement benefits – in line with local country practices, we 
encourage all employees to contribute appropriate savings 
toward their retirement. In the UK, we operate pension 
arrangements within the Occupational and Personal Pension 
Schemes (Automatic Enrolment) Regulations 2010.

Our 
Governance. Discretions retained by the Committee 
The Remuneration Committee will operate the annual bonus 
plan and PSP according to their respective rules (or relevant 
documents) and in accordance with the Listing Rules where 
relevant. The Remuneration Committee retains certain 
discretions, consistent with market practice, with regard to the 
operation and administration of these plans. These include, 
but are not limited to, the following in relation to the PSP: 
the participants; the timing of grant of an award; the size of 
an award; the determination of vesting; discretion required 
if dealing with a change of control or restructuring of the 
Group; determination of the treatment of leavers; adjustments 
required in certain circumstances (e.g. rights issues, corporate 
restructuring events and special dividends); reviewing 
performance measures and weighting; and targets for the PSP 
from year to year.
In relation to the annual bonus plan, the Committee retains 
discretion over: the participants; the timing of grant of a 
payment; the determination of the bonus payment; dealing with 
a change of control; determination of the treatment of leavers 
based on the rules of the plan and the appropriate treatment 
chosen; the annual review of performance measures and 
weighting; and targets for the annual bonus plan from year  
to year.
In relation to both our PSP and annual bonus plan, the 
Remuneration Committee retains the ability to adjust the targets 
and/or set different measures if events occur (e.g. material 
acquisition and/or divestment of a Group business) which cause 
it to determine that the conditions are no longer appropriate and 
the adjustment is required so that the conditions achieve their 
original purpose and are not materially less difficult to satisfy. We 
have used EPS as a determining measure since inception for the 
PSP; it is therefore consistent and transparent to participants 
and shareholders. The Remuneration Committee will exercise 
discretion if required to adjust EPS to reflect what it considers 
to be a fairer outcome for shareholders and executive directors. 
In both the current and prior year, the Remuneration Committee 
has excluded re-measurements and exceptional items from both 
the PSP and the annual bonus plan. 
Any use of the above discretions would, where relevant, be 
explained in the Annual Report on Remuneration and may, 
as appropriate, be the subject of consultation with our major 
shareholders.
The operation of our Sharesave scheme will be as permitted 
under HM Revenue and Customs’ rules and the Listing Rules. 
Details of share awards held by executive directors at the 
end of the financial year are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration. These remain eligible to vest based on their 
original award terms.
Illustrations of application of the Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
Our remuneration arrangements have been designed so that a substantial proportion of reward is dependent on the achievement of 
stretching short and long-term performance targets. The chart below shows the value of the current executive directors’ packages 
under three reward scenarios (minimum, on-target and maximum).

70 Approach to the recruitment and retention 
of executive directors
Principles
When hiring a new executive director or promoting to the Board 
from within the Group, the Remuneration Committee will offer 
a package that is sufficient to attract, retain and motivate the 
right talent, whilst at all times aiming to pay no more than is 
necessary. In determining an appropriate remuneration package, 
the Remuneration Committee will take into consideration all 
relevant factors including but not limited to the impact on  
other existing remuneration arrangements, the candidate’s 
location and experience, external market influences and internal 
pay relativities. 
The remuneration package for a new executive director would 
be set in accordance with the terms of our prevailing approved 
remuneration policy at the time of appointment and take into 
account the skills and experience of the individual, the market 
rate for a candidate of that experience and the importance of 
securing the relevant individual.
Salary would be provided at such a level as required to attract 
the most appropriate candidate and may be set initially at 
a below mid-market level on the basis that it may progress 
towards the mid-market level once expertise and performance 
has been proven and sustained. The annual bonus potential 
would be limited to 150% of salary and grants under the 
PSP would be limited to 200% of salary (300% of salary in 
exceptional circumstances).
In addition, the Remuneration Committee may offer additional 
cash and/or share-based elements to replace deferred or 
incentive pay forfeited by an executive director leaving a 
previous employer. It would seek to ensure, where possible, that 
these awards would be consistent with awards forfeited in terms 
of vesting periods, expected value and performance conditions.
For an internal executive director appointment, any variable  
pay element awarded in respect of the prior role may be  
allowed to pay out according to its terms. In addition, any other 
ongoing remuneration obligations existing prior to appointment 
may continue. 
For external and internal appointments, the Remuneration 
Committee may agree that certain relocation and/or incidental 
expenses (as appropriate) will be met.
Policy on payment for loss of office
We are committed to ensuring a consistent approach so 
that we do not pay more than is necessary in circumstances 
leading to loss of office. In the event of an early termination 
of a contract, the policy is to seek to minimise any liability. 
When managing such situations the Remuneration Committee 
takes a range of factors into account, including contractual 
obligations, shareholder interests, organisational stability and 
the need to ensure an effective handover. Executive directors 
may be entitled to a payment in lieu of notice (“PILON”) if 
notice is served by us. In the normal course of events, the 
executive director would work their notice period. In the event 
of termination for cause (e.g. gross misconduct or negligence), 
neither notice nor PILON would be given and the executive 
director would cease to perform services immediately.
In the event of termination for reasons other than cause (for 
example, resignation) where the individual is requested by us to 
cease working before the end of the notice period, PILON may 
be payable. If a portion of the notice period is served, the PILON 
payment will be reduced on a pro rata basis. Payments may 
be made on a phased basis. Alternatively, rather than making a 
PILON, we may place an executive director on garden leave for 
the duration of some or all of their notice period.
Where an executive director leaves during a financial year, the 
annual bonus may be payable with respect to the period of the 
financial year worked although it will be pro rated for time and 
paid at the normal payment date.
Any share-based entitlements granted to an executive 
director under our share plans will be determined based 
on the relevant plan rules. The default treatment under the 
PSP is that any outstanding awards lapse on cessation of 
employment. However, in certain prescribed circumstances, 
such as death, ill-health, injury, disability, retirement, sale of 
the employing company or business outside the Group or any 
other circumstances at the discretion of the Remuneration 
Committee, ‘good leaver’ status may be applied. For good 
leavers, awards will normally vest on their normal vesting 
date, subject to the satisfaction of the relevant performance 
conditions at that time and will be reduced pro rata to reflect 
the proportion of the performance period actually served.  
However, in the event of the death of an executive director, 
the Remuneration Committee has discretion to determine that 
awards vest at cessation, subject to performance targets, with 
no service pro rata reduction. 
Payment may also be made in respect of accrued benefits, 
including untaken holiday entitlement.
In addition, as is consistent with market practice, we may  
pay a contribution towards an executive director’s legal fees  
for entering into a statutory agreement and may pay a 
contribution towards fees for outplacement services as part of a 
negotiated settlement.
There is no provision for additional compensation on  
termination following a change of control, nor liquidated 
damages of any kind.
Consideration of conditions elsewhere in 
our Company
The Remuneration Committee has oversight of the main 
compensation structures throughout the Group and actively 
considers the relationship between general changes to 
employee remuneration and executive director reward. When 
considering changes to executive director remuneration, 
the Remuneration Committee is provided with comparative 
employee information (for example, average salary review) 
across the Group.
The Remuneration Committee does not consider it appropriate 
to consult directly with employees when formulating executive 
director reward policy. However, it does take into account 
information provided by the Director of HR.

Summary of the Non-Executive Director Remuneration Policy
The Board aims to recruit high calibre non-executive directors with broad commercial, international or other relevant experience. The remuneration policy is as follows:
Element Base Salary
Purpose and link to strategy Fees are set at an appropriate level to attract and retain high calibre non-executive directors, and reflect the time commitment and responsibilities of 
each role and fees paid in other companies of a similar size, industry, global scope and complexity.
Operation Fees are normally reviewed annually.
Fees are normally paid in cash. 
Each non-executive director is paid a basic fee for undertaking non-executive director and Board duties. A higher fee is typically paid to the  
Chairman of the Board and the Senior Independent Director. Additional fees may also be payable for taking on Committee responsibilities and other 
Board duties.
Non-executive directors also receive staff discount on Superdry products.
Maximum opportunity As is the case for the executive directors, there is no prescribed maximum fee or maximum fee increase.
Performance measures Individual and business performance is taken into consideration when deciding fee levels.
When recruiting a new non-executive director, the remuneration arrangements offered will be consistent with the policy presented above.
Non-executive directors are appointed for an initial period of three years. This period may be renewed. Appointments may be terminated by either the Company or the non-executive director giving 
three months’ notice, or in the case of the Chairman, 12 months’ written notice. Save in respect of retirement by rotation, a non-executive director being removed from office will be entitled to 
compensation equal to the fee during any remaining notice period.

72 3.  Annual Report on Remuneration
The following part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report, 
together with the Annual Statement, will be subject to an 
advisory vote at the AGM to be held on 9 September 2015 
and sets out how the Directors’ Remuneration Policy will be 
implemented in 2016, and how it was implemented in 2015. 
This part of the report has been prepared in accordance with 
Part 3 of The Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups 
(Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) Regulations 2013 and 
9.8.8R of the Listing Rules. 
The following sections of the Annual Report and Accounts are 
identified as audited or unaudited as appropriate.
Implementation of the Remuneration Policy 
for 2016:
Base salary (audited)
Executive directors’ base salaries are normally reviewed 
annually, taking into account business and individual 
performance, salary levels at companies of a similar size, 
industry, global scope and complexity and the salaries paid to 
other employees across the Group. No changes have been 
made to base salary for existing executive directors. Current 
annual base salary levels are as follows:
From 
26 April 2015

2 Euan Sutherland was appointed to the Board as an executive director on 
22 October 2014.
3 Nick Wharton was appointed to the Board as an executive director on  
24 June 2015.
Benefits in kind and pension (audited)
Benefits will continue to include a biannual health assessment, 
private medical insurance (for the individual and their family), sick 
pay, holiday pay, life assurance, car allowance and staff discount 
on Superdry products. Other benefits may be provided where 
appropriate. We will continue to contribute no more than 15% of 
salary into the Group personal pension plan and/or in the form 
of a salary supplement.
Annual bonus (audited)
We will continue to operate an annual bonus plan for FY16 
based on the achievement of challenging financial metrics, 
business objectives and personal/strategic objectives. 
Specific targets will not be disclosed in advance as they are 
commercially confidential, but will be disclosed next year. The 
maximum bonus opportunity in FY16 will be 150% of base 
salary for the Chief Executive Officer and 100% of base salary 
for other executive directors.
Long-term incentives (audited)
The SuperGroup PSP enables us to incentivise and reward 
participants appropriately for contributing to the delivery of our 
strategic objectives and to provide an appropriate level of long-
term performance-related pay. 
For FY16, the grant for the Chief Executive Officer, Euan 
Sutherland, and the Chief Financial Officer, Nick Wharton, will be 
200% of salary. Although Julian Dunkerton and James Holder 
are eligible to participate in the PSP , the Committee believes that 
their significant shareholdings in the Company are sufficient to 
incentivise them and align interests with longer-term Company 
performance at the current time.
Consistent with the FY15 awards, performance for FY16 awards 
will be 70% based on sliding scale EPS and 30% based on TSR 
relative to a selected group of retailers as measured over the 
three year period ending the 2018 financial year end: 
•	 25% of the EPS-related component of the award will vest 
for average annual EPS growth of 8% p.a. increasing on a 
straight-line basis to 50% of the EPS-related component of 
the award vesting for average annual EPS growth of 10% 
p.a.; increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% vesting for 
EPS growth of at least 12% p.a.; and
•	 25% of the TSR-related component of the award will 
vest if the Company’s TSR is ranked at the median of a 
comparator group increasing on a straight-line basis to 100% 
vesting at the upper quartile of the group. The comparator 
group for the FY15 awards will comprise the companies 
listed in the following FTSE AllShare subsectors: Apparel 
Retailers, Broadline Retailers, Clothing and Accessories, 
Furnishings, Home Improvement Retailers, Recreational 
Products, Speciality Retailers and Toys at the start of the TSR 
performance period.
In addition to the TSR performance condition, the Remuneration 
Committee must also be satisfied that there has been an 
improvement in our underlying financial performance.

performance of a director’s duties in carrying out activities, such as travel to and from Company meetings, are classified as taxable benefits. In such cases, the Company will ensure that the director is not out of pocket by settling the 
related tax via the PAYE Settlement Agreement (PSA). In line with current regulations these taxable benefits have been disclosed and are shown in the taxable benefits column in the directors’ remuneration table above. The figures shown 
include the cost of the expenses grossed up for tax and National Insurance.
2 Susanne Given, Hans Schmitt and Shaun Wills participated in the Company’s Group personal pension plan under which the executive director contributes 5% of base salary and the Company contributes 7.5% of base salary.
3 Euan Sutherland received a Company contribution of 15% of base salary in the form of either pension contribution or cash allowance.
4 Susanne Given resigned as a director on 12 February 2015 and will leave the Company on 31 August 2015.

Governance. Annual bonus for the year ended 25 April 2015
For FY15 the maximum annual bonus opportunity was 150% of salary for the Chief Executive Officer (pro rated from appointment) and 100% of salary for the other executive directors. Reflecting that 
Euan Sutherland’s appointment was part-way through the financial year, his bonus arrangement was based two-thirds on profit-related targets and one-third on personal/strategic targets while the 
bonus arrangement for all other executive directors was based purely on profit-related targets. The performance against the targets was as follows:

Profit-related targets 100% of annual bonus for executive directors and ex Chief 
Executive Officer, 66.6% of Chief Executive Officer’s bonus

1 The profit-related targets for the 2015 financial year, against which the threshold target was not met, have not been disclosed as they are considered to be commercially confidential. They will be published in the FY16 Annual Report.
2 The personal/strategic targets agreed for Euan Sutherland were based on fostering a strong working relationship with the founders, developing a new trading plan and strategic framework, establishing improved communication throughout 
the senior management population and reviewing the structure of the leadership team. Following a review of the defined measures of success, the actual achievements and supporting evidence, the Committee was satisfied that each of 
the objectives was met in full.
Annual bonus for the year ended 26 April 2014
For FY14 the maximum annual bonus opportunity was 100% of salary for all executive directors (pro-rated from appointment where relevant).  Julian Dunkerton and James Holder chose to waive their 
bonus award. The performance against the targets was as follows:

Performance share plan
The PSP awards granted on 16 August 2012 was based on a three year performance period ended 25 April 2015. As disclosed in previous annual reports, the performance condition for these awards 
was as follows:

Membership and attendance
During the year ended 25 April 2015, the Remuneration Committee consisted of the following non-executive directors:
Keith Edelman 
Euan Sutherland (until October 2014) 
Minnow Powell 
Ken McCall
Executive directors attend Remuneration Committee meetings by invitation of the Committee, except where their own remuneration is being discussed. Euan Sutherland (Chief Executive Officer), 
Julian Dunkerton (former Chief Executive Officer), Shaun Wills (former Chief Financial Officer), Lindsay Beardsell (Group General Counsel) and Andrea Cartwright (Director of HR) attended Remuneration 
Committee meetings during the year under review and provided advice to assist the Committee.
Adviser to the Committee
During 2015 the Remuneration Committee received advice from New Bridge Street (“NBS”) (a trading name of AON plc) on senior executive remuneration and employee share schemes. Neither 
NBS nor AON plc provided other services to us during the year. NBS is a member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and complies with its code of conduct. The Remuneration Committee is 
comfortable that NBS’s advice remains objective and independent. For the year under review NBS’s total fees charged were £41,684.

84 Directors’ Report.
We present the Directors’ Report together with our audited 
Financial Statements (and those of our subsidiaries) (together 
the “Group”) for the financial year ended 25 April 2015. The 
Corporate Governance Report set out on pages 53 to 57 forms 
part of this Directors’ Report. We are UK domiciled but have a 
number of overseas subsidiaries and branches in Austria, Italy 
and Portugal. 
The Directors’ Report and Strategic Report comprise the 
‘management report’ for the purposes of the Financial Conduct 
Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules (DTR 4.1.8.R).
Please refer to pages 51 to 52 for a full list of the directors.
Results 
Our Financial Statements for the year are set out on pages 98 to 
146, which should be read in conjunction with the Finance Review.
Post balance sheet events
There have been no balance sheet events that either require 
adjustment to the Financial Statements or are important in the 
understanding of our current position other than those detailed 
in note 35 on page 146.
Approach to tax 
Our approach to tax matters is to comply with all relevant tax 
laws and regulations, whichever country we operate in, whilst 
effectively managing the overall tax burden. We will pay the 
right and fair amount of tax in each territory we trade from in 
accordance with the letter and spirit of local laws and regimes. 
We understand that taxes we pay to governments are an 
important source of revenue for them in providing a stable 
infrastructure and environment in which we operate. 
Our businesses operate in a growing number of countries, 
which leads to increasing complexity in our tax affairs, and it 
is well documented that tax authorities around the world are 
subjecting the tax affairs of large companies to ever-greater 
scrutiny. We look to manage our tax affairs in a manner to 
support business operations with the aim of ensuring that 
the tax consequences match the economic and commercial 
consequences of those operations. Naturally, we seek to ensure 
that the same profits are not taxed twice by different jurisdictions 
and that transactions between subsidiary and associate 
companies are conducted on an arm’s length basis and in line 
with our transfer pricing agreements. 
Where a tax rule, regulation or incentive exists that may convey 
a tax advantage to us, for example, using losses incurred in prior 
years, we will use that rule, regulation or incentive to support the 
businesses as permitted by local law.
We use the services of external, expert tax advisers to 
provide input into our tax affairs, such as the management 
of compliance in the UK and overseas jurisdictions and the 
impact of changes in tax legislation on us. During the year we 
undertook a tax tender and appointed Grant Thornton as our 
primary tax adviser.
T ax governance
Our tax strategy is determined by the Board of Directors as a 
sub-set of our overall business strategy and is overseen by the 
Audit Committee. Operational responsibility for the execution of 
the Group’s tax strategy rests with the Chief Financial Officer, 
who reports the Group’s tax position to the Audit Committee on 
a regular basis.
The Audit Committee considers tax risks that may arise as 
a result of business operations through the Group’s risk 
management framework. The consideration of such tax 
risks includes actions to mitigate the risks or to prevent their 
occurrence or recurrence.
As a clothing brand with international Retail and Wholesale 
operations, we naturally have a presence in some countries with 
lower tax rates than the UK. We also operate in a number of 
countries with much higher rates and all territories are chosen 
for their strategic importance to the growth of the business 
rather than their tax regimes. Importantly, we have full Retail and 
Wholesale trading businesses and we aim to pay appropriate 
taxes in all of the countries where we have a presence. 
Related party transactions 
Other than in respect of arrangements set out in note 5 to 
the Financial Statements and in relation to the employment 
of directors, details of which are provided in the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report on pages 64 to 84, there is no material 
indebtedness owed to or by us to any employee or any other 
person or entity considered to be a related party.
Details of related party transactions are set out in note 5 to the 
Financial Statements.
Share capital
Details of our issued share capital, together with details of 
movements in our issued share capital during the year, are 
shown in note 32 which is deemed to be part of this Directors’ 
Report. We have one class of ordinary shares, which carries no 
right to fixed income. Each share carries the right to one vote 
at our general meetings. The ordinary shares are listed on the 
Official List and traded on the London Stock Exchange. As at  
25 April 2015, we had 80,984,973 ordinary shares in issue.
Share capital, control and restriction on 
voting rights
As at 25 April 2015, our issued share capital was 80,984,973 
ordinary shares of five pence each in nominal value (the “issued 
share capital”). Details of our share capital are shown in note 
32 to the Financial Statements on page 143.
The rules about the appointment and replacement of directors 
are contained in our Articles of Association. Specific rules 
regarding the re-election of directors are referred to in the 
Corporate Governance Report on pages 53 to 57. Changes 
to the Articles of Association must be approved by our 
shareholders.
Powers relating to the issue and buy back of shares are 
included in our Articles of Association and such authorities are 
renewed by shareholders each year at the AGM.
Pursuant to the terms of an agreement entered into between us 
and Julian Dunkerton dated 12 March 2010 as amended on  
9 July 2014, Julian Dunkerton has undertaken to ensure that 
we are able to operate independently of him as a shareholder 
for as long as he and persons with whom he is acting in concert 
together hold not less than 30% of the voting rights attached to 
the ordinary shares. He is restricted from exercising his voting 
rights in certain circumstances, including the requisition of a 
general meeting to appoint or remove a director.

Our 
Governance. Share buy-backs
At the AGM in 2014, shareholders approved a resolution to 
grant the directors authority to repurchase a maximum number 
of 8,096,137 ordinary shares (representing 10% of our issued 
share capital as at 1 August 2014) as shares become available. 
During the reporting year to 25 April 2015, we did not purchase 
any of our own shares. We intend to renew this authority at 
the AGM in September 2015 in respect of 8,102,872 ordinary 
shares (again, representing 10% of our issued share capital  
as at 21 July 2015). Further details are set out in the notice of 
the AGM.
Share schemes
We have two types of share scheme: (i) a long-term incentive 
plan (or performance share plan) (“LTIP” or “PSP”); and (ii) a 
save as you earn scheme (“SAYE” or “Sharesave” scheme). 
All shares allotted under the PSP and SAYE schemes have the 
same rights as those already issued.
Directors’ share interests
The interests of the directors holding office at 25 April 2015 are 
shown in the Directors’ Remuneration Report on page 81. There 
were no changes to the beneficial interests of the directors 
between 25 April 2015 and 8 July 2015.
UK Corporate Governance Code
Our statement on corporate governance and compliance with 
the Code can be found in the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 53 to 57 and is incorporated by reference.
The T akeover Directive
The rights and obligations attached to the issued share capital 
are set out in the Articles of Association available on our website 
www.supergroup.co.uk. At the AGM in 2014, shareholders 
approved resolutions to allot shares up to an aggregate nominal 
value of £1,349,356 (representing one-third of our issued 
share capital as at 1 August 2014). It is intended to renew this 
authority at the AGM in September 2015 in respect of shares 
with a nominal value of £1,350,479 (again, representing one-
third of the issued share capital as at 21 July 2015).
The disapplication of pre-emption rights for cash issues 
of shares was approved at the AGM in 2014 in respect of 
ordinary shares with a nominal value of £202,403, representing 
approximately 5% of our issued share capital at that date. This 
disapplication will be renewed at the AGM in September 2015 
in respect of ordinary shares with a nominal value of £202,572 
(again representing approximately 5% of the issued share capital 
as at 21 July 2015).
Other relevant disclosure requirements from the Takeover 
Directive are included elsewhere in the Directors’ Report,  
the Corporate Governance Report, the Directors’  
Remuneration Report and the Notes to the Group and  
Company Financial Statements. 
There are no agreements in place between us and our 
employees or directors for compensation for loss of office or 
employment that trigger as a result of a takeover bid. 
Financial risk management
Please refer to note 31 of the accounts.
Legal and regulatory compliance
The legal team is responsible for identifying and carrying out 
assessments of those areas of the business where material 
legal and regulatory risks may be present. In the last year, the 
legal team (supported by external advisers where appropriate) 
reviewed our approach to franchise agreements and carried 
out training in anti-bribery and corruption, data protection and 
competition law. We have also further reviewed risks in relation 
to our intellectual property portfolio and implemented changes 
to ensure that our strategy to protect the Company’s intellectual 
property is robust. Where issues are identified, mitigating 
actions are built into an action plan involving the drafting and 
communication of policies and the delivery of training where 
appropriate, or are approached by way of a revision to key 
contractual terms. The Board receives regular reports on 
material litigation and the legal action taken to support our 
strategy, and the Audit Committee monitors progress against 
set compliance targets.
In order to ensure that our suppliers behave in a moral and 
ethical manner, we have in place a comprehensive supplier 
manual which includes contractual terms, codes of conduct 
and an ethical trading policy. Compliance with the manual is 
monitored by audits carried out in accordance with an agreed 
plan, and a report is presented to the Board annually. 
Whistleblowing hotlines are in place internationally and are 
managed through a third party provider. These cover all 
countries in which we operate. All matters arising from the 
use of the whistleblowing hotline are referred to the Company 
Secretarial team and investigated. The Audit Committee receives 
a summary of all matters arising through the whistleblowing 
hotline on a regular basis.
Health and safety 
We are committed to providing a safe place for employees 
to work and customers to shop. Our policies are reviewed 
on an ongoing basis to ensure that the approach to training, 
risk assessments, safe systems of working and accident 
management are appropriate. As part of this process, a rolling 
audit programme is in place to ensure that health, safety, 
environmental and security risks are stringently assessed and 
that robust control measures are in place to limit these risks. 
For further information, please refer to the Strategic Report on 
pages 1 to 49.
Greenhouse gas emissions 
We have measured our operational and wider carbon footprint 
for the past five years, providing insight into where the largest 
climate impacts are and to prioritise resources accordingly.
The Corporate Responsibility Report contains a table detailing 
our global greenhouse gas (carbon) emissions on page 35 and 
is incorporated into the Directors’ Report by reference. 
Disclosure of information to auditors
Each director who held office on the date of approval of this 
Directors’ Report confirms that, so far as he or she is aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors 
are unaware. Furthermore, each director has taken all the steps 
that he or she ought to have taken as a director to make him or 
herself aware of any relevant audit information and to establish 
that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.

86 Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual 
Report, the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the Financial 
Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. Under that law the directors 
have prepared the Group and parent Financial Statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. Under company 
law the directors must not approve the Financial Statements 
unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit 
or loss of the Group for that period. In preparing these Financial 
Statements, the directors are required to:
•	 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
•	 make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
•	 state whether IFRSs as adopted by the European Union and 
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in 
the Group and Company Financial Statements respectively; 
and
•	 prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the Financial Statements and the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report comply with the Companies Act 2006

Overview
  
  
Materiality
Audit scope
Areas
of focus
•	 Overall Group materiality: £3.2 million which represents 5% of underlying profit before tax.
•	 We conducted an audit of the complete financial information of three reporting units: DKH Retail 
Limited, C-Retail Limited and SuperGroup Plc due to their size and risk characteristics. 
•	 In addition, we conducted the statutory audits of three reporting units located in the UK such that 
the audit work was complete prior to finalisation of the Group financial statements, as well as some 
specific procedures in the US, which included attending physical inventory observations at the 
acquisition date.
•	 We also audited central activities, including the US business combination and goodwill impairment 
testing.
•	 US business combination, including classification of exceptional items arising from the business 
combination.
•	 Reallocation of goodwill between cash generating units.
•	 Inventory and accounts receivable provisions.
The scope of our audit and our areas of focus
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) (“ISAs (UK & Ireland)”).
We designed our audit by determining materiality and assessing the risks of material misstatement in the financial statements. In 
particular, we looked at where the directors made subjective judgements, for example in respect of significant accounting estimates 
that involved making assumptions and considering future events that are inherently uncertain. As in all of our audits  
we also addressed the risk of management override of internal controls, including evaluating whether there was evidence of bias by 
the directors that represented a risk of material misstatement due to fraud. 
The risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on our audit, including the allocation of our resources and effort, are 
identified as “areas of focus” in the table below. We have also set out how we tailored our audit to address these specific areas in 
order to provide an opinion on the financial statements as a whole, and any comments we make on the results of our procedures 
should be read in this context. This is not a complete list of all risks identified by our audit.

US business combination, including classification 
of exceptional items arising from the business 
combination 
Refer to the Audit Committee Report on page 60, the critical 
accounting estimates and judgements in note 2 to the accounts 
on page 111, and note 33 for the US business combination.
The US business combination with SD USA LLC (“SD USA”) 
included the termination of an existing licence agreement allowing 
SD USA exclusive rights to the Superdry brand in the USA, 
Canada and Mexico (“North America”), and the acquisition of the 
trade and certain assets from SD USA, comprising principally 
15 Superdry stores. The fair value of consideration paid for the 
acquisition of the trade and assets of SD USA and settlement of 
the pre-existing relationship was £22.5m, with £1.7m indemnity 
held in escrow for a period of up to one year.
Management used an external expert to prepare the models used 
to value both the pre-existing relationship and reacquired right 
(intangible asset). The principal matters that we focused on were:
T ermination of licence agreement
This existing licence was granted to SD USA in 2008 and was for 
a 30 year period, allowing exclusive rights to distribute Superdry 
products in North America. 
The termination of the licence agreement required judgement in 
relation to determining the gain/loss on settlement of the pre-
existing relationship. A model was prepared by management’s 
expert and the two key judgements involved in this valuation 
were:
1. determining the unfavourable contract terms with reference to 
current market terms; and
2. forecasting cash flows for the remaining 23 year licence 
period.
The unfavourable element of the terminated licence agreement 
was included as an exceptional item. This required judgement in 
determining if it met the Group accounting policy definition.
We read the relevant legal documentation for the business 
combination to understand each element of the transaction 
and whether it related to an identifiable asset or liability, 
or whether it was an item that should be included in the 
statement of comprehensive income. We found that each 
element of the transaction had been correctly classified.
We also agreed amounts paid by the Group to bank 
statements, and understood the terms of amounts held back 
in escrow to confirm they formed part of the consideration 
paid.
We assessed the competency of management’s external expert 
who prepared the valuation models for both the pre-existing 
relationship and reacquired right by evaluating the professional 
qualifications and reputation of the expert. We found them to be 
reputable and appropriately qualified. 
T ermination of licence agreement
We used our valuation knowledge to test the results of the 
expert’s model by understanding the appropriateness of 
the methodology used, benchmarking the discount rate to 
comparable organisations and data sources, benchmarking 
the growth rate to long-term economic forecasts for the US, 
re-performing the discounting of cash flows and testing for 
mathematical accuracy. We found the assumptions adopted 
and methodology applied by the expert to be acceptable 
consistent with our knowledge of the business.
We tested management’s assessment of unfavourable 
contract terms by considering recent and similar licence 
agreements for royalty rates to understand the amount 
by which the US licence was unfavourable, and found 
the conclusions reached to be reasonable based on this 
comparable information.
Cash flow forecasts used in the valuation model were agreed 
to Board approved papers for the first five years, and we 
understood and challenged assumptions in the forecasts such 
as phasing of forecast store openings and capital expenditure 
forecasts.
We considered the classification of the loss on the pre-existing 
relationship as exceptional, and determined that it met the 
Group accounting policy definition.

Acquisition of trade and assets
The acquisition of the trade and assets involved judgements in 
relation to the identification and valuation of assets and liabilities 
to be recognised. In particular:
•	 The valuation of the ‘re-acquired right’ intangible asset required 
judgement to determine the estimated future cash flows under 
the remaining licence period. 
•	 The valuation of inventory included judgement to determine the 
fair value with reference to the quality of that inventory based on 
management experience, current retail prices, costs of selling 
and average margins.
•	 The resulting bargain purchase recognised in the statement of 
comprehensive income is calculated as the difference between 
the fair value of identified assets and liabilities acquired and the 
fair value of consideration paid, less the amount attributed to 
the pre-existing relationship. 
Other exceptional items arising from the US acquisition primarily 
relate to onerous leases and fixed asset impairments. Judgement 
was required to determine whether the recognition criteria had 
been met at the balance sheet date, and whether these items met 
the Group’s accounting policy description for exceptional items.
Acquisition of trade and assets
•	 We checked and found that the cash flow forecasts used in 
the model were the same as those used in the pre-existing 
relationship model (as above).
We used our valuation knowledge to test the results of the 
expert’s model as described above. For the purpose of 
evaluating this specific item we benchmarked the discount 
rate to comparable organisations and data sources and 
the growth rate to long term economic forecasts for the 
US, re-performed the discounting of cash flows, assessing 
the appropriateness of contributory asset charges based 
on a reasonably expected return on the underlying asset, 
and tested for mathematical accuracy. We found the 
assumptions adopted and methodology applied by the 
expert to be consistent with our knowledge of the business.
•	 We evaluated the fair value ascribed to inventory by 
challenging management’s assessment of the quality of 
inventory by reference to the age of that inventory, agreeing 
margins by sales channel to recent actual experience. We 
also challenged judgements formed around costs to sell 
by reference to actual costs experienced in the same sales 
channels elsewhere in the Group. We found these to be 
appropriate.
•	 Having obtained audit evidence over the valuation of assets 
and liabilities acquired, we re-performed management’s 
calculation of the resulting bargain purchase recognised in 
the statement of comprehensive income. We considered the 
classification as exceptional, and determined that it met the 
Group accounting policy definition.
For onerous lease and asset impairment provisions included 
as exceptional we considered the classification of costs 
as exceptional and determined that they met the Group 
accounting policy. We also tested these costs by agreeing 
them to appropriate evidence to evaluate the onerous element 
of the lease and amounts by which fixed assets were impaired.

Reallocation of goodwill between cash generating units
Refer to the Audit Committee Report on page 60, the critical 
accounting estimates and judgements in note 2 to the accounts 
on page 111, and note 19 for goodwill.
Management has reassessed the cash generating units (“CGUs”) 
used in their goodwill impairment testing as a result of structural 
changes in the way in which the European business is operated. 
The structural changes include the movement of the wholesale 
operations from Belgium to the UK and the restructuring of key 
management personnel.
As a result, the goodwill that arose on the acquisition of 
SuperGroup Europe (“SGE”) in 2011 has been reallocated 
between two CGUs (being Retail and Wholesale) based on a 
three year historic average of retail and wholesale sales made 
by SGE. This allocation required judgement to determine the 
methodology upon which the allocation should take place.
We understood the rationale for reallocating goodwill between 
CGUs given the structural changes in the business, and 
determined it to be consistent with the accounting framework. 
We traced the three year historic revenue data used in the 
reallocation of goodwill between the Retail and Wholesale 
CGUs back to historical accounting records and found it to 
be accurate. We then recomputed the allocation of goodwill 
based on this data.
Inventory and accounts receivable provisions
Refer to the Audit Committee Report on page 60, the critical 
accounting estimates and judgements in note 2 to the accounts 
on page 111, note 22 for inventory and note 23 for accounts 
receivable.
The valuation of inventory involves judgement in recording 
provisions for slow moving or obsolete inventory. The Group 
accounting policy is based upon the ageing of inventory by 
season, with a percentage provision applied which reflects the 
actual historic rate of losses made. In addition, specific provisions 
are made for known product quality issues. This requires 
management judgement to assess the quality of product and the 
expected realisable value. 
Accounts receivable provisions involve judgement in determining 
the recoverability of receivables. Provisions are made for specific 
known issues such as counterparty risk.  
We evaluated the slow moving and obsolete inventory 
provision by testing the season ageing of inventory at the 
balance sheet date and then recalculating the provision 
required with reference to the Group policy. We also 
challenged the Group policy for provision rates by reference to 
historic evidence of selling inventory below cost and/or actual 
inventory write downs. We found that the provision rates were 
consistent with the evidence obtained as to past activity, and 
appropriately applied.
We evaluated the provision for accounts receivable balances 
by testing the ageing of amounts due at the balance sheet 
date to understand and quantify the potential risk in overdue 
balances. Recoverability was then tested by vouching cash 
receipts after the year end date. For amounts that were past 
due and not yet recovered we understood and challenged 
the provision requirements with reference to that customer’s 
historic payment performance, any credit insurance or bank 
guarantees in place, and the wider macro-economic situation. 
We found that the provisions recorded were consistent with 
the evidence obtained.

Strategic 
Report. How we tailored the audit scope
We tailored the scope of our audit to ensure that we performed enough work to be able to give an opinion on the financial 
statements as a whole, taking into account the geographic structure of the Group, the accounting processes and controls, and the 
industry in which the Group operates. 
The Group financial statements are a consolidation of a number of reporting units, comprising the Group’s operating businesses 
within three segments – Retail, Wholesale and Central Cost – plus its centralised functions.
In establishing the overall approach to the Group audit, we identified three reporting units: DKH Retail Limited, C-Retail Limited and 
SuperGroup Plc (the Company), which, in our view, required an audit of their complete financial information both due to their size 
and risk characteristics. These reporting units were audited by the Group engagement team. 
In addition, we also conducted the statutory audits of three non-significant reporting units located in the UK such that the audit work 
was complete prior to finalisation of the Group financial statements. The audits of three further reporting units located in Belgium 
were conducted by the PwC network firm in Belgium. We also conducted specified procedures on the acquired US business 
including attending physical inventory observations at the acquisition date.
The audits of these nine reporting units, together with additional procedures performed on centralised functions and at the Group 
level, including audit procedures over the consolidation and impairment testing and in respect of accounting matters arising in 
relation to the US acquisition, as described in our area of focus above, gave us the evidence we needed for our opinion on the 
Group financial statements as a whole. 
Materiality
The scope of our audit was influenced by our application of materiality. We set certain quantitative thresholds for materiality. These, 
together with qualitative considerations, helped us to determine the scope of our audit and the nature, timing and extent of our audit 
procedures and to evaluate the effect of misstatements, both individually and on the financial statements as a whole. 
Based on our professional judgement, we determined materiality for the financial statements as a whole as follows:
Overall Group materiality £3.2 million (2014: £3.0 million).
How we determined it 5% of underlying profit before tax.
Rationale for benchmark 
applied
We believe that underlying profit before tax is the key measure used by the shareholders as a 
body in assessing the Group’s performance. This benchmark, which excludes exceptional and 
remeasurement items, provides us with a consistent year on year basis for determining materiality by 
eliminating the non-recurring and/or disproportionate impact of these items.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to them misstatements identified during our audit above £0.1 million 
(2014: £0.1 million) as well as misstatements below that amount that, in our view, warranted reporting for qualitative reasons.

94 Going concern
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review the directors’ statement, set out on page 57, in relation to going concern. We 
have nothing to report having performed our review.
As noted in the directors’ statement, the directors have concluded that it is appropriate to prepare the financial statements using 
the going concern basis of accounting. The going concern basis presumes that the Group and Company have adequate resources 
to remain in operation, and that the directors intend them to do so, for at least one year from the date the financial statements were 
signed. As part of our audit we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis is appropriate.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, these statements are not a guarantee as to the Group’s and 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.

What an audit of financial statements involves
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable 
assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: 
•	 whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the Company’s circumstances and have been consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed; 
•	 the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the directors; and
•	 the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
We primarily focus our work in these areas by assessing the directors’ judgements against available evidence, forming our own 
judgements, and evaluating the disclosures in the financial statements.
We test and examine information, using sampling and other auditing techniques, to the extent we consider necessary to provide 
a reasonable basis for us to draw conclusions. We obtain audit evidence through testing the effectiveness of controls, substantive 
procedures or a combination of both. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with 
the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the Group 
and Company 
Financial Statements.
1. Principal accounting policies 
a) Basis of preparation
The financial statements of SuperGroup Plc (the ‘‘Company’’) and SuperGroup Plc and its subsidiary undertakings in the UK, 
Republic of Ireland, Belgium, France, Germany, Netherlands, Spain, Turkey, Scandinavia and United States as detailed in note 
20 (the ‘‘Group’’) have been prepared on a going concern basis under the historical cost convention as modified by fair values, in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) adopted for use in the European Union, and in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
The current period (“2015”) is for the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2015 (2014: 51 weeks and 6 days ended 26 April 2014 (“2014”)).
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates and requires 
management to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies (note 2).
The Group financial statements are presented in sterling and all values are rounded to the nearest hundred thousand except  
where indicated. 
b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidation of the subsidiaries acquired in advance of the Initial Public Offering in March 2010 (C-Retail Limited, DKH Retail 
Limited, SuperGroup Concessions Limited, SuperGroup International Limited, SuperGroup Internet Limited and SuperGroup Retail 
Ireland Limited) into the financial statements of SuperGroup Plc has been prepared under the principles of predecessor accounting, 
whereby an acquirer is not required to be identified, and all entities are included at their pre-combination carrying amounts. This 
accounting treatment leads to differences on consolidation between consideration and fair value of the underlying net assets and 
this difference is included within equity as a merger reserve. All subsequent business combinations are accounted for using the 
acquisition method of accounting (note 1c).
Subsidiaries are those entities in which the Group has power to govern the financial and operating policies so as to obtain economic 
benefits. The existence and effect of potential voting rights that are presently exercisable or convertible are considered when 
assessing whether the Group controls another entity. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired during the year are included in the Group statement of comprehensive income from the date on 
which control is transferred to the Group. Accounting policies of subsidiaries are changed when necessary to ensure consistency 
with the accounting policies adopted by the Group. 
Associates are all entities over which the Group has significant influence but not control, generally accompanying a shareholding of 
between 20% and 50% of the voting rights. Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. 
The Group’s share of post-acquisition profit or loss is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income with a corresponding 
adjustment to the carrying value amount of the investment. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds 
its interest in the associate, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred legal or constructive obligations or 
made payments on behalf of the associate. 
The Group determines at each reporting date whether there is any objective evidence that the investment in associate is impaired. 
If this is the case, the Group calculates the amount of impairment as the difference between the recoverable amount of the 
associate and its carrying value and recognises the amount adjacent to “share of profit or loss of investment” in the statement of 
comprehensive income. 
Intercompany transactions and balances are eliminated on consolidation.

104 Financial 
Statements.
1. Principal accounting policies (continued) 
c) Business combinations
The Group uses the acquisition method of accounting to account for business combinations of entities not under common control. 
The consideration transferred for the acquisition of a subsidiary is the fair values of the assets transferred, the liabilities incurred and 
the equity interests issued by the Group. The consideration transferred includes the fair value of any asset or liability resulting from a 
contingent consideration arrangement. Acquisition-related costs are expensed as incurred. Identifiable assets acquired and liabilities 
and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair values at the acquisition date. 
On an acquisition-by-acquisition basis, the Group recognises any non-controlling interest in the acquiree either at fair value or at the 
non-controlling interest’s proportionate share of the acquiree’s net assets. Investments in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less 
impairment. Cost is adjusted to reflect changes in consideration arising from contingent consideration amendments. The excess of 
the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the acquisition-date fair value of any 
previous equity interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifiable net assets acquired is recorded 
as goodwill. If this is less than the fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired in the case of a bargain purchase, the 
difference is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income. 
d) Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial information is presented in pounds sterling, which is the Company’s functional and the Group’s 
presentation currency. 
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate ruling at the date of the transaction. 
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currency are translated at the rates ruling at the balance sheet date. Resulting 
exchange gains and losses are recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income. 
Upon consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the 
balance sheet date. Income and expense items of foreign operations are translated at the actual rate or average rate if not materially 
different. Differences on translation are recognised in other comprehensive income. 
e) Revenue recognition
Revenue is measured at the fair value of the consideration received, or receivable, and represents amounts receivable for goods 
supplied, stated net of discounts, returns and value added taxes. 
The Group recognises revenue when the amount of revenue can be reliably measured, it is probable that future economic benefits 
will flow to the entity and when specific criteria have been met for each of the Group’s activities, as described below. The Group 
bases its estimate of returns on historical results, taking into consideration the type of customer, the type of transaction and the 
specifics of each arrangement. 
Standalone store revenue 
Standalone store revenue from the provision of sale of goods is recognised at the point of sale of a product to the customer. 
Standalone store sales are settled in cash or by credit or payment card. It is the Group’s policy to sell its products to the customer 
with a right to exchange within 28 days. 
Concession revenue 
Concession revenues from the provision of sale of goods are recognised gross at the point of sale of a product to the customer. 
Concession revenues are settled in cash, by the concession grantors net of commissions or other fees payable. It is the 
concessions’ policy to sell its products with a right to exchange within 28 days and a cash refund within 14 days. Provisions are 
made for concession returns based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate of returns.

1. Principal accounting policies (continued) 
Internet revenue 
Revenue from the provision of the sale of goods on the internet is recognised at the point that the risks and rewards of the inventory 
have passed to the customer, which is the point of delivery. Transactions are settled by credit card, payment card or PayPal. 
Provisions are made for internet credit notes based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical rate 
of returns. 
Wholesale revenue 
Wholesale revenues from the sale of goods are recognised at the point that the risks and rewards of the inventory have passed 
to the customer, which depends on the specific terms and conditions of sales transactions and which are typically upon either 
dispatch or delivery. Revenues are settled in cash, net of discounts. 
Provisions are made for Wholesale credit notes based on the expected level of returns, which in turn is based upon the historical 
rate of returns. 
f) Other income
Other income primarily relates to proceeds from legal claims and royalty income. Royalty income is recognised on an accruals basis 
in accordance with the substance of the Wholesale royalty agreements. 
g) Finance income
Finance income comprises interest receivable on funds invested. Finance income is recognised in the Group statement of 
comprehensive income using the effective interest method. 
h) Finance expenses
Finance expenses comprise interest payable on interest-bearing loans and borrowings. Finance expenses are recognised  
in the Group statement of comprehensive income using the effective interest method. 
i) Leasing and similar commitments
Leases are accounted for as operating leases as the risks and rewards of ownership are retained by the lessor and the rental 
charges are charged to the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the life of the lease. 
Lease incentives are received in the form of cash contributions and rent-free periods and are considered financing activities for the 
purposes of the cash flow statement, as they are the same as financing from landlords to fund store fit-outs. 
Cash contributions 
Cash contributions from landlords for store fit-outs are initially recognised as a deferred income liability in the balance sheet at 
the point the recognition criteria in the lease are met, and credited to selling, general and administrative expenses in the Group 
statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease commencing from opening date. Cash 
contributions are not discounted.
Rent-free periods 
A deferred income liability is built up on the balance sheet during the rent-free period, which is then credited to the Group statement 
of comprehensive income over the life of the lease. The effect is to recognise a reduction in selling, general and administrative 
expenses on a straight-line basis over the longer of the term of the lease, or from property access date to the end of the lease. 
Rent-free periods are not discounted.

1. Principal accounting policies (continued) 
Lease premiums
Lease premiums paid to landlords are initially recognised as a prepayment, and lease premiums paid to previous tenants are initially 
recognised as an intangible asset, in the balance sheet, at the point the recognition criteria in the lease are met, and debited to 
selling, general and administrative expenses in the Group statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the term 
of the lease commencing from opening date.
j) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less accumulated depreciation. Cost includes the original purchase price 
and the costs attributable to bringing the asset into its working condition but excludes interest. Gains and losses on disposals 
are determined by comparing the proceeds received with the carrying amount and are recognised in the Group statement of 
comprehensive income.
Depreciation is provided at rates calculated to write down the cost of the assets, less their estimated residual values, over their 
remaining useful economic lives as follows: 
Freehold buildings – 50 years on a straight-line basis
Leasehold improvements – 5 – 10 years on a straight-line basis
Furniture, fixtures and fittings – 5 – 10 years on a straight-line basis
Computer equipment – 3 – 5 years on a straight-line basis
Land is not depreciated. Residual values and useful economic lives are reviewed annually and adjusted if appropriate. 
k) Impairment
The carrying values of non-financial assets are tested annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any 
such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated. Where the asset does not generate cash flows which 
are independent from other assets, the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit (“CGU”) to which the asset belongs is 
estimated. 
The recoverable amount of a non-financial asset is the higher of its fair value less costs to sell, and its value in use. Value in use is 
the present value of the future cash flows expected to be derived from an asset or CGU. 
An impairment loss is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income whenever the carrying amount of an asset or 
CGU exceeds its recoverable amount. An impairment loss in a subsidiary consolidated under predecessor accounting (note 1b) 
is recognised as a movement in the merger reserve and retained earnings in addition to recognising a loss on the statement of 
comprehensive income.

1. Principal accounting policies (continued) 
l) Intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately from a business are recognised initially at cost. An intangible asset acquired as part of a 
business combination is recognised outside goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or other legal rights and its 
fair value can be measured reliably. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses. Intangible assets with a finite life have no residual value and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their 
expected useful lives as follows: 
Trademarks –  10 years
Website and software –  5 years
Lease premiums – Over the life of the lease on a straight-line basis
Distribution agreements –  6 to 23 years
Trademark costs comprise the external cost of registration and associated legal costs. Website and software costs consist 
primarily of externally incurred development costs. Lease premiums comprise the amount paid to the previous tenant to acquire 
the lease. Distribution agreements comprise the fair value, at date of acquisition, of distribution agreements acquired as part of a 
business combination. Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
net identifiable assets of the acquired subsidiary at the date of acquisition. Goodwill on acquisitions of subsidiaries is included in 
“intangible assets”. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. Impairment 
losses on goodwill are not reversed. 
m) Investments
Investments in subsidiaries are recorded at historical cost, less any provision for impairment. 
Investments in associates are accounted for using the equity method of accounting. Under the equity method, the investment is 
initially recorded at cost, and the carrying amount is increased or decreased to recognise the investor’s share of the profit or loss of 
the investee after the date of acquisition. The Group’s investment in associate includes goodwill identified on acquisition. 
n) Derivative financial instruments and hedging activities
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at their fair value and re-measured at fair value at each period end. Derivative 
financial instruments are categorised as held for trading. The gain or loss on re-measurement to fair value is recognised immediately 
in the Group statement of comprehensive income. The Group has not applied hedge accounting. 
Foreign forward exchange derivative gains and losses are recognised in other gains and losses (net).
o) Inventories
Inventories are valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost comprises costs associated with the purchase and bringing 
of inventories to the distribution centres and is based on the weighted average principle. Provisions are made for obsolescence,  
mark-downs and shrinkage. 
p) Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised at original invoice amount less impairment losses. A provision for the impairment of trade 
receivables is established when there is objective evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due, according 
to the original terms. Significant financial difficulties of the customer, probability that the customer will enter bankruptcy or financial 
reorganisation and default or delinquency in payments are considered indicators that the trade receivable may be impaired. The 
movement in the provision is recognised in the Group statement of comprehensive income.
q) Other financial assets
Other financial current assets are cash investments with a maturity date of greater than three months and are measured at cost.
SUPERGROUP PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2015

108 Financial 
Statements.
1. Principal accounting policies (continued)
r) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and short-term deposits comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity date of three 
months or less. Bank overdrafts are offset against cash when a right of offset exists and the Group intends to use this right of offset. 
For the purpose of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short-term deposits, less overdrafts, 
which are repayable on demand. 
s) Borrowings
Borrowings are initially recorded at fair value net of transaction costs, including facility fees incurred, and subsequently measured at 
amortised cost using the effective interest method. Where a loan is obtained at interest rates different from market rates, the loan is  
re-measured at origination to its fair value, which is calculated as future interest payments and principal repayments discounted 
at market interest rates for similar loans. Subsequently, the carrying amount of the borrowings is adjusted for amortisation of the 
origination gain or loss, and the amortisation is recorded as finance income/cost using the effective interest yield method on the 
asset/liability. 
Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for at 
least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
t) Provisions and contingent liabilities
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, it is more likely than not that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation and the obligation can be 
estimated reliably. Provisions are discounted if the impact on the provision is deemed to be material. 
u) Employee benefit obligations
The Group operates a defined contribution pension scheme for the benefit of its employees. The Group pays contributions into an 
independently administered fund via a salary sacrifice arrangement. The costs to the Group of providing these benefits are recognised 
in the Group statement of comprehensive income and comprise the amount of contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the 
year.
Payroll expense and related contributions 
Wages, salaries, payroll tax, paid annual leave and sick leave, bonuses, and non-monetary benefits are accrued in the year in which 
the associated services are rendered by employees of the Group. 
v) Share based payments
The Group operates an equity settled share based compensation plan. The fair value of the shares under such plans is recognised 
as an expense in the Group statement of comprehensive income. Fair value is determined using the Black–Scholes Option Pricing 
Model. The amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference to the fair value of share incentives excluding 
the impact of any non-market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are considered as part of the assumptions about 
the number of share incentives that are expected to vest. At each balance sheet date, the Group revises its estimates of the number 
of share incentives that are expected to vest. The impact of the revision on original estimates, if any, is recognised in the Group 
statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding adjustment to equity over the remaining vesting period. 
w) Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables, excluding lease incentives (see note 1i), are non-interest bearing and are initially recognised at their fair 
value which approximates book value. Trade and other payables are derecognised when the contractual obligations to the cash 
flows from the liability expire or are transferred.

x) Taxation 
The policy for current and deferred income tax, when relevant, is as follows: 
•	 tax on the profit or loss for the period will comprise current and deferred income tax;
•	 current income tax expense is calculated using the tax rates which have been enacted or substantively enacted at the balance 
sheet date, and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years; 
•	 deferred income tax is provided using the balance sheet liability method, providing for temporary differences between the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts used for taxation purposes; 
•	 the amount of deferred income tax provided is based on the expected realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets 
and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date;
•	 a deferred income tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against 
which the asset can be utilised. Deferred income tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that the related 
tax benefit will be realised; and
•	 deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current income tax assets 
against current income tax liabilities and when the deferred income tax assets and liabilities relate to income taxes levied by 
the same taxation authority on either the same taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is an intention to settle the 
balances on a net basis. 
y) Dividends
Dividends are recognised as a liability and deducted from equity at the balance sheet date only if they have been approved before or 
on the balance sheet date. Dividends are disclosed when they have been proposed before the balance sheet date or proposed or 
declared after the balance sheet date but before the financial statements are approved for issue by the directors. 
z) Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity, as a 
deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. 
aa) Retained earnings 
The retained earnings reflect the accumulated profits and losses of the Group. 
ab) Merger reserve, non-controlling interests and other reserves
The merger reserve arose on the Group restructuring in March 2010 and represents the differences on consolidation arising on the 
adoption of predecessor accounting. This comprises the difference between consideration paid and the book value of net assets 
acquired in the transaction less any impairment. Non-controlling interests relate to business arrangements in which SuperGroup has 
less than a 100% share. Other reserves arose on the business combination occurring in Germany regarding former KuH stores. The 
translation reserve arises on the movement of closing exchange rates between each balance sheet date.
ac) Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision-Maker. 
The Chief Operating Decision-Maker, which is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identified as the executive Board.

ad) Cost of sales
Cost of sales comprises movements between opening and closing inventories, purchases, carriage in, commissions payable, and 
other related expenses.
ae) Exceptional items
Items that are both material in size and unusual or infrequent in nature, are disclosed separately as exceptional items in the Group 
statement of comprehensive income. 
The separate reporting of exceptional items, which are presented as exceptional within the relevant category in the Group statement 
of comprehensive income, helps to provide an indication of the Group’s underlying business performance. The principal items which 
may be included as exceptional items are: 
•	 significant profit/(loss) on the disposal of non-current assets;
•	 impairment of property, plant and equipment;
•	 impairment of intangible assets;
•	 impact on deferred income tax for changes in tax rates; and
•	 the costs and benefits associated with significant corporate, financial or operational restructuring, including acquisitions. 
2. Critical accounting estimates and judgements in applying accounting policies
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS as adopted by the EU requires management to make judgements, 
estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and 
expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other factors that are 
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying 
values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates. The 
judgements, estimates and assumptions which have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amount of 
assets and liabilities are discussed below. 
a) Acquisition accounting 
In accounting for business combinations, the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired have to be measured 
at their fair values. In particular, some judgement is required in estimating the fair value of inventory with reference to current selling 
prices and costs to sell, and judgement in estimating the valuation of intangible assets and pre-existing relationships with reference 
to forecast future sales under the pre-existing contract. Details concerning acquisitions and business combinations are outlined in 
note 33. 
b) Exceptional items 
Judgements are required as to whether items that are both material in size and unusual or infrequent in nature should be disclosed 
as exceptional. Details of these items categorised as exceptional are outlined in note 13.
c) Reallocation of goodwill
The Group has reallocated goodwill across the cash generating units which requires judgement on the allocation basis. 
Further details of the key assumptions are included in more detail in note 19.

(continued)
d) Provisions
The Group has recognised provisions for impairment of inventories, impairment of trade receivables, post year end credit notes and 
returns in respect of revenue, employee bonuses, dilapidations, onerous leases and income tax in its financial statements which 
requires management to make judgements. The judgements, estimates and associated assumptions necessary to calculate these 
provisions are based on historical experience and other reasonable factors.
3. New accounting pronouncements
The following new or recent standards, interpretations and amendments to standards have been adopted by the Group where 
appropriate or applicable to the Group for the financial year beginning 27 April 2014:
•	 There were no new standards, interpretations or amendments to standards that are effective to the Group for the financial year 
beginning 27 April 2014 that have a material impact.  
•	 IAS 36 (Amended), ‘Impairment of assets’ removed certain disclosures of the recoverable amount of CGUs which had been 
included by the issue of IFRS 13.
New standards and interpretations issued but not yet effective:
At the balance sheet date there are a number of new standards and amendments to existing standards in issue but not yet effective 
including IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’ which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2017 and 
IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’, which is effective for periods beginning on or after 1 January 2018. The Group has not early adopted 
any of these new standards or amendments to existing standards. The Group is currently assessing the impact of IFRS 9 and IFRS 
15. There are no other new standards, amendments to existing standards or interpretations that are not yet effective that would be 
expected to have a material impact on the Group.
4. Segment information
The Group’s operating segments under IFRS 8 have been determined based on the reports reviewed by the Group’s Chief 
Operating Decision-Maker (Executive Committee members: “the CODM”). The CODM assesses the performance of the operating 
segments based on profit before income tax, before inter-segment royalties. The CODM considers the business from a customer 
perspective only, being Retail and Wholesale. The CODM reviews the balance sheet at a Group level. No separate balance sheet 
measures are provided between the Retail and Wholesale segments.
The CODM receives information, reviews the performance of the business, allocates resources and approves budgets for two 
operating segments, and therefore information is disclosed in respect of the following two segments:
•	 Retail – principal activities comprise the operation of UK, Republic of Ireland, European and USA stores, concessions and all 
internet sites. Revenue is derived from the sale to individual consumers of own brand and third party clothing, footwear and 
accessories.
•	 Wholesale – principal activities comprise the ownership of brands, wholesale distribution of own brand products (clothing, 
footwear and accessories) worldwide and trade sales.
Segment results and assets include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable 
basis. The Group reports and manages central functions separately to the Retail and Wholesale operations, which includes design, 
finance, HR, IT, legal, marketing, merchandising, property, sourcing and the goodwill and intangibles arising on consolidation.

contingent share consideration and financial derivatives), exceptional items and, when appropriate, the related income tax. The directors believe that the underlying 
results provide additional guidance to statutory measures to help understand the performance of the Group. Further details of the adjustments are included in note 
13. All references to underlying are after making these adjustments. Retail and Wholesale segments are presented before inter-segment royalties.

the exercise or vesting date subject to the discretionary powers of the Remuneration Committee.
Performance Share Plan
The award of shares is made under the SuperGroup Performance Share Plan (“PSP”). Shares have no value to the participant at the 
grant date, but subject to the satisfaction of earnings per share, share price and total shareholder return performance targets can 
convert and give participants the right to be granted nil-cost shares at the end of the performance period.
The movement in the number of share awards outstanding is as follows:
 
Group & Company

the performance targets, totals £2.1m. 
A credit of £0.8m (2014: charge of £1.1m) has been recorded in the Group statement of comprehensive income during the year.

13. Re-measurements and exceptional adjustments (continued)
Re-measurements
a) Fair value re-measurement of deferred share consideration
The SuperGroup Europe BVBA acquisition in February 2011 included two tranches of deferred contingent share consideration to 
be issued on the second and third anniversaries of the acquisition. The consideration was payable in shares, and the shares were 
issued in proportion to the percentage completion of certain sales and store number targets. The fair value of these shares at the 
acquisition date was £10.3m.
IFRS 3 (revised) requires deferred contingent share consideration to be re-measured at each period end to reflect the estimated 
percentage completion of the targets and change in share price. The share price movement from £7.36 at April 2013 to £16.10 in 
February 2014, the date the shares were issued on the third anniversary of the acquisition, increased the liability by £4.0m.
b) Unrealised loss/gain on financial derivatives
Unrealised loss/gain on derivatives is recognised as a re-measurement. 
Exceptional items
aa) Buy-out of USA licence and business combination costs
On 25 March 2015 the Group completed a business combination (see note 33) in the USA including the acquisition of trade and assets 
of 15 Superdry branded stores. As part of the business combination a payment was made to terminate the license rights to distribute the 
Superdry products in North America for £12.4m. The consideration paid for assets acquired was lower than the assumed provisional fair 
value of those assets resulting in a £1.0m gain. A post-acquisition review of the current and forecast trading performance, and assets of 
the stores resulted in an onerous lease provision charge of £1.8m, an impairment of assets of £1.1m. In addition £0.6m of other related 
costs, including professional fees, were incurred prior to acquisition.
ab) Buy-out of Spanish and UK agents
£0.8m of the deferred contingent consideration and accrued costs for the buy-out of the Spanish and UK agents in 2014 has been 
released as the amount is no longer deemed payable given that the contingent criteria were not met.
ac) Restructuring 
During the period restructuring and redundancy costs totalled £2.7m (2014: £nil). These costs relate to a strategic realignment of 
management responsibilities.
ad) Acquisition of SMAC
On 27 June 2014 the Group completed a business combination (see note 33) and acquisition costs of £0.3m were incurred.
ae) Set-up costs regarding the Retail distribution centre
On 15 April 2013 the Group announced that the Gloucester retail and e-commerce distribution centres would close and the 
activities be moved to a site in Burton-upon-Trent. In 2014 £3.4m of set-up and dual running costs and write-off of assets was 
recognised.

Closing net deferred income tax (note 21) (26.9) (28.8)
Included within note 13 is an exceptional tax credit of £0.6m (2014: £4.3m), of which £0.1m (2014: £3.7m) relates to the impact 
of the tax rate change on goodwill and intangibles and a tax credit of £0.8m (2014 £nil) relates to the recognition of a deferred 
tax asset following agreement with the Irish Revenue on the relief for Intellectual Property created as part of the March 2010 
reorganisation. The remainder of £0.1m tax charge (2014: £0.6m) is included within other movements such as accelerated capital 
allowances and temporary differences. 
The Group’s income tax expense on underlying profit of £14.8m represents an effective tax rate of 23.4% for the period ended 
25 April 2015. The Group’s underlying effective tax rate of 23.4% is higher than the statutory rate of 20.9%, primarily due to 
depreciation of non-qualifying assets and non-allowable expenses.
15. Loss attributable to SuperGroup Plc 
The after tax loss for the 52 weeks ended 25 April 2015 for the Company was £2.5m (51 weeks and 6 days ended 26 April

and a credit to equity reserves of £nil m (2014: £0.5m) in respect of deferred tax. The directors have approved the statement of 
comprehensive income for the Company.

Impairment
An impairment test is a comparison of the carrying value of assets of a business or cash-generating unit (CGU) to their recoverable 
amount. The Group has defined its CGUs as Retail and Wholesale. Where the recoverable amount is less than the carrying value, an 
impairment results. During the year, the goodwill on the acquisition of SuperGroup Europe BVBA; SMAC (SMAC A/S, SMAC Norge 
A/S and SMAC Retail A/S); and German business combination was tested for impairment, with no impairment charges resulting.
Following a change in the Group’s management and financial reporting structure, the Group changed its method of allocation of 
goodwill, and goodwill of £20.0m was allocated between the Group’s CGUs, Retail and Wholesale, based on the last 3 years’ actual 
sales achieved by each CGU. This led to an allocation of £15m and £5m of goodwill to the retail and wholesale CGUs respectively. 
The recoverable amounts in 2015 were measured based on post tax value in use (2014: based on post tax value in use). This 
methodology is considered reasonable given the significant levels of headroom noted from this assessment. Detailed forecasts for 
the next five years have been used which are based on approved annual budgets and strategic projections representing the best 
estimate of future performance.

19. Intangible assets (continued)
Key assumptions
In determining the recoverable amount it is necessary to make a series of assumptions to estimate the present value of future cash 
flows. In each case, these key assumptions have been made by management reflecting past experience and are consistent with 
relevant external sources of information.
Discount rates
Discount rates are derived from the Group’s post tax weighted average cost of capital of 10.5%.  The pre-tax weighted cost of 
capital is 13.6%.
Operating cash flows
The main assumptions, which are derived from past experience and external information, within the forecast operating cash flows 
include the achievement of future sales prices, volumes, raw material input costs and the level of ongoing capital expenditure. 
Long-term growth rates
To forecast beyond the five years, a long-term average growth rate of 2% has been used; this is not greater than the average long-
term retail growth rate for each CGU.
Goodwill sensitivity analysis 
The results of the Group’s impairment tests are dependent on estimates and judgements made by management, particularly in 
relation to the key assumptions described above. A sensitivity analysis as to potential changes in key assumptions has therefore 
been performed.  
The present values of the future cashflows of the Retail and Wholesale CGUs are significant and are insensitive to any changes to 
potential changes to key assumptions.

Laundry Athletics LLP , which transferred its trade to DKH Retail Limited, is currently involved in a dispute between two of its 
manufacturers in Turkey over the use of an export company (Gisad Dis Ticaret (‘‘Gisad’’)). The manufacturers had used Gisad to 
reclaim Turkish VAT on its behalf. Gisad has a €100m loan facility with Morgan Stanley International (Morgan Stanley) with an Export 
Receivables Assignment Agreement as security. This loan was called in during January 2009. The Group has retained a liability for 
the disputed sums. The total in dispute is £1.9m which has been withheld and remains as a liability within trade payables in the 
Group balance sheet.

31. Financial risk management
The Company and Group’s activities expose it to a variety of financial risks including: market risk (including foreign currency risk 
and cash flow interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the 
unpredictability of financial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s financial performance. The 
Group uses derivative financial instruments to hedge certain foreign exchange exposures. 
Credit risk
Credit risk is managed on a Group basis except for credit risk relating to accounts receivable balances which each entity is 
responsible for managing. Credit risk arises from cash and cash equivalents, as well as credit exposures to Wholesale and to 
a lesser extent Retail customers, including outstanding receivables and committed transactions. For Wholesale customers, 
management assesses the credit quality of the customer, taking into account its financial position, past experience and other 
factors. The Group mitigates risk on in certain markets or customers considered higher risk with payments in advance, accelerated 
and bank guarantees, as well as adopting credit insurance where appropriate. Sales to Retail customers are settled in cash, major 
credit cards or by PayPal. The Group regularly monitors its exposure to bad debts in order to minimise exposure. Credit risk from 
cash and cash equivalents is managed via banking with well-established banks with a strong credit rating.

31. Financial risk management (continued) 
Foreign currency risk 
The Group’s foreign currency exposure arises from: 
•	 transactions (sales/purchases) denominated in foreign currencies;
•	 monetary items (mainly cash receivables and borrowings) denominated in foreign currencies; and
•	 investments in foreign operations, whose net assets are exposed to foreign currency translation.
The Group is mainly exposed to US dollar and euro currency risks. The exposure to foreign exchange risk within each company is 
monitored and managed at Group level. The Group’s policy is to economic hedge a portion of foreign exchange risk associated with 
forecast overseas transactions, and transactions and monetary items denominated in foreign currencies. 
The Group’s policy is to hedge the risk of changes in the relevant spot exchange rate. The Group uses forward contracts to hedge 
foreign exchange risk. As at 25 April 2015 and 26 April 2014, the Group had entered into a number of foreign exchange forward 
contracts to hedge part of the aforementioned translation risk. Any remaining amount remains unhedged.
Forward exchange contracts have not been formally designated as hedges and consequently no hedge accounting has been 
applied. Forward exchange contracts are carried at fair value. Currency exposure arising from the net assets of the Group’s foreign 
operations are not hedged. 
At 25 April 2015 if the currency had weakened/strengthened by 10% against both the US dollar and Euro with all other variables 
held constant, profit for the period would have been £2.7m (2014: £2.0m) higher/lower, mainly as a result of foreign exchange gains/
losses on translation of US dollar/euro trade receivables, cash and cash equivalents, and trade payables. The figure of 10% used for 
sensitivity analysis has been chosen because it represents a range of reasonably probable fluctuations in exchange rates.
The Group’s foreign currency exposure is as follows:

Net exposure 11.3 18.3 0.4 19.8
The US dollar and euro overdrafts form part of an offset arrangement and as such each currency is netted off against other cash 
balances in the same currency and is not recognised as an overdraft in its own right.

31. Financial risk management (continued)
Cash flow interest rate risk 
The Group has financial assets and liabilities which are exposed to changes in market interest rates. Changes in interest rates 
impact primarily on deposits, loans and borrowings by changing their future cash flows (variable rate). Management does not 
currently have a formal policy of determining how much of the Group’s exposure should be at fixed or variable rates and the Group 
does not use hedging instruments to minimise its exposure. However, at the time of taking new loans or borrowings, management 
uses its judgement to determine whether it believes that a fixed or variable rate would be more favourable for the Group over the 
expected period until maturity. Sensitivity analysis has not been provided due to the low level of loans and borrowings within the 
Group. The Group’s significant interest-bearing assets and liabilities are disclosed in notes 24 and 25. 
Liquidity risk 
Cash flow forecasting is performed on a Group basis by the monitoring of rolling forecasts of the Group’s liquidity requirements to 
ensure that it has sufficient cash to meet operational needs. The maturity profile of the Group’s liabilities is analysed in notes 25  
and 26.

The level 2 forward foreign exchange valuations are derived from mark-to-market valuations based on observable market data as at 
the close of business on 25 April 2015. 
Fair value gains of £13.4m (2014: losses of £3.7m) relating to the movement on open forward foreign exchange contracts have 
been recognised in other gains and losses.
The notional principal amount of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 25 April 2015 was £141.1m (2014: 
£122.8m).
Fair value movements show: 
(a)  the amount of change, during the period and cumulatively, in the fair value of the financial liability/asset that is attributable to 
changes in the credit risk of that liability; 
(b)  the difference between the financial liability’s/asset’s carrying amount and the amount the entity would be contractually required 
to pay at maturity to the holder of the obligation; 
(c) the methods used to arrive at the above amounts; and 
(d)  if the entity believes that the disclosure given to comply with the above does not faithfully represent the change in the fair value 
of the financial liability attributable to changes in its credit risk, should disclosed the reasons for reaching this conclusion and the 
factors is believes are relevant.

The full fair value of a derivative is classified as a non-current asset or liability where the remaining maturity of the derivative is more 
than 12 months and as a current asset or liability, if the maturity of the derivative is less than 12 months. 
Capital risk management 
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard its ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders, and benefits for other stakeholders, and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. 
Consistent with others in the industry, the Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This ratio is calculated as net 
debt divided by total capital employed. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings (including “current and non-current borrowings” as 
shown in the consolidated balance sheet) less cash and cash equivalents. Total capital employed is calculated as “equity” as shown 
in the consolidated balance sheet plus net debt. The Group is in a net cash position at 25 April 2015. 
The directors have concluded that the Company is best served by retaining current cash reserves to support growth. 
Consequentially, a recommendation will be made to the AGM that no dividend is payable for 2015 (2014: £nil).
The Directors recently announced the intention to commence the payment of ordinary dividends with an interim dividend payment in 
FY16. The Directors will also consider one-off returns to shareholders where excess capital has not been deployed.

33. Business combinations
SMAC
On 27 June 2014 the Group acquired the share capital of its long-term distributor, the SMAC A/S, SMAC Norge A/S and SMAC 
Retail A/S former distributors in Denmark, Finland and Norway. As part of the transaction the pre-existing distributor agreement 
between the Group and SMAC A/S was terminated in order that the Group would take back control of these territories. 
The transaction will allow the Group to benefit from improved wholesale margins, accelerate the roll-out of stores by investing its 
own capital, and retain the local operational and management expertise.
Supergroup paid a total of £3.8m in consideration by cash funding. Cash paid by SuperGroup Plc on acquisition was £3.0m and 
deferred consideration payable within one year was £0.8m which remains unpaid as at 25 April 2015.
The provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows:
SMAC
(£m)
Intangible assets 2.0
Property, plant and equipment 0.5
Inventories 1.1
Trade and other receivables 1.4
Trade and other payables (1.5)
Provision for deferred tax (0.5)
Total fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 3.0
Goodwill/(non-distributable reserve) arising on acquisition 0.8
Total consideration 3.8
  
Intangible assets relate to the reacquired rights to the territories in Denmark, Finland, and Norway. Goodwill represents expected 
synergies and is expected to be tax deductible.
The amounts included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since 27 June 2014 included revenue of £9.1m and 
there was a profit of £0.6m over the same period. Had the transaction occurred on the first day of the financial year, then estimated 
contribution to Group revenues would have been £9.6m and net profits £0.5m.
USA
On 25 March 2015, SuperGroup Plc has acquired the exclusive rights to distribute Superdry products in North America, by 
terminating the 30 year licence granted to SDUSA LLC, the Group’s US licence partner, in 2008. The Group has also acquired from 
SDUSA LLC the trade and assets of 15 Superdry branded stores in the USA. 
This transaction provides a strategic opportunity to enhance the brand presence in North America and significantly build the long-
term value of the business through investing its own capital and retaining the local operational and management expertise. 
SuperGroup Plc paid a total of £10.1m in consideration by cash funding. Cash paid by SuperGroup Plc on acquisition was £8.1m 
and £2.0m was withheld to allow for any indemnity claims arising during the 12 month period following completion. The £2.0m 
remained unpaid as at 25th April 2015 and will be released, less the value of any claims made by the Group to SDUSA LLC, in four 
equal instalments.

33. Business combinations (continued)
The provisional fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed was as follows: 
USA
(£m)
Intangible assets 5.3
Property, plant and equipment 4.4
Inventories 5.5
Trade and other payables (4.1)
Total fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed 11.1
Gain arising on acquisition (1.0)
Total consideration 10.1
Intangible assets of £5.3m relate to reacquired rights to the North American territory and was valued using a multi period excess 
earnings methodology.
Fair value adjustments under IFRS 3 (revised) were made to property, plant and equipment, and inventories. The value of property, 
plant and equipment was adjusted for an impairment of £1.2m for the assets at one of the acquired stores as there is uncertainty 
over the lease assignment. Inventories were valued at sales price less costs to sell which increased the value of inventory by £2.4m.
Total consideration paid of £10.1m was £1.0m more than the total fair value of assets acquired and liabilities assumed and resulted 
in a gain credited to exceptional items (see note 13).
The impact of deferred tax has been considered and deemed to be nil.
Also included within exceptional items is the cash termination fee of the license rights in North America of £12.4m and £0.6m of 
professional fees paid including legal, due diligence and other costs. A post-acquisition review of the current and forecast trading 
performance, and assets of the stores resulted in an onerous lease provision charge of £1.8m, a write down of store assets of 
£0.8m, and asset impairment of £0.3m. 
The amounts included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income since 25 March 2015 included revenue of £1.8m 
and there was a profit of £0.4m over the same period. Had the transaction occurred on the first day of the financial year, then 
estimated contribution to Group revenues would have been £23.9m and net losses of £5.3m.
Germany
In October 2013 a 70% subsidiary of SuperGroup Plc, Superdry Germany GmbH (“Superdry Germany”) completed a business 
combination with KuH, a former distributor and former agent in Germany for the Group. The provisional fair values of the assets  
and liabilities were reviewed within 12 months of acquisition and an adjustment of £0.7m was made to increase goodwill from 
£0.7m to £1.4m.

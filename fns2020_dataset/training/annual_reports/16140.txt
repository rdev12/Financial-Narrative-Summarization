CHAIRMAN’S REVIEW
Chairman’s review
Year ended 31 December 2004
In 2004, the TripleArc Group made the transition into a major communications support services provider.  Following
the acquisition of Access Plus Plc in November 2003, the Group’s print management division was transformed into
one of the largest print management companies in the United Kingdom.  The Group’s development was further
augmented by the acquisition of Stream in December 2004.  Stream is a direct marketing fulfilment company and
has allowed the Group to expand its offering into data management and fulfilment services.
The Group has progressed significantly in 2004, with turnover increasing to £48.7m from £20.9m in 2003 and
operating profit before exceptional cost and amortisation of intangible assets increasing to £4.5m from £0.9m.
The Group continues to use its expertise in technology solutions to provide customers with industry leading print
management services.  Our proprietary technology combined with our print management company, Access Plus,
and our full-service marketing fulfilment company, Stream, form the basis for our vision of a total communications
support services solution.  In 2004, the Group won some significant contracts and made important strategic steps
towards this vision, and I expect 2005 to continue to build on this.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
Chief executive’s review
Year ended 31 December 2004
Overview
The Group’s vision is to provide a total communications support services solution.  This strategy involves the provision
of complementary services to assist companies in communicating more intelligently and effectively, through
traditional print as well as digital channels. 
In December 2004, TripleArc acquired Stream, a leading direct marketing fulfilment company, to enhance the
Group’s suite of services, expanding it into data management and fulfilment services.  These capabilities allow
TripleArc to add further value throughout the supply chain, ensuring that clients’ objectives are met.
The Group has an advanced technology service to manage the print buying process, a leading print management
company and a full service marketing fulfilment company offering clients a portfolio of solutions to fulfil their com-
munication needs. In addition, TripleArc has developed further offerings both internally and through partnerships to
ensure that it can provide clients with leading-edge services that improve their communications and offer them
competitive advantages.  These solutions include digital asset management, document creation, retail campaign
management and digital communication management and integration.  The value of an all encompassing
solution to a client’s print needs is reflected in the level of contracts we won last year including Virgin Mobile and
Virgin Retail and this ability to deliver several added value solutions in the supply chain helps the Group cement
relationships with its customers.
The strategy behind the acquisition of Access Plus in November 2003 was to enable the Group to compete for the
large scale, long term print management outsourcing contracts put out to tender by companies wanting cost-
effective solutions to non-core activities. The year under review saw that strategy pay off with the Group being
awarded contracts with an aggregated value of approximately £32 million.  These contracts range from one year
rolling contracts to five year fixed term agreements with companies that include BAA, Virgin Retail, Virgin Mobile,
BMI Healthcare and Matalan.
The challenging business environment is continuing to drive interest in outsourcing as companies focus on reducing
costs to improve bottom line performance.  The print industry is the UK’s fifth largest industry sector.  However, the
supply chain is complex and fragmented.  As a result, companies with a large print spend will almost certainly
benefit from an outsourced print management solution.  TripleArc has demonstrated savings of over 30% to some of
its clients.  As the outsourcing market continues to grow, so the contracts being awarded become more complex
and sophisticated, and information technology has become a major driver.  The Group is well placed to capitalise
on this requirement due to its industry leading technologies designed to streamline the supply chain and help us re-
engineer our customers’ business processes to achieve greater savings.  We will continue to deliver cost savings to
our clients and look forward to demonstrating these capabilities as we look at a strong new contracts pipeline.
Print Management Division
The results include a full year’s contribution from Access Plus and highlights the Group’s strong position as one of the
most complete print management service providers in the UK.  The division now trades under the name of
AccessPlus.  AccessPlus provides print management solutions directly to print buying customers across a diversity of
industries that includes retail, financial services, leisure, publishing and the public sector.  The Print Management
Division saves customers’ time and expense by utilising its expertise in project management, new digital and
workflow technologies, purchasing print and managing suppliers, thereby allowing customers to outsource the
complex process of buying and managing print. 
The year under review has seen the integration of Access Plus with the Group’s existing print management business,
gl2.  The integration of Access Plus was combined with the roll out of a Group-wide accountancy system and the
Group’s proprietary technology across the divisions and its suppliers.  On an operational level the newly created
division performed well and overall sales margins were ahead of initial expectations.  However, the achievement of
full-scale revenue generation on certain new contracts took longer than originally anticipated due to contract
timing delays.  Whilst these timing delays impacted on the 2004 financial performance, the Board fully expects the
Group to generate the revenues anticipated from these contracts in the current financial year.  It is in the nature of
these contracts that they require significant management time to win and implement and can involve financial
investment to set up.  Typically there can be up to a six-month delay before they contribute to Group profitability.
We therefore expect to see the full impact from these exciting contract wins during 2005.
The UK business forms market continues to decline as more businesses move towards automated solutions requiring
single sheet products.  This is impacting the profitability of one of our business groups which manages a high
percentage of this type of work.  However, the Group is confident that it will be able to continue to migrate its
business activity away from this sector and provide a more comprehensive Group-wide offering to these customers.   5
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
This combined with a slow down in the retail sector has led to a slightly slower than expected start for the Print
Management Division in 2005.  However, the pipeline appears healthy and the Board is confident of improved
levels of trading in the second quarter.
AccessPlus experienced a good level of success during 2004 in the public sector which now accounts for 7% of the
Group’s gross profit.  We aim to continue growing this part of our business which will benefit from the public sector’s
commitment to e-business and cost saving strategies.
The Print Management Division has also been successful in providing cost saving solutions to the retail sector.  This
was highlighted by the winning of the Virgin Mobile and Virgin Retail POS contracts.  The sophistication of these
contracts has enabled the division to further enhance its service offering and technology solutions.  Partner tech-
nologies have been adopted and integrated into our existing technology and fulfilment offering, which has
enabled the Group to provide a comprehensive POS solution that is now being cross-sold into other Group
customers.
The new business activity within AccessPlus remains high and the division is currently at preferred bidder status with
a large financial services business to provide a significant print management contract.  The Board expects to be
able to confirm details of the contract soon. 
Technology Division
The Technology Division, TripleArc Ltd, markets and supports the Group’s proprietary solutions, namely CWS
(Collaborative Workflow System), edit2print and OSCOS (Online Stock Catalogue and Ordering System), and
provides internal support to the Print Management Division, providing a strong competitive advantage.
Technology is recognised as playing a pivotal role in allowing organisations to manage and reduce printing costs.
TripleArc’s JDF compliant technology remains at the core of our offering and the Group is benefiting from the
increasing adoption of JDF within the print industry. 
In 2004, TripleArc announced a strategic partnership with Four51 Inc. to distribute CWS in the US market. Four51 is
seeing an increase in demand for CWS as the US market’s appetite to outsource commercial print from large
enterprises grows.  The roll out of the CWS technology into the customer base of PathForward (a business unit of
Standard Register, one of the largest print groups in the US) is progressing well and the Board expects to be able to
give further updates on its strategic partnership with Four51 and opportunities in the US later in the year.  
In order to smoothly introduce TripleArc’s proprietary software and other operating platforms across the Group last
year, resources within the Technology Division were diverted from their main focus of generating external revenue.  As
a result, revenue growth from the Technology Division was held back but now the systems implementation is substantially
complete, the Board is confident that the Group will obtain significant benefits from the common technology
platforms now in place, and these have already been a key aspect in assisting the Group win new business. 
The CWS network now has suppliers connected to it across the UK, Europe and US.  The Group is currently identifying
suppliers in the Far East and Asia which will add further competitive services to the fast growing network.  The print
spend through the network is continuing to gain momentum and the Group is beginning to see a solid recurring
revenue stream being generated from CWS.
Our attendance at the industry trade show DRUPA in association with Hewlett Packard, generated a number of
leads with regard to licensing the edit2print software. A number of these opportunities have been closed in the
current financial year.
The Group is currently seeking further opportunities to leverage revenues from its proprietary technologies, which
include licensing the CWS software and use of the print network to large enterprises which have adopted an
‘insource’ print management solution.   
As the Technology Division refocuses on external technology sales, the Board is confident that it can deliver
substantial earnings growth from this division in the future.
Data Management and Fulfilment Division
Stream, acquired in December 2004, was formed through the integration of two established direct marketing
companies, Stream Direct Communications in Cirencester (formerly Brann Direct) and Stream GWC in Swindon 
(formerly GWC Group).  Both businesses have over 20 years experience in the provision of direct marketing services.
The integration of these businesses was completed in March 2005 with the Cirencester operation closed down and
business transferred to Swindon.  The division, previously known as HFS Projects Limited, now trades as Stream and
employs over 200 staff.  Stream specialises in the automotive, mail order, publishing, charity, financial services and
leisure sectors. 6
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
The acquisition of Stream not only increases the Group’s scale in the print management sector, but also adds a
range of ‘data-centric’ solutions which include: data management and data processing, response management,
such as inbound and outbound call handling and data-capture and extensive personalisation and data fulfilment
facilities.  These new services will benefit the Print Management Division’s customers as well as enabling the Group
to tender for some of the larger financial services contracts available which require particular expertise in the
customer data area.
It is anticipated that Stream will quickly adopt the Group’s technologies, such as OSCOS and CWS, adding further
momentum to the print spend placed via CWS.  Furthermore, the cross selling benefits between the businesses
within the Group are excellent with many AccessPlus customers requiring the services provided by Stream and vice
versa.
The Board has had a strategic goal of providing added-value services to the Group’s offering.  The purchase of
Stream provides the Group with more control of our customers’ sensitive data, taking us further up the supply chain
of their communication solutions and strengthening our relationships. 
Business Improvement
As the Group continues to grow it is important we focus on continued improvement within the business divisions.  In
February 2005, Six Sigma, a methodology for improving the efficiency and effectiveness of business activities, was
adopted and is being rolled out across the Group.
The Group is committed to providing the best possible service to all of our customers all of the time.  This is endorsed
by our implementation and support of Six Sigma.  Our commitment to quality and service extends from the Board to
all members of the workforce and will be constantly reviewed to ensure a culture of continual improvement
throughout the organisation.
Staff
TripleArc Plc now employs over 350 people and the Board would like to thank all of them for their loyalty and level
of professionalism over the past year.  It has been a time of great change and excitement and the Board is grateful
for all their hard work. 
Outlook
The Group has experienced a significant improvement in the quantity and quality of its earnings stream.  We
expect this trend to continue as we progressively move away from ad hoc print supply orders towards longer term
print management contracts and the Group’s technology procurement network grows.  The substantial contract
wins and the expansion of the CWS network over the past year provide clear evidence of the basis of long-term
sustainable revenues.  This has established a firm foundation on which the Group will develop its strategy for
delivering a complete communications support services solution.
A Group-wide Contract Solutions team has been established to deliver on this strategy and ensure that services are
cross-sold between divisions to our customers.  The acquisition of Stream has greatly enhanced the Group’s
customer base and service offering and we have already seen over £500,000 of annualised business placed by a
Stream customer with AccessPlus.  Stream represents a step towards the Group’s aim to help customers to
effectively manage the integration of data with the convergence of digital and print communication channels.
In focusing on new strategic partnerships and potential acquisitions we are enhancing the service offering to our
clients, whilst delivering value for the Group.  TripleArc aims to fulfil its vision by adding further service areas to its
offering and to develop the potential of the Group’s procurement technology through the establishment of a
global technology platform.  The Board believes that it will continue to deliver shareholder value over the
forthcoming year and well into the future.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
Financial review
Year ended 31 December 2004
Revenue for the year was £48.7m (2003 - £20.9m), a 134% increase on 2003, reflecting the first full year of sales from
AccessPlus.  
The consolidated gross profit was £12.2m for 2004, a 256% increase on the £3.4m generated in 2003.  This significant
growth was primarily achieved by the Group’s print management operations.  The Group’s combined gross profit
was 8% higher than the proforma annualised figure of £11.3m for 2003.
In 2004, exceptional costs of £0.3m were incurred in relation to the integration of AccessPlus and the reorganisation
of the Group’s print management activities into one operating company.  Amortisation of intangible assets was
£2.1m during 2004 (2003 - £0.6m), reflecting a full year’s charge on the acquisition of AccessPlus.  The non-cash
share option compensation expense was immaterial, as this charge was extinguished during 2004 (2003 - £0.1m).  
Operating profit before allowing for exceptional costs, amortisation and share option compensation (‘EBITA’) was
£4.5m in 2004, compared to an operating profit of £0.9m on the same basis in 2003, and represents a 5% increase
over the proforma annualised EBITA of £4.3m in 2003.  The operating profit before interest and taxation was £2.1m
(2003 - £0.1m), and the net interest payable was £1.4m (2003 - £0.1m), after allowing for amortisation of deferred
financing costs of £0.1m (2003 – Nil).  The profit before tax in 2004 was £0.8m (2003 – loss £0.04m).  
The basic earnings per ordinary share was 0.13 pence (2003 – loss per share of 0.29 pence).  After allowing for
exceptional costs, amortisation of intangible assets and non-cash share option compensation expense, the Group
had adjusted earnings per share of 1.31 pence, (2003 – adjusted earnings per share 0.71 pence)
Cash generation has also been strong in 2004, with the Group producing net cash inflow from operating activities
of £3.4m (2003 - £1.6m).  This has allowed the Group to make accelerated bank debt repayments during 2004.
On 31 December 2004, the Group acquired HFS Projects Limited, now trading as Stream, giving rise to goodwill on
acquisition of £8.2m and an estimated liability for deferred consideration of £7.0m included in long term liabilities.

REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Report on corporate governance
Year ended 31 December 2004
The Directors intend, where practicable for a company of its size and nature, to comply with the Revised Combined
Code on Corporate Governance. At present there are areas of non-compliance with the Code and the Company
intends to address these items, in the future, as the Company grows and compliance becomes more appropriate
to a company of TripleArc’s size.
The Company has adopted a code of Directors’ dealings appropriate for a company whose shares are trading on
AIM and takes all reasonable steps to ensure compliance by the Directors and any relevant employees.
Board and board committees
The Board of seven comprises four executive Directors and three non-executive Directors.  The full Board, which met
seven times in 2004, manages overall control of the Group's affairs by the schedule of matters reserved for its
decision.  These include the approval of financial statements, acquisitions and disposals, authority levels for
expenditure, and review of monthly and other management reports.  Short biographies of all the Directors are set
out on page 8. 
The Directors are able to take independent professional advice in the furtherance of their duties at the Company's
expense and all Directors have access to the advice and services of the Company Secretary.  Mr Pople is the
senior independent non-executive Director.  An independent director is one who has no relationship with the
Company or its management which may undermine independence and who is not independent of the Company
or its management for his primary source of income, was not within the last 3 years a senior manager of the
Company and does not participate in the Company’s incentive bonus schemes or pension schemes.
The Board delegates day-to-day and business management control to the executive Directors who are in regular
contact with each other.  Formal decisions are communicated throughout the Group.  The executive Directors are
responsible for implementing Group policy, the monitoring and performance of the business, and reporting to the
full Board thereon.
The Company has set up an Audit Committee whose terms of reference cover the points recommended by the
Code.  Its duties include monitoring internal control throughout the Group, approving the Group's accounting
policies and reviewing the interim and annual financial statements before submission to the Board.  The Committee
is chaired by Mr Pople and consists of Mr Greenan and is attended by Mr Houston, the Finance Director, as
appropriate.  At the conclusion of the annual audit and the review of the interim accounts, the Audit Committee
receives and considers a report from the auditors on any material findings.
The Company has a Remuneration Committee, which is composed of the three non-executive Directors and is
chaired by Dr Wong.  The report of the Remuneration Committee is set out on pages 11 and 12.
All executive Directors have rolling service contracts with the Company terminable on six months notice, apart from
Mr Houston and Mr Haigh who have twelve months’ notice, which in all cases, may be served by either party.
Following their first appointment to the Board, the terms of the Articles of Association require all Directors to retire
and stand for re-election at the earliest opportunity.  Under the Articles of Association, one third of the Directors
shall retire from office by rotation and all Directors are required to retire once every three years. 
In view of the size of the Group there is no Nominations Committee. 10
REPORT ON CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Relationship with shareholders
The Directors consider the clear and timely communication of information to shareholders as an important part of
their duties.  The Chairman’s and the Chief Executive’s Reviews provide a summary of the Group's trading
performance and future outlook.  In addition, the Financial Review, contained in this report, also provides
Shareholders with further background and information into the Group.  The Group’s various web sites also give
Shareholders access to additional information.  Furthermore, twice a year, the Group's financial results are
published, in conjunction with briefings for investment managers and institutional analysts following the Company's
interim and preliminary final announcements. 
The Board also views the Annual General Meeting as an ideal opportunity to communicate with both institutional
and private investors alike and aims to comply with all the provisions of the Combined Code relating to the con-
structive use of Annual General Meetings.  This year's Annual General Meeting will be held on Tuesday 28 June 2005
when all the Directors plan to be present and available to answer questions.  A Notice calling the Meeting has
been sent to shareholders with this Report and Accounts.  
Accountability and internal control
The Directors have set out their responsibility for preparing the accounts in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities on page 14. The Board has overall responsibility for the systems of internal control.  Implementation
and maintenance of the internal control systems is the responsibility of executive management.  The Board, through
the Audit Committee, has reviewed the effectiveness of the systems of internal control for the accounting year, and
the period to the date of approval of the financial statements.  It should be understood, however, that such systems
are designed to provide reasonable but not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Company has an established framework of internal controls, the key features of which are as follows: 
Control environment – There are clearly defined organisational responsibilities and the Board is committed to
employing suitably qualified staff so that the appropriate level of authority can be delegated with regard to
accountability and acceptable levels of risk.
Information systems – The Group operates a number of separate systems of financial and operational reporting to
the Board and senior management, based upon an annual budget and regular forecasts.  The Board recognises
the need to continually review and where appropriate improve information technology systems and during 2004,
have introduced new systems across the Group.  Further work may be needed in 2005 to integrate further acquisi-
tions in to the Group’s financial and operating systems.  Monthly, weekly and other periodic reports of actual results
(financial and non-financial) together with key performance indicators are produced for and discussed by the
Directors.
Identification and evaluation of business risks and controls – Management control is exercised at all levels of the
Group and is regulated by appropriate limits of authority.  The Directors have considered various areas of business
risks and have developed appropriate policies to manage and mitigate those risks.  These policies are reviewed in
the light of known and perceived changes to the risks.
Quality and integrity of personnel – The Group attaches high importance to the values of trust, honesty and integrity
of personnel in responsible positions and operates a policy of recruiting and promoting suitably experienced
personnel with clearly defined accountabilities.  The group currently employs over 350 people in 7 locations.  There
are regular meetings of the main sales related staff where additional training is carried out and information about
new product technology is exchanged.
Investment appraisal – Although capital investment is not a significant element of the Group’s operations, all major
expenditure is included in the annual budget and is reported on to the Board.  In addition, the Board, both in the
regular meetings and by ad hoc reports, regularly reviews all potential and actual acquisition opportunities.
Monitoring – Given the size of the Group and the close day-to-day involvement of the executive Directors in almost all
of the Group’s locations, no formal internal audit function is considered necessary. 11
REPORT ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
Report on directors’ remuneration

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Directors’ report
Year ended 31 December 2004
The Directors present their annual report on the affairs of the Group, together with the financial statements and
auditors’ report for the year ended 31 December 2004.
Results and dividends
The Group profit after taxation for the year amounted to £256,000 (2003: loss £231,000).  The Directors do not
recommend the payment of a dividend.
Principal activities and business review
TripleArc Plc (“the Company”) is an investment holding company.  The principal activities of the Company’s sub-
sidiaries are the provision of print management services and the provision of e-procurement solutions for the print
industry.  A review of the Group’s activities during the year and its future prospects can be found in the Chief
Executive’s Review on pages 4, 5 and 6.
On 17 November 2003, the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of Access Plus Plc, now renamed
Access Plus Limited.  The consideration was satisfied by the issue of 65,500,000 ordinary shares in the Company and
a cash consideration of £28 million. 
On 31 December 2004, the Company acquired the entire issued share capital of HFS Projects Limited. The initial
consideration was satisfied by the issue of 3,247,776 ordinary shares. Further conditional consideration of £8.0m will
be payable on 15 March 2007 dependent upon the level of average pre-tax profits of HFS Projects Limited in 2005
and 2006.  Full details of this acquisition are provided in note 12 to the financial statements. Full details of the
movements during the year in the share capital and reserves of the Group are given in notes 24 and 26.

Jason Cromack 
Nick Haigh
Peter Houston

Directors’ interests in the share capital of the Company and in any beneficial share options are shown in the Report
on Directors’ remuneration on pages 11 and 12. In accordance with the Articles of Association of the Company,
the Directors retiring by rotation are David Wong and Jason Cromack and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-
election.
Substantial shareholdings
In addition to the interest of Directors disclosed on page 12 the Directors have been notified that the following
shareholders own 3% or more of the total issued share capital of the Company at 14 April 2005:
Morley Fund Management 12.17%
Schroder Investment Management 4.97%
Employees
The Group is committed to employment policies which follow best practice, based on equal opportunities for all
employees irrespective of sex, race, national origin, religion, colour, disability, sexual orientation, age or marital
status. Employees are kept closely involved in major changes affecting them through such measures as team
meetings, briefings and internal communications. These are well established procedures to ensure that the views of
employees are taken into account in reaching decisions.
Significant changes in fixed assets
In the opinion of the Directors, the market value of fixed assets is not materially different from the carrying value at
31 December 2004.
Creditor payment policy
It is the Group’s payment policy for the year ended 31 December 2004, in respect of suppliers, to settle agreed
outstanding accounts in accordance with the terms and conditions agreed with suppliers when placing orders. The
Group will abide by these terms of payment. Creditors at the year end represented 84 days purchases (2003: 65 days). 14
DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Research and development
Software research and development expenditure is written off in the period in which it is incurred.
Going concern
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group has adequate resources to
continue in operation for the foreseeable future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in
preparing the financial statements.
Share option scheme
Certain executive Directors and senior management participate in the share option scheme. Under the terms of
the scheme, the Board is entitled to select the employees to participate in the scheme in order to provide
appropriate incentives to selected individuals. Details of the terms under which options are exercisable are set out
in note 25 to the financial statements.  During 2004, the Directors obtained Inland Revenue approval for an
additional share option scheme and a number of awards were made to employees this year.
Financial risk management
The Group’s financial instruments comprise bank borrowings and cash. The main purpose of these financial
instruments is to raise finance for the Group’s operations. The Group’s current policy is that no trading in financial
instruments shall be undertaken.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. The
Group’s policies for managing each of these risks are summarised below:
Foreign exchange risk
A number of the Group’s principal suppliers are in Europe with expenses arising in Euros. The Group manages the foreign
exchange risk arising on substantial transactions with these suppliers through agreeing exchange rate ranges with suppliers.
Interest rate risk
The Group has not entered into arrangements whereby it would be exposed to long-term interest rate risk. No
derivative instruments are used by the Group.
Charitable donations
During the year, the Group made charitable donations amounting to £Nil (2003 - £Nil).
Corporate governance
The Board is mindful of the voluntary provisions of the Combined Code relating to Corporate Governance and has
been reviewing some of its procedures during 2004, taking into account the size and stage of development of the
Group.  During the year, the Directors have considered some of the implications of the Turnbull Report even though
compliance with this Report is not required by the Group.  It remains too early to advise on the date by which the
Group will elect to be ready to comply with this Report.
Directors’  responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare in accordance with applicable United Kingdom law and
accounting standards, financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and Group and of the profit or loss for that period.  In preparing those financial statements,
the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group
will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy, at
any time, the financial position of the Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial
statements comply with the Companies Act 1985.  They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are
reasonable to safeguard the assets of the Group, and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Auditors
A resolution is to be proposed at the Annual General Meeting for the re-appointment of KPMG as auditors of the Company. 
By order of the Board.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF TRIPLEARC PLC
Independent auditors’ report to the members of TripleArc Plc
We have audited the financial statements on pages 16 to 34. We have also examined the Directors’ remuneration
table in the Report on Directors’ remuneration. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the
Companies Act, 1985.  Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest extent
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements.  As described in the
Directors’ Report, this includes responsibility for preparing the financial statements in accordance with applicable
United Kingdom law and accounting standards.  Our responsibilities, as independent auditors, are established in the
United Kingdom by statute, the Auditing Practices Board, the Listing Rules of the United Kingdom Financial Services
Authority and by our profession’s ethical guidance.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.  We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’
Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we
have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law or
the Listing Rules regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the Group is not disclosed.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the
audited financial statements.  We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board.  An audit
includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial
statements.  It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the
preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s cir-
cumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered
necessary in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements
are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error.  In forming our opinion
we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.   
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the
Group as at 31 December 2004 and of the profit of the Group for the year then ended and have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Notes to the financial statements
Year ended 31 December 2004
1 Accounting policies
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered
material in relation to the Group’s financial statements.
(a) Basis of preparation and status of financial statements
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards and under
the historical cost convention on a going concern basis and comply with financial reporting standards of the
Accounting Standards Board.
(b) Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements include the financial statements of TripleArc Plc and its subsidiary 
undertakings prepared up to 31 December 2004.  Intercompany profits, transactions and account balances
have been eliminated.  The acquisition method of accounting is applied for acquisitions with fair values being
attributed to the identifiable net assets acquired.  Goodwill arising on acquisition is dealt with as set out below.
The results of subsidiary undertakings acquired during the year are included in the consolidated profit and loss
account from the date of acquisition.  
(c) Turnover
Turnover represents the invoiced fair value of goods and services (excluding value added tax) delivered to third
party customers during the year.
(d) Tangible fixed assets and depreciation
Depreciation is provided by the Group to write off the cost, less the estimated residual value of tangible fixed
assets over their estimated useful economic lives as follows:
Furniture, fixtures and fittings - over 4 to 10 years (Straight-line basis)
Office equipment - over 4 to 10 years (Straight-line basis)
Software - over 3 to 5 years (Straight-line basis)
Motor vehicles - over 4 to 5 years (Straight-line basis)
Freehold land is not depreciated. Freehold buildings are depreciated on a straight-line basis, at 2.5% per annum.
Leasehold improvements have been depreciated, using the straight-line method, over the period of the lease to
the date of the next option-to-break clause.
The carrying values of tangible fixed assets are reviewed for impairment in periods if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate the carrying value may not be recoverable.
(e) Intangible assets and Goodwill
Intangible assets represents intellectual property and goodwill. Purchased goodwill arising on the acquisition of a
business (representing the excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the separate
assets acquired) is capitalised. Positive goodwill is amortised on a straight-line basis over its estimated useful life,
the period during which benefits are expected to accrue. Purchased goodwill is being amortised over 15 - 20
years. Intellectual property acquired together with the related costs of acquisition is being amortised over three
years.
Where events or circumstances are present which indicate that the carrying amount of intangible assets may
not be recoverable, the Group estimates the recoverable amount based on the present value of future cash
flows expected to result from the use of the asset and its eventual disposition. Where this amount is less that the
carrying amount of the asset, the Group will recognise an impairment loss.
(f) Investments
Investments in subsidiary undertakings are shown at cost less provisions for impairment.
(g) Debt
Debt is initially stated at the amount of the net proceeds after deduction of issue costs. The carrying amount is
increased by the finance cost in respect of the accounting period and reduced by payments made in the
period.  21
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
1 Accounting policies (continued)
(h) Cash and liquid resources
Cash, for the purposes of the cash flow statement, comprises cash in hand and deposits repayable on demand,
less overdrafts payable on demand.
Liquid resources are current asset investments which are disposable without curtailing or disrupting the business
and are either readily convertible into known amounts of cash or close to their carrying value or traded in an
active market.  Liquid resources comprise term deposits of less than one year (other than cash).
(i) Foreign currencies
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are reported at the
rates of exchange prevailing at that date.  Any gain or loss arising from a change in exchange rates subsequent
to the date of the transaction is included as an exchange gain or loss in the profit and loss account.
(j) Leased assets
Where the Group enters into a lease that entails taking substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of an
asset, the lease is treated as a finance lease.  The asset is recorded in the balance sheet as a tangible fixed
asset and is depreciated over its useful life or the term of the lease, whichever is shorter.  Future instalments under
such leases, net of finance charges, are included within creditors.  The interest element of finance lease
payments is charged to the profit and loss account.
All other leases are accounted for as operating leases and rental charges are charged to the profit and loss
account as incurred.
(k) Pension costs
The Group makes contributions to the personal pension plans of certain employees. Group contributions
payable are charged to the profit and loss account. 
A stakeholder pension scheme has been set-up by certain of the Group’s subsidiaries.  All employees may elect
to contribute a portion of their pre-tax earnings into the stakeholder pension plan which is managed by an
independent party.
(l) Research and development
Software research and development expenditure is written off in the period in which it is incurred.
(m) Stocks
Stocks and work in progress are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value, after making due
allowance for obsolete and slow moving items. 
(n) Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid using the rates and laws that have been enacted or
substantially enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the
balance sheet date where transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future or a
right to pay less tax in the future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Provision is made at the rates
expected to apply when the timing differences reverse. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s
taxable profits and its results as stated in the financial statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses
in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are recognised in the financial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all
available evidence it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits from
which the future reversal of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
(o) Earnings per share 
Basic earnings per ordinary share is computed by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders 
by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year. Diluted earnings per share is
computed by dividing the net profit attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of
ordinary shares in issue after adjusting for the effects of all potential dilutive ordinary shares that were
outstanding during the year. 22

NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
20Financial instruments
An explanation of the Group’s objectives and policies regarding financial instruments can be found on page 14
in the Directors’ Report.  There is no difference between the book values and the fair values of the Group’s
financial assets and financial liabilities either because of the relative short-term nature of the respective
instruments or because of uncertainty regarding their future amount.  The disclosure below excludes short-term
debtors and creditors.
Financial liabilities
The Group has an annual overdraft facility of £0.25m at 31 December 2004 (2003 - £0.25m).  This facility is
secured by a standard fixed and floating charge over the assets of the Company and all subsidiary undertak-
ings.  All other facilities lapsed during 2004.  On 1 January 2004, the Company entered into an agreement with
HSBC Bank Plc to compensate against potential material increases in interest rates for the period of the existing
banking facilities.  The Company pays a quarterly fee in advance.
The Company has agreed to pay deferred consideration to the vendors of HFS on 15 March 2007, on which no
interest is paid.  The deferred consideration can be settled in a mixture of shares or loan notes and is contingent
on the level of average profits of HFS for the two years ending 31 December 2006.  The maximum liability is £8m
and the amount shown in the accounts (£6.956m), is the ‘present value’ of the maximum consideration after
allowing for the costs of funds at the Group’s current rate of borrowing of 7.24%.
Access Plus Limited has issued 10-year guaranteed unsecured floating rate Loan Notes which bear interest linked
to bank base rates less 150 basis points and pay interest twice a year.  The Loan Notes are effectively repayable
on demand on any interest payment date, and are guaranteed by the Group’s bankers. The guarantee is
funded by an equal cash collateral which is invested on a 3 month high interest bond. The Group has no fixed
rate interest bearing debt.
Financial assets
All money market deposits are on varying rates depending on the daily demand for short-term funds.  Apart
from the cash collateral, there are no fixed rate financial assets over one month in length. Some of the Group’s
financial assets are currently used as collateral for some of the Group’s financial liabilities.
Bank and other loans are repayable within one year as follows: £’000
Repayable other than by instalments:
Bank overdraft nil

The Group’s borrowing facilities at the year end were in the form of a secured overdraft facility and the provision
of a long term loan by HSBC Bank Plc.  The facility was secured over the assets of the Group.  
The HSBC facility represents a £16m term loan facility and a £4m revolving loan facility.  Loans under the term
facility bear interest at specific margins over LIBOR plus standard regulatory cost.  Loans under the term facility
are repayable in quarterly instalments commencing 31 March 2004 and must be fully repaid on 31 December
2010.  At 31 December 2004, £2.3m had been repaid on the term facility during 2004.  At 31 December 2004,
£4m had been drawn down under the revolving credit facility.  31

On 17 November 2003, a special resolution was passed to increase the authorised share capital of the Company
by 180,000,000 ordinary shares of 5p each.
The cost of gl2 Limited’s shares in the Company has been deducted from shareholders’ funds in accordance
with UTIF 37.  The Directors consider that the arrangements are such that the shares owned by gl2 Limited have
effectively been repurchased by the Group and so do not constitute an asset of the Group and that to show
them as such would fail to show a true and fair view.
On 17 November 2003, 65,498,542 ordinary shares were issued to the shareholders of Access Plus Limited in part
consideration for the acquisition of the entire share capital of that company.  On the same date, 70,000,000 5p
ordinary shares were placed with certain institutional and other investors on the re-admission of the Company to
the Alternative Investment Market.  The total proceeds were £11.2m.
On 31 December 2004, 3,247,776 ordinary shares were issued at 19.675 pence per share, which is a premium of
14.675 pence per share, to the shareholders of HFS Projects Limited to satisfy the initial consideration for
acquisition of the entire share capital of that company. 32
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
25Share options 
During the year the Company granted options over an aggregate of 3,752,857 (2003: 102,857) ordinary shares on
the terms of the Share Option Scheme at subscription prices ranging from 19p to 20.75p per ordinary share.  
The options issued in favour of Peter Houston, Nick Haigh and 450,000 of the options issued in favour of JT Wong,
are exercisable in two equal tranches depending on whether earnings targets are achieved in the financial
years ending 31 December 2004 and 31 December 2005 respectively.  900,000 of the options issued in favour of
Jason Cromack are exercisable in three equal tranches.  The first two tranches may be exercised if the two
foregoing earnings targets are met.  The third tranche may only be exercised if the Company's average share
price is above a pre-determined target over a three month period between 1 January 2005 and 30 June 2006.  If
any of the targets are not met the options will lapse.
The Company recognised a compensation expense of £6,997 (2003: £99,055) during the year ended 31
December 2004 for those instances in which the exercise price of the Company’s options was less than the
estimated fair market value of the underlying shares at the date of grant.
The Company listed on the Alternative Investment Market on 10 December 2001.  The price of the Company’s
shares at 31 December 2004 was 19.50p (2003: 17.50p).  During the year the average market price of the
Company’s shares was 18.625p.  All options granted subsequent to the Company’s AIM listing in December 2001
have been granted with exercise prices equal to the market value at the date of grant.

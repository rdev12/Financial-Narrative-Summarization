OPERATING 
SMARTER
Our greatest challenge is to deliver the returns our 
shareholders expect but to do so in a way that creates 
shared value for all our partners and stakeholders.
To deliver on this commitment in a sustainable way,  
we have set out a clear strategy that will transform  
Anglo American. At the heart of this sit our new 
Organisation and Operating Models. These two  
clearly defined and focused approaches will see us 
operating smarter in every area of our business, 
across the value chain.
As we continue to embed these models, we are 
starting to witness significant progress. Clear 
authorities and accountabilities, operational 
improvements and a more disciplined approach  
to capital allocation are already helping us create  
a more effective and efficient organisation, for the 
benefit of all our stakeholders.

PERFORMANCE HIGHLIGHTS CONTENTS CHAIRMAN’S  
STATEMENT
Notably, our production performance in all our key 
businesses has been ahead of plan. During October 2014, 
we were able to ship our first ore from Minas-Rio earlier  
than expected and within the revised capital budget of  
$8.8 billion. This is testimony to the unrelenting endeavours 
of the team in Brazil. However, the dramatic drop in the iron  
ore pricing environment, which has been particularly acute  
in the near term and has also dragged down long term  
price expectations, has resulted in a $3.5 billion non-cash 
(post-tax) write down in the asset value of Minas-Rio.
Notwithstanding the tough pricing environment, there have 
been several encouraging developments. Our platinum 
operations in South Africa are recovering strongly from the 
prolonged strike in the first half of 2014, and we are making 
headway in restructuring the business, including the 
divestment of operations we no longer consider to be  
‘core’. The operational turnaround at our two major copper 
interests in Chile, Los Bronces and Collahuasi, is well under 
way despite the challenges, at Los Bronces, posed by 
declining grades and ore hardness. At Sishen, our flagship 
iron ore asset in South Africa, we are on track to restore 
production to a 38 million tonnes per annum level in 2016.  
In Australia, where deteriorating prices for metallurgical coal 
are putting great pressure on our coal operations, we have 
managed to dramatically improve productivity, bringing 
down unit costs substantially at our key longwall operations.
SAFETY
I never fail to be impressed by the level of commitment 
shown throughout our Group – from Board level to the 
working face – in safety matters. That is why it is always sad 
and disappointing to report on loss of life in our business.  
In 2014, despite a steep reduction in fatal incidents (after 
taking the platinum strike into account), and ongoing 
declining trends in injuries, six people lost their lives – it is 
incumbent on us all to do whatever it takes to get this figure 
down to zero.
Under Tony O’Neill, our technical director, this is being given 
renewed direction, particularly with the emphasis being 
placed via our Operating Model on planned work, which is 
improving performance not only in safety, but in practically 
all areas of the business. 
Allied to this, we are focusing on the deployment of  
new technologies, and particularly those concerning 
mechanisation and automation, in order to make mining less 
physically arduous and to eliminate, as far as possible, the 
potentially hazardous interface between employees and 
machinery and the rock face. This has led to tightening 
policy around transportation (along with falls of ground,  
the main cause of injuries in our Group), including stricter 
regulation around transport hire and the advance 
monitoring of road conditions.
These macro-economic conditions and the over-supply  
of certain mined commodities drove severe price decreases. 
Such developments are posing considerable challenges  
for the global mining industry. This is particularly the case  
in bulk commodities such as iron ore, where industry 
over-expansion created price levels that are more depressed 
than they might have been. Given these developments, 
Anglo American is taking further action to cushion the 
impact of downward price pressures.
ANGLO AMERICAN’S ROAD TO RECOVERY
Results
These challenging conditions are demonstrating the 
resilience of Anglo American’s strategy, based as it is on a 
diversified range of products attuned to different stages of 
the cycle. We delivered an underlying EBIT of $4.9 billion  
in 2014 (2013: $6.6 billion). We have also recommended  
a dividend of 53 cents per share at the final stage, giving  
a maintained total dividend for the year of 85 cents  
per share, and we expect the dividend to be funded  
from free cash flow from 2016 onwards. The Board’s 
commitment to providing a base dividend, which will be 
maintained or increased through the cycle, is unchanged.
Performance
Under the leadership of Mark Cutifani, considerable 
progress is being made, on this, the first year of our 
three-year journey towards realising the potential set  
out in our Driving Value strategic imperative. 
In 2014, we passed a number of important milestones on  
the road to our ambition. This included making significant 
strides in our operational performance to meet our 2016 
target of 15% ROCE at June 2013 prices and exchange 
rates. At that time we plan to deliver an additional $4 billion  
of incremental EBIT (compared to 2012), and are redoubling 
our efforts to create further improvements, including scaling 
down our capital expenditure for 2015 and 2016. 
2014 saw a notable divergence in performance 
between the world’s major economies. In China, 
growth dipped slightly below the government’s 
7½% target. Other emerging economies, the 
eurozone and Japan are in a fragile state, though 
the US strengthened significantly during the year .

STRATEGIC REPORT CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT DEVELOPING AND DEPLOYING NEW TECHNOLOGIES
In the past, Anglo American, deservedly, had a reputation  
for being a leader in mining technology, and the Board  
is giving its full backing to the executive and the Technical 
team as we endeavour to again lead the industry. Our 
intense focus on operational fundamentals – doing the basic 
things better – is already delivering substantial benefits. 
Today, however, no mining company can be working wholly 
within its own silo, and that is why Anglo American is working 
with a range of global institutions and universities in the 
Americas, Australia, South Africa and the UK to support  
us in our drive to be at the forefront of mining technology. 
We now want to move on to the next phase, with 
developments such as rock cutting lasers, alongside the 
deployment of digital engineering that can simulate mine 
and infrastructure conditions prior to the first shovel being 
put in the ground. In turn, the adoption of the latest 
construction techniques will greatly reduce the labour 
intensiveness and development risks of projects. 
RESETTING THE SOUTH AFRICAN RELATIONSHIP
At Anglo American, we attach great importance to our 
relationships with our host governments. None is more 
important than South Africa, where we have substantial iron 
ore, platinum, thermal coal and diamond interests. These 
include projects such as the $2 billion extension into an 
underground diamond mine at Venetia, already under way, 
the potential New Largo coal mine development and the 
possible expansion of Platinum’s open pit at Mogalakwena.
We are also changing the role and composition of the 
Anglo American South Africa Board in order to: reinforce 
our commitment to, and strengthen our engagement with 
the country; and to co-ordinate our significant social and 
community programmes there through an integrated 
project management approach.
BOARD DEVELOPMENTS
During my time as your chairman, I have constantly  
sought to recruit people with the relevant skills sets and 
breadth of experience to make a real difference to the 
Board’s deliberations. This has brought to the boardroom 
not only mining knowledge, but also experience in  
such areas as management of major projects, modern 
engineering, construction, finance, investment expertise, 
global business experience, corporate leadership and 
healthcare. As a result, I believe that the Board is now not 
only stronger and more dynamic, but that it has helped to 
foster a relationship with the executive based on mutual 
trust and respect. This has created a boardroom culture 
where robust challenge is respected. 
We are fortunate indeed to have Jack Thompson, who 
brings experience gained at all levels of the mining industry, 
as the chairman of the Sustainability Committee. I would 
also like to thank Byron Grote for the important perspectives 
he has brought to the Audit Committee in his first year as its 
chairman, and Sir Philip Hampton who diligently chairs our 
Remuneration Committee and serves as our senior 
independent director.
I am pleased to report that at year end, we had three  
female directors, constituting 25% of our Board, in line  
with the Davies Report 2015 target. We have also 
consciously built up our ethnic diversity.
OUR PEOPLE
I am encouraged by the extent to which we are being 
supported by our employees as we strive to make  
Anglo American a more efficient and effective organisation. 
Change is never comfortable for employees – but, as  
Mark Cutifani emphasised at our Investor Day in December, 
we have to adapt urgently given the pricing pressure on  
our business.
It is pleasing to note how far we have come already in 
restructuring the organisation, not least in the alignment  
of key people to key roles. Notably, in our all important 
Technical and Sustainability area, which is leading the  
way on our continuing journey to transform operational 
performance, we have seen the emergence of a revitalised 
organisation, with three-quarters of its top management 
recruited from across the global mining industry.
I wish to express my sincere gratitude to everyone who 
works for Anglo American for their hard work during a year 
of great change both internally and externally, and for their 
ongoing commitment to the Group in what undoubtedly will 
be a very challenging year ahead.
OUTLOOK
Against a background of a world economy that is likely to 
remain turbulent as the after-effects of the global financial 
crisis continue to linger, Anglo American is determined to  
be commercial in its approach, with a disciplined focus on 
margins and aligning output to anticipated market demand. 
Given this approach, our Group, with its differentiated range 
of early-, mid-, and late-stage products such as platinum  
and diamonds, is well placed to withstand both the vagaries 
of the cycle and to take advantage of the eventual upturn. 
Meanwhile, we are focused on delivering cost effective 
operational performance.

REVIEW
THE ECONOMY
GROWTH STABILISATION
Global real gross domestic product (GDP) increased  
by 3¼% in 2014, the same as in 2013, according to the 
International Monetary Fund (IMF). There was a notable 
divergence in performance, however, between the world’s 
major economies. Early in the year, extremely cold weather 
depressed activity in the United States (US), though the 
economy recovered through the spring and summer. After  
a recovery in the spring, the Chinese economy slowed in  
the second half of the year. In Japan, activity was robust at 
the start of 2014, but then slumped following an increase in 
the consumption sales tax. Europe’s growth remained weak 
in 2014, especially in the eurozone’s largest economies. 
Activity remained fragile in emerging economies.
At the start of 2014, there was growing optimism about 
prospects for the US economy, but the extreme winter 
weather contributed to a contraction in real GDP in  
the first quarter. The strong recovery in the spring and  
summer led to annualised GDP growth of more than 4½%. 
Improvements in the labour and housing markets and a 
steep fall in oil prices later in the year supported significant 
gains in consumer confidence. Business sentiment also 
improved, encouraging increases in capital spending. After  
a significant tightening in 2012–2013, the fiscal squeeze 
moderated in 2014, imparting a smaller drag on growth.  
The Federal Reserve gradually wound down its quantitative 
easing programme, completing it in October.
In the first six months of 2014, China’s economy grew in  
line with the government’s 7½% target, which was a little 
below the rate in the second half of 2013. The People’s  
Bank of China injected liquidity into distressed sectors  
of the economy and the government accelerated some 
infrastructure projects. In the second half of 2014, growth 
dropped below the government’s target, mainly reflecting 
the negative impact of a weakening property market and 
slower industrial activity. In response, the Bank cut interest 
rates and allowed the renminbi to drift lower, and the 
government eased house purchase restrictions and 
loosened mortgage terms.
The European economy remained fragile in 2014. Following 
two years of output contraction, the eurozone registered 
modest growth as the heavily indebted economies 
stabilised, with Germany being the strongest of the larger 
economies. But after robust gains early in 2014, the German 
economy weakened appreciably later in the year, reflecting 
the slowdown in its main export markets and the impact  
of a stronger euro, especially against the Japanese yen.  
The French economy stagnated and the Italian economy 
contracted again in 2014, with fiscal austerity and impaired 
banking systems compounding the effects of a stronger 
euro. The European Central Bank announced significant 
easing measures in the summer, but stopped short of 
outright quantitative easing.
After strong growth in the first quarter, the Japanese 
economy slumped in the subsequent six months. The 
government’s decision to increase the consumption sales 
tax in April had a bigger negative impact than expected and, 
as a result, the Bank of Japan announced an aggressive 
scaling up of its quantitative and qualitative easing. The Abe 
government subsequently decided to postpone the second 
stage of the tax hike.
After the turmoil of 2013, many emerging economies 
experienced greater stability in 2014. Financial market 
sentiment improved significantly in India following the 
election of Narendra Modi as prime minister. While 
improvements in the real economy have been patchy, 
confidence is improving regarding India’s medium to longer 
term prospects. In Brazil and South Africa, growth finally 
stabilised after significant slowdowns. Russia’s economy 
weakened sharply in response to the escalating Ukrainian 
crisis and a significant fall in oil prices.
PROSPECTS
The world economy should strengthen in 2015–2016, with 
real GDP growth picking up to around 3½–3¾% per year, 
close to its historical average. Sharply lower oil prices should 
support activity in many oil consuming countries. The US is 
expected to lead the recovery, with GDP growth of at least 
3% a year. In Europe and Japan, growth should remain more 
modest given continuing concerns around government 
finances and the health of their banking systems and 
corporate sectors.
The turbulence in emerging economies has led to a  
more cautious assessment of their medium term growth 
prospects. With a less favourable external environment  
and increasing domestic challenges, the IMF has recently 
revised down again its forecasts for growth over the  
next three to five years. Lower commodity prices could 
undermine activity in commodity producing economies. 
Still, the powerful logic of convergence in living standards 
suggests there is considerable growth potential, especially 
in Asia and Africa. There is a great onus on domestic 
policymakers to implement much needed reforms to  
unlock this potential.
COMMODITY MARKETS
Throughout 2014, the prices of the commodities we 
produce displayed marked trend differences, as well as 
recording high volatility around those trends. Individual  
price performance reflected changing expectations of  
the macro-economic context, in particular global growth 
and the relative strength of the US dollar, the outlook  
for supply (which exceeded expectations in some key 
commodities) and the underlying industry cost structure  
of each commodity.

As expectations of growth in China were progressively 
revised downward and confidence was eroded in the 
outlook for the EU and Japan through the year, demand 
forecasts were lowered, which impacted the price 
performance of the bulk commodities in particular.
Iron ore experienced significant downward pressure in 
2014, with the price dropping by almost 50% over the 
course of the year. This reflected a fundamental oversupply 
in the market as the industry expanded output rapidly, even 
compared with guidance earlier in the year. Australia and 
Brazil, for example, increased output by an estimated 
140 Mt. This substantially exceeded incremental growth in 
demand, which almost halved in 2014, primarily as a result  
of a marked slowdown in key steel consuming sectors in 
China, particularly construction.
In the metallurgical coal markets, prices declined, with  
the hard coking coal spot price falling from an average  
of $147 /tonne in 2013 to $1 13/tonne in 2014. Despite 
year-on-year growth in steel production in the key demand 
regions of north-east Asia, India and Europe, import 
demand from China stalled on the back of slowing steel 
output growth and increased domestic production. At the 
same time, a depreciating Australian dollar, the ramp up of 
new projects and a productivity focus at existing operations 
supported overall year-on-year hard coking coal supply 
growth from Australia. These largely offset the impact  
of announced capacity closures there and elsewhere. 
Manganese, as a steelmaking raw material, also faced 
challenging conditions. Infrastructure constraints in 
South Africa were loosened, which eliminated a key 
bottleneck from the market, and South African production 
became the relevant price setting assets. 
Thermal coal also had a difficult year, with prices moving 
down from $84/tonne FOB Newcastle in 2013 to below 
$65/tonne by year end, a new five-year low. Weak Chinese 
buying continued to weigh on Asia-Pacific prices, with 
flagging Chinese domestic coal demand growth offset only 
partly by Indian demand growth. Weaker currencies in coal 
producing countries helped support production levels 
despite low prices, while there was no significant slowing  
in project execution, notably in Indonesia, which put further 
pressure on prices through the year. 
Copper prices came under pressure from around mid-year. 
Demand suffered from destocking in China, principally from 
bonded warehouses as a result of the financing scandal 
centred in the port of Qingdao. Concerns over potentially 
strong supply growth weighed on sentiment, as did the 
uncertain outlook for global growth and particularly that  
of the Chinese construction sector. However, support for 
prices was provided by strategic purchases made by the 
Chinese State Reserve Bureau; significant destocking from 
Chinese bonded warehouses reaching an end; exchange 
stock levels remaining relatively low; and by expectations 
that unfulfilled power infrastructure budget spending in 
China might begin to accelerate. The copper price fell by 
almost $700/tonne by mid-January 2015, with reports that 
some large Chinese hedge funds had played a role in the 
sudden weakness by selling large amounts of copper 
futures, forcing the price much lower.
Nickel prices were strong through most of the first six 
months on expectations that the ban on exports of nickel  
ore from Indonesia would lead to the global market moving 
into a deficit. They plummeted in the second half, however, 
owing to unexpectedly high levels of ore exports from the 
Philippines, lower than expected stainless demand and by 
an increase in highly visible LME inventories. This essentially 
delayed the still widely forecast tightness in the global 
market for the metal.
Phosphate fertiliser prices in Brazil were broadly unchanged 
year-on-year.
Niobium prices decreased slightly, due to production 
capacity increases running ahead of relatively flat demand, 
and the strength of the US dollar. 
Platinum and palladium prices exhibited very different 
trajectories in 2014; in the 12 months to December 2014, 
platinum prices dropped 10% while palladium prices rose  
by 12%. 
With regard to platinum, while demand was higher in 
aggregate for autocatalysts, industrial and jewellery 
applications, it was more than offset by weaker investment 
demand. On the supply side, the five-month South African 
strike had a major impact and reduced global platinum 
supply by 700,000 ounces. The positive price response  
on account of the apparent deficit was more muted  
than expected, partly owing to the existence of above 
ground stocks.
The palladium price, supported by a tighter supply-demand 
balance than platinum, as well as concerns over Russian 
supply, hit a 13-year high of $91 1 per ounce in early 
September, but thereafter followed platinum prices down.
End consumer demand for diamonds is estimated to have 
grown globally in 2014, in dollar terms. Increased economic 
activity and consumer confidence in the US reinforced 
demand for diamonds there, while in China, the growing 
middle class, and the ongoing penetration of diamonds in 
the bridal segment, continued to drive Chinese demand 
growth. De Beers’ own underlying rough price index was  
on average 5% higher than in 2013.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 Our diversified product portfolio provided us with a  
degree of insulation from the particularly sharp price falls  
for the bulk commodities of iron ore and coal, albeit in an 
environment where weaker commodity prices accounted 
for $2.4 billion
(1)
 of underlying EBIT reduction. The 
operational turnaround of a number of our priority 
operations and the continued weakening of many producer 
country currencies ($1.3 billion positive impact to underlying 
EBIT) also helped to mitigate the effects of the generally 
adverse pricing environment. After adjusting for the 
platinum strike, copper equivalent unit costs
(2) 
in local 
currency terms decreased by 3% (real) in 2014, and we 
have delivered a $500 million sustainable reduction in 
overhead and project study and evaluation costs compared 
to our 2012 baseline. Underlying EBIT of $4.9 billion, a 25% 
decrease, and underlying EBITDA of $7.8 billion, an 18% 
decrease, reflect the substantial operational progress we 
have made to restore the performance of our mines, though 
further progress is necessary to meet our return targets 
through the cycle. Underlying earnings reduced by 17%  
to $2.2 billion.
Our safety and environmental performance is a leading 
indicator of how we are running the business. The greater 
the degree of planned work and stable operations, the safer  
we will be. We have seen a very meaningful improvement 
across our key safety and environmental performance 
metrics, taking into account the five-month platinum strike, 
reflecting our focus on high risk activities, standards and 
controls. Despite the positive progress, I am saddened to 
report that we still lost six colleagues during the year, so we 
have a lot more work to do and our focus is unrelenting to 
achieve zero harm.
We have shown in 2014 that we are adapting and delivering 
and are on the right track to transform the performance  
of Anglo American. Our mining operations are the engine  
of our business and we have delivered higher and more 
consistent volumes, with a clear focus on increased stability, 
productivity, margins and returns. There is significantly more 
improvement potential as we continue to build the capability 
to achieve a step change in performance and returns from 
our exceptional resource endowment.
DELIVERING ON COMMITMENTS
We have delivered on the major operational and portfolio 
commitments for the year that we made to shareholders. 
Most prominently, we shipped our first ore from the 
Minas-Rio project in Brazil ahead of schedule in October, 
and expect to bring the project in $400 million below the 
revised budget. However, the steep drop in the iron ore  
price has resulted in a $3.5 billion post-tax write down in  
the carrying value of Minas-Rio. We are, though, clear  
about the asset’s potential and the differentiated nature  
of its high quality products in the market.
We have made substantial progress towards creating a 
platinum business fit for the future. We have defined the 
shape of our future platinum portfolio, taken the hard 
decisions to close down a number of shafts, restructured the 
assets that we plan to divest to demonstrate their long term 
commercial viability, set disposal processes under way and, 
most importantly, aligned our plans with government and 
with our employees.
I have been clear that a platform of operational excellence is 
fundamental to delivering the full potential of this business. 
Our top 16 priority assets contribute the majority of value to 
Anglo American and offer the scope for the greatest upside. 
The majority of those assets are now performing above plan 
(compared to only three in 2013) and the remainder are 
improving in line with our expectations.
We have focused urgent attention on the performance of 
our largest and most valuable mines, a number of which had 
become severely constrained in recent years due to a lack of 
mine development, with the positive results seen in our 2014 
operational performance. 
The redesign of the pit at the Sishen iron ore mine in  
South Africa and the implementation of our new Operating 
Model have successfully unlocked the challenge of excess 
waste material that needs to be mined to access the orebody. 
Sishen hit its target production level for 2014 of 35 million 
tonnes (Mt) of iron ore and is now on track to recover its 
production level to 38 Mt in 2016, in excess of our original  
37 Mt target. At the same time, its sister mine at Kolomela 
continues to outperform its nameplate capacity of 9 Mt per 
annum, producing 1 1.6 Mt in 2014, due to plant throughput 
optimisation, delivering ore feed at a lower unit cost and 
complementing the improving Sishen performance.
Similarly, at our Los Bronces copper mine in Chile, the  
waste backlogs and other pit constraints of previous years 
have been cleared and the mine and plant have been 
stabilised, enabling record material to be mined in the year 
and continuous ore to be fed into the plant. At the Collahuasi  
joint operation, also in Chile, the performance of the mining 
operation has been stabilised and improved and attention 
will move to the plant in 2015. As a result of these 
interventions to turn around the operations, we have been 
able to steadily increase production expectations for our 
Copper business during the year, to achieve full year 
production of 748 kt of copper, a 7% increase on the original 
guidance for the year.

08 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 The performance of our diamond business – De Beers –  
is a clear demonstration of the benefits and value of our 
diversified business model. The integration of De Beers  
into Anglo American is complete; De Beers contributed 
$1.4 billion of underlying EBIT in 2014, 28% of – and the 
second largest contributor to – the Group’s total, and 
delivered a 15% return on capital employed (ROCE).
DISCIPLINED ALLOCATION OF CAPITAL
Consistent with our focus on returns, we must be disciplined 
with our deployment of physical and financial resources to 
those assets that will provide us with the greatest value for 
capital employed and potential upside. Through our asset 
review process, we identified a number of assets – principally 
in our Platinum, Copper and Coal businesses – that are likely 
to deliver greater value under different ownership, enabling us 
to concentrate our resources on our most attractive priority 
assets. A number of sales processes are under way; however, 
our value hurdles will need to be met prior to divestment,  
in what is a challenging environment for asset sales. The 
proposed merger of Lafarge with Holcim, on which the sale 
of our 50% shareholding in Lafarge Tarmac to Lafarge is 
dependent, is progressing in line with the announced 
completion timetable of the first half of 2015 following a 
positive decision by the European Commission in December 
2014, but remains subject to certain other conditions.
We are committed to maintaining a robust capital structure 
which balances long term business value growth with 
sustainable capital returns to shareholders. In 2014, net  
debt increased to $12.9 billion and we expect to touch a 
peak level of $13.5-$14 billion during 2015, after receipt  
of Lafarge Tarmac sales proceeds. Anglo American is 
fortunate to have a world class resource endowment, 
including a number of attractive, predominantly brownfield 
options, for organic growth. We will continue to allocate 
capital to our most value accretive options and pursue a 
syndication approach for major greenfield developments,  
in line with managing individual risk exposures and  
achieving our long term net debt target of $10-$12 billion, 
assisted by our asset disposal programme.
Our revised Operating Model is delivering strong underlying 
results and we are building on those foundations to 
complete the next phase of the transformation process.  
Our focus on ROCE drives the right behaviours within the 
business and we are moving all the levers within our control 
to deliver $4 billion
(3)
 of additional EBIT in 2016 (compared 
to 2012 EBIT), all of which has now been fully scoped. We 
are intensifying our efforts to identify the additional EBIT 
necessary to mitigate recent downward pressure on prices.
PARTNERS IN THE FUTURE
Society’s expectations of the mining industry have long 
been in the spotlight, often for good reason, and our 
reputations can be shaped by the actions of others. At a 
global level, mining activity occupies a tiny fraction of the 
earth’s surface yet, to a community neighbouring a mine,  
it may feel somewhat different. The business imperative  
is clear; that without securing and sustaining our social 
licences to operate, more operations and developments will 
face disruption, costs will escalate further and opportunities 
will be lost on all fronts. We are working tirelessly through 
partnerships with the likes of the Kellogg Innovation 
Network and faith groups to change the status quo, to listen 
to what our host communities need – not what we think they 
need – and to uplift the industry to realise our vision of 
becoming real partners in their future. 
OUTLOOK
Despite the headlines of economic uncertainty and 
geopolitical tensions, the underlying fundamentals of our 
business – applying world class technical skills to world  
class assets – remain attractive over the long term. Declining 
ore grades, a very small number of new mineral discoveries 
and project developments, ever rising government and 
community expectations, and infrastructure and energy 
challenges all point towards a constrained supply picture  
for most of our products in a world where the major 
consuming economies are still growing, albeit at a slower 
pace of growth. China’s continuing growth slowdown  
has significantly altered the demand profile for many 
commodities, but successful reform and rebalancing should 
make the economy more resilient in the medium to longer 
term. While Europe and Japan are still struggling, we have 
seen more encouraging news on economic developments 
in the US and an apparent strengthening of India’s economy.
In the immediate term, I expect tough trading conditions  
to prevail during 2015, but we are determined to continue  
to build on our already very significant operational 
improvements, drive towards an effective and efficient 
organisation and culture, and to be unwavering in our  
capital discipline.
THANKS
On behalf of my executive colleagues, I would like to thank 
all our people – our employees and contractors – and the 
extensive network of stakeholders in our business for their 
continued dedication and support as we make the changes 
necessary to create a more agile, robust and sustainable 
Anglo American. We are transforming this business. We 
have a clear direction and we are creating a different, better 
future for Anglo American and for you all.
Lastly, I thank all the members of the Board, led by our 
chairman Sir John Parker, for sharing their extensive 
collective experience and providing the support for our 
strategy to deliver our full potential.

The mining industry continues to be at the heart 
of the world’s economic engine and will remain

commodities and precious metals and minerals 
that are essential for economic development  
and modern life.

For almost a hundred years, we have been mining the  
raw materials that society needs to develop and prosper.  
We provide our investors with a balanced portfolio of 
opportunities as we find, plan and build, mine, process, move 
and market a diversified and high quality range of products, 
spanning bulk commodities, base metals and minerals, and 
precious metals and minerals.
Having a diversified portfolio gives us options in terms of  
how and where we choose to allocate capital to grow the 
business, improve margins, generate returns and ultimately 
deliver value, and helps protect us through commodity and 
economic cycles. 
As a responsible 
miner, we are the 
custodians of some of the 
world’s most precious 
resources that enable 
economic development 
and modern

TOGETHER
Our ability to manage this diversification for value provides  
us with a competitive advantage. Knowing where along the 
chain, from exploration to marketing, we can leverage value 
from each of our different products is one of the many skills 
required in managing a diversified portfolio.
While our aim as a business has always been to generate 
returns for our shareholders, how we accomplish this – by 
striving to make a real and lasting contribution to society – is 
fundamental and defines us as a company. We believe this is 
best done through forming mutually beneficial partnerships, 
as reflected in our vision: ‘Partners in the future’.
We are clear that the delivery of consistent and superior cash 
returns and capital appreciation to shareholders will only 
endure if we deliver value to society, as seen through the 
eyes of our key constituencies: employees, governments, 
social stakeholders, customers and business partners. 
Achieving this balance is fundamental to our effectiveness  
as an organisation and our sustainability as a business.
  For more on how we deliver our strategy
 See pages 12–13
We are one of the industry leaders in resource 
development, mining and operational 
innovation to drive the delivery of exceptional 
returns from our assets for our shareholders. 
However, the delivery of returns to 
shareholders will only endure if we deliver 
value to society, as seen through the eyes of 
our key stakeholders.
We believe this is best done through forming 
mutually beneficial partnerships, as reflected 
in our mission: Together, we create sustainable 
value that makes a real difference. Working in 
this way we strive towards our ultimate vision, 
to be ‘Partners in the future’.
Mining remains at the heart of the world 
economy. Long term demand for products will 
continue to grow but the mining ‘supercycle’ of 
the past decade is over. Miners can no longer 
rely on high commodity prices to mask 
inefficiencies in their businesses.
The attractiveness of commodities, and 
stakeholder demands, can shift over time 
depending on business and social trends.  
Our diversified portfolio of products spans  
the economic development cycle and  
presents us with many options to create value 
and opportunities for all our stakeholders,  
and to work more effectively and efficiently  
as an organisation.
Through an ongoing focus on capital discipline 
and costs, we aim to double our 2014 operating 
profit by 2020, consistent with our 15% ROCE 
target by 2016

. 
Our strategy to achieve this ambition is split into 
three elements: 
 • Where we compete (Portfolio)
 • How we win (Performance)
 • Critical core skills (People)
The delivery of our strategy implies a major 
transformation. We have identified four 
immediate strategic imperatives to ensure  
the delivery of our strategy. 
1. Deliver Driving Value
2. Focus the portfolio
3. Develop core business processes
4. Create a high performance culture
We will measure results and ensure the 
implementation of our strategy through an 
holistic business scorecard that includes  
seven pillars of value. 
Our Organisation Model empowers our  
people to realise their full potential and that  
of our assets by ensuring that the right people 
are in the right roles, doing the right work.
Our Operating Model provides a  
structured approach to how we define, 
organise and deliver that work to improve  
our performance, enabling consistent  
delivery against expectations.  12

WHAT WE MUST DELIVER  
IN THE NEAR TERM
Our strategic imperatives
1. Deliver Driving Value
The delivery of this strategic 
imperative will help us rebuild our 
market credibility. We have already 
delivered a number of near term 
critical tasks:
 • Minas-Rio first ore on ship and  
ramp up under way
 • Restructure of Platinum business 
 • Operational turnaround at Copper 
 • Sishen mine optimisation
 • Finalising the organisation structure.
Ongoing tasks:
 • Roll out Operating Model to  
Priority 1 assets
 • Deliver $500 million sustainable  
cost reductions
 • Implement business scorecard
 • Reset our South African government 
and community relationships.
2. Focus the portfolio 
Our resource and asset participation 
will focus on positions where we 
believe we can deliver consistent 
margins to support high returns 
through the respective price cycles.
 • Achieve full potential in  
Priority 1 assets
 • Prioritise high value projects  
(e.g. Quellaveco)
 • Exit select Priority 3 and  
Priority 2 assets to simplify our 
portfolio and reduce net debt
 • Rescale our overheads appropriately 
 • Re-assess our value chain 
participation.
3. Develop core business processes
We aim to become industry leaders  
in critical areas, helping us to  
extract the maximum value from  
our assets and products.
Exploration 
Embed a self-funding model  
that positions us to compete  
for the next major undeveloped  
or potential resource in our  
selected commodities.
Operations 
Embed Anglo American’s  
Operating Model in our Priority 1 
assets by the end of 2016. 
Project delivery 
Drive our project delivery skills  
to the next level to reduce capital 
expenditure and provide more 
certainty around delivery of  
project outcomes. 
Marketing 
Ensure maximum value creation 
across the entire value chain – from 
mine to customer.
4. Create a high performance culture
Our people, across all facets of the 
business, are integral to the delivery 
of our strategy. We aim to provide the 
right environment in which to create  
a high performance culture. We are 
creating an organisation where all 
people are treated in such a way  
that they willingly give the best they 
have got.
Create a high performance 
leadership team 
A high performance culture starts 
with developing a high performance 
leadership team capable of 
developing a broader plan for our 
wider organisational culture. 
Organisation redesign 
We aim to retain and appoint the  
right people in critical organisation 
roles. We will continue to develop the 
organisation in this way.
Focused on delivery 
We will measure our progress  
through an holistic business 
scorecard comprising both financial 
and non-financial indicators, including 
our seven pillars of value. 13

REWARD SUCCESS
Remuneration  
Anglo American’s remuneration policy for executive directors is 
designed to ensure that senior management is encouraged to  
deliver the Group’s strategy in a responsible and sustainable manner.  
In addition to the basic salary, the main elements of the remuneration 
package are the annual bonus and long term incentive plan (LTIP).
Annual bonus
Annual bonus performance measures include:
 • At least 50% on underlying earnings per share (EPS). EPS is one  
of the Group’s key financial measures of performance and is set  
on an annual basis to ensure targets are demanding yet realistic
 • The remaining measures are non-financial and include project 
delivery, capital allocation, business improvement, stakeholder 
engagement and employee development
 • A deduction to bonus outcomes is applied if safety targets are  
not met.
To help ensure sustainable long term performance, 60% of any bonus 
that is paid to executive directors is deferred into shares for a minimum 
of three years. We are also able to reduce or claw back elements of the 
bonus in the event of a material misstatement of the Group’s results, 
misconduct or a material failing in risk management processes.

Long term incentive plan
The LTIP performance measures are aligned to our strategic  
objectives over a three-year performance period. LTIP awards that 
have vested must be held for an additional two years and there are 
similar claw back provisions to the annual bonus awards, helping ensure 
that executive interests are aligned with those of our shareholders.
The LTIP performance measures are:
 • One quarter of LTIP awards is measured against the Group’s  
TSR performance relative to the Euromoney Global Mining Index  
and one quarter relative to the constituents of the FTSE 100 index
 • The remaining half is based on attributable ROCE to reflect the 
strategic focus on disciplined capital allocation. The initial ROCE 
targets have been informed by the Group’s stated 2016 attributable 
ROCE aspiration.

NATURAL
In order for us to mine, we first 
need to find locations rich in 
the minerals our customers 
need. Once operational, we 
require water, electricity and 
fuel in order to run our mines, 
process our products and 
move them to our customers.

Comparatives have been reclassified to align with current year presentation.
Underlying earnings
Group underlying earnings were $2.2 billion, a 17% 
decrease (2013: $2.7 billion).
Net finance costs 
Net finance costs, before special items and 
remeasurements, excluding associates and joint  
ventures, were $256 million (2013: $276 million). The 
decrease was due to lower average LIBOR rates on 
borrowings and increased capitalised interest, offset  
by lower interest income.
Tax 
The effective rate of tax, before special items and 
remeasurements, including attributable share of associates’ 
and joint ventures’ tax, decreased from 32.0% in 2013 to 
29.8%. This lower rate was due to the impact of certain  
prior year adjustments, the remeasurement of withholding 
tax provisions across the Group, and the recognition of 
previously unrecognised losses. In future periods, it is 
expected that the effective tax rate will remain above the 
United Kingdom statutory tax rate.
Special items and remeasurements 
Special items and remeasurements, after tax and  
non-controlling interests, primarily relate to impairments  
in respect of the Minas-Rio iron ore project ($3.5 billion, 
post-tax), Peace River Coal and other operations within  
the Coal segment ($0.3 billion, post-tax), and costs in 
respect of the closure of the Drayton coal mine in Australia  
($0.2 billion, post-tax). Full details of the special items  
and remeasurements charges are to be found in note 6  
to the financial statements.
Falling prices across most of our commodities ($2.4 billion 
impact
(1)
), and the five-month strike at Platinum ($0.8 billion 
impact) more than offset the increases in underlying EBIT, 
most notably at De Beers.
The Group’s results also benefited from currency 
fluctuations in the countries where the operations are based. 
The strengthening of the US dollar against the South African 
rand and the Australian dollar resulted in a $1.3 billion 
favourable exchange variance in underlying EBIT compared 
with 2013. CPI inflation had an adverse $0.8 billion impact 
on underlying EBIT. Further gains were also made through 
moderation of input costs and cost reduction initiatives.
Net debt increased by $2.2 billion to $12.9 billion  
(2013: $10.7 billion) and total capital expenditure remained 
broadly flat at $6.0 billion (2013: $6.1 billion). 
OPERATIONAL PERFORMANCE –  
PRODUCTION/COSTS 
In contrast to the financial performance, operational 
performance across the majority of our commodities 
improved compared with the prior year. Production at 
Kumba Iron Ore (Kumba) increased by 14%, with a  
strong performance at both Kolomela and Sishen, and 
metallurgical coal production at Coal – Australia and Canada 
increased by 12% driven by improved operating equipment 
efficiencies at Grasstree. In addition, Minas-Rio produced 
0.7 Mt (wet basis) in 2014 after commencing operations  
in the fourth quarter and reaching first ore on ship on  
25 October. Platinum production (equivalent refined)  
was down 21%, largely driven by the 532,000 ounces lost  
as a result of the strike affecting three sites in South Africa.
Costs at Coal – Australia and Canada were down 8% largely 
in relation to labour, contractors and maintenance, while at 
Nickel lower electricity tariffs resulted in a 5% decrease in 
production costs. Costs at our South African operations 
increased as a result of inflationary pressures in the country, 
although underlying cost reduction initiatives, specifically in 
relation to corporate restructuring, have made progress.
Platinum unit costs increased by 20% from 2013, owing  
to the continued incurrence of costs during the strike in  
the first half of the year. However, during the strike, lower 
variable costs as a result of the ‘no work, no pay policy’ 
resulted in cost savings of $300 million.

BALANCE SHEET
Net assets of the Company totalled $32.2 billion at 
31 December 2014 (31 December 2013: $37.4 billion).
This decrease resulted from impairments of $3.9 billion,  
the impact of the weaker South African rand and Australian 
dollar of $1.9 billion, depreciation of $2.8 billion and net 
drawdown of additional debt of $1.8 billion. This was partially 
offset by capital expenditure for the year of $6.0 billion, and 
capitalised interest of $0.4 billion.
GROUP ROCE
Attributable ROCE was 8% in 2014 (2013: 1 1%) as a 
consequence of weaker commodity prices, alongside 
ongoing capital expenditure, primarily at Minas-Rio and 
Grosvenor, partially offset by depreciating foreign exchange 
and a lower proportion of post-tax earnings attributable  
to non-controlling interests. The 8% in 2014 would have  
been 10% at 30 June 2013 exchange rates and commodity 
prices. Average attributable capital employed increased 
from $39.7 billion in 2013 to $40.4 billion in 2014. No 
improvement to ROCE has been realised as a result of  
the impairments at Minas-Rio and Coal, in line with the 
ROCE methodology as described on page 203.

Liquidity and funding
At 31 December 2014, the Group had undrawn committed 
bank facilities of $8.4 billion and cash of $6.7 billion.
The Group’s forecasts and projection, taking account  
of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
indicate the Group’s ability to operate within the level of  
its current facilities for the foreseeable future.
At 31 December 2014, Anglo American’s ratings were 
Moody’s Baa2 (negative outlook) and Standard & Poor’s 
BBB (negative outlook).
Net debt
Net debt is a measure of the Group’s financial position.  
The Group uses net debt to monitor the sources and  
uses of financial resources, the availability of capital to  
invest or return to shareholders, and the resilience of the  
balance sheet. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings 
less cash and cash equivalents (including derivatives which 
provide an economic hedge of debt).
The reconciliation in the table above is the method by  
which management reviews movements in net debt and 
comprises key movements in cash and any significant 
non-cash movements on net debt items.
Net debt increased by $2.2 billion to $12.9 billion  
(2013: $10.7 billion) and net debt to total capital at  
31 December 2014 was 28.6%, compared with 22.2%  
at 31 December 2013. 
Cash flow from operations
In 2014, there was a cash reduction in working capital of  
$9 million compared with 2013. This was mainly driven by a 
$576 million decrease in debtors, reflecting the receipt of 
high year end 2013 debtors at Copper and Kumba following 
a production outperformance at the end of that year. There 
was no similar build in debtors at the end of 2014. This 
reduction has been offset by an increase in stock of  
$129 million, primarily due to rail and port constraints at 
Kumba, as well as stock increases at De Beers, partially 
offset by reductions in high stock levels due to strike action 
at Platinum. A decrease in creditors of $438 million, driven 
by working capital requirements at Cerrejón, offset the 
remaining year-on-year working capital movement.
20 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT GROUP FINANCIAL REVIEW Attributable free cash flow
Total capital expenditure remained broadly flat at  
$6.0 billion (2013: $6.1 billion). Capital expenditure is  
shown net of proceeds on the disposal of property, plant  
and equipment (2014: $71 million, 2013: $140 million)  
and is net of capital expenditure funded by the minority 
partner at Quellaveco (2014: $42 million, 2013: $46 million). 
Prior year comparatives have been re-presented to align 
with current year presentation. 
Net debt is expected to continue to rise in 2015, as 
expenditure on the Group’s projects offsets cash generated 
from operations.
The majority of dividends paid to non-controlling interests  
of $823 million (2013: $1,159 million) were to minority 
shareholders of Copper and Kumba, where external 
dividends of $1 16 million and $674 million were paid 
respectively (2013: $474 million and $663 million).
Disposals are mainly due to the receipt of deferred proceeds 
related to the formation of the Lafarge Tarmac joint venture.

for the year (2013: 85 US cents per share), subject to 
shareholder approval at the Annual General Meeting to be 
held on 23 April 2015.
The maintenance of the level of the dividend reflects the 
Board’s confidence in the underlying business. This 
recommendation is consistent with the commitment to  
have a disciplined balance between the maintenance of  
a strong investment grade rating, returns to shareholders 
and sequencing of future investment in line with resulting 
funding capacity. From time to time any cash surplus to 
requirements will be returned to shareholders.

Minas-Rio project was 
loaded on to a vessel at 
Açu, en route to China.
MINAS-RIO DELIVERS
The delivery of first ore on ship from the Minas-Rio iron  
ore project in Brazil, $400 million below the revised 
capital budget of $8.8 billion, represented one of our three 
major commitments to shareholders in 2014. The first 
cargo of more than 80,000 tonnes of iron ore for the blast 
furnace pellet feed market was loaded on to a chartered 
vessel at the dedicated export terminal at the port of Açu  
in Rio de Janeiro state in October, arriving eight weeks later 
at the port of Zhanjian in southern China.
What sets Minas-Rio apart is its rare magnitude and 
quality. One of the world’s biggest undeveloped iron ore 
resources, its Ore Reserves have more than doubled since 
2013, and are currently 2.8 billion tonnes (at 34.4% Fe). 
Minas-Rio produces high quality products, with a high  
iron content of around 67.5%, and low impurity (alumina 
and silica are below 3%), and is expected to capture  
a significant portion of the pellet feed market. Real  
long term cash costs are likely to be around the  
$33–$35/tonne mark, placing it among the world’s  
major low cost iron ore operations.
The focus now at Minas-Rio is on a safe ramp up to 
between 24 and 26.5 million tonnes (wet basis) of  
saleable products of iron ore pellet feed in 2016.
Minas-Rio is favourably placed on the global cost curve  
and provides Anglo American with a major long life asset 
with which to compete in the global seaborne iron ore 
market. It also offers the optionality and the marketing 
benefits of being able to supply iron ore from two 
continents, providing Anglo American with clear 
competitive advantage.  COMPETING

DIVERSE PORTFOLIO
A DIVERSIFIED APPROACH
The primary source of competitive advantage in the mining 
industry is to own high quality assets in the most attractive 
commodities. Leadership can be achieved by operating 
such assets to their full capability while optimising the 
development of their resource potential to ensure strong 
future asset positioning. 
Given the dynamic industry landscape, the attractiveness of 
commodities can shift over time depending on business and 
social trends. The ability to anticipate trends and manage 
our portfolio within this context is critical to delivering 
sustainable business returns. 
Understanding these industry ‘rules’, Anglo American has 
made clear choices about where it will compete. This has led 
to a diversified portfolio approach to position the company 
well to take advantage of opportunities across commodities, 
geographies and the mining value chain. This approach also 
helps us cope with downturns and other industry turbulence. 
Within our portfolio, we maintain a clear and disciplined 
focus on our ‘Priority 1’ (P1 ) assets as these are our greatest 
source of both short term returns and of potential long term 
value creation.
A range of attractive commodities  
across geographies
We participate in a range of commodities we believe 
possess attractive medium to long term fundamentals  
and which span all stages of the economic development 
cycle. Our diversified portfolio offers exposure to bulk 
commodities and base metals to precious metals and 
diamonds (through De Beers). Our bulk commodities 
include iron ore, manganese, metallurgical coal and thermal 
coal, all of which benefit from the continued industrialisation 
and urbanisation in emerging economies. Our base  
metals and minerals include copper, nickel, niobium and 
phosphates and offer mid-cycle exposure. In precious 
metals and minerals, we are the global leader in both 
platinum and diamonds. These areas are typically later  
cycle, with strong demand coming from more developed, 
higher GDP areas, such as the US, Japan and the major 
cities in China.
While copper, diamonds and iron ore are our top priorities 
and areas of investment, we are not limited by these 
preferences. We continue to review opportunities across 
our full range of preferred commodities.
Our portfolio is multi-regional, which further positions us  
to access the best opportunities and helps ensure a balance 
of political and currency risks. Our mining operations, 
growth projects and exploration and marketing activities 
extend across southern Africa, South America, Australia, 
North America, Asia and Europe. 
At Anglo American, we believe that being a  
global diversified mining company positions  
us best for long term value creation.

PORTFOLIO: WHERE WE COMPETE A clear focus on the best assets
Within our diversified portfolio, we are increasingly focused 
on higher quality resources and assets which can deliver 
consistently high margins through commodity cycles. While 
we manage all holdings in this portfolio to the best of our 
ability, the clear focus is on P1 assets. P1 assets command 
the most attention of the business unit and Group 
management time and are prioritised for capital allocation  
to ensure they reach their full potential. 
We determine asset priority through a careful assessment  
of strategic attractiveness and ultimate value creation 
potential. We consider and analyse a number of factors, 
including cost position, endowment and resource scale  
and quality, life and specific risk, alongside relevant 
qualitative factors. We then overlay our view of  
commodity attractiveness.
Our 16 P1 assets contributed 90% of our underlying EBIT  
in 2014. Furthermore, the majority of our capital expenditure 
related to P1 assets.
‘Priority 2’ (P2) assets are those which we believe have 
exciting cash generation potential, though not on the  
same scale as P1 assets. We nurture these assets and 
resource positions to deliver material contributions to 
returns, or redeploy our efforts and capital where this is not 
possible. We typically provide ‘lighter touch’ support to P2 
assets which often act as a good training ground for talent 
and innovation. 
Lowest priority assets are those that would be better 
managed by another operator because we choose not to 
invest in them fully, given finite resources and management 
time. Some are managed for value, while we look to exit 
others where appropriate. We are continuing to define and 
execute our asset divestment programme.
Selective value chain participation
Our portfolio and operational focus is predominantly 
upstream, generally in resource and mine development  
and operations. We invest in downstream activities and 
facilities only if they help sustain or increase profits through 
the value chain and have developed leading capabilities in 
select areas.
OUR APPROACH TO CAPITAL ALLOCATION
Across the Group, we continue to apply our capital allocation 
model in line with our portfolio strategy, while maintaining 
the objective of optimising our investment in the business in 
order to deliver superior returns. 
The model is built on the principles of living within our  
means and funding our growth from internal cash flow, a 
rigorous approach to capital approval, and managing our 
balance sheet to ensure appropriate levels of gearing and 
financial risk. 
Our investment decisions reflect the ongoing application  
of our capital planning and review processes. Every year, 
capital plans from across the Group undergo a detailed 
prioritisation process that ensures our capital budget is 
affordable under a range of commodity price scenarios,  
is focused on the highest priority areas of our portfolio,  
is technically sound, and is advancing projects which we 
expect to deliver suitably attractive returns. 
In addition to this, all material new investments (either in 
existing or new operations) are evaluated to ensure an 
appropriate balance between technical and financial risk 
and supporting the businesses to develop their most 
attractive new projects.
Study and evaluation expenditure
The Group continues to study a series of expansionary 
projects, with a range of options, to deliver profitable  
growth. Our focus is on ensuring we have a series of  
low risk, high return brownfield expansion options,  
targeted on our highest priority assets. 
Studies in progress include examining the optimal 
expansion path for Platinum’s Mogalakwena mine, the 
potential to further optimise the Moranbah-Grosvenor 
metallurgical coal hub, life extension possibilities in  
South African thermal coal, and further optimisation of 
Kumba’s Kolomela mine. The Group has reviewed its 
approach to project development, with a new emphasis on 
ensuring that extensive desktop studies of available options 
are completed prior to moving projects through study 
phases, so that the most attractive projects are identified 
and then progressed in the most efficient manner through  
to execution. These include the Quellaveco copper project, 
where the feasibility study is expected to be completed in 
2015. This revised approach has resulted in study and 
evaluation costs falling to $218 million in 2014, compared 
with $326 million in 2013.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 Platinum group metals exploration accounted for $8 million 
and was mainly focused on reviewing and repositioning the 
project portfolio within South Africa’s Bushveld Complex.  
In addition, prospecting for platinum group metals was also 
conducted around our Unki platinum mine in Zimbabwe. 
Diamond exploration was $37 million and related to  
work conducted in Angola, Botswana, Canada, India and 
South Africa. The exploration team continued to provide 
technical services to the resource extension programmes 
for the Jwaneng and Orapa mines in Botswana.
Exploration
Exploration is a clear strategic choice for Anglo American  
to deliver transformative value creation via discovery of  
P1 assets, maximise value at key operations, and to position 
us to compete for the next major undeveloped or potential 
resource in our selected commodities. We continue to have 
a diversified portfolio of exploration opportunities in highly 
endowed brownfield environments as well as key land 
positions and partnerships in frontier belts. Through an 
emphasis on ‘Smart Discovery’, the team applies innovative 
exploration concepts and techniques to both frontier and 
established districts.
Global exploration activity for 2014 concentrated on 
greenfield projects across a number of mature and frontier 
locations, as well as on adding value, through increasing 
resources and reserves, to our operations and advanced 
projects across all our commodities. Exploration 
expenditure for the year amounted to $181 million  
(2013: $207 million) and spanned 19 countries.
Copper exploration expenditure of $37 million consisted 
mainly of near-mine and greenfield exploration drilling in 
Chile and assessing the potential in the Quellaveco district  
in Peru. Greenfield exploration was conducted in Argentina, 
Australia, Brazil, Chile, Colombia, Indonesia, Kalaallit Nunaat 
(Greenland), Peru, the US and Zambia. Polymetallic 
(copper-nickel-platinum group elements) exploration 
expenditure (included within the nickel commodity line as 
disclosed in note 4 to the financial statements) amounted  
to $15 million and was concentrated on the Sakatti project  
in northern Finland. Greenfield polymetallic exploration  
was also conducted in the Mosku region of Finland and the 
Canadian Arctic. Nickel exploration expenditure amounted 
to $1 million and targeted nickel sulphides in the Morro Sem 
Boné district in Brazil. Phosphates exploration expenditure 
totalled $4 million and was concentrated on assessment  
of district-wide greenfield prospects and further definition 
drilling at the advanced Morro Preto phosphates project in 
central Brazil.
Expenditure on metallurgical coal exploration totalled 
$8 million. This included drilling, seismic surveys in the 
Middlemount region in Australia, and coal quality analysis 
and resource assessment work on the tenements 
surrounding the Peace River Coal Trend Mine and Roman 
Project in Canada. Expenditure on thermal coal and coal 
bed methane (CBM) exploration in Africa amounted  
to $9 million. This was incurred primarily on coal drilling  
and analysis in South Africa and Botswana, and on CBM  
drilling and analysis in South Africa. Iron ore exploration 
expenditure of $25 million was concentrated around 
operations in South Africa and greenfield projects in Liberia.

PORTFOLIO: WHERE WE COMPETE Projects and capital expenditure
In 2014, capital expenditure amounted to $6.0 billion,  
of which $3.2 billion was committed to expansionary 
projects and $2.0 billion to sustaining our existing business. 
Expansionary capex remains concentrated on the delivery 
of our portfolio of major projects (Minas-Rio, Barro Alto and 
Grosvenor). As these projects transition into operational 
production, expansionary capital will decrease, which  
will enable the Group to further align its level of growth 
investment with prevailing commodity market conditions. 
Projects in ramp up in 2014
In addition to delivering first ore on ship at Minas-Rio in 
October, the Group also completed the Boa Vista Fresh 
Rock (BVFR) niobium and Cerrejón P40 thermal coal 
projects in 2014. 
The BVFR project delivered first production in November, 
and is expected to reach full nameplate capacity in 2017. 
When fully ramped up, production from existing operations 
is expected to increase to 6,800 tonnes of niobium per 
annum (2014: 4,700 tonnes). 
The Cerrejón P40 project was also completed, increasing 
infrastructure capacity for coal exports. Ramp up of  
capacity at the shiploaders will continue in 2015, although 
production capacity is expected to be constrained at  
35 million tonnes per annum (Mtpa) owing to market  
and operational constraints.
Projects advanced in 2014
The Grosvenor metallurgical coal project in Queensland 
advanced towards its target of first longwall coal production 
in late 2016. Once complete, the project is expected to 
deliver 5 Mtpa of high quality metallurgical coal for the 
seaborne market. The Group is also evaluating surface 
infrastructure options to fully capture the value from the 
Moranbah-Grosvenor complex.
At Venetia in South Africa, De Beers continues to advance 
the development of the underground project, with the 
expectation of first underground production in 2021. 
In Nickel, the rebuild of the first of Barro Alto’s two  
furnaces is under way, with the expectation that the plant  
will reach nameplate capacity during 2016.
Projects initiated in 2014
In line with its increased focus on capital discipline and 
responding to market conditions, the Group approved 
relatively few new projects in 2014. 
At De Beers, the Gahcho Kué project commenced 
construction following receipt of necessary permits and 
licences and is expected to deliver an estimated 52 million 
carats (100% basis) over its 13-year life from the second  
half of 2016. De Beers’ 51% share of Gahcho Kué’s capital 
expenditure is approximately $0.5 billion. The Group  
also supported investment in a new treatment plant at  
the Letlhakane diamond mine in Botswana, a low risk,  
high return project designed to process the extensive 
tailings mineral resource that has been deposited over  
30 years. De Beers’ 19.2% share of capital expenditure  
is less than $0.1 billion.
Acquisition and disposal activity
In July, Anglo American announced that it had reached  
a binding agreement to sell its 50% holding in Lafarge 
Tarmac to Lafarge SA (Lafarge) for a minimum value of 
£885 million (approximately $1.35 billion at present) in  
cash, on a debt- and cash-free basis, and subject to other 
customary working capital adjustments. The sale is subject 
to a number of conditions, including the completion of the 
proposed merger of Lafarge and Holcim Limited.
In December, the Group also gave notice to the Peruvian 
government to terminate the 2007 privatisation agreement, 
which has resulted in Anglo American withdrawing from the 
exploration phase Michiquillay copper project.

FOCUSING ON OUR BEST ASSETS
Mogalakwena is a Priority 1 asset and the flagship 
operation in our Platinum portfolio. Although the mine’s 
operating costs are already among the lowest in the 
industry, over the past two years the focus has been  
on implementing a number of business improvement 
initiatives to raise productivity and reduce costs further –  
maximising the value delivered from the asset, with 
minimal additional capital commitment.
The main initiatives include increasing the effectiveness  
of the mine’s drills, explosives, diesel, shovels and mining 
trucks. These are yielding significant improvements in 
availability and utilisation. For example, since 2012, drill 
penetration has improved by 36%, while mining truck 
utilisation – which has increased by 15% over the same 
period – is now considered to be world class.
In 2014, Mogalakwena delivered more than 350,000 
ounces of platinum, an increase of 50,000 ounces over 
2012. Collectively, the business improvement initiatives 
have resulted in a 33% increase in total tonnes mined  
over the past two years. In 2015, we will be implementing  
Anglo American’s Operating Model at the mine and expect 
to increase production to 360,000 ounces while incurring 
limited capital spend.
As well as improving operational performance in the short 
term, the team at Mogalakwena plans to maximise returns 
over the longer term. The strategic mining plan has been 
scrutinised and revised accordingly, with the resultant aim 
of reducing total tonnage mined by more than 85 million 
tonnes per annum (Mtpa), against the previous plan of in 
excess of 200 Mtpa. The consequent fall in the stripping 
ratio is estimated to save the company close to $3 billion  
in avoided cost increases over the next 20 years. 29 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014

OPERATING PERFORMANCE
safer, more efficient, environmentally friendly and sustainable 
ways to unlock mineral value.
The third pillar is Anglo American’s Operating Model,  
which forms a strong foundation from which we can build  
and transform the business. 
OPERATING MODEL FOCUS
Doing the fundamentals better is key to ensuring reliable and 
predictable performance. Using a single operating model for 
how we set targets, plan, manage, execute and improve our 
work brings a consistency of approach, a common language 
and way of working across the business, irrespective of 
history or culture. By getting the basics right, and operating 
our assets to their full potential, we will enhance our long term 
operational capability.
Key principles
There are three basic principles underpinning the  
Operating Model:
Produce stability: Stable operations deliver  
predictable outcomes. 
 • Instability comes from unanticipated conditions or actions 
that destroy our ability to make reliable predictions.
 • Stable and capable operations experience lower operating 
costs and fewer capital expenditure requirements.
Reduce variation: Lower variation in operational 
performance increases capability and efficiency. 
 • All processes have variation: the key is to reduce variation 
either at the input stage or within the process.
Provide clarity: T eam members who have a clear 
understanding of their own work, and how their team works, 
produce consistent and repeatable outcomes.
Over the past year , we have continued to review 
our organisation and implement vital changes to 
ensure the sustainability of our business.

RIGHT WORK, RIGHT TIME, RIGHT WAY
The changes implemented in 2014 have been far reaching. 
We are rebuilding our operational and technical capability  
to drive improved performance. As part of this focus, our 
new Operating Model is bringing a consistent and stable 
approach to how we do all our work – this includes the way 
we mitigate our environmental impact. By ensuring more 
predictable performance at our operations we are able to 
optimise the mine-to-market value chain, and ultimately 
respond better to customer demands.
REBUILDING TECHNICAL EXCELLENCE
Our business turnaround is dependent on rebuilding our 
operational and technical capability. T o do this, our T echnical 
and Sustainability function’s strategy has three pillars: 
technical leverage, technical innovation and Anglo American’s 
Operating Model. We have established a new leadership team 
whose focus is to deliver on all three pillars.
T echnical leverage will come from having highly capable  
and knowledgeable people in the right roles. We have been 
able to demonstrate how technical leverage works in practice 
through an integrated approach to technical initiatives piloted  
at Minas-Rio in 201 4. T eams from both Minas-Rio and 
elsewhere in Anglo American worked seamlessly, based on 
clear roles, responsibilities and accountabilities. In 201 5, the 
same disciplined approach is being used to structure a jointly 
managed programme of improvement initiatives across our 
Los Bronces, Sishen, Mogalakwena and Kolomela 
operations. Across the Group our focus will be on raising 
operations to a consistent level of best practice, improving 
fundamental operating performance against a detailed 
framework of ‘what good looks like’.
Through FutureSmart™, Anglo American’s approach to 
innovation, we will accelerate our ability to use innovation  
and technology to address our critical challenges and to find

PERFORMANCE: HOW WE WIN Outcomes
Central to the Operating Model is the discipline of planned 
work, which has been proven across many industries to 
deliver substantial benefits:
Productivity 
 • Planned work is 30% more productive than  
unplanned work. 
Costs 
 • An unplanned breakdown of in-service equipment  
can cost 10 times more than a planned shutdown.
 • Stable and capable operations experience lower operating 
costs, and have fewer capital expenditure requirements.
Safety
 • Planned work is 70% safer than unplanned work.
Environment
 • Most environmental discharges result from unplanned 
stoppages of in-service equipment.
The Operating Model pilot implementation took place at  
Kumba’s Sishen North mine during 2014. The main benefit 
identified has been the detailed integrated work schedule, 
designed to deliver safe production, in line with the  
forecast in the short to medium term mine plan. Through 
implementing the Operating Model in ore and internal  
waste operations, with a clear focus on how work is 
managed and executed, the mine is consistently delivering 
significantly higher average daily volumes. This has been 
achieved through: 
 • Improving scheduled work from 20% to around 70%
 • A 23% efficiency improvement in total tonnes handled 
 • A 50% reduction in waiting time on shovels.
We expect this improvement to continue and stabilise as the 
programme embeds into working practices. Stabilisation is 
the period of greatest adjustment for most people. There are 
new role holders in place, existing role holders performing 
new tasks, new management routines, and additional 
training in new systems and processes. It represents a 
transition phase stretching over many months. The Sishen 
North mine implementation is guiding the roll out to the rest 
of the mine, focused initially on waste mining, and at the 
Kolomela plant. Lessons from the pilot have been integrated 
into the overall implementation approach across the Group.
The Operating Model journey
Successful implementation of the Operating Model is  
reliant on all of our people being clear about the work to be 
undertaken, and also on their being inspired to work together. 
Following nine months of preparation, we have now derived  
a comprehensive system for intervening in matters of 
operational performance. It is based on our two business 
models coming together. The Operating Model defines the 
work: right work, right time, right way; the Organisation Model 
defines accountability for its delivery: right people, right roles.
Roll out programme
Building capability internally is crucial to the programme’s 
success and its sustainability over the long term. Our Centre 
for Experiential Learning, a dedicated internal training facility, 
will support Operating Model skills development. T argeted at 
managerial and supervisory levels, and run on the lines of a 
professional adult learning institute, teams will learn to apply 
the Operating Model tools through a mix of virtual reality, 
modelling and real-time scenarios. This innovative and 
industry leading facility is planned to be fully operational  
from mid-201 5.
Roll out of the programme has been carefully prioritised in 
terms of impact, readiness and resources. The initial focus is 
on the most important value creating assets and those with 
the greatest long term potential. Businesses not included  
in the early programme will receive training on some of the 
Operating Model’s key elements, in particular the analysis of 
data and business improvement.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 In 201 4, we completed a review of the ‘route to market’  
for a number of commodities. This has resulted in several 
initiatives, including increasing direct sales to end customers 
rather than through sales agents. 
During the year, we experienced significant uplift from  
direct PGM sales to new customers through concentrating  
on the Asian market. In addition, we adopted a more proactive 
approach to ruthenium and iridium marketing, thereby 
significantly increasing the revenue and profit contribution 
from these lesser known PGMs.
During 201 4, a new copper concentrates sales book was 
created to improve commercial value, implement alternative 
approaches to pricing, and ultimately create long term 
strategic partnerships with customers. 
Product optimisation continues to be an area of focus. During 
the year, Marketing worked closely with Kumba to generate a 
higher value product mix based on market demand. Such 
value creation is expected to increase in 201 5 and 2016, as 
lump ore volumes continue to grow.
Various value chain optimisation activities in the year created 
additional earnings. These included the optimisation of the 
growing shipping portfolio by linking freight trades and 
optimising freight contracts and efficiencies. During 201 4, the 
link was made with iron ore freight trades from South Africa to 
China and thermal coal freight trades from Indonesia to India, 
thereby realising cost benefits relative to stand-alone routes. 
With the addition of Minas-Rio volumes, there are now further 
opportunities to capture value through greater synergies 
across the Marketing portfolio.
Good progress has been made with the move into trading. 
This is a new activity for Anglo American and has been 
approached with a pilot in thermal coal. The initial focus has 
been primarily on asset backed trading (buying and selling 
physical materials, using associated financial trading tools to 
manage the price and delivery risks). Our trading strategy is 
designed to take advantage of the maturity of the thermal  
coal market by benefiting from opportunities to improve 
profitability and increase returns, and to build capabilities 
which will allow us to create additional future value. This 
includes improving capabilities in areas such as supporting 
processes, systems, position management, and active  
price management.
MARKETING PRODUCTS FOR FULL VALUE
As commodity markets and the business models of miners 
and traders evolve, we are changing our marketing approach 
and strategy to ensure maximum value creation across the 
entire value chain – from mine to customer.
The establishment, on 1 January 201 4, of the Marketing 
business unit (‘Marketing’) forms an important step to enable 
us to improve customer focus and, in turn, refine our approach 
to our various markets. Marketing is now responsible for all 
sales and marketing activities for iron ore, metallurgical  
coal, thermal coal, platinum group metals (PGMs), copper, 
nickel, and niobium. Marketing is also responsible for the 
management of all associated risk. The management and 
improvement of risk systems, processes and standards  
was a major focus during 201 4, as we bedded down the  
new business unit and initiated trading activities.
Through our dedicated sales and marketing hubs in 
Singapore, London and Luxembourg, we are now closer  
to our customers both geographically and commercially. 
Internally, collaboration and knowledge sharing are achieved 
through co-location of marketing teams and specialist 
resources, including shipping, market intelligence, trading, 
and risk and performance management.
Our aim is to generate additional profit through four  
principal levers:
Marketing excellence: getting the basics right.
Product optimisation: working with the mines to optimise 
product offering – for example, blending products to create 
the precise quality desired by individual customers.
Value chain optimisation: creating an efficient flow from 
mine to market so that customers get the right products,  
at the right time, and leveraging shipping services.
Trading: buying and selling third party material to 
complement the physical portfolio.
The target, which forms part of the Driving Value initiative, is 
an additional $400 million in EBIT by the end of 2016, with the 
majority of this generated through additional income. A large 
proportion of this additional value is currently being generated 
through the marketing excellence activities, with other levers 
becoming increasingly important over time. 
32 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
PERFORMANCE: HOW WE WIN MANAGING OUR IMPACT ON THE ENVIRONMENT
The benefit that mining delivers to society also comes  
with an impact on the environment; this can be 
disproportionately borne by the communities adjacent to  
the mines, many of which rely on the land and ecosystem 
services. Anglo American believes that it has a responsibility 
to manage its impact on the environment in such a way  
that, on balance, host communities can benefit from the 
mining activities. This implies striking the optimal balance 
between environmental and other impacts with the societal 
benefits of mining. Achieving an acceptable balance for our 
stakeholders influences our acceptance by society, and can 
influence our future access to mining opportunities and  
long term business success and viability. 
Growing regulatory and social pressure, increasing 
demands for limited natural resources, the rising costs  
of and demand for energy and water, and mine closure  
and future land use issues, all support the business 
imperative for responsible environmental management. 
Within this context, the principal environmental risks  
facing our business are associated with water and climate  
change. In our Sustainable Development Report we also 
report on land management, biodiversity, waste and air 
quality as other important issues that require specific 
management attention.
We continue to make progress towards achieving our  
long term environmental goals and internal targets. Tangible 
improvements in reducing our impact include improved 
efficiencies, which achieve associated cost savings and 
productivity benefits.
Strategy and management approach
We seek to manage our environmental risks by 
understanding and evaluating both our impacts and benefits 
and by taking advantage of opportunities that deliver  
long term value to our stakeholders. Our environmental 
strategies have three main focus areas: driving operational 
excellence; investing in technology; and engaging and 
partnering with our stakeholders. 
Anglo American’s Environment Way, which includes 
performance standards covering all our environmental 
impacts, guides our approach to robust and responsible 
environmental management. Our mine closure 
performance requirements and toolbox offer specific 
guidance on mine closure planning and we now have a 
dedicated team to provide expert input into mine closure 
planning and management.
Environmental incidents
The reporting and understanding of significant environmental 
incidents is aligned with Anglo American’s learning from 
incidents process which ensures optimum learning from our 
mistakes. Anglo American reports environmental incidents in 
terms of five levels of severity according to their consequence 
and impact. 
In 201 4, 1 4 Level 3 (medium impact) environmental incidents 
were reported, and one Level 4 (high impact), which resulted  
in an acidic water discharge at Coal South Africa’s Landau 
mine polluting a stream causing some discolouration and 
metal precipitation for several kilometres. Systems at Landau 
have been improved and the stream remediation is complete. 
No Level 5 (major impact) incidents occurred during the  
year. All incidents are addressed on site and the root causes 
determined and mitigated in order to prevent repeats. 
Remedial action has been completed for three of the Level 3 
incidents and is in progress at the rest. Where appropriate, 
learning points are shared with operational managers across 
the Group.
Environmental legislation is tightening and regulatory 
developments remain uncertain in a number of countries 
where we operate. Chile is enforcing legislation more 
rigorously, as part of the country’s environmental regulation 
reform process. Our Los Bronces operation is addressing  
a non-compliance relating to afforestation plans and waste 
dump acid drainage generation. A fine of $3.4 million  
was imposed for regulatory breaches associated with 
afforestation and water quality at El Soldado. Remediation 
plans are being implemented at both operations.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 WATER
Like most of the mining industry, our business is highly  
reliant on water; this is of increasing significance given that 
more than 70% of our mines are in water stressed areas.  
For our operations to be sustained in the long term, we aim  
to protect water quality and support the access rights of  
other users. We also endeavour to play a leadership role in  
our water catchments through engagement, partnerships  
and innovation.
Strategy and management approach
Our 10-year water strategy, launched in 2010, guides our 
approach to demonstrating leadership in water stewardship. 
All our operations have water programmes in place and 
employ the ‘avoid, minimise, mitigate’ hierarchy of controls  
to reduce our water consumption, moderate the potential 
impact we have on water quality and eliminate water related 
environmental incidents. Those operations in water stressed 
locations seek to go beyond our minimum requirements, 
using a risk based approach that aims to demonstrate 
leadership by working with partners and through 
implementing good practice technologies. 
Our water management programme is supported by a 
mandatory water standard and delivered via operational water 
action plans. Every Anglo American operation works towards 
a water reduction target using our water efficiency target tool 
(WETT), which forecasts the projected business as usual 
demand of individual operations and tracks water saving 
projects. Operational targets are aggregated at business  
unit level, where they are included in business unit CEO 
performance contracts. These make up our Group target  
of a 1 4% reduction from our projected water consumption  
by 2020. 
Our performance
Anglo American’s total consumption of new water (not 
re-used) decreased from 201 million m
3
 in 201 3 to  
195 million m
3
 in 201 4. The reduction was primarily 
attributable to the limited production at Platinum’s strike 
affected operations, as well as water savings achieved 
through the implementation of the WETT programme. By  
the end of 201 4 we had achieved an estimated 16% water 
saving against our projected water usage, exceeding our 
2020 target. Water saving projects, which include more 
effective dust suppression, dewatering of tailings and more 
efficient ore separation, saved the Group approximately  
36 million m
3
 of water. Water re-use/recycling levels remained 
at 69%, in line with 201 3 levels. 
Where operations and projects face high risks related to 
water, we have developed specific risk management action 
plans and guidance. Operations most exposed to water 
security risks and extreme weather risks include Los Bronces 
and Collahuasi in Chile, Catalão in Brazil, Venetia in  
South Africa and Moranbah North in Australia. Our principal 
water quality related risks are associated with high salinity and 
acid rock drainage at some of our coal operations in Australia 
and South Africa, tailings dam seepage at our Los Bronces 
and El Soldado operations in Chile, acid rock drainage from 
the Donoso waste rock dump at Los Bronces, and high 
salinity at De Beers’ Snap Lake mine in Canada. We continue 
to mitigate the risk of acid rock drainage through effective 
mine design and management procedures such as the 
concurrent rehabilitation of open cut operations and waste 
facilities, as well as water treatment solutions, including the 
use of mobile water treatment plants.
CLIMATE CHANGE AND ENERGY
Climate change has potentially significant implications for 
our activities, resulting from government policies, changing 
demand for our products, and physical impacts such as 
water scarcity and flooding at our operations and 
neighbouring communities.
Our host governments continue to develop climate change 
policies. In South Africa, the planned implementation of a 
carbon tax in 2016 would introduce a higher carbon cost for 
our business. In Chile, the government plans to introduce a 
carbon tax, in 2018, of $5 per metric ton of carbon dioxide 
emitted. In Australia, our Coal business will identify 
opportunities to participate in the new direct emissions 
reduction scheme.

PERFORMANCE: HOW WE WIN (1) 
Scope 1 emissions 
are direct emissions 
from owned or 
controlled sources.  
Scope 2 emissions 
are indirect emissions 
from the generation  
of purchased energy.
Strategy and management approach
We aim to reduce exposure to emerging carbon  
regulations and increases in energy costs, improve  
our ability to influence the development of effective 
government policy, increase commercial opportunities,  
and build greater resilience to the physical impacts of 
climate change.
Anglo American believes that there will be a transition  
over the long term towards a low carbon future that will 
encompass a progressively more diverse energy mix.  
Coal has played a vital role in supporting poverty alleviation 
and sustaining prosperity. Independent forecasters  
foresee a significant continuing role for coal in the energy 
mix, up to 2040, including under policy scenarios that 
successfully limit global warming to two degrees Celsius. 
We believe that the roadmap to reduced CO
2
 emissions 
from coal fired power generation involves two steps: firstly 
more efficient combustion and secondly, in the longer  
term, the deployment of carbon capture and storage 
technologies. Replacing the world’s inefficient coal plants 
(those with efficiencies of less than 27%) with existing 
ultra-supercritical combustion technology, with efficiencies 
of more than 45%, could cut carbon emissions from coal 
fired power generation by 40%. In addition to coal, our 
portfolio also includes metals that are likely to see a major 
increase in demand as low carbon energy generation 
expands, most notably platinum and copper.
The demand for coal is forecast to continue to grow –  
a demand which has to be met – and we believe that 
responsible mining companies, such as Anglo American, 
need to be part of the solution.
Improving operational energy and carbon management  
is driven through our industry leading programme, 
ECO
2
MAN. In 201 1, energy- and carbon-reduction targets 
were agreed for every Anglo American operation. These  
are aggregated into business unit targets and form part  
of business unit CEO performance contracts. We have set 
greenhouse gas (GHG) and energy consumption reduction 
targets against the projected business as usual levels in 
2015, and are now defining our longer term performance 
objectives and targets for energy and carbon.
Our performance
By year end, we had achieved reductions of 4.2 million 
tonnes (Mt) of GHG emissions and 4.3 million GJ in  
energy consumption against the 2015 business as  
usual projections.
During 2014, Anglo American consumed 108 million GJ  
of energy (2013: 106 million GJ). The implementation of a 
total of 325 energy- and carbon-saving projects as part of 
the ECO
2
MAN programme accounted for a 5% reduction 
against our business as usual consumption target of 7%  
by 2015. The resultant avoided energy cost is estimated  
at $105 million. 
The Group’s total Scope 1 and Scope 2
(1)
 GHG emissions 
increased marginally to 17.4 Mt of carbon dioxide equivalent 
emissions (CO
2
e) (2013: 17.1 Mt CO
2
e). Most business units 
are on track towards achieving their carbon saving targets 
which contribute to the Anglo American target of 19% 
against the projected business as usual levels by 2015.  
The carbon savings will be achieved largely through  
Coal Australia’s management of underground methane.

Marliza Santos in the 
medical clinic at Ouvidor.
The road safety 
partnership involving our 
Niobium and Phosphates 
businesses, the local 
police, municipal 
government, NGOs and 
other stakeholders has 
already had a dramatic 
impact in improving road 
safety in and around the 
city of Catalão.
IMPROVING PUBLIC ROAD SAFETY
Driving is a high risk activity in many of the countries in 
which we operate. Large numbers of vehicles enter and 
leave our sites every day and, as a result, the volume of 
traffic in these areas often increases. To mitigate our  
own impact and support community needs, we have 
implemented a Group-wide initiative to improve the  
public road transportation of employees and contractors, 
with the aim of making each journey as safe as possible. 
At our Niobium and Phosphates businesses in Goiás state, 
Brazil, a SEAT
(1)
 assessment highlighted road safety to be a 
major concern for communities in the region, particularly 
the highway BR050 that links our operations with the city 
of Catalão. Between 2007 and 2012, 122 people lost their 
lives and nearly 750 people suffered significant or minor 
injuries in accidents on this stretch of road. 
To lead an effective, co-ordinated campaign to improve  
road safety, we partnered with local police, NGOs, 
government and other key stakeholders. Over a 12-month 
period, Anglo American focused on improving road 
infrastructure and raising awareness of safe driving 
practices through road safety lectures, meetings and 
workshops. Our efforts culminated in an intensive road 
safety week involving employees across the business units.
The project, together with other initiatives implemented 
locally, contributed to enhanced road safety in the area, 
with a 70% reduction in the number of lives lost over  
the campaign period. Also in 2014, we implemented an  
internal road safety campaign and launched a second 
external campaign, to broaden the scope of work along 
highway BR050 and widen the area of influence. The 
principles developed in this project are being transferred  
to operations in other high risk environments.

Niobium and Phosphates
Our Niobium business unit owns two 
niobium mines, while Phosphates 
comprises a mine and two chemical 
processing facilities. 
Niobium’s main application is as an 
alloying agent in high strength steel  
alloys; phosphates are a principal 
ingredient of fertilisers.
Strategic report WORKING  
TOGETHER
A diverse workforce
By year end, 24% of managers were women  
(2013: 23%), with 16% of our overall workforce being 
female (2013: 15%). Across our businesses, targets have 
been set to further increase female representation.
In our South African operations we continued to promote 
transformation. By year end, 60% of our management 
comprised ‘historically disadvantaged South Africans’ 
(HDSAs) (2013: 64%).
Fostering sound industrial relations
Approximately 76% of our permanent workforce is 
represented by work councils, trade unions or other similar 
bodies and covered by collective bargaining agreements.
In South Africa, the labour relations climate remains  
a particular challenge and concern. Labour instability  
has been exacerbated by inter-union conflict, and is 
underpinned by ongoing systemic societal challenges  
that are deeply rooted in the country’s history and in the 
legacy of the migrant labour system. The five-month strike  
at Platinum by the majority union AMCU highlighted the 
adversarial nature of the situation. The strike was eventually 
concluded through mutual dialogue and collaboration, with 
a three-year agreement signed on 24 June. The process 
nonetheless exacted a significant toll and reflected the need 
for us to improve relations with our employees and their 
representative bodies. 
A number of long term interventions are being  
implemented, aimed at developing a more democratic  
and transparent industrial relations climate, where 
employees are recognised and respected as equals, based 
on a culture of trust and respect. Our approach focuses  
on building relationships with union leadership and jointly 
driving visible felt leadership programmes, implementing  
a proactive employee relations programme that engages 
employees directly, and rolling out a values and culture  
change programme.
Protecting labour rights
As signatories to the United Nations Global Compact, we  
are committed to the labour rights principles provided in  
the International Labour Organization core conventions, 
including the right to freedom of association and collective 
bargaining, the eradication of child and forced labour and 
non-discrimination. We do not tolerate any form of labour 
rights abuse and full observance of these issues is also 
required of our suppliers in tenders. Compliance is audited.
Ensuring a safe working environment
Effectively managing safety and health in the workplace  
is a direct investment in our business and our employees. 
Our main priority is to prevent loss of life and serious injuries 
or disability by creating safe and healthy work environments. 
A detailed review of our safety and health performance is 
provided in our Sustainable Development Report, available 
online at www.angloamerican.com.
Our safety strategy focuses on improving our ability to 
anticipate and prevent harm to our people, and reduce 
safety related stoppages at operations. Our principal  
safety risks relate to transportation, moving machinery,  
fall of ground, working at heights and isolation/lock-out.  
Our risk based approach is outlined in Anglo American’s 
Guided by our values – safety, care and respect, integrity, 
accountability, collaboration and innovation – our people 
apply their skills, knowledge and expertise to ensure we 
operate successfully and responsibly. It is our people  
who develop trusting and respectful relationships with 
communities, governments, suppliers, partners and peers  
to ensure that we deliver on our promises.
In return, we reward and recognise our people, supporting 
them in their careers and providing opportunities to help 
them develop and grow.
THE RIGHT PEOPLE IN THE RIGHT JOBS
In 2013, Anglo American initiated a process of  
restructuring the organisation, with the aim of ensuring  
that we have the right people in the right roles to deliver 
effectively and efficiently on our strategic objectives.  
The roll out of our new Organisation Model is creating  
a leaner organisation, with greater clarity on roles and 
accountabilities, and improved lines of communication 
between levels of the organisation, while also removing 
unnecessary work and duplication. 
The restructuring of the Group Functions and business unit 
corporate centres was completed in 2014. The Organisation 
Model implementation programme is under way at Kumba 
and will progress during 2015 to other operational areas of 
the business that support our most important value  
creating assets.
Talent management and skills development 
We seek to offer safe, worthwhile and stimulating work, 
provide opportunities for personal development, pay 
competitively, recognise and reward excellence, encourage 
diversity and protect employee rights. Our approach  
is underpinned by our human resources standards, 
management systems and processes. Providing high quality 
training is a key attraction and retention tool. During the year 
we supported 3,602 graduates, bursars, apprentices and 
other trainees (2013: 2,974).
Formal learning is delivered at both business unit and  
Group level, with external training expenditure across  
Anglo American amounting to $106 million, 2.3% of total 
employee costs in 2014 (2013: $104 million, 2.0% of total 
employee costs).
Over the year, the number of permanent employee 
resignations as a percentage of total permanent employees 
was 2.0%, the same as in 2013.
We continue to provide basic literacy and numeracy to  
our employees, contractors and community members, 
through adult basic education and training and transferable 
skills programmes.
Our people are as vital to our success as our 
mining assets – they are the business. It is our 
people who are inspired to deliver sustainable 
value that makes a real difference. 
38 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
PEOPLE: CRITICAL CORE SKILLS Safety Way – a comprehensive framework of roles and 
responsibilities supported by a set of safety principles  
and mandatory safety standards. This underpins the  
delivery of our safety strategy, which is founded on three  
key principles: a mindset of zero harm; the elimination of 
repeat incidents; and the consistent application of simple, 
non-negotiable standards. Over the past year, we have 
focused on embedding and reinforcing five specific 
elements of our safety programme: leadership, front-line 
supervision, effective planning, incident management, and 
risk management.
Anglo American operates in some of the highest risk  
regions for road safety, in particular, South Africa, Brazil  
and Botswana. In 2014, we launched a Group-wide initiative 
to improve public road transportation of employees and 
contractors. Focus areas include standardising contracts  
for transportation of employees and contractors, and 
addressing human behaviour aspects.
We regret to report that in 2014, four employees and two 
contractors lost their lives in work related activities at 
operations managed by Anglo American. Even taking into 
account the suspension of activity at our platinum mines 
during the protracted period of industrial unrest, this still 
represented a substantial reduction on 2013 when 15 
colleagues died on company business. Nevertheless, any 
loss of life remains unacceptable and we are committed to 
achieving and maintaining zero fatalities and zero harm. 
We have made steady progress in managing safety and  
our key lagging safety performance indicators suggest that 
we are starting to achieve the desired step change in our 
performance. The reporting, investigation, analysis and 
improved sharing of high potential incidents through the 
learning from incidents process ensure improvement of 
controls on sites in order to prevent repeats. We believe  
that, by mining category and geographical area, we are 
performing well in the sector, and we aspire to become 
industry leaders. 
During 2014, 48 regulatory stoppages and 17 
non-compliance notices were issued across the Group 
relating to safety, with an additional number of voluntary 
stoppages as a result of conditions that were deemed 
potentially unsafe.
Promoting health and well-being
Our occupational health strategy is governed through a 
series of standards, guidelines and assurance processes 
aimed at preventing harm to the workforce. Our principal 
health risks relate to noise, inhalable hazards (specifically, 
particulate matter – dust), musculoskeletal disorders, 
alcohol and substance abuse, and fatigue. Our health and 
well-being programmes include the provision of care and 
treatment for HIV/AIDS and TB, as well as early diagnosis 
and preventative care for any other conditions that may  
lead to ill health in the long term. Another strategic focus  
is strengthening healthcare systems in underserviced  
rural areas that are home to many of our employees in 
South Africa, and building partnerships to improve access  
to quality healthcare.
During the year we made good progress in managing  
health risks and delivering on our health strategy, reflected 
in an improved performance across most of our parameters. 
Anglo American has not recorded any cases of silicosis 
since 201 1, which is a positive indication of effective 
management of exposure to respirable crystalline silica  
over the past 10 years. 
WORKING WITH STAKEHOLDERS
Our ability to realise mining’s full benefit to society  
requires strong relationships with stakeholders – principally 
employees and the communities around our operations,  
but also governments, shareholders, joint venture and civil 
society partners and suppliers. To create shared value for  
all our stakeholders we must understand their needs, 
concerns and aspirations, as well as the sustainability risks 
affecting our business, and consider them as part of our 
decision making processes as we develop new mines and 
continue to improve our existing operations.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 While specific interests and concerns typically vary  
by stakeholder group and region, industrial unrest in  
South Africa remains a particular priority. To address this,  
we continue to invest in enhancing our relationship with  
the South African government, and with communities 
around our Rustenburg and Limpopo mines. We are also 
engaging more closely with investors, under the leadership 
of chief executive Mark Cutifani, on the progressive 
business turnaround.
Finding solutions to increasingly complex societal 
challenges requires collaboration between business, 
government, civil society, labour, and research bodies.  
We place a strong emphasis, therefore, on developing 
partnerships with a broad range of stakeholders.

Managing our social performance 
Anglo American’s social performance strategy focuses  
on observing human rights, proactive engagement with  
our stakeholders and leveraging our business to support 
long term socio-economic development. Our approach  
is implemented through a comprehensive set of  
social performance requirements that are detailed in  
Anglo American’s Social Way. In 2014, we revised the 
requirements of the Social Way, in line with the latest  
best practices and standards and emerging stakeholder 
expectations. In-depth site audits of compliance with the 
updated Social Way will be undertaken on a three-year 
rotation basis from 2015, with desk based assessments  
of all sites conducted annually. 
Within our host communities, our industry leading  
Socio-Economic Assessment Toolbox (SEAT), now in its 
third version, is our primary means to improve operations’ 
understanding of their socio-economic impacts (both 
positive and negative), enhance stakeholder dialogue and 
the management of social issues, build our ability to support 
local socio-economic development, and foster greater 
transparency and accountability.
Observing human rights
Incorporating respect for human rights into regular  
business practice is both a moral and business imperative. 
Our approach is aligned with the ‘Protect, Respect and 
Remedy’ framework set out in the UN Guiding Principles  
on Business and Human Rights. In 2014, we developed  
a stand-alone human rights policy (available online at  
www.angloamerican.com) and established the  
Anglo American human rights framework to address our 
principal human rights risks. Human rights commitments 
have been integrated into the Social Way, and will be further 
integrated into SEAT and other relevant policies, procedures, 
management systems and tools throughout the business. 
Complaints and grievances
Our mandatory Group-wide social incident reporting 
mechanism, which includes complaints and grievances,  
is designed to ensure openness, accountability and 
respectfulness in our handling of any stakeholder 
grievances. The facility is a confidential and secure means 
for our local communities and other external stakeholders  
to raise concerns. All submissions are reviewed and 
responses provided and, where necessary, mitigating 
actions are implemented. 
In addition, at Group level, an anonymous tip-off procedure 
called ‘Speak Up’ allows any of our stakeholders to 
confidentially report concerns and incidents relating to the 
integrity of our conduct. Disciplinary proceedings, including 
termination, are instituted where employees are found to 
have behaved contrary to our principles. 
Responsible supply chain management
Our supplier sustainable development assurance 
programme addresses adherence to local legislative 
requirements and best practices in areas including safety, 
the environment, corruption, human rights and HIV 
management. A risk based approach is followed to identify 
suppliers to be audited, with a focus on small and medium 
enterprises, and we conduct follow-up audits to assess 
progress against improvement plans. During 2014, many  
of our largest contractors in South Africa received SEAT 
training, which includes our stance on responsible sourcing. 
In addition, business units have delivered presentations to 
smaller suppliers we have identified as being high risk. 
Incidents of non-compliance with contractual conditions 
typically involve minor issues that are easily addressed.
Community development
Our socio-economic development strategy guides  
our approach to building resilience within communities  
to prosper beyond mine closure through a range of 
interconnected programmes. To support local markets,  
we focus on promoting local procurement, enterprise 
development and workforce development. These 
programmes create a strong platform for job creation  
within and outside the mining value chains. To improve the 
delivery of public services, we are concentrating on working 
with local governments to strengthen their capacity to 
deliver on their core public service obligations, and on 
sustainable community health and education initiatives.  
This new approach to socio-economic development 
delivery is being rolled out across the Group, with key sites 
being prioritised for early implementation.
40 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
PEOPLE: CRITICAL CORE SKILLS Local procurement
Our local procurement initiatives add value to the business 
and provide the anchor for boosting economic growth in 
communities around our operations. They are designed to 
optimise opportunities to integrate local businesses into  
our global supply chain and advise them on how to compete 
successfully for new business. In promoting inclusive 
procurement practices, we do not compromise on quality, 
delivery, service, safety, health and environmental 
performance, or on any technical requirements.
In 2014, expenditure with suppliers based in the 
communities close to our operations was $1.7 billion  
(2013: $1.6 billion). This represented 14% of total 
addressable supplier expenditure (2013: 12%), against  
a Group target of 13%.
In South Africa, our operations contribute to the country’s 
drive to promote black economic empowerment. In  
2014, Anglo American managed businesses spent  
ZAR 39.3 billion (2013: ZAR 32.4 billion) with ‘historically 
disadvantaged South African’ businesses (excluding  
goods and services procured from the public sector and 
public enterprises).
Enterprise development
Our enterprise development programmes are designed  
to foster the potential of local entrepreneurs to build  
local capacity and ensure that the local economy is able  
to provide opportunities, even after mine closure. The 
schemes integrate with our supply chain (more than  
$18 billion globally) and develop long term platforms  
for partnerships with governments, NGOs and private 
sector companies.
Our well established schemes, Zimele in South Africa and 
Emerge in Chile, have supported more than 95,000 jobs 
over the past seven years. Based on our experience with 
these schemes, we developed a best practice model, which 
was used to implement schemes in Botswana and Brazil in 
2013, and in Peru in 2014. These three programmes have 
supported more than 1,500 jobs during 2014 and aim to 
support an additional 3,000 jobs by the end of 2015 and 
close to 10,000 by the end of 2016.
Building local capacity
Our capacity development activities focus on  
strengthening the skills, competencies and abilities of 
employees, community members and key local institutions 
to promote robust, self-sufficient local economies long  
after our mines have closed. As we can only offer a limited 
number of jobs, diversifying our skills development 
initiatives to promote broader employment opportunities 
enables us to play a more productive role in meeting 
community expectations. Our activities included spending 
$6.1 million towards institutional capacity development  
in 2014 (2013: $3.1 million), often partnering with local 
municipalities on projects. In South Africa in 2014, we 
launched a major local government capacity building 
programme in 1 1 municipalities, in partnership with the 
Development Bank of Southern Africa, with an investment 
of $3 million.
Infrastructure development
We operate in areas that are often underdeveloped and 
remote, where we can create synergies with infrastructure 
associated with our mines – such as roads, health facilities 
and water – for the benefit of local communities. A particular 
focus is investing in housing development in South Africa,  
in areas where services are inadequate or do not exist. 
Across the Group’s businesses in the country, we invested 
$109 million on housing projects in 2014.
Corporate social investment
To maximise development benefits, we prioritise the 
implementation of corporate social investment (CSI) 
programmes that are linked to our core functions and 
support activities where we have limited opportunities  
to contribute through our value chains and expertise. 
Anglo American’s CSI expenditure in local communities 
totalled $135.8 million
(1)
 (2013: $127.5 million). This figure 
represents 3.0% of underlying EBIT, excluding associates 
and joint ventures.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 EFFECTIVE RISK 
MANAGEMENT
 Understanding our key risks and developing 
appropriate responses are critical to our future 
success. We are committed to a robust system  
of risk identification and an effective response  
to such risks.
Byron Grote 
Chairman, Audit Committee
HOW WE MANAGE RISK
Management of risk is critical to the success of  
Anglo American. Our Group is exposed to a variety  
of risks that can have a financial, operational or 
reputational impact. Effective management of risk 
supports the delivery of our objectives and the 
achievement of sustainable growth.
HOW DOES RISK RELATE TO OUR  
STRATEGIC INTENTS?
Risks can arise from events outside of our control or from 
operational matters. Each of the key risks described on the 
following pages can have an impact on our ability to achieve 
our strategic intents. This is illustrated by reference to each 
of our strategic intents:
 • Where we compete: optimising our diverse portfolio 
We will focus management time and prioritise capital on 
the mining assets that offer us the most attractive long 
term value creation potential
 • How we win: maximising our performance 
We will maintain a highly competitive mindset, with 
innovation and outstanding delivery at the forefront  
of how we drive change
 • Critical core skills: creating a capable organisation 
We will ensure that our people and organisation have  
the critical core skills, supported by key people systems,  
to ensure we improve our returns.

1
Identifying risks 
A robust methodology is used to identify key risks across  
the Group; at business units, operations and projects. This  
is being applied consistently through the development  
and ongoing implementation of a Group integrated risk 
management standard.
2
Analysing risks and controls to manage identified risks 
Once identified, the process will evaluate identified risks to 
establish root causes, financial and non-financial impacts and 
likelihood of occurrence. Consideration of risk treatments is 
taken into account to enable the creation of a prioritised register.
3
Determining management actions required
Effectiveness and adequacy of controls are assessed.  
If additional controls are required, these will be identified  
and responsibilities assigned.
4
Reporting and monitoring
Management is responsible for monitoring progress of actions  
to treat key risks and is supported through the Group’s internal 
audit programme, which evaluates the design and effectiveness 
of controls. The risk management process is continuous; key 
risks are reported to the Audit Committee, with sustainability  
risks also being reported to the Sustainability Committee.
STRATEGIC REPORT RISK
42 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 As mining is a business that can span decades, many of its 
attendant risks are long term in nature, and there may not  
be any significant change year-on-year. The commentary 
provided on each risk is intended to highlight significant 
changes in the profile of individual risks or describe our 
experience of the risk over the course of 2014.
The risks defined in this report are those we believe are  
our principal risks. In previous years we have reported risks 
relating to climate change, counterparty, exploration, supply 
chain, contractors, Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources, 
bribery and corruption, joint ventures, and acquisitions and 
divestments, all of which we remain exposed to, though we 
do not consider them to be our principal risks. Therefore, 
such risks are not discussed in the report. 
The risks included in this report could threaten our ability to 
achieve our 2016 objectives.
We also recognise that risks cannot be viewed in isolation. 
Emergence of one risk may be caused by one or more  
other risks, or may cause another risk to emerge. For 
example, project delivery or production risk can be 
influenced by risks relating to supply, inflation, political 
matters, legal and regulatory requirements, infrastructure  
or community relations. This interconnectivity, and the 
relationship of risks to our above-mentioned strategic 
elements, requires significant emphasis to be placed on  
the management of risk and the effectiveness of our risk 
controls, with the identification and understanding of our 
risks being the first step in what is a continuous process.

EXTERNAL RISKS
STRATEGIC REPORT RISK
COMMODITY PRICES Pillars of value:
The prices of all the commodities that 
Anglo American produces are subject to  
wide fluctuation.
Impact: Commodity price volatility can result in  
a material and adverse movement in the Group’s 
operating results, asset values, revenues and cash 
flows. Falling commodity prices could prevent us 
from completing transactions that are important 
to the business and which may have an adverse 
effect on Anglo American’s financial position.
If commodity prices remain weak for a sustained 
period, growth projects may not be viable and we 
may not be able to compete for new, complex 
projects that require significant capital investment. 
Commodity prices are one of the significant 
factors that rating agencies use to determine 
credit rating.
Root cause: Commodity prices are determined 
primarily by international markets and global 
supply and demand. Demand for commodities  
will largely be determined by the strength of the 
global economic environment.
Mitigation: Our diverse commodity portfolio 
provides some protection to this risk, and our 
policy is not to engage in commodity price 
hedging. We constantly monitor the markets in 
which we operate, reviewing capital expenditure 
programmes accordingly, so as to ensure the 
supply of our products reflects forecast  
market conditions.
Increased risk
Commentary: During  
2014, prices of most of the 
commodities we mine weakened 
as a result of lacklustre 
economic conditions in many of 
our key markets and increased 
supply of some products. This 
trend is expected to continue for 
some time.
POLITICAL, LEGAL AND REGULATORY Pillars of value: 
Wherever we operate, our businesses  
may be affected by political or regulatory 
developments, including changes to fiscal 
regimes or other regulatory regimes.
Impact: Potential impacts include restrictions  
on the export of currency, expropriation of assets, 
imposition of royalties or other taxes targeted at 
mining companies, and requirements for local 
ownership or beneficiation. Political instability can 
also result in civil unrest and nullification of existing 
agreements, mining permits or leases. Any of 
these may adversely affect the Group’s operations 
or results of those operations.
Root cause: The Group has no control over  
local political acts or changes in local tax rates.  
It recognises that its licence to operate through 
mining rights is dependent on a number of factors, 
including compliance with regulations.
Mitigation: The Group actively monitors 
regulatory and political developments on a 
continuous basis.
No change in risk
Commentary: Due to market 
conditions, industry appetite  
for developing projects is low, 
particularly where political risk  
is high. The commodity cycle 
downturn may reduce the ability 
of host governments to impose 
new taxes and royalties. 
However, there is a continuing 
need to manage government 
relations in this period of 
significant change.
INFORMATION AND CYBER SECURITY Pillars of value: 
The Group is exposed to risk of attack by  
third parties on our information systems.
Impact: Attacks on our information systems  
may result in loss of sensitive or proprietary 
information and fraud. Damage is possible to 
equipment that is critical to mining or processing 
of ore, resulting in interruption to production.
Root cause: Cyber risk arises from criminal 
activity to cause disruption or attempts by  
third parties to access sensitive information.  
The pace of technological development makes  
it challenging for any organisation to prevent 
increasingly sophisticated methods of attacking 
information technology systems.
Mitigation: Anti-virus software and general 
computer controls provide a level of protection.  
In addition, monitoring of networks is undertaken 
to identify suspicious activity in order that 
appropriate action can be taken. We receive 
information on threats through security 
consultants and agencies on an ongoing basis. 
The Group also has an Information Security policy 
that introduces the measures expected of 
employees in handling sensitive information.
No change in risk
Commentary: The risk is 
unchanged but we recognise  
the threat is continually 
developing on a global basis. 45
Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
INFLATION Pillars of value:
The Group is exposed to potentially high  
rates of inflation in the countries in which  
it operates.
Impact: Higher rates of inflation may increase 
future operational costs if there is no concurrent 
depreciation of the local currency against the  
US dollar, or an increase in the dollar price of the 
applicable commodity. This may have a negative 
impact on profit margins and financial results.
Root cause: Cost inflation in the mining sector is 
more apparent during periods of high commodity 
prices as demand for input goods and services 
can exceed supply.
Mitigation: We closely manage costs through 
our business improvement and supply chain 
initiatives and, where necessary, through  
adjusting employee and contractor numbers.  
The Driving Value programme has targeted a 
$500 million reduction in overheads by 2016.
No change in risk
Commentary: While operating 
improvements, restructuring 
and cost saving programmes  
are contributing to financial 
performance, some of the 
benefits will be offset through 
uncontrollable cost increases.
CURRENCY RISK Pillars of value: 
The Group is exposed to currency risk when 
transactions are not conducted in US dollars.
Impact: Fluctuations in the exchange rates of  
the most important currencies influencing our 
own operating costs and asset valuations (the  
South African rand, Chilean peso, Brazilian  
real, Australian dollar, and pound sterling) may 
materially affect the Group’s financial results.
Root cause: The global nature of the Group’s 
businesses exposes the Group to currency risk.
Mitigation: Given our Group’s diversified nature, 
our policy is generally not to hedge currency risk. 
Mitigation in the form of foreign exchange hedging 
is limited to debt instruments and capital 
expenditure on major projects.
No change in risk
Commentary: Further 
description of currency risk  
and analysis of sensitivity to 
foreign exchange movement is 
provided on pages 156– 157.
PORTFOLIO RESTRUCTURING Pillars of value: 
Inability to achieve asset sales as planned.
Impact: Failure to achieve planned sales may 
influence cash flow generation targets and ability 
to achieve required levels of return.
Root cause: The current commodity market 
climate is creating a challenging environment in 
which to sell assets.
Mitigation: A strategy for the transaction  
process has been developed, aimed at 
maximising buyer interest.
New risk
Commentary: N/A
LIQUIDITY RISK Pillars of value:
Our Group is exposed to liquidity risk in terms 
of being able to fund operations and growth.
Impact: If we are unable to obtain sufficient credit 
as a result of prevailing capital market conditions, 
we may not be able to raise sufficient funds to 
meet ongoing financing needs, develop projects, 
compete for new projects requiring significant 
capital expenditure, or fund acquisitions. As a 
result, our revenues, operating results, cash flows 
or financial position may be adversely affected. 
The Group’s access to liquidity or cost of funding 
could be adversely influenced by any credit rating 
agency downgrade.
Root cause: Liquidity risk arises from  
uncertainty or volatility in the capital or credit 
markets owing to perceived weaknesses in the 
global economic environment, or possibly as a
response to shock events. Liquidity risk also arises 
when lenders are insecure about our long term 
cash generative capacity.
Mitigation: We have an experienced Treasury 
team which is responsible for ensuring that there 
are sufficient committed loan facilities in place  
to meet short term business requirements after 
taking into account cash flows from operations 
and holdings of cash, as well as any Group 
distribution restrictions. We limit exposure on 
liquid funds through a policy of minimum 
counterparty credit ratings, daily counterparty 
settlement limits and exposure diversification.
No change in risk
Commentary: All financing 
needs have been met,  
though capital availability for 
project development or 
acquisition is likely to be low  
until existing commitments  
are fulfilled or a stronger  
pricing environment exists. 46 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
OPERATIONAL RISKS 
STRATEGIC REPORT RISK
INFRASTRUCTURE Pillars of value: 
Inability to obtain adequate supporting 
facilities, services and installations  
(water, power, road, rail and port, etc.).
Impact: Failure to obtain supporting facilities  
may affect the sustainability and growth of the 
business, leading to loss of competitiveness, 
market share and reputation. Failure of rail or  
port facilities may result in delays and increased 
costs, lost revenue, and a worsening reputation 
with customers. Failure to procure shipping  
costs at competitive market rates may reduce 
profit margins.
Root cause: The potential disruption of ongoing 
generation and supply of power is a risk we face in
a number of countries. Our operations and projects 
can be located in areas where power and water 
supplies are not certain and may be affected by 
population growth, the effects of climate change  
or lack of investment by owners of infrastructure. 
We rely upon effective rail and port facilities for 
transporting our products. We use third parties to 
ship products to customers, if required.
Mitigation: We seek to work closely with 
suppliers of infrastructure to mitigate the risk  
of failure and have established contingency 
arrangements. Long term agreements with 
suppliers are sought where appropriate.
No change in risk
Commentary: Details of 
programmes to manage water 
consumption and power usage 
are provided on pages 34–35.
EVENT RISK Pillars of value: 
Damage to physical assets from fire, 
explosion, natural catastrophe or breakdown 
of critical machinery.
Impact: The direct costs of repair or replacement 
combined with business interruption losses can 
result in financial losses.
Root cause: Some of our operations are located 
in areas exposed to natural catastrophes such as 
earthquake/extreme weather conditions. The 
nature of our operations exposes us to potential 
failure of mining pit slopes, underground shafts
and tailings dam walls, fire, explosion and 
breakdown of critical machinery, with long lead 
times for replacement.
Mitigation: Specialist consultants are engaged 
to analyse such event risks and provide 
recommendations to prevent or limit the effects  
of such a loss. Contingency plans are developed  
to respond to significant events and restore 
normal levels of business activity. Anglo American 
purchases insurance to protect itself against the 
financial consequences of an event, subject to 
availability and cost.
No change in risk
Commentary: Management 
continues to implement 
measures to mitigate this risk.
ENVIRONMENT Pillars of value: 
Some of our operations create environmental 
risk in the form of dust, noise or leakage of 
polluting substances, or through the potential 
for uncontrolled breaches of tailings dam 
facilities. These can be harmful to our 
employees, contractors and the communities 
near our operations.
Impact: Potential impacts include fines and 
penalties for past, current or future events, 
statutory liability for environmental remediation 
and other financial consequences that may be
significant. Governments may force closure of 
mines on a temporary or permanent basis or 
refuse future mining right applications.
Root cause: The mining process, including 
blasting and processing of orebodies, can 
generate dust and noise and requires the storage 
of waste materials in liquid form.
Mitigation: The Group implements a number  
of standards to prevent, monitor and limit the 
impact of its operations on the environment.
No change in risk
Commentary: Our 
environmental performance 
during 2014 is detailed on  
pages 33–35.
COMMUNITY RELATIONS Pillars of value: 
Disputes with communities may arise from 
time to time.
Impact: Failure to manage relationships with 
local communities, government and NGOs  
may disrupt operations and negatively affect 
Anglo American’s reputation as well as our  
ability to bring projects into production.
Root cause: We operate in several countries where 
ownership of rights in respect of land and resources 
is uncertain and where disputes in relation to
ownership or other community matters may arise. 
The Group’s operations can have an impact on 
local communities, including the need, from time 
to time, to relocate communities or infrastructure 
networks such as railways and utility services.
Mitigation: We have developed comprehensive 
processes to enable our business units to 
effectively manage relationships with communities 
and we actively seek to engage with, and support, 
all communities affected by our operations.
No change in risk
Commentary: Further 
description of our work  
during 2014 to maintain and 
improve relationships with our 
stakeholders is provided on 
pages 38–41. 47
Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
SAFETY AND HEALTH Pillars of value: 
Failure to maintain high levels of safety 
management can result in harm to our 
employees, contractors and communities 
near our operations. Occupational health  
risks to employees and contractors include 
noise induced hearing loss, occupational  
lung diseases and tuberculosis (TB). In 
sub-Saharan Africa in particular, HIV/AIDS is a 
threat to economic growth and development.
Impact: In addition to injury and damage to 
health, impacts could include fines and penalties 
for past, current or future issues, liability to 
employees or third parties, impairment of 
Anglo American’s reputation, industrial action or 
inability to attract and retain skilled employees. 
Government authorities may force closure of 
mines on a temporary or permanent basis or 
refuse mining right applications. The recruitment 
and retention of skilled people required to meet 
growth aspirations can be affected by high rates  
of HIV/AIDS.
Root cause: Mining is a hazardous industry  
and working conditions such as weather, altitude 
and temperature can add to the inherent  
dangers of mining, whether underground or in 
open pit mines.
Mitigation: Anglo American sets a very high 
priority on safety and health matters. A safety  
and health risk management process, global 
standards and a technical risk assurance 
programme form part of a consistently applied 
robust approach to mitigating safety, health and 
environmental risk. Anglo American provides  
free anti-retroviral therapy to employees with  
HIV/AIDS and undertakes education and 
awareness programmes to help prevent  
infection or spread of infection.
No change in risk
Commentary: Details of safety 
performance and our approach

OPERATIONAL RISK AND PROJECT DELIVERY Pillars of value: 
Failure to meet production targets or  
project delivery timetables and budgets.
Impact: Increased unit costs may arise from 
failure to meet production targets, thus affecting 
our operational and financial performance.  
Failure to meet project delivery timetables and 
budgets may delay cash inflows, increase capital 
costs, incur contractual penalties, and reduce 
profitability, as well as have a negative impact  
on the Group’s reputation.
Root cause: Increasing regulatory, 
environmental, access and social approvals can 
increase construction costs and introduce delays. 
Operational performance can be influenced  
by technical and engineering factors as well as 
events or circumstances that have an impact on 
other critical inputs to the mining and processing 
of minerals.
Mitigation: Management oversight of operating 
performance and project delivery through regular 
executive management briefings, a continuous 
focus on improvement of operations through  
our business improvement programme, and 
consistent application of the Group’s methodology 
for new projects, are vital aspects in managing  
this risk.
No change in risk
Commentary: The Minas-Rio 
project achieved first ore on ship 
during 2014 (refer to pages 
22–23) and our focus is now  
on ramp up. We continued  
to see improved operational 
performance across our  
business units as a result of 
management actions.
EMPLOYEES Pillars of value: 
The ability to recruit, develop and retain 
appropriate skills for the Group. Strikes or 
other industrial relations disputes may occur.
Impact: Failure to retain or recruit skilled 
employees may lead to increased costs, and 
interruptions to existing operations and new 
projects. Industrial disputes adversely affect 
production, costs and the results of operations.
Root cause: We are subject to global competition 
for skilled labour. Our assets and projects are 
often in remote places or in countries where it is  
a challenge to recruit suitably skilled employees. 
In the key countries where the Group operates,  
the majority of employees are members of  
trade unions. Negotiations over wage levels or 
working conditions can sometimes fail to result  
in agreement.
Mitigation: Anglo American aims to be the 
employer of choice in the mining sector.  
A comprehensive human resources strategy  
has been devised to support that objective.  
The Group seeks constructive relationships and 
dialogue with trade unions and employees in  
all its businesses.
Decrease in risk
Commentary: During 2014  
we completed the review of our 
Organisational Model, corporate 
structure and a number of 
business units. Implementation  
of the changes and restructuring 
programmes identified has 
progressed. Further details are

STRATEGIC REPORT IRON ORE AND MANGANESE FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW
Kumba
Underlying EBIT decreased by 37% to $1.9 billion  
(2013: $3.0 billion), mainly attributable to the significant 
decline in the iron ore benchmark price, which declined  
28% to an average of $97 /tonne. In 2014, Kumba took steps 
to address its cost base and to establish a robust continuous 
improvement programme that builds off the implementation 
of Anglo American’s Operating Model. Total operating  
costs decreased by 4%. Despite the 14% increase in waste 
mining, a 12% weakening of the South African rand against 
the US dollar, and benefits from the Operating Model, more 
than offset this headwind.
Export sales increased by 4% to 40.5 Mt (2013: 39.1 Mt)  
as a result of higher iron ore production which increased by 
14% to 48.2 Mt (2013: 42.4 Mt). Kumba rebuilt stock on the 
back of the higher production. Total finished product stocks 
increased to 6.5 Mt as at 31 December 2014 compared  
with 2.9 Mt at 31 December 2013.
Iron Ore Brazil
First ore on ship was achieved on 25 October 2014, ahead of 
schedule and with total project capital expenditure expected 
to be $0.4 billion below the revised budget of $8.8 billion. 
Despite the project’s complexity and logistical challenges, 
Minas-Rio achieved an exceptional safety performance with 
very low lost time injury rates compared to other projects  
of similar scale. Delivery of the project is a significant 
milestone. The ramp up schedule continues and is expected 
to reach design capacity during the second quarter of 2016. 
Minas-Rio is a world class asset benefiting from long life 
(~45 years); high quality iron ore saleable product  
(~67% Fe); and a favourable cash cost, and is expected  
to be in the bottom half of the cash cost curve. 
Underlying EBIT is expected to be capitalised until the end 
of 2015, by which time the Minas-Rio project is expected  
to have achieved commercial production capacity. In 2014, 
Iron Ore Brazil’s capitalised underlying EBIT loss was 
$57 million, while an amount of $34 million was charged  
to the income statement in relation to expenses that were 
not directly associated with the project.
Sales volumes of 0.2 Mt relate to three Panamax vessels 
transporting iron ore from Minas-Rio to customers in China. 
Iron ore production volumes for the year reached 0.7 Mt 
(wet basis).
Samancor
Underlying EBIT decreased by 15% to $178 million, driven 
by lower ore prices, offset to some extent by higher sales 
volumes and cost control.

Different products are priced against a number of different indices in the market. 
IODEX 62% has been used in this instance as a generic industry benchmark against 
which to compare average realised prices.
Demand for seaborne iron ore grew 6.7% (2013: 7.0%),  
or 79 Mt; however this was more than offset by seaborne 
supply which increased by 14.2%, or 167 Mt, on an 
equivalent basis. The result was a 28% decline in the 
average iron ore price, which reached $72 per tonne  
(Platts 62% benchmark) at the end of the year. Kumba’s 
achieved sales benefited from the inclusion of a significant 
share of high grade fines and lump products which attracted 
a market premium. 
Manganese ore
The manganese ore market remained under pressure,  
with the benchmark ore price (CIF China) falling 16% over 
the prior year. Infrastructure constraints in South Africa  
were loosened, which eliminated a key bottleneck from the 
market. This resulted in South African production becoming 
the relevant price setting assets.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Kumba 
Overall, Kumba showed a marked improvement in 
production as plans put in place over the past few years 
yielded benefits. These were complemented by the 
implementation of Anglo American’s Operating Model  
at Sishen in August.
Sishen production of 35.5 Mt increased 15%  
(2013: 30.9 Mt), with total tonnes mined rising to  
229.9 Mt (2013: 208.8 Mt). Of this amount, 187.2 Mt was 
waste (2013: 167.8 Mt). Although below the waste target  
set at the start of the year, waste removal run rates are now 
meeting targets. Additional contractor capacity has been 
secured and the performance of Kumba’s own mining fleet 
improved. The vertical rate of advance at the mine was 
increased, further strengthening the exposed ore position. 
The strategic redesign of the western pushbacks of the pit, 
together with the improved waste removal run rates, have 
achieved appropriate waste removal during the year to 
ensure sufficient exposed ore to support a 2015 production 
target of 36 Mt.
Execution of the pit redesign plan has resulted in an 
improved mining plan that enables better use of equipment, 
and the deployment of two priority pushbacks. Around 
780 Mt of waste was taken out of the revised life of mine 
plan, reducing the average life of mine stripping ratio from  
4.4 to 3.9, and the reserve life from 18 years to 16 years at 
the end of 2014. 
Kolomela maintained its strong performance, with total 
tonnes mined increasing by 18% to 70.4 Mt (2013: 59.9 Mt). 
The mine produced 1 1.6 Mt of iron ore (2013: 10.8 Mt), an 
increase of 7%, and mined 55.5 Mt of waste (2013: 46.7 Mt). 
Pre-stripping of the third pit (19.4 Mt), in order to maintain 
flexibility, was completed during the year, with first ore 
exposed during November. 
Thabazimbi lifted output to 1.1 Mt (2013: 0.6 Mt), with  
waste mining volumes increasing by 19% to 31.6 Mt  
(2013: 26.5 Mt). 
Volumes railed on the Iron Ore Export Channel were  
6% higher at 42.2 Mt (2013: 39.7 Mt) on the back of the 
improved performance at Sishen and Kolomela, accounting 
for 31.7 Mt and 10.5 Mt, respectively. 
To facilitate the expansion of Sishen mine to the west, 
Phase 1 of the Dingleton relocation project was completed, 
with 71 homes in Dingleton North being moved to the new 
host site. Phase 2, the relocation of the 428 remaining 
houses, buildings and businesses, has commenced and  
is progressing well.
Samancor
Production of manganese ore remained consistent at  
3.3 Mt (attributable basis), with a record performance in  
the second half. Production benefited from improved ore 
recovery and plant availability in South Africa, which offset 
the impact of weather related stoppages in the first quarter 
in Australia.
Production of manganese alloys increased by 14% to 
286,100 tonnes (attributable basis) owing to greater furnace 
stability and availability in South Africa and Australia.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK 
Kumba
Kumba will focus on optimising its production portfolio  
by reconfiguring its project portfolio to focus on low cost 
production. The target is an additional ~5 Mt in South Africa 
over the next three to five years, through incremental 
volumes from projects at Sishen and Kolomela.
Additional port capacity through the use of the Saldanha 
Multi-Purpose Terminal is expected to optimise port 
throughput. Sishen is aiming to increase production to 
around 36 Mt in 2015, as it ramps up its waste stripping to 
around 250 Mt. This will be supported by the Dingleton 
relocation project and ongoing implementation of  
Anglo American’s Operating Model. Following the planned 
commissioning of a new modular plant in 2015, production 
guidance has been increased by 1 Mt to 38 Mt in both 2016 
and 2017.
Kolomela’s life of mine production capacity has been 
increased to 1 1 Mtpa from 2015, and studies are in progress 
which could result in increasing production further to 12 Mt 
in 2016 and to 13 Mtpa from 2017. The future of Thabazimbi 
mine in Kumba’s portfolio is currently being assessed.
Iron Ore Brazil
Iron ore production of between 1 1 Mt and 14 Mt (wet basis) 
is expected in 2015. Nameplate capacity is expected to be 
reached by the second quarter of 2016, with production of 
between 24 Mt and 26.5 Mt (wet basis) expected in 2016.  
In addition to the safe ramp up of operations, activities also 
include the completion of the outstanding construction 
works and the regular cycle of licence and permit renewals 
required for the mining operations.

STRATEGIC REPORT IRON ORE AND MANGANESE 51
Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
During 2013, Kumba undertook and concluded various 
analyses and geological studies in order to better understand 
the orebody at Sishen mine, and determine how best to mine 
it successfully and sustainably.
The outcome of this review has been the development of  
a revised mining plan, with a resultant reduction of almost 
780 Mt of waste stripping over the life of the mine, along with 
a number of other initiatives aimed at improving efficiencies 
and ensuring that Sishen is able to meet its revised 
production targets.
Sishen is on track to meet its target of 38 Mt of iron ore 
production in 2016 as a result of the following initiatives:
 • The implementation of Anglo American’s Operating Model, 
a project being piloted at Sishen to improve productivity 
through scheduled work. Initiated in August 2014, this is 
already yielding significant benefits, including improving 
scheduled work from 20% to ~70%, a 50% reduction in 
waiting time on shovels, and a 23% efficiency 
improvement in total tonnes handled. 
 • The Dingleton relocation project to facilitate Sishen’s 
westward expansion has now commenced. In the 
current phase, 17 private homeowners and the occupants 
of 54 municipal houses in the northern section of Dingleton 
had been relocated by the end of 2014, with the rest to 
follow by the end of 2016. 
 • Two new waste dumps are being constructed to reduce  
the distance trucks are required to travel to move waste.
 • A five-year fleet and associated infrastructure plan  
is currently under way, which includes an on-site 
maintenance facility to safely and efficiently service the 
mine’s haul trucks. This, along with increasing the fleet  
of trucks, is set to increase capacity for moving ore as  
the mine ramps up.
Following the success of the Operating Model pilot at  
Sishen North, further roll outs are planned at Sishen pre-strip 
and Kolomela plant during 2015, followed by roll out at all 
other areas.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW
Australia and Canada
Australia and Canada recorded an underlying EBIT of  
$(1 ) million. The loss was attributable to a 21% decrease in 
the average quarterly hard coking coal (HCC) benchmark 
coal price, reducing underlying EBIT by $528 million. The 
impact was offset by productivity improvements that 
resulted in a 12% increase in metallurgical coal production 
despite market related production curtailments, significant 
cost reductions across the Australian operations and 
favourable Australian dollar exchange rate movements. 
Underlying EBIT included a higher onerous contract 
provision release at Callide, an $86 million loss at  
Peace River Coal in Canada, which was placed on care  
and maintenance in December 2014, and the impact of 
lower insurance receipts. 
Cost savings across labour, contractors and maintenance, 
combined with productivity improvements, resulted in the 
lowest unit costs since 2010, with Australian export FOB 
cash unit costs reducing by 9% from 2013, in local  
currency terms.
A focus on higher margin products resulted in a favourable 
product mix, with the proportion of HCC sales to total export 
sales increasing by 3% to 55%.
South Africa
South Africa’s underlying EBIT of $350 million was  
flat year-on-year owing to a strong operational performance, 
lower costs and favourable currency movement which 
mitigated a 10% reduction in realised export prices. FOB 
cash unit costs at trade mines decreased by 5%, benefiting 
from the weaker rand and a focus on productivity and cost 
efficiency primarily related to maintenance and contractor 
costs, as well as lower overhead costs owing to the  
business restructuring. Underlying EBIT also included  
$38 million from the opportunistic sale of reserves and a 
surplus dragline.
Colombia
Underlying EBIT was $163 million, 29% down on the prior 
year, mainly owing to weaker prices reducing underlying 
EBIT by $73 million, offset in part by favourable exchange 
rate movements and cost reductions.

The metallurgical coal market experienced growing 
Australian production and resilient US supply, which 
resulted in a surplus of seaborne metallurgical coal,  
while domestic Chinese production increased. As a key 
steelmaking ingredient, global demand growth for seaborne 
volumes slowed to 4%, with imports into China declining  
by 16% to 63 Mt. This was partially offset, however, by a  
 19% increase in demand from India to 49 Mt. Seaborne 
metallurgical coal prices have traded within a narrow range 
since April 2014, with spot price indices trading at historical 
lows throughout the year. Term contract prices have, 
however, maintained a consistent premium above these 
spot indices. The average quarterly HCC reference price 
decreased by 21% during 2014, to $125/tonne, reaching  
a low of $1 19/tonne in the fourth quarter.

Thermal coal prices decreased during 2014 as supply 
growth in the market encountered softening demand 
growth, particularly in China. China’s stronger hydro-
electricity power performance displaced thermal coal in 
domestic generation and resulted in aggressive coal price 
discounting, ultimately dragging down the seaborne thermal 
coal price. The price of FOB Newcastle thermal coal 
decreased during the year by 27% from $85/tonne to a  
low of $62/tonne, ending the year at $65/tonne.

Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Australia and Canada
Australia and Canada achieved record metallurgical coal 
production of 20.9 Mt, chiefly attributable to a step change 
in performance at Grasstree following its implementation  
of the management operating system and improvements 
across all Australian open cut operations. 
Australian export thermal coal production decreased by 
17%, mainly the result of lower production at the Drayton 
open cut mine as the mine nears the end of its life.
Underground operations increased production by 1 1%  
to record their best ever output. This was offset, however,  
by a 14% decrease in production at Moranbah North, from  
the prior year’s record performance, owing to equipment 
design issues. Given the current market conditions, 
Moranbah North plans to rectify these issues during the 
planned longwall move in the third quarter of 2015.
Production at the open cut operations rose by 5%, mainly  
as a result of the productivity improvements at Dawson 
following the implementation of the management operating 
system and a recovery in production at Callide following  
the flooding and rail closures in the first quarter of 2013. 
Foxleigh open cut mine recorded a record output, reflecting 
productivity improvements.
South Africa
Export production at 18.2 Mt was 7% higher, with all 
operations delivering an increase in production. Trade  
mine productivity, measured through the percentage of 
benchmark overall equipment effectiveness, increased  
by 6% for the underground operations and 5% for the 
opencast operations.
Domestic production at 37.6 Mt decreased by 5%, primarily 
owing to Eskom reducing offtake from New Vaal, and 
planned production decreases at Kriel prior to a move to 
new mining areas.
Colombia
Our share of Cerrejón’s output of 1 1.2 Mt was 2% higher 
than in 2013. In 2014, production was impacted by high dust 
emissions associated with the extended drought conditions 
that constrained production up until August, followed by 
heavy rainfall that led to production stoppages.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK
Australia and Canada
Peace River Coal operations in Canada were placed on care 
and maintenance in December 2014 owing to weak market 
conditions. The Drayton South project which was intended 
to extend the life of Drayton mine has not yet received 
regulatory approval. A new development application and 
accompanying Environmental Impact Statement will be 
submitted early in 2015.
Metallurgical coal production in 2015 is expected to  
remain broadly flat at 20 to 21 Mt as the increase in output  
from Australian underground operations and Grosvenor 
development coal will be offset by the suspension of activity 
at Peace River Coal.
South Africa
Export production is expected to be approximately  
17 to 18 Mt in 2015, as productivity improvement  
benefits are offset by logistics constraints and challenges 
associated with the ageing of the current coal reserves.
Colombia
Production is expected to be approximately 35 Mt  
(100% basis), subject to permitting and market conditions.

STRATEGIC REPORT COAL 55
Strategic report
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
Our Coal South Africa business has developed and patented 
bioconversion technology that could significantly accelerate 
and improve the quality of opencast mine rehabilitation.
Known as Fungcoal, the process harnesses fungi and 
weathered coal to produce natural fertilisers. The research 
project is a partnership with Rhodes University’s Institute  
for Environmental Biotechnology in South Africa and began 
in 2004, when Coal South Africa investigated solutions to 
accelerate and improve the quality of rehabilitation at its 
opencast mines.
The technology was trialled at four of our coal mines at a 
collective cost of $1.5 million. The outcomes of the research 
showed that certain fungi have the ability to break down and 
liquefy coal that has been exposed to the elements. In certain 
applications, it showed extremely positive results, both on 
rehabilitated mining pits and coal discard facilities. In addition 
to being more cost effective in certain applications than 
traditional rehabilitation, the technology will enhance the 
quality of existing rehabilitation by increasing the organic 
content and the humic acid concentrations in the soil,  
thereby improving vegetation health and reducing soil 
compaction – which is a significant rehabilitation challenge 
facing the industry.
We are effectively developing a complete toolkit of 
organisms to restore the ecology of land that has been 
disturbed, so that it can be returned to communities for 
economic activity almost immediately after mining. The 
technology is expected to achieve in six months, or one 
growing season, what nature does in 60 years.
The next steps will be to establish a thorough record  
of land rehabilitated with Fungcoal and to gain a greater 
understanding of the product’s use in other applications  
and over a longer period of time. Engagement with  
regulators will take place as the project moves closer  
to the commercial phase.

56 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
STRATEGIC REPORT BASE METALS AND MINERALS FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW 
Copper recorded an underlying EBIT of $1,193 million,  
31% lower, largely due to an 8% decline in the average 
realised copper price and a 2% decrease in sales volumes. 
Operating costs have increased owing to inflation, higher 
treatment and refining charges, and an increase in mine 
development at Los Bronces, partially offset by the  
benefits of a weaker Chilean peso. At the end of 2014, 
164,700 tonnes of copper were provisionally priced at 
287 c/lb. Provisional pricing plus final liquidation of copper 
sales resulted in a negative EBIT adjustment of $196 million 
for 2014, versus a negative EBIT adjustment of $92 million  
in 2013. 
MARKETS 
2014 2013
Average market prices (c/lb) 311 332
Average realised prices (c/lb) 300 326
The average LME copper cash settlement price decreased 
by 6% in the year to 31 1 c/lb (2013: 332 c/lb). The copper 
price fell sharply in March due to fears of large scale 
destocking in China. Despite a rebound in the price following 
the Qingdao warehousing scandal in June, the recovery  
was tempered by a mild Chinese summer, leading to slower 
growth in the production of air conditioners, while usage  
of copper and copper alloys in Europe exhibited seasonal 
weakness. On the supply side, strong output from many  
of the largest producing mines and the ramp up of new 
production more than offset constraints in exports  
from Indonesia. 
OPERATING PERFORMANCE 
Production at Los Bronces was 404,500 tonnes, 3% lower 
than in 2013. Strong throughput performance was achieved 
as a result of higher mine extraction rates improving the 
continuity of ore supply and debottlenecking of the plants. 
This was offset by expected lower grades. Material mined 
increased by 13% and reached record levels of 145 Mt, 
with waste stripping increasing by 14% to 62 Mt. 
Anglo American’s share of Collahuasi’s production of 
207,000 tonnes was 6% higher than the prior year. This  
was a reflection of continued high grades resulting from 
improved fleet and primary crusher performance allowing 
accelerated extraction from the Rosario pit, as well as 
throughput recovering from the 49-day shutdown of  
the SAG Mill 3 in 2013. Material mined also reached  
record levels at Collahuasi, increasing by 9% to 251 Mt 
(100% basis).
Production at El Soldado decreased by 37% following 
expected lower grades arising from the intersection  
with a geological fault encountered in 2013. Output at 
Mantos Blancos and Mantoverde decreased by 4% and  
9% respectively, owing to expected lower grades. 
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK 
Production guidance for 2015 is in the range of 720,000 to 
750,000 tonnes as lower throughput rates at Los Bronces, 
resulting from constrained water supply during the first half 
of the year, are only partially offset by higher ore grades. 
Production is expected to be maintained at similar levels  
to 2014 at the other operations.

Cash capital expenditure for Nickel of $164 million (2013: $76 million) is offset by the capitalisation of $150 million (2013: $104 million) of net operating cash inflows generated by Barro Alto, which has not yet 
reached commercial production.
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW 
Nickel’s underlying EBIT was $21 million, a $65 million 
improvement over the prior year (2013: $44 million loss), 
owing to a $24 million favourable non-cash balance sheet 
gain, as a result of a weakening in the Venezuelan bolivar 
(relating to remaining Minera Loma de Níquel creditors), 
higher pricing, favourable exchange rates and improved 
cash costs at Codemin.
Underlying EBIT from the Barro Alto project continues to be 
capitalised as the asset is not yet in commercial production. 
Barro Alto’s underlying EBIT, before capitalisation, was 
$152 million, a $208 million improvement over the prior year 
(2013: $56 million loss) owing to higher pricing, improved 
cash costs, gains on excess electricity sales and favourable 
exchange rates.
MARKETS 
2014 2013
Average market prices (c/lb) 765 680
Average realised prices (c/lb) 731 646
The average LME nickel cash settlement price increased by 
13% in the year to 765 c/lb (2013: 680 c/lb). Demand levels 
improved while supply was constrained due to a reduction  
in nickel pig iron (NPI) production in China following the 
Indonesian nickel ore ban, and reductions in output from 
certain other producers. Overall, nickel consumption 
increased by 6%, while supply decreased by 2%.
The sizeable market surplus of 184,000 tonnes in 2013  
was reduced to 43,000 tonnes by the end of 2014.
OPERATING PERFORMANCE 
Nickel production increased by 8% as the improved 
performance at Barro Alto’s furnaces, and recovery from  
the operational issues experienced in 2013, more than 
offset the impact of the Line 2 rebuild which started in 
October 2014. At Codemin, output was 4% lower, reflecting 
the planned mining of lower grades.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK 
Production is expected to decline to a range of 20,000 to 
25,000 tonnes in 2015, as a consequence of the rebuild of 
Barro Alto’s two furnaces, thereafter increasing to between 
40,000 and  45,000 tonnes in 2016.

FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW 
Underlying EBIT at Niobium decreased by 18% to 
$67 million (2013: $82 million). This resulted from higher 
cash costs, driven by inflation and escalation in the costs  
of labour, mining and contracted services, partly offset by 
reduced expenditure on project studies. 
MARKETS 
Global average niobium prices decreased slightly, due  
to the euro weakening against the US dollar and production 
capacity increasing in an environment of largely stable 
overall demand. 
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW 
Underlying EBIT of $57 million was $1 1 million lower,  
mainly owing to lower sales prices and inflation, partly  
offset by favourable foreign exchange rates.
MARKETS 
Average annual pricing in 2014 was broadly unchanged 
from 2013. In Brazil, demand for phosphate fertilisers 
totalled approximately 13.4 Mt, a 3% increase on the 
previous year, mainly as a result of increased production  
of soybean and corn crops.
OPERATING PERFORMANCE 
Production of 1,1 13 kt of fertiliser was 7% lower than the 
prior year, mainly as a result of a reduction in throughput  
to optimise product quality, maintenance activities and a  
power outage.
OPERATING PERFORMANCE 
Production of 4,700 tonnes was 4% higher, mainly due  
to the mining of higher grade ore and the start-up at the  
Boa Vista Fresh Rock (BVFR) project. 
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK 
Production from existing operations is expected to  
increase to 6,800 tonnes once BVFR has completed  
its ramp up.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK 
Fertiliser production over the next three years is expected to 
be broadly similar to 2014, with any year-on-year variations 
relating to product mix optimisation (reflecting market 
demand) and major maintenance activities.

Anglo American Platinum Limited (Platinum) is 78% owned by Anglo American. Production at Rustenburg and Union was also reduced 
following the planned restructuring and optimisation of 
these mines during 2013, and the closure of the last of the 
decline sections at Union mine during the fourth quarter  
of 2014, all of which accounted for a further reduction of 
1 14,000 ounces.
These losses were partially compensated by strong 
performances from Mogalakwena mine and increases at 
some of Platinum’s independently managed operations. 
Production from these operations rose by 2%, led by a  
15% increase at Bokoni, 5% at BRPM and 4% at Kroondal.
The record production at Mogalakwena mine was due  
to higher head grades and increased concentrator 
throughput, supported by improved mining performance. 
On-mine production increased by 9% to 348,000 ounces, 
while toll concentrating activities at a third party 
concentrator yielded 22,000 ounces.
Refined platinum production was 21% lower at 1.89 million 
ounces (2013: 2.38 million ounces) owing to production 
shortfalls at the strike affected operations. However, this was 
partially offset by a drawdown of pipeline metal inventory. 
The pipeline was steadily increased to normal operating 
levels by year end, once the mines had ramped up to full 
production. Refined palladium output decreased by 1 1%, 
while refined production of rhodium decreased by 22%, 
reflecting the industrial action, a different ore source mix 
from operations, and different pipeline processing times  
for each metal. Refined nickel production increased by  
25% to 28,200 tonnes, which was boosted by an additional 
2,000 tonnes from toll refining, resulting in an overall 
increase in base metal production to 47,600 tonnes, an 
increase of 10,000 tonnes.
Sales volumes exceeded production volumes owing to the 
drawdown of built up metal inventory, but were 9% lower 
than 2013. 
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK 
As a result of the successful post-strike ramp up of 
operations during the third quarter of 2014, Platinum is 
expected to return to baseline production (equivalent 
refined and refined production) and sales of between  
2.3 and 2.4 million platinum ounces in 2015, with  
reduced output from the decline closures at Union mine  
in the fourth quarter of 2014 being offset by improved 
output through the implementation of operational 
improvement plans. 
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW 
Underlying EBIT decreased by $432 million to $32 million 
(2013: $464 million) as a consequence of the five-month 
industrial action in South Africa, which had a material impact 
on production. Sales volumes were also impacted, though to 
a lesser extent, as sales commitments were met through the 
drawdown of both pipeline and refined product inventory. 
Year-on-year cash operating costs per equivalent refined 
platinum ounce increased by 20% to $2,1 12 per ounce, 
owing primarily to lower production from strike impacted 
mines that continued to incur fixed overhead costs during 
the period of industrial unrest and increased input costs, 
including the wage settlement which added approximately 
9% to the cost of employment, and electricity costs. The 
impact of the strike was partially mitigated by applying the 
‘no work, no pay’ principle and implementing strict cost 
controls. The weaker rand also had a favourable impact  
on unit costs. 
In addition to the higher operating costs, the drawdown  
of metal inventory during the year to fulfil sales 
commitments also impacted cost of sales adversely.

Platinum group metal (PGM) prices in 2014 reflected the 
impact of the strike, producers selling from normal working 
inventory and inventory built up ahead of the anticipated 
industrial action, and macro-economic factors negatively 
affecting prices in the second half. For the year as a whole, 
the average platinum market price decreased by 7% to 
$1,385 per ounce, with an average platinum price in the  
first half of $1,438 per ounce and in the second half of 
$1,335 per ounce. Palladium and rhodium market prices 
increased by 1 1% and 10% to $803 per ounce and  
$1,173 per ounce respectively, and the dollar basket price 
increased by 3% to $2,428 per ounce.
OPERATING PERFORMANCE 
Total equivalent refined platinum production decreased  
by 21% to 1.84 million ounces (2013: 2.32 million ounces). 
The decline in production was primarily owing to the  
impact of the strike, which commenced on 23 January and 
ended on 24 June, and affected all of Platinum’s managed 
underground mines. This resulted in a steep fall in output 
from Rustenburg, Amandelbult and Union mines and a loss 
of 424,000 ounces of platinum. The build up to steady state 
production in the third quarter resulted in a further loss of 
108,000 ounces, bringing the total strike related impact to 
532,000 ounces.

. 
In Namibia, production was marginally higher at 1.9 million 
carats (Namdeb (land operations) 0.6 million and Debmarine 
Namibia 1.3 million), driven by strong operational improvement 
by the MV Mafuta vessel. Namdeb production was broadly in 
line with the previous year, despite a 19-day strike in the third 
quarter. Namdeb Holdings has received a 15-year licence 
extension for both land and sea operations to 2035.
In South Africa, a 2% decrease in output to 4.6 million carats 
(Venetia 3.2 million, Voorspoed 0.7 million and Kimberley 
0.7 million), was principally due to lower grades at Kimberley. 
In Canada, production was slightly lower at 1.8 million carats 
(Snap Lake 1.2 million and Victor 0.6 million). A decline  
in production at Snap Lake of 0.1 million carats was due  
to the impact of flooding, forest fire smoke protocols,  
and reviewing and implementing revised ground  
support standards. Work continues to optimise Snap Lake  
to enable economic access to the promising, though 
challenging, orebody. 
Element Six (E6) enjoyed a year of solid growth, with a 
strong performance in the synthetic industrial diamond 
product groups, both for abrasives and advanced 
technology applications. This growth was offset partially by 
weakness in tungsten carbide sales in the first six months. In 
order to continue improving customer service and operating 
efficiencies, E6 announced in April that it would close its 
plant in Robertsfors, Sweden, to focus on its primary plants 
in Shannon, Ireland, and Springs, South Africa. 
Brands
Forevermark saw strong growth in 2014, with retail outlets 
up by 20%. The brand is now available in more than 1,500 
outlets in 34 markets. Since the launch of Forevermark, 
more than one million diamonds have received the 
Forevermark inscription and unique identification number. 
In 2014, De Beers Diamond Jewellers opened a new store in 
Selfridges in London and a concession in Saks Fifth Avenue, 
New York. There are now 35 De Beers stores in 12 key 
consumer markets around the world.
OPERATIONAL OUTLOOK
Diamond production (on a 100% basis) for 2015 is forecast 
to be in the range of 32 to 34 million carats, subject to 
market demand.
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW
De Beers’ underlying EBIT increased by 36% to $1.4 billion 
(2013: $1.0 billion). The increase was due primarily to solid 
demand across key markets, particularly the US, which 
resulted in strong revenue growth. Operating costs 
benefited from favourable exchange rate movements,  
which offset underlying inflationary pressures.
De Beers’ total sales rose 1 1% to $7.1 billion, with rough 
diamond sales up 12% to $6.5 billion. Higher rough  
diamond revenue was driven principally by a 12% increase 
in consolidated sales volumes to 32.7 million carats.  
Average realised diamond prices were in line with 2013 at 
$198/carat, driven by a 5% higher average rough price index 
in 2014, offset by a marginally lower product mix. 
MARKETS
Consumer demand for diamond jewellery showed positive 
growth in local currency terms in all the main markets in 
2014. The economic recovery gained momentum in the US, 
the largest consumer diamond market, which resulted in 
healthy diamond jewellery sales growth throughout the year. 
Growth in diamond jewellery demand in China continued, 
albeit at more modest levels, reflecting slowing economic 
growth. Macro-economic conditions in India started 
improving in the final quarter of 2014, following the election 
of a new government earlier in the year, which boosted 
consumer confidence, lifting hopes that growth will return. 
Polished prices ended the year broadly in line with where 
they started in 2014, with the increase in the first half of the 
year being offset by a reduction in the second half. Rough 
diamond prices increased over the course of 2014, albeit 
with some softness experienced towards the end of 2014 
and early in 2015.
In July, De Beers announced details of a new approach to  
its rough diamond Sightholder sales contracts. The new 
contract period, which will start in March 2015 and run for 
three years, with an option for De Beers to extend, requires, 
amongst other things, its rough diamond customers to 
comply with more rigorous financial and governance criteria 
in order to be eligible for supply.
OPERATING PERFORMANCE
Mining and manufacturing
De Beers’ full year production increase of 5% to 32.6 million 
carats (2013: 31.2 million carats) reflected a strong 
performance from Debswana, partly offset by slightly lower 
production at Snap Lake and Kimberley, with all other 
regions performing broadly in line with 2013. 
Debswana benefited from greater efficiency at its 
processing plants following operational improvement 
initiatives, producing 24.2 million carats (Orapa 12.9 million 
and Jwaneng 1 1.3 million). Performance was enhanced by 
recovery from the carry-over effects through 2012 and 2013 
of the Jwaneng slope failure clean-up as well as the Orapa

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 CORPORATE AND OTHER
Exploration
Anglo American exploration expenditure of $181 million  
represented a decrease of 13%, following reductions in 
diamonds, metallurgical coal and nickel exploration costs. 
Decreases are mainly attributable to an overall reduction  
in drilling activities.
Corporate activities and unallocated costs
Underlying EBIT was a $96 million loss, a decrease of  
$82 million. 
Corporate costs decreased by 24% ($1 18 million), of which 
$44 million resulted from corporate cost savings initiatives 
embedded during the year. Further reductions were mainly 
owing to a lower share scheme charge of $27 million  
(a decrease of 39%) and a foreign exchange gain of  
$19 million compared to 2013. This was partly offset by  
a 20% reduction in the allocation of corporate costs to 
business units of $59 million, reflecting the lower  
corporate cost base.
FINANCIAL AND OPERATING OVERVIEW 
Other Mining and Industrial
Underlying EBIT of $62 million was an improvement  
on the underlying operating loss of $13 million in 2013, 
mainly attributable to an improved performance from  
the Lafarge Tarmac joint venture.
Lafarge Tarmac joint venture
Anglo American’s share in the underlying EBIT of the joint 
venture was $78 million, a $69 million increase over 2013. 
Improved market conditions, combined with synergy 
delivery and efficiency initiatives, have led to improved 
margins and cash generation. The outlook for the UK 
construction market remains positive and further growth  
is expected in 2015.
Following the announcement on 7 July 2014 of an 
agreement in principle, the Group reached a binding 
agreement on 24 July 2014 to sell its 50% ownership 
interest in Lafarge Tarmac to Lafarge SA (Lafarge) for a 
minimum value of £885 million (approximately $1.35 billion 
at present) in cash, on a debt- and cash-free basis and 
subject to other customary working capital adjustments. 
The sale is subject to a number of conditions, including  
the completion of the proposed merger of Lafarge and 
Holcim Limited.

STRATEGIC REPORT CORPORATE AND OTHER I have long believed that good governance 
equals good business.
GOVERNANCE
BOARD COMPOSITION
Your Board comprises directors representing seven 
nationalities with experience from a broad range of sectors, 
as set out in the table on page 72. I am proud that we have 
achieved the Davies Report target of 25% women on the 
Board, and that our Board has been regularly refreshed 
such that no current non-executive director has served 
more than six years.
I am also pleased to report that we have been conscious  
of the value of incorporating ethnic diversity on our Board.  
I have agreed to accept an invitation from the UK 
government to set out a practical way ahead for FTSE 
companies to target ethnic diversity as a natural part of  
the recruitment process.
REGULATORY DISCLOSURES
We have taken the opportunity this year to revise the  
content and format of the Governance section to, hopefully, 
make it clearer and more concise. So, rather than simply 
repeat every piece of information from prior years, we  
have tried to report only what is relevant and of interest  
for 2014. For example, we have not reported this time  
on our approach to director induction as we have  
previously reported on the process followed for all  
current non-executive directors. The legal and regulatory 
requirements concerning disclosure in annual reports  
have developed incrementally over the years and, while  
this development has on the whole been beneficial, it  
has to some extent rendered sections of the report slightly 
redundant and repetitious. The Directors’ Report is a good 
example of this. Still required by law, but with much of its 
content reported elsewhere, it is difficult to decide where it 
should sit. We have therefore moved the Directors’ Report to 
the ‘Other Information’ section (on page 212). Our hope is 
that these changes will make the format flow more logically, 
and be more readable, while still ensuring full disclosure.
I do hope the following reports convey the importance we 
attach to our governance arrangements and that you find 
them useful and interesting.

CHAIRMAN’S INTRODUCTION
I am pleased once again to introduce the Governance 
section of the Annual Report, where we set out our 
approach to directing and controlling the activities of the 
Group. I have long believed that good governance equals 
good business, and I hope this report will offer readers  
some insight into how we try to achieve that.
I am pleased to report that your Company has complied in 
full with the UK Corporate Governance Code published in 
2012 (the ‘Code’). 
TONE FROM THE TOP
In this report, we describe the role of the Board and its 
committees, and of the chairman and chief executive, and 
we do so in terms of the tangible functions they perform – 
setting strategy, monitoring performance, etc. This  
provides useful factual information, but it does not quite 
capture everything. For me, one of the most important,  
but intangible, functions of the Board is to set the ‘tone  
from the top’. This is driven by the integrity, honesty and 
professionalism of the directors and the Board as a whole 
setting the drumbeat for the behavioural expectations of 
directors and employees. 
You cannot write a policy guide for this vital role, but you  
can promote it by recruiting the right people to the Board, 
with the right mix of skills and experiences, coupled with 
committed leadership.

Governance BOARD VISITS TO OPERATIONS
We recognise the importance of getting out of the 
boardroom and visiting the Group’s operations on the 
ground. Such visits provide directors with opportunities to 
meet with local employees, ‘kick the tyres’ and gain insights 
that are simply not available from spreadsheets and  
PowerPoint presentations. 
During 2014, the entire Board visited the Mogalakwena 
platinum mine in South Africa as part of the October  
Board meeting, and individual directors made visits to the 
Sishen iron ore mine in South Africa, and the Michiquillay, 
Quellaveco, Collahuasi and El Soldado copper projects/ 
mines in South America.

GOVERNANCE THE BOARD IN 2014 BOARD EVALUATION
In accordance with the Code, we conduct an externally 
facilitated evaluation every three years, with the next  
being due to take place during the course of 2015.  
Between the externally facilitated reviews, the Board 
undertakes an online, questionnaire based evaluation  
of its, and the committees’, performance. This is  
augmented by one-to-one interviews by the chairman  
with the non-executive directors.
The evaluation undertaken in late 2013 and reviewed  
by the Board in February 2014 found that, overall, the  
Board and its committees were performing well. The  
areas for improvement included: shorter presentations  
and longer discussions and, in terms of strategic 
discussions, more information on industry trends and 
competitor benchmarking was requested. That these 
suggested improvements are not new underlines the  
fact that improving board performance is an iterative, 
ongoing exercise, which is never entirely complete. 
A further internal evaluation was undertaken in late  
2014, the results of which were reviewed by the Board 
in February 2015.
Overall, performance of the Board was highly rated. 
However, as one would expect from an engaged board,  
there is the opportunity for further improvements. At a time  
of increased volatility in the industry the Board needs to 
continue its focus on the management of risks. It also  
needs to strengthen its links with the Management of the 
Businesses to ensure that the expertise and experience  
of Board members is utilised in support of restructuring  
and strategic change. Suggestions to improve our  
strategic debates, especially around our Strategy Day,  
will also be addressed. 
An action plan incorporating key suggestions for 
improvements will be debated at our next Board meeting  
to implement agreed change.
INVESTOR RELATIONS
The Company maintains an active engagement with its key 
financial audiences, including institutional shareholders and 
buy and sell-side analysts, as well as potential shareholders. 
The Investor Relations department manages the interaction 
with these audiences and regular presentations take place 
at the time of interim and final results as well as during the 
rest of the year, including an annual capital markets day.  
An active programme of communication with potential 
shareholders is also maintained. 
Any significant concerns raised by a shareholder in relation 
to the Company and its affairs are communicated to the 
Board. The Board is briefed on a regular basis by the 
Investor Relations department and analysts’ reports are 
circulated to the directors. Feedback from meetings held 
between executive management, or the Investor Relations 
department, and institutional shareholders, is also 
communicated to the Board.
During the year there were regular presentations to, and 
meetings with, institutional investors in the UK, South Africa, 
continental Europe, the US and Asia Pacific to communicate 
the strategy and performance of Anglo American. Executive 
directors as well as key executives, including business unit 
heads, host such presentations, which include seminars for 
investors and analysts and one-on-one meetings.
Throughout the year, executive management also presents 
at industry conferences that are mainly organised by 
investment banks for their institutional investor base.
The chairman, the senior independent director and other 
non-executive directors are available to shareholders to 
discuss any matter they wish to raise. The Company’s 
website provides the latest news and historical financial 
information, details about forthcoming events for 
shareholders and analysts, and other information regarding 
Anglo American.

79 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
Governance ENSURING INDEPENDENCE OF THE  
EXTERNAL AUDITORS
Anglo American’s policy on auditors’ independence is 
consistent with the ethical standards published by the  
Audit Practices Board.
A key factor that may impair auditors’ independence is a lack 
of control over non-audit services provided by the external 
auditors. In essence, the external auditors’ independence is 
deemed to be impaired if the auditors provide a service that:
 • results in the auditors acting as a manager or employee  
of the Group
 • puts the auditors in the role of advocate for the Group
 • creates a mutuality of interest between the auditors and  
the Group.
Anglo American addresses this issue through three primary 
measures, namely:
 • disclosure of the extent and nature of non-audit services
 • the prohibition of selected services – this includes the 
undertaking of internal audit services
 • prior approval by the Audit Committee chairman of 
non-audit services where the cost of the proposed 
assignment is likely to exceed $50,000.
Anglo American’s policy on the provision of non-audit 
services is regularly reviewed. The definition of prohibited 
non-audit services corresponds with the European 
Commission’s recommendations on auditors’ 
independence and with the Ethical Standards issued  
by the Audit Practices Board in the UK.
Other safeguards 
 • The external auditors are required to adhere to a rotation 
policy based on best practice and professional standards 
in the United Kingdom. The standard period for rotation of 
the audit engagement partner is five years and, for any key 
audit partner, seven years. The audit engagement partner 
was appointed in 2010 and will rotate off at the conclusion 
of the 2014 audit in accordance with this requirement. The 
appointment of a replacement engagement partner has 
been approved by the Audit Committee.
 • Any partner designated as a key audit partner of 
Anglo American shall not be employed by Anglo American 
in a key management position unless a period of at least  
two years has elapsed since the conclusion of the last 
relevant audit.
 • The external auditors are required to assess periodically, 
whether in their professional judgement, they are 
independent of the Group.
 • The Audit Committee ensures that the scope of the 
auditors’ work is sufficient and that the auditors are  
fairly remunerated.
 • The Audit Committee has primary responsibility  
for making recommendations to the Board on the 
appointment, re-appointment and removal of the  
external auditors.
 • The Audit Committee has the authority to engage 
independent counsel and other advisers as they  
determine necessary in order to resolve issues on  
auditors’ independence.
 • An annual assessment is undertaken of the auditors’ 
effectiveness, independence and objectivity. The 
effectiveness assessment involves a review with the  
senior finance managers in each of the business units  
and relevant corporate functions. 
Conclusions of the Audit Committee for 2014
The Audit Committee has satisfied itself that the UK 
professional and regulatory requirements for audit lead 
engagement partner rotation were adhered to and the 
external auditors’ independence was not impaired.
The Audit Committee held meetings with the external 
auditors without the presence of management on two 
occasions and the chairman of the Audit Committee held 
regular meetings with the audit engagement partner  
during the year. 
Consideration given to the appointment of the 
external auditors 
The Audit Committee’s assessment of the external  
auditors’ performance and independence underpins its 
recommendation to the Board to propose to shareholders 
the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditors until the 
conclusion of the AGM in 2016. Resolutions to authorise  
the Board to re-appoint and determine the remuneration  
of Deloitte LLP will be proposed at the AGM on 
23 April 2015.
Audit Tender
Anglo American recognises the outcome of the reviews of 
the statutory audit market undertaken by the EU and the 
Competition and Markets Authority including the associated 
transition rules. Under these arrangements, Anglo American 
will undertake, at the latest, a tender and rotation of the  
audit appointment at the time of the rotation of the lead 
engagement partner, which is due after completion of the 
2019 audit. 
Audit Committee actions in 2015
Priorities for 2015 will include assessment of risks for  
which the Audit Committee has responsibility, monitoring 
significant financial matters and review of new regulatory 
requirements for audit committees with respect to reporting 
and governance.
AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 80
GOVERNANCE AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT The role of internal audit
The Group has an internal audit department that reports 
centrally, with responsibility for reviewing and providing 
assurance on the adequacy of the internal control 
environment across all of Anglo American’s operations.
The head of internal audit is responsible for reporting  
and following up on the findings of this internal audit work 
with local management and the Audit Committee on a 
regular basis.
Internal audit teams operated in all of the Group’s principal 
divisions in the period under review, reporting findings to 
local senior management. The internal audit function’s 
mandate and annual audit coverage plans have been 
approved by the Audit Committee.
The Audit Committee met independently with the head of 
internal audit during the year.
Obtaining assurance on the internal  
control environment
The system of internal control, which is embedded in all  
key operations, provides reasonable rather than absolute 
assurance that the Group’s business objectives will be 
achieved within the risk tolerance levels defined by the 
Board. Regular management reporting, which provides  
a balanced assessment of key risks and controls, is an 
important component of board assurance. 
During 2014, Anglo American detected a fraud committed 
by a project director for a development project in Australia 
involving an override of management controls in 
procurement and payments to fictitious suppliers. The 
project director had performed a similar role in Chile 
previously and forensic investigation established a similar 
fraud had been committed in that project. A separate fraud 
was identified in the Copper business perpetrated by a key 
contractor to the Los Bronces mine. In each case, the losses 
suffered were not material. The Company is taking steps to 
improve its controls to address identified weaknesses.
Whistleblowing programme
The Group has had a whistleblowing programme in place  
for a number of years in all its managed operations.
This facility operates in addition to a standardised Group-
wide stakeholder complaints and grievance procedure  
that is operated at all managed operations (see the 2014 
Sustainable Development Report for more details). The 
whistleblowing programme, which is monitored by the Audit 
Committee, is designed to enable employees, customers, 
suppliers, managers or other stakeholders, on a confidential 
basis, to raise concerns in cases where conduct is deemed 
to be contrary to our values. 
During 2014, 302 (2013: 372) reports were received via  
the global ‘Speak Up’ facility covering a broad spectrum of 
concerns, including:
 • ethical
 • criminal
 • supplier relationships
 • health and safety
 • HR issues.
Reports received were kept strictly confidential and were 
referred to appropriate line managers within the Group for 
resolution. Where necessary, action was taken to address 
the issues raised. A governance process is in place to ensure 
all reports are analysed and acted upon.

GOVERNANCE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE 1.  INTRODUCTORY LETTER
Dear Shareholder,
The role of the Company’s Remuneration Committee 
remains to ensure that the remuneration arrangements  
for executive directors and other members of the Group 
Management Committee offer them every encouragement 
to enhance the Company’s performance and deliver our 
strategy in a responsible manner. It is also our task to ensure 
that the rewards received by the executive directors are 
proportionate to the levels of performance achieved and the 
returns received by you as shareholders. As a Committee, 
we therefore have to give full consideration to the 
Company’s strategy, its performance, your interests and  
the interests of the wider communities we affect. 
As reported by the chief executive in his introduction to  
this year’s Annual Report, it has been a challenging year  
for Anglo American. Whilst 2014 has seen a marked 
softening of commodity prices, the Company is continuing 
its operational turnaround and delivering on many of its 
strategic objectives, for example:
 • completing the Minas-Rio project, with first iron ore 
shipped before the end of October and production  
being ramped up
 • rolling out a revised operating model to  
improve operational performance
 • continuing the review of its asset portfolio
 • implementing organisational change.
DIRECTORS’  
REMUNERATION  
REPORT
The role of the Company’s Remuneration 
Committee remains to ensure that the 
remuneration arrangements for executive 
directors offer every encouragement for them  
to enhance the Company’s performance and 
deliver our strategy in a responsible manner .
The economic challenges and business performance  
are reflected in the remuneration received by executive 
directors in 2014. Specifically:
 • underlying earnings were ahead of the targets set at the 
start of the year
 • the relatively subdued level of earnings over the last  
three years means that the required three-year earnings 
growth was not achieved and, therefore, of the 
Enhancement Shares initially awarded in 2012, none 
vested at the end of 2014
 • the results of the Company’s longer term efficiency 
programmes mean that half the Long Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP) awards initially granted to executive directors in 
2012 are likely to vest. The remainder will not vest as the 
full value of these savings has yet to be returned to you, as 
shareholders, in the form of superior Total Shareholder 
Return (TSR).
We have chosen to reproduce the Company’s 
Remuneration Policy (as approved at the 2014 Annual 
General Meeting (AGM)) in full, rather than an abridged 
version, so that the Implementation Report for 2014, starting 
on page 93, will be more meaningful for you.
The Remuneration Policy continues to support the delivery 
of our strategic objectives as evidenced by the performance 
measures and targets for both the Bonus Share Plan (BSP) 
and LTIP awards made in 2014, both of which are outlined in 
the Implementation Report.
I am pleased to report that the strengthening of the malus 
and clawback provisions of the BSP and LTIP , introduced for 
awards made from 2014 onwards, meet the requirements of 
the revised Corporate Governance Code that will apply for 
the 2015 reporting year.

Purpose Maximum opportunity Operation
Basic salary To recruit and 
retain high calibre 
executives
Standard maximum increase 
5% of salary
(the Committee retains the discretion  
to exceed this in certain situations as 
explained under Operation)
Basic salary levels are reviewed annually by the Committee, 
taking account of Company performance, individual 
performance, levels of increase for the broader UK 
population and inflation 
Reference may also be made to median levels within 
relevant FTSE 50 and global extractive companies
The Committee also considers the impact of any basic 
salary increase on the total remuneration package
Annual increases are typically within the standard  
maximum given 
However, there may be occasions when the Committee 
needs to recognise, for example, development in role, 
change in responsibility and/or specific retention issues.  
In these circumstances, the Committee may offer a higher 
annual increase, the rationale for which will be explained  
to shareholders in the relevant remuneration report 
Maximum levels will be reviewed to take account of any 
significant rise in inflation levels 
Salary levels on recruitment and promotion to the Board are 
covered below 
Bonus Share 
Plan (BSP)
To encourage and 
reward delivery of 
the Company’s 
strategic priorities
To help ensure, 
through the 
share-based 
elements, that  
any resulting 
performance is 
sustained over the 
longer term in line 
with shareholder 
interests
Maximum (threshold) 
210% of salary (0% of salary)
Performance measures 
At least 50% – underlying earnings  
per share (EPS)
Up to 50% – individual objectives linked 
to the Company’s strategic priorities
A deduction to the above is applied if 
safety targets are not met 
Form and timing of payment 
40%: cash award at end of year 
40%: Bonus Shares vesting three  
years after end of bonus year
20%: Bonus Shares as above  
but subject to a further two-year  
deferral period 
Each year executive directors participate in the BSP , which 
rewards EPS and individual performance targets
The EPS measure has been chosen as it is one of the 
Company’s key measures of performance. As EPS 
performance in our sector can be highly volatile owing to 
external factors, the individual objectives measure was 
chosen to provide a balance and reflect management’s 
underlying activity towards delivering the company’s 
strategy regardless of price or other volatility 
The EPS targets are set each year to ensure they are 
demanding yet realistic. They primarily reflect internal 
budgets and price expectations for the year. Consideration 
is also given to prior performance and external expectations. 
The individual objectives are based on the Company’s 
strategic priorities for the year
Dividends are payable on Bonus Shares during any  
deferral period
The Committee is able to reduce any unvested Bonus Share 
awards, vested awards subject to a deferral period or future 
awards in the event of a material misstatement in the 
Company’s results, misconduct or a material failing in risk 
management processes that has given, or is likely to give, rise 
to significant and lasting value destruction for the Company
2. POLICY ON DIRECTOR REMUNERATION
2.1 Remuneration policy
Figures 1 and 2 summarise key aspects of the Company’s 
remuneration policy for executive and non-executive 
directors. This policy and the policy on termination set out  
in Figure 4 took effect for the purposes of S226D of the 
Companies Act on approval by shareholders at the AGM 
held on 24 April 2014. The Company has been operating 
these policies since 1 January 2014 and intends that these 
policies should apply until the Company’s 2017 AGM, 
subject to any unforeseen developments. It is the 
Committee’s intention that commitments entered into 
before these policies took formal effect and which are 
inconsistent with them should be honoured, as explained 
further below.
Figure 1 shows the Remuneration Policy approved at the 
AGM in 2014, updated to reflect the fact that some historical 
information is no longer relevant.

Discretions 
Given the volatility mentioned above, the Committee does 
not intend to make adjustments to BSP outcomes to reflect 
either positive or negative short term fluctuations in EPS 
performance driven by external factors such as commodity 
prices. It reserves the discretion to make adjustments to 
outcomes in very exceptional circumstances whether 
related to internal or external factors (for example, on a 
sequestration of assets during the year). Shareholders  
will be given details of any adjustments in the following 
remuneration report
Under the BSP Rules, the Company also has the standard 
discretion to take appropriate action in the event of 
unforeseen events which affect the Bonus Shares (for 
example, on a variation in share capital) and to settle the 
Bonus Shares in cash (for example, on a termination)

Vesting at threshold  
ROCE: 25% of award portion

The Committee makes an annual conditional award of

The ROCE measure has been selected to reflect the 
strategic focus on disciplined capital allocation and the  
TSR measures to reflect the extent to which value is being 
delivered to shareholders 
Each year, the Committee reviews the performance targets 
prior to grant to ensure they remain sufficiently stretching. 
The initial ROCE targets have been informed by the 
Company’s stated 2016 attributable ROCE aspiration and 
each year will be set with reference to current budgets. The 
relative TSR targets are set such that only a quarter of the 
award is payable for median performance whilst maximum 
vesting requires exceptional relative performance 
Dividend equivalents are paid on any shares that vest
The Committee is able to reduce any unvested awards, 
vested awards subject to a holding period or future grants 
in the event of a material misstatement in the Company’s 
results, misconduct or a material failing in risk management 
processes that has given, or is likely to give, rise to significant 
and lasting value destruction for the Company
Discretions 
As is the case for the BSP , the Committee does not intend  
to make adjustments to LTIP outcomes to reflect either 
positive or negative short term fluctuations in performance 
driven by external factors such as commodity prices. It 
reserves the discretion to make adjustments to outcomes  
in very exceptional circumstances whether related to 
internal or external factors (for example, on a sequestration 
of assets). Shareholders will be given details of any

Pension To offer market-

30% of basic salary Executive directors participate in defined contribution 
pension arrangements
Prior to 6 April 201 1, executive directors had the option of  
all or part of their employer-funded defined contribution 
arrangements being paid into an unregistered retirement 
benefits scheme (an EFRBS). Since 6 April 201 1, executive 
directors have the option for contributions which may not be 
paid to a UK registered pension scheme as a result of HMRC 
limits (either annual allowance or lifetime allowance) to be 
treated as if paid to an unregistered unfunded retirement 
benefit scheme (an UURBS)
The Committee is prepared to consider requests from 
executive directors for a pension allowance to be paid in 
place of defined contribution arrangements

Maximum level of ongoing benefits 
Capped at 10% of salary
Exceptional situations 
The Committee reserves the discretion 
to exceed the ongoing maximum level

such as relocation. Full details of the 
exercise of any such discretion will be 
provided to shareholders in the 
following remuneration report
The Company provides the following ongoing benefits:
 • 28 days’ leave and encashment of any accumulated leave 
in excess of 20 days
 • car-related benefits
 • medical insurance
 • death and disability insurance
 • limited personal taxation and financial advice
 • club membership
 • other ancillary benefits, including attendance at  
relevant public events.
In addition, the Company pays additional benefits  
when specific business circumstances require it,  
including costs and allowances related to relocation  
and international assignments
UK-based executive directors, as UK employees, are eligible 
to participate in the Company’s Save As You Earn (SAYE) 
scheme and Share Incentive Plan (SIP). In terms of HMRC 
rules these plans do not have performance conditions

To secure the

Maximum annual award
(for ongoing arrangements)
BSP: 210% of salary
LTIP: 350% of salary
The ongoing remuneration arrangements for a newly 
recruited or promoted executive director will reflect the 
remuneration policy in place for executive directors at the 
time of the appointment. The ongoing components will 
therefore comprise basic salary, BSP awards, LTIP awards, 
benefits, pension and SAYE/SIP on the bases set out above 
The initial basic salary level for a newly recruited or 
promoted executive director will be set to reflect the 
individual’s experience, salary levels within the Company 
and market levels. Where basic salary is set below the level 
that might be expected, given the executive’s relative 
inexperience, and the executive then develops successfully 
into the role, the Committee has the discretion to give a 
salary increase in the year(s) after appointment above the 
standard maximum level of 5% 
For external appointments, the Committee may also offer 
additional cash and/or share-based elements to replace any 
remuneration forfeited, when it considers this to be in the 
best interests of the Company and its shareholders. The 
terms of any share-based elements offered will reflect the 
nature, time horizons and performance requirements of 
remuneration forfeited and will have performance 
conditions attached. Shareholders will be informed of any 
such payments at the time of appointment. The Company 
has retained its Discretionary Option Plan to use in such 
circumstances, if appropriate. If necessary, the Company 
can go outside of existing plans as currently permitted under 
the Listing Rules
It is the Committee’s intention that the restricted awards 
granted to Mark Cutifani on appointment will be released  
in accordance with the terms on grant. These awards were 
made under the approved policy at the time, as disclosed  
in the 2012 Report 
For internal appointments, any commitments made before 
appointment and not relating to appointment are allowed to 
pay out according to their terms 
For external and internal appointments, the Committee may 
agree that the Company will meet certain relocation 
expenses as appropriate

Shareholding targets
Within five years of appointment, executive directors are 
expected to hold Company shares with a value of three 
times basic salary in respect of the chief executive and two 
times basic salary in respect of other executive directors. 
The Committee takes into consideration achievement 
against these targets when making grants under the 
Company’s various long term incentive plans.
External directorships
Executive directors are not permitted to hold external 
directorships or offices without the prior approval of the 
Board. If approved, they may each retain the fees payable 
from only one such appointment.
Executive director contractual commitments
The remuneration provisions within the service contracts  
for Mark Cutifani and René Médori are consistent with  
the policies outlined in Figure 1 and in Figure 4  
(termination provisions). 
Policy in rest of company
The remuneration arrangements for the executive  
directors outlined in Figure 1 are consistent with those  
for other executives serving on the Group Management 
Committee, although opportunity levels vary. The majority 
of our employees are located in South Africa and South 
America, and the remuneration arrangements of these 
employees are aligned to local market practices and levels. 
Past directors
In addition to retirement benefits, the Company continues  
to provide seven former executive directors with private 
medical insurance arrangements. The annual cost to the 
Company is minimal. The Committee continues to meet 
these longstanding commitments but no new commitments

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 2.3 Indicative total remuneration levels
The Company’s policy for executive directors results  
in a significant portion of the remuneration received  
by executive directors being dependent on Company 
performance. Figure 3 illustrates how the total pay 
opportunities for the chief executive and the finance  
director vary under three different performance scenarios: 
 • Above – representing 100% of maximum for variable  
pay opportunity
 • Target – representing a notional 65% of maximum  
for variable pay opportunity
 • Below – representing 0% of maximum for variable  
pay opportunity.
These charts are indicative as share price movement  
and dividend accrual have been excluded. All assumptions 
made are noted below the charts.
2.4 Policy on termination and change in control

Figure 4 sets out the Company’s policy on termination. This 
policy is consistent with provisions relating to termination of 
employment in the executive directors’ service agreements 
and with provisions in the incentive plan rules with one

exception. René Médori’s service agreement contains a 
longstanding provision under which the Company may pay  
a lump sum in lieu of any notice period, comprising salary, 
bonus and pension contributions in respect of the unexpired 
notice period, with the bonus element calculated based  
on the average bonus percentage paid over the last three  
years and prorated based on the time employed during the 
bonus year. The Committee intends, if required, to meet this 
obligation but does not intend to include such a clause in  
any future service agreements.
Figure 5 sets out key provisions relating to change of control,  
where there is no termination. There are no provisions for 
enhanced payments in the event of a change of control of 
the Company. 
2.4.2 Non-executive directors
All non-executive directors have letters of appointment  
with the Company for an initial period of three years, subject 
to annual re-appointment at the AGM. The Chairman’s 
appointment may be terminated by the Company with six 
months’ notice. The appointment letters for the Chairman 
and non-executive directors provide that no compensation 
is payable on termination, other than any accrued fees  
and expenses.

Governance
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 2.5 Development of director remuneration policy
In developing and reviewing the Company’s remuneration 
policy for executive directors and other senior executives, 
the Committee is receptive to the views of shareholders and 
sensitive to the relationship between the arrangements for 
executive directors and those for other employee groups. 
Specifically:
 • whenever any significant changes are made to 
remuneration, the Committee seeks feedback from 
investors. The Committee also listens to and takes into 
consideration investor views and comments throughout 
the year. For example, greater clarity has been provided  
in the remuneration policy in respect of the maximum  
level of ongoing benefits for executive directors 
 • the Committee considers the general basic salary  
increase for the broader UK employee population when 
determining the annual salary increases for the executive 
directors. The rate of basic salary increase for the chief 
executive and the finance director, at 3% and 2% of salary 
for 2014 and 2015 respectively, has been the same as the 
general increase, in both years, for the UK employee 
population

For the restricted shares currently held by the chief 
executive, if he leaves as a ‘Good Leaver’ before the 
remaining designated release dates, any unvested shares 
would be released on the earlier of the remaining release 
dates or one year from the date of the chief executive ceasing 
to be the Company’s chief executive
Generally Forfeit Forfeit
Other Limited disbursements (for example, legal costs, relocation 
costs, untaken holiday)
None None
 • each year the Committee also reviews in detail how  
the arrangements for the executive directors compare  
to those for other members of the Group Management 
Committee to ensure an appropriate relationship and to 
support career development and succession.
Given the geographic spread of the Company’s workforce, 
the Committee does not consider that consulting with 
employees on the remuneration policy for directors is a 
sensible use of resources. Many of the Company’s 
UK-based employees are shareholders, through the SAYE 
and SIP schemes, and they, like other shareholders, are able 
to express their views on director remuneration at each 
general meeting.
2.6 Payments under previous policies
The Committee reserves the right to make any remuneration 
payments and payments for loss of office, notwithstanding 
that they are not in line with the policy set out above, where the 
terms of the payment were agreed (i) before the policy or the 
relevant legislation came into effect or (ii) at a time when the 
relevant individual was not a director of the Company and,  
in the opinion of the Committee, the payment was not in 
consideration for the individual becoming a director of the 
Company. For these purposes ‘payments’ includes the 
satisfaction of awards of variable remuneration and, in relation 
to awards of shares, the terms of the payment which are 
agreed at the time the award is granted.

3.  DIRECTOR REMUNERATION IN 2014
The information set out in this section has been subject to 
external audit.
Figures 6 to 1 1 show the outcomes for 2014 of the main 
components of executive director remuneration, including 
the expected vesting of share awards with a performance 
period ending in 2014, and Figure 12 sets out the total 
remuneration outcomes.
Conditional share awards made in 2014 are set out in  
Figure 15 in Section 4.1.
3.1 Basic salary for 2014
Figure 6 sets out the basic salaries for 2014.
Mark Cutifani was appointed chief executive with effect 
from 3 April 2013. His annual salary level on appointment 
was £1,200,000. Mark Cutifani received a salary increase  
 of 3% in 2014. 
René Médori received a salary increase of 3% in 2014.
3.2 Annual BSP outcomes for 2014
Figure 7 shows the BSP outcomes for 2014. Figures 8a  
and 8b summarise the annual financial and personal 
strategic measures for the 2014 BSP for Mark Cutifani and 
René Médori, along with the performance targets, where 
relevant, the level of performance achieved and the resulting 
award levels. Key details of the performance delivered over 
2014 are set out under BSP Key Performance Aspects.
The Committee reviewed the annual targets set at the 
beginning of 2014 and, in light of the positive results 
achieved across the group in 2013, decided to raise 
threshold performance expectations to a more stretching 
level in 2014 (threshold of $1.50). To ensure the core 
structure of the incentive scheme remained the same, the 
potential pay out at threshold performance was increased to 
17.6%, on this measure, with no payment for performance 
below threshold. The resulting target and maximum 
outcomes remained the same.
The executives’ individual objectives were set at the start  
of the year and reflect the Company’s strategic priorities for 
the year. Each category contained between one and five 
specific objectives. Some of these are reflected under BSP 
Key Performance Aspects. Given the non-financial nature  
of these, specific quantitative targets were not set but, at the 
end of the year, the Committee made a detailed assessment  
of performance against each, leading to the evaluations 
shown in Figures 8a and 8b. The overall outcome for each 
executive director was then adjusted by the safety deductor 
(based on loss of life, lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR) 
and a risk and change management rating).

Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 3.3 BSP Enhancement  
Share outcomes for 2014 
In 2012, René Médori was awarded 16,538 
Enhancement Shares under the BSP . Vesting was subject  
to the Company’s real EPS growth over the three-year 
period to 31 December 2014. The growth targets set on 
award were the UK Retail Price Index (RPI) +9% for 
threshold performance (resulting in 44% of the award 
vesting) and RPI + 15% for maximum performance 
(resulting in 100% of award vesting). Threshold 
performance was not achieved over the three-year  
period, resulting in no vesting of the shares.

SECTOR INDEX COMPARISON  
(25% OF TOTAL AWARD)
 • The Sector Index measure compares the Company’s 
three-year TSR performance with the weighted  
median of six international mining companies. 
 • Vesting required the Company’s TSR performance  
to be at least equal to the weighted median. 
 • As at 31 December 2014, the Company’s TSR 
performance was below the weighted median; it is 
therefore not expected that any shares will vest for  
this part of the award.
FTSE 100 COMPARISON  
(25% OF TOTAL AWARD)
 • The FTSE 100 measure compares the Company’s 
three-year TSR performance with the constituents  
of the FTSE 100.
 • Vesting required the Company’s TSR performance  
to be at least equal to the median TSR of the FTSE 100. 
 • As at 31 December 2014, the Company’s TSR 
performance was ranked below the 50th percentile  
of the FTSE 100; it is therefore expected that no shares 
for this part of the award will vest.
AOSC  
(50% OF TOTAL AWARD)
 • The AOSC measure rewards the delivery of additional 
operating profit and capital expenditure savings 
delivered through the Company’s Asset Optimisation 
and Supply Chain programmes.
 • Minimum vesting required cumulative savings to 
31 December 2014 of $4.6 bn and maximum vesting 
required cumulative savings of $5.6 bn.
 • Actual performance was $7.7 bn, leading to  
100% vesting of this part of the award (50% of the 
overall award).

3.4 Long Term Incentive  
Plan outcomes for 2014
In 2012, René Médori received an LTIP grant of 85,048 
conditional shares vesting subject to (a) the Company’s TSR 
performance relative to (i) a weighted group of international 
mining companies and (ii) FTSE 100 companies over the 
three-year period to announcement of the 2014 results, and 
(b) the level of savings delivered by the Asset Optimisation 
and Supply Chain programmes to 31 December 2014.
Figure 10 sets out further details of the measures and  
the Company’s expected performance against each.  
As the performance period for the TSR measures ends 
immediately after the date of this report on the 
announcement of the 2014 results, performance and

LTIP KEY PERFORMANCE ASPECTS
 • Actions taken on the back of the 2013 Asset Review 
process continued to assist in delivering AOSC benefits 
across all businesses during 2014. The implementation 
of either quick return or long term value initiatives 
identified during the asset review process was 
kick-started during 2014.
 • Specific AO highlights include improvements in 
Longwall cutting hours at Moranbah and Grasstree 
(Coal in Australia), increased average throughput at  
Los Bronces SAG Mill (Copper) and secondary crusher 
debottlenecking at Mogalakwena North (Platinum). 
 • Specific SC highlights include Global Framework 
Agreements with Komatsu and Caterpillar which 
resulted in preferential pricing; increased rail capacity 
and reduced rail rates in Kumba; and electricity cost 
savings derived through the resale of electricity at  
Iron Ore Brazil and Nickel.
 • Continuing Improvement in relationships with suppliers 
are driving reduced cost, lead time and supply risk to 
our business.
 • Should the 2012 LTIP awards vest at 50%, 42,524 
shares are receivable by René Médori. At a share price 
of £12.98 (the average for the last quarter of 2014), this 
results in a value of £551,962. Dividend equivalents 
over the vesting period will also be payable at vesting, 
estimated to be £66,105.

GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 (1) 
In addition to his basic salary, René Médori retained fees amounting to £81,000 in respect of one external directorship (see Section 2.2).
(2) 
Benefits for executive directors with a value over £5,000 are set out below. The executive directors also receive a limited amount of financial advice, club subscriptions, death  
and disability benefits, and medical insurance and other ancillary benefits. As indicated in the 2013 Annual Report, the Company reimbursed Mark Cutifani for the tax paid on his 
relocation benefits (except the relocation allowance) on a ‘grossed up’ basis in 2014.

The pension contribution amounts should be read in conjunction with the following information:
(a) The amount stated for Mark Cutifani for 2014 includes a cash allowance of £288,000.
(b) The total amount of pension contributions treated as having been paid into the UURBS for 2014 was £237,000 for René Médori (2013: £221,000).
(c) Contributions treated as being paid into the UURBS earn a return equivalent to the Company’s pre-tax sterling nominal cost of debt. The total return earned in 2014 was 
£59,000 for René Médori (2013: £45,000).
(d) As at 31 December 2014, the total balances due to the executive directors in relation to the UURBS was £1,330,000 for René Médori (2013: £1,034,000). Retirement 
benefits can only be drawn from the UURBS if a member has attained age 55 and has left Group service.
(4) 
60% of the amount shown for annual bonus will be paid in Bonus Shares with deferred receipt. For 40%, vesting will occur after a further three years, subject to continued 
employment; for 20%, there is a further two-year holding period in addition to the three-year vesting period. 
(5) 
The performance condition attached to the 2012 Enhancement Share award was not met and none of these shares will vest.
(6) 
As vesting of the LTIP awards granted in 2012 is due to take place after publication of this report, vesting levels are on an ‘expected’ basis and a share price of £12.98 has been 
used to calculate the values shown. The value shown includes a dividend equivalent amount £66,105 for René Médori. The LTIP amounts shown in last year’s report in respect  
of the LTIPs awarded in 201 1 were also calculated on an ‘expected’ vesting levels basis with an assumed share price of £14.12. The actual vesting levels were as expected but  
the actual share price at vesting was £14.22, leading to the following increases in value: René Médori – estimated value £301,000; actual value £303,000 (increase of £2,000).
(7) 
The amount stated for Mark Cutifani in 2013 relates to the value on grant of the restricted shares awarded to him as compensation for the incentives forfeited on leaving his 
previous employer AngloGold Ashanti.
(8)  
Cynthia Carroll ceased to be chief executive on 3 April 2013, stepped down as a director on 19 April 2013 and ceased to be employed by the Company on 30 April 2013. 
 
In
 
2012, Cynthia Carroll was awarded 26,573 Enhancement Shares, none of which vested, as set out in Section 3.3.
 
In
 
2012, Cynthia Carroll received an LTIP grant of 157,333 shares relating to performance primarily over the three-year period to 31 December 2014. Full details of the 
performance measures and targets attaching to the grant are set out in Section 3.4, along with details of performance delivered and vesting levels. Ms Carroll’s award was 
prorated to 70,103 shares as she did not serve the last 20 months of the performance period. If the award vests at 50%, 35,051 shares are receivable by Ms Carroll and using  
the same share price, £12.98, as outlined in Figure 1 1, this results in a value of £454,962 and a dividend equivalent amount of £54,488. The LTIP amounts shown in last year’s 
report in respect of the LTIPs awarded in 201 1 were also calculated on an ‘expected’ vesting levels basis with an assumed share price of £14.12. The actual vesting levels were  
as expected but the actual share price at vesting was £14.22, leading to the following increases in value: Cynthia Carroll – estimated value £434,000; actual value £437,000 
(increase of £3,000).
(9) 
Sir John Parker’s Chairman’s fee was increased, for the first time since his appointment in 2009, with effect from 1 July 2013 and he has elected to waive his Nomination 
Committee chairman fees. Benefits with a value over £5,000 comprise car related benefits and medical insurance in line with the remuneration policy set out in Figure 2.
(10) 
David Challen and Sir CK Chow both retired from the Board with effect from 24 April 2014.

Ray O’Rourke has instructed the Company that his net fees be donated to charity.

GOVERNANCE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 4.  OUTSTANDING SHARE INTERESTS
The information in this section has been subject to  
external audit.
4.1 Conditional share awards granted in 2014
Figure 15 summarises the longer term, conditional share 
awards granted to directors during 2014. Receipt of these 
awards is dependent on the Company’s performance over 
2014– 16, as detailed below. Also included in Figure 15  
are the options granted to directors in 2014 under the 
Company’s SAYE scheme.
The value of Bonus Shares awarded to directors in 2014  
is included in the Annual Performance Bonus figures  
for 2013, set out in Figure 12.
4.2 Further details of LTIP awards granted in 2014
4.2.1 TSR – Euromoney Global Mining Index 
comparison
 • One quarter of the LTIP awards granted in 2014 vests 
according to the Company’s three-year TSR performance 
relative to the Euromoney Global Mining Index (the Index), 
previously named the HSBC Mining Index
 • The threshold for vesting is the Company’s three-year TSR 
being equal to the Index
 • Maximum vesting occurs when the Company’s TSR 
outperforms the Index by 6% pa
 • Between threshold and maximum, vesting is based on 
a straight line.

Directors, like all eligible UK employees, are able to make monthly savings over a set period. At the end of the period the funds can be used to purchase shares under option. The exercise price of the 2014 SAYE 
option was set at a 20% discount to the share price at the date of invitation, which is the same for any employee who participates in the scheme.

Governance
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 4.2.2 TSR – FTSE 100 comparison
 • One quarter of the LTIP awards granted in 2014 vests 
according to the Company’s three-year TSR performance 
compared with the TSR performance of the constituents 
of the FTSE 100 Index
 • Threshold vesting occurs when the Company’s three-year 
TSR is equal to the median TSR of the FTSE 100 
constituents
 • Maximum vesting occurs when the Company’s TSR is 
equal to or exceeds the TSR of the FTSE 100 company 
whose TSR performance is ranked at the 80th percentile 
 • Between target and maximum, vesting is based on a 
straight line basis.
The performance targets for both TSR measures were set to 
ensure that an appropriate level of performance would be 
required for each level of vesting. PwC, using a Monte Carlo 
model, have assessed the probability of achieving full 
vesting as approximately 20% and chance of achieving 
threshold vesting as 50%. 
Total shareholder return for both the TSR measures is 
calculated based on average returns over the three months 
prior to the end of the financial year. It is assumed that all 
dividends are reinvested on the ex-dividend date.
4.2.3 Return on Capital Employed (ROCE)
 • Vesting of one half of LTIP awards granted in 2014 
depends on the performance of the Company’s 
attributable ROCE over the three-year period to  
31 December 2016
 • The measure, tied to underlying achieved business return, 
aligns management reward with those of our shareholders. 
It is not adjusted for price or foreign exchange movements 
and refers to the externally reported attributable ROCE in 
the year of assessment, 2016
 • By design, attributable ROCE covers the financial 
outcomes of all management actions, both on balance 
sheet and income statement. The company’s Driving Value 
programme supports delivery of EBIT in the measure, 
through its focus on operational improvement, efficiencies 
and also improved marketing performance. Balance sheet 
efficiency is being progressed through Anglo American’s 
greater focus on capital efficiency and debt reduction.
4.3 Total interests in shares
Figure 17 summarises the total interests of the directors  
in shares of Anglo American plc as at 12 February 2015  
(and at the end of the 2014 financial year). These include 
beneficial and conditional interests. As already disclosed, 
Mark Cutifani is required to hold interests in shares to a  
value of three times basic salary (built up over five years)  
and René Médori to a value of two times salary.
The vesting schedule of Mark Cutifani’s one-off share award 
means that he is expected to have a net shareholding of 
beneficial shares equal to 60% of basic salary by the 2015 
AGM. Incentives awarded under the Company’s LTIP  
from 2013 will start to vest, subject to the satisfaction of 
performance conditions, from 2016 onwards and under the 
BSP from 2017. The requirements for René Médori will have 
been exceeded by the 2015 AGM.

Governance
Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 5. REMUNERATION IN 2015
The Company’s policy on executive director remuneration 
for 2015 is summarised in the policy statements in Figure 1. 
Figure 17 summarises how that policy will be implemented 
in 2015. It is the Company’s intention that the fees for 
non-executive directors will remain at their 2014 levels 
during 2015, although this will be kept under review. 
The EPS performance range for 2015 is considered to be 
commercially sensitive, although it will be disclosed in  
the 2015 remuneration report.
The Committee determined the target range of 9– 13% for 
the LTIP in 2015 based upon the following considerations:
Figure 17: Summary of key remuneration aspects in 2015

 • A range of 9– 13% is the equivalent of the 2014 LTIP  
target of 12– 16% should prices remain at the levels seen  
in early 2015 over the performance period. It is clear that 
unless there is a significant increase in prices over the 
performance period, there will be zero vesting on the 
ROCE element of the 2014 LTIP , even if there are material 
operational improvements during that time
 • The Threshold ROCE of 9% is higher than the 8%  
ROCE achieved in 2014 when prices were above the  
spot prices in early 2015
 • The range is based upon a Capital Employed figure  
which is not reduced by the impairments made over  
the past two years.

in this report, feedback from investors at the time of the 
2014 AGM, and more generally, helped shape clarifications 
to the remuneration policy for 2014 onwards.
7. SIX-YEAR REMUNERATION AND RETURNS
Figure 20a shows the Company’s TSR performance  
against the performance of the FTSE 100 Index from 
1 January 2009 to 31 December 2014. The FTSE 100 Index 
was chosen as being a broad equity market index which 
includes companies of a comparable size and complexity  
to Anglo American. 
TSR is calculated in US dollars, and assumes all dividends 
are reinvested. The TSR level shown as at 31 December 
each year is the average of the closing daily TSR levels for 
the five-day period up to and including that date.
Figure 20b shows the total remuneration earned by the 
incumbent chief executive over the same six-year period, 
along with the proportion of maximum opportunity earned 
in relation to each type of incentive. The total amounts are 
based on the same methodology as for Figure 12 (Total 
remuneration outcomes for 2014). 
For the period 2009 to 201 1, the TSR performance of the 
Company, and the remuneration received by Cynthia Carroll 
as chief executive, demonstrates that this was a period of 
strong operational performance and high commodity 
prices. These led to a doubling of profits and almost a 
doubling of underlying EPS in 2010. 
Cynthia Carroll’s remuneration levels in 201 1 also reflect 
record profits and strong EPS performance for the year in 
addition to the increase in value of the LTIP awards that 
vested at the end of 201 1 – when granted the Company’s 
share price was £12.61; the share price at vesting 
was £26.00. 
The outcome of longer term incentives from 2012, have 
been much lower, reflecting, in part, the impact of the fall 
in commodity prices on earnings and the returns delivered 
to shareholders.

By order of the Board
Mark Cutifani René Médori
Chief Executive Finance Director
Company law requires the directors to prepare financial 
statements for each financial year. The directors are 
required to prepare the Group financial statements in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), as adopted by the European Union and 
Article 4 of the IAS regulation, and have elected to prepare 
the parent company financial statements in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). The directors must not approve the accounts unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the 
state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or loss of  
the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements,  
the directors are required to:
 • select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently
 • make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent
 • state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards  
have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the financial statements
 • prepare the financial statements on the going concern  
basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the 
Company will continue in business.
In preparing the Group financial statements, IAS 1  
requires that directors:
 • properly select and apply accounting policies
 • present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information
 • provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRS is insufficient to enable 
users to understand the impact of particular transactions, 
other events and conditions on the entity’s financial 
position and financial performance
 • make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions, disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the financial position of the Company 
and enable them to ensure that the financial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also 
responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company  
and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention 
and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and financial information included 
on the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of financial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ 
RESPONSIBILITIES 
The directors are responsible for preparing the 
Annual Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT  
TO THE MEMBERS OF ANGLO AMERICAN PLC
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources in the 
audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Impairments (notes 1 and 6)
As a consequence of the current volatility in 
commodity prices and foreign exchange rates, the 
assessment of the recoverable amount of operating 
assets and development projects is a key judgement. 
This includes specifically the Minas-Rio project  
within the Iron Ore and Manganese segment (where  
a post-tax impairment of $3.5 billion has been 
recorded) and the mines within the Coal segment 
(where a post-tax impairment of $0.3 billion has  
been recorded).
We challenged management’s assessment as to whether indicators of impairment exist for specific 
assets. Where such indicators were identified, specifically in relation to the Minas-Rio project and the 
mines within the Coal segment, we obtained copies of the valuation models used to determine the 
value in use or fair value less costs of disposal of the relevant asset. We challenged the assumptions 
made by management in relation to these models, including the discount rate used, the short-term 
and long-term commodity prices, capital expenditure and operating cost forecasts and the expected 
production profiles, by comparison to recent third party forecast commodity price data, reference to 
third party documentation where available, review of reserves and resources reports, consultation 
with operational management and consideration of sensitivity analyses. We assessed whether the 
assumptions had been determined and applied on a consistent basis across the Group.
Taxation (notes 1, 8 and 21)
The assessment of the Group’s taxation exposures in 
all jurisdictions is a key area of judgement particularly 
with respect to transfer pricing arrangements and the 
appropriateness of the recognition of deferred 
taxation assets.
We reviewed all potential taxation exposures within the Group and, through discussions with the 
Group’s tax department, the tax specialists within the audit team and review of relevant 
documentation, we assessed the appropriateness of the provisions raised. 
We considered, in the context of our tax specialists’ prior experience of similar issues, the Group‘s 
transfer pricing arrangements and deferred taxation assets and liabilities to confirm that they are 
reasonable. 
Special items and remeasurements (note 6)
The assessment of the appropriateness of items 
disclosed within ‘special items and remeasurements’ 
is a key judgement because of their impact upon 
the underlying financial performance achieved by 
the Group.
We considered and challenged each item disclosed within ‘special items and remeasurements’ as 
defined in note 6 to the financial statements. We determined, through examination of the audit 
evidence obtained relating to the underlying transactions and discussion with management, whether 
such categorisation is appropriate and consistent with the Group’s stated policy and past practice for 
recognition of such items, and whether, taken as a whole, the income statement is fair and balanced 
in its presentation.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit Committee discussed on page 42.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express an opinion 
on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described above, and we do not 
express an opinion on these individual matters.
Opinion on financial statements of Anglo American plc
In our opinion:
 • the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s 
and of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of the 
Group’s loss for the year then ended;
 • the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the 
European Union;
 • the parent company financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice 
(UK GAAP); and
 • the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated income statement, the 
Consolidated statement of comprehensive income, the Consolidated balance 
sheet, the Consolidated cash flow statement, the Consolidated statement of 
changes in equity, the accounting policies, the related notes 1 to 39 and the 
balance sheet of the parent company and related information. 
The financial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of 
the Group financial statements is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union. The financial reporting framework that has been applied in 
the preparation of the parent company financial statements is applicable law 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
As required by the Listing Rules we have reviewed the directors’ report 
on page 212 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
 • we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of 
accounting in the preparation of the financial statements is appropriate; and
 • we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant 
doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted,  
this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.  Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 111
Financial statements
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial 
statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use 
materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the 
results of our work.
We determined planning materiality for the Group to be $225 million 
(2013: $250 million), which is below 5% (2013: 5%) of pre-tax profit before 
special items and remeasurements, and below 1% (2013: 1%) of equity. 
Pre-tax profit is normalised for the materiality calculation to exclude special 
items (including impairments), remeasurements and other one off items that 
are audited separately and would, if included, significantly distort the 
materiality calculation year on year.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the Committee 
all audit differences in excess of $10 million (2013: $10 million), as well as 
differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on 
qualitative grounds. We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure 
judgements in the financial statement that we identified when assessing the 
overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its 
environment, including internal control, and assessing the risks of material 
misstatement. Audit work to respond to the risks of material misstatement 
was performed directly by the audit engagement team.
All business units were subject to a full scope audit with the exception of 
Manganese where specific audit procedures were performed. 
The Senior Statutory Auditor visits the principal location of each significant 
business unit at least once every year and key operational assets on a 
rotating basis.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies 
Act 2006
In our opinion:
 • the part of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and
 • the information given in the Strategic report and the Directors’ report for the 
financial year for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the financial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, in our 
opinion:
 • we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit; or
 • adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, 
or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from branches not 
visited by us; or
 • the parent company financial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Directors’ remuneration
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are also required to report if in our opinion 
certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration have not been made or the part 
of the Directors’ Remuneration report to be audited is not in agreement with 
the accounting records and returns. We have nothing to report arising from 
these matters. 
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the 
Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with 
ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to 
report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion, information in the Annual Report is:
 • materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial 
statements; or
 • apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our 
knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing our audit; or
 • otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any 
inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and the 
directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately discloses those 
matters that we communicated to the Audit Committee which we consider 
should have been disclosed. We confirm that we have not identified any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, the 
directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to 
audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). 
Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s 
Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on 
Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to 
ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and 
applied. Our quality controls and systems include our dedicated professional 
standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for 
no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or 
assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the Company’s 
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we 
have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; 
the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, 
we read all the financial and non-financial information in the Annual Report 
to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and 
to identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect based on, 
or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course 
of performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material 
misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION
1. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES 
OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY
In the course of preparing financial statements, management necessarily 
makes judgements and estimates that can have a significant impact on the 
financial statements. The most critical of these relate to estimation of Ore 
Reserves, assessment of fair value, impairment of assets, restoration, 
rehabilitation and environmental costs, deferred stripping, taxation, 
retirement benefits, contingent liabilities and joint arrangements. The use 
of inaccurate assumptions in assessments made for any of these estimates 
could result in a significant impact on financial results.
Ore Reserve estimates
When determining Ore Reserves, which may be used to calculate 
depreciation on the Group’s mining properties, assumptions that were valid 
at the time of estimation may change when new information becomes 
available. Any changes could affect prospective depreciation rates and asset 
carrying values.
The calculation of the unit of production rate of amortisation could be 
impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from 
current forecast production based on Proved and Probable Ore Reserves.
Factors which could impact useful economic lives of assets and Ore Reserve 
estimates include:
 • changes to Proved and Probable Ore Reserves
 • the grade of Ore Reserves varying significantly from time to time
 • differences between actual commodity prices and commodity price 
assumptions used in the estimation of Ore Reserves
 • renewal of mining licences
 • unforeseen operational issues at mine sites
 • adverse changes in capital, operating, mining, processing and reclamation 
costs, discount rates and foreign exchange rates used to determine 
Ore Reserves.
For further information refer to the unaudited Ore Reserves and Mineral 
Resources section of the Annual Report.
Assessment of fair value 
The assessment of fair value is principally used in accounting for business 
combinations, impairment testing and the valuation of certain financial assets 
and liabilities.
Fair value is determined based on observable market data (in the case of 
listed subsidiaries, market share price at 31 December of the respective 
entity) or discounted cash flow models (and other valuation techniques) using 
assumptions considered to be reasonable and consistent with those that 
would be applied by a market participant. Where discounted cash flows are 
used, the resulting fair value measurements are considered to be at level 3 
in the fair value hierarchy as defined in IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement as 
they depend to a significant extent on unobservable valuation inputs. The 
determination of assumptions used in assessing the fair value of identifiable 
assets and liabilities is subjective and the use of different valuation 
assumptions could have a significant impact on financial results.
In particular, expected future cash flows, which are used in discounted cash 
flow models, are inherently uncertain and could materially change over time. 
They are significantly affected by a number of factors including Ore Reserves 
and Resources, together with economic factors such as commodity prices, 
exchange rates, discount rates and estimates of production costs and future 
capital expenditure. 
Cash flow projections
Cash flow projections are based on financial budgets and Life of Mine Plans or 
non-mine production plans, incorporating key assumptions as detailed below:
 • Reserves and resources 
Ore Reserves and, where considered appropriate, Mineral Resources are 
incorporated in projected cash flows, based on Ore Reserves and Mineral 
Resource statements and exploration and evaluation work undertaken by 
appropriately qualified persons. Mineral Resources are included where 
management has a high degree of confidence in their economic extraction, 
despite additional evaluation still being required prior to meeting the 
requirements of reserve classification.
 • Commodity and product prices 
Commodity and product prices are based on latest internal forecasts, 
benchmarked with external sources of information, to ensure they are within 
the range of available analyst forecasts. Where existing sales contracts are 
in place, the effects of such contracts are taken into account in determining 
future cash flows.
 • Foreign exchange rates 
Foreign exchange rates are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked 
with external sources of information for relevant countries of operation. 
Foreign exchange rates are kept constant (on a real basis) from 2019 onwards.
 • Discount rates 
Cash flow projections used in fair value less costs of disposal impairment 
models are discounted based on a real post-tax discount rate of 6.5% 
(2013: 6.5%). Adjustments to the rate are made for any risks that are not 
reflected in the underlying cash flows.
 • Operating costs, capital expenditure and other operating factors 
Operating costs and capital expenditure are based on financial budgets 
covering a three year period. Cash flow projections beyond three years are 
based on Life of Mine Plans or non-mine production plans, as applicable, 
and internal management forecasts. Cost assumptions incorporate 
management experience and expectations, as well as the nature and 
location of the operation and the risks associated therewith. Underlying 
input cost assumptions are consistent with related output price 
assumptions. Other operating factors, such as the timelines of granting 
licences and permits are based on management’s best estimate of the 
outcome of uncertain future events at the balance sheet date.
Impairment of assets
In making assessments for impairment, management necessarily applies 
its judgement in allocating assets, including goodwill, that do not generate 
independent cash flows to appropriate cash generating units (CGUs), and 
also in estimating the timing and value of underlying cash flows within the 
calculation of recoverable amount.
The calculation of recoverable amount is based on assessments of either fair 
value less costs of disposal or value in use. The cash flow projections used in 
these assessments are subject to the areas of judgement outlined above.
Subsequent changes to the CGU allocation, to the timing of cash flows or to 
the assumptions used to determine the cash flows could impact the carrying 
value of the respective assets.
Restoration, rehabilitation and environmental costs
Costs for restoration of site damage, rehabilitation and environmental costs 
are estimated using either the work of external consultants or internal 
experts. Management uses its judgement and experience to provide for and 
amortise these estimated costs over the life of the mine.
Deferred stripping
The Group defers stripping costs onto the balance sheet where they are 
considered to improve access to ore in future periods. Where the amount to 
be capitalised cannot be specifically identified it is determined based on the 
volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume for the identified 
component of the orebody. This determination is dependent on an individual 
mine’s pit design and Life of Mine Plan and therefore changes to the pit 
design or Life of Mine Plan will result in changes to these estimates. 
Identification of the components of a mine’s orebody is made by reference 
to the Life of Mine Plan. The assessment depends on a range of factors 
including each mine’s specific operational features and materiality.
NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS  Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 117
Financial statements
1. CRITICAL ACCOUNTING JUDGEMENTS AND KEY SOURCES 
OF ESTIMATION UNCERTAINTY continued
Taxation
The Group’s tax affairs are governed by complex domestic tax legislations 
interlaced with the override of international tax treaties between countries 
and the interpretation of both by tax authorities and courts. In addition, in 
arriving at the tax charge in the financial statements a degree of judgement 
is required by management about the future taxable profits and repatriation 
of retained earnings. These judgements in turn are influenced, inter alia, by 
factors such as estimates of future production, commodity lines, operating 
costs, future capital expenditure, and dividend policies. Given the many 
uncertainties that could arise from any or all of these factors and judgements, 
future adjustments to the tax charge already recorded could occur. Where 
management is aware of potential uncertainties around these factors and 
judgements, provision is made and reviewed on a regular basis. These are 
subject to risk and changes may be required to the amount provided in 
respect of historic or future tax costs.
Retirement benefits
The expected costs of providing pensions and post employment benefits 
under defined benefit arrangements relating to employee service during 
the period are determined based on financial and actuarial assumptions.
Assumptions in respect of the expected costs are set after consultation with 
qualified actuaries. While management believes the assumptions used are 
appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would affect the amounts 
recognised in the financial statements.
Contingent liabilities
On an ongoing basis the Group is a party to various legal disputes, the 
outcomes of which cannot be assessed with a high degree of certainty.
A provision is recognised where, based on the Group’s legal views and advice, 
it is considered probable that an outflow of resources will be required to settle 
a present obligation that can be measured reliably. Disclosure of contingent 
liabilities is made in note 34 unless the possibility of a loss arising is 
considered remote.
Joint arrangements
Joint arrangements are classified as joint operations or joint ventures 
according to the rights and obligations of the parties, as described in note 
39k. When a joint arrangement has been structured through a separate 
vehicle, consideration has been given to the legal form of the separate vehicle, 
the terms of the contractual arrangement and, when relevant, other facts and 
circumstances. When the activities of an arrangement are primarily designed 
for the provision of output to the parties and, the parties are substantially the 
only source of cash flows contributing to the continuity of the operations of 
the arrangement, this indicates that the parties to the arrangement have 
rights to the assets and obligations for the liabilities. Certain joint 
arrangements that are structured through separate vehicles including 
Collahuasi, Debswana and Namdeb are accounted for as joint operations. 
These arrangements are primarily designed for the provision of output to 
the parties sharing joint control, indicating that the parties have rights to 
substantially all the economic benefits of the assets. The liabilities of the 
arrangements are in substance satisfied by cash flows received from the 
parties; this dependence indicates that the parties effectively have obligations 
for the liabilities. It is primarily these facts and circumstances that give rise to 
the classification as joint operations.
2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES
The accounting policies applied are consistent with those adopted  
and disclosed in the Group financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2013, except for the adoption of amendments to  
IAS 36 Impairment of Assets: Recoverable Amount Disclosures for  
Non-Financial Assets. 
The amendment introduces the requirement to disclose the recoverable 
amount of CGUs that have been impaired in the period. In addition, the 
amendment requires the disclosure of certain additional information on 
valuation assumptions, where the recoverable amount of a CGU is assessed 
on a fair value less costs of disposal basis using a discounted cash flow 
method. The required disclosures are reflected in these financial statements.
A number of other accounting pronouncements, principally amendments to 
existing standards, issued by the IASB became effective on 1 January 2014 
and were adopted by the Group. The Group has early adopted IFRIC 21 Levies 
which has been endorsed by the European Union (EU) but is effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 17 June 2014. These pronouncements 
have not had a material impact on the accounting policies applied by the Group. 
The Group has not early adopted any other amendment, standard or 
interpretation that has been issued but is not yet effective. It is expected that 
where applicable, these standards and amendments will be adopted on each 
respective effective date.
New IFRS accounting standards, amendments and 
interpretations not yet adopted
The following new IFRS accounting standards in issue but not yet effective 
(and not yet endorsed by the EU) are expected to have a significant impact 
on the Group:
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments 
IFRS 9 will replace IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement and addresses the following three key areas: 
 • Classification and measurement establishes a single, principles-based 
approach for the classification of financial assets, which is driven by cash 
flow characteristics and the business model in which an asset is held. 
 • Impairment introduces a new ‘expected loss’ impairment model, requiring 
expected credit losses to be recognised from when financial instruments 
are first recognised. 
 • Hedge Accounting aligns the accounting treatment with risk management 
practices of an entity.
IFRS 9 is expected to have a number of impacts on the Group financial 
statements including changes in the presentation of gains and losses 
on financial assets classified as available for sale. 
IFRS 9 is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2018.
IFRS 15 Revenue from Contracts with Customers
IFRS 15 replaces IAS 11 and IAS 18 and establishes a unified framework for 
determining the timing, measurement and recognition of revenue. The focus 
of the new standard is to recognise revenue as performance obligations are 
met rather than based on the transfer of risks and rewards. 
IFRS 15 includes a comprehensive set of disclosure requirements including 
qualitative and quantitative information about its contracts with customers 
to help investors understand the nature, amount, timing and uncertainty 
of revenue.
The Group’s revenue is predominantly derived from the sale of goods under 
arrangements in which the transfer of risks and rewards of ownership and 
the fulfilment of the Group’s performance obligations are likely to coincide. 
Therefore, for the majority of sales the timing and amount of revenue is 
unlikely to be materially affected by the adoption of the new standard. The 
standard is effective for annual reporting periods beginning on or after 
1 January 2017.

2. CHANGES IN ACCOUNTING POLICIES AND DISCLOSURES 
continued
The following new or amended IFRS accounting standards, amendments and 
interpretations in issue but not yet effective (and in some cases not yet 
adopted by the EU) are not expected to have a significant impact on the Group:
 • Amendments to IAS 19 Employee Benefits: Defined Benefit Plans – 
Employee Contributions provides additional guidance on the accounting for 
contributions from employees or third parties set out in the formal terms of 
a defined benefit plan. The amendment is effective for annual periods 
beginning on or after 1 July 2014.
 • Amendments to IAS 1 Presentation of Financial Statements: Disclosure 
Initiative provides guidance on the use of judgement in presenting financial 
statement information, including: the application of materiality, order of 
notes, use of subtotals, accounting policy referencing and disaggregation 
of financial and non-financial information. 
 • Amendments to IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements: Accounting for Acquisitions 
of Interests in Joint Operations provides guidance on accounting for the 
acquisition of an interest in a joint operation that constitutes a business.
 • Amendments to IAS 16 Property, Plant and Equipment and IAS 38 
Intangible Assets: Clarification of Acceptable Methods of Depreciation 
and Amortisation clarifies that there is a rebuttable presumption that 
revenue-based methods of depreciation are not appropriate.
 • Amendments to IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements and IAS 28 
Joint Ventures: Sale or Contribution of Assets between an Investor and its 
Associate or Joint Venture removes an inconsistency between the two 
standards on the accounting treatment for gains and losses arising on the 
sale or contribution of assets by an investor to its associate or joint venture. 
Following the amendment, such gains and losses may only be recognised to 
the extent of the unrelated investor’s interest, except where the transaction 
involves assets that constitute a business. 
Other issued standards and amendments that are not yet effective are not 
expected to have an impact on the financial statements.  Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014 119

3. SEGMENTAL INFORMATION
The Group’s segments are aligned to the structure of business units based around core commodities. Each business unit has a management team that is 
accountable to the Chief Executive, and in the instance of Copper, Nickel, Niobium and Phosphates, the same management team is responsible for the 
management of all four business units, collectively referred to as Base Metals and Minerals. To align with changes in the management structure of the Group’s 
coal businesses and the way their results are internally reported, Coal South Africa and Coal Colombia (formerly the Thermal Coal segment) and Coal Australia 
and Canada (formerly the Metallurgical Coal segment) are now reported together as the Coal segment. Niobium and Phosphates are now reported as 
separate segments, having previously been aggregated and the Diamonds segment is now referred to as De Beers.
The Kumba Iron Ore, Iron Ore Brazil and Samancor business units have been aggregated as the ‘Iron Ore and Manganese’ segment on the basis of the ultimate 
product produced (ferrous metals).
The Other Mining and Industrial segment is no longer considered to be individually significant to the Group and is therefore now shown within ‘Corporate and 
other’ together with unallocated corporate costs and exploration costs. Exploration costs represent the cost of the Group’s exploration activities across all 
segments, and were previously reported separately. Comparatives have been reclassified to align with current year presentation.
The Group Management Committee evaluates the financial performance of the Group and its segments principally with reference to earnings before interest 
and tax (underlying EBIT). Underlying EBIT is operating profit presented before special items and remeasurements and includes the Group’s attributable 
share of associates’ and joint ventures’ underlying EBIT. Underlying EBIT of associates and joint ventures is the Group’s attributable share of revenue less 
operating costs before special items and remeasurements of associates and joint ventures. 
Underlying EBITDA is underlying EBIT before depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries and joint operations and includes the Group’s attributable share of 
associates’ and joint ventures’ underlying EBIT before depreciation and amortisation.
Segment revenue includes the Group’s attributable share of associates’ and joint ventures’ revenue. Segments predominantly derive revenue as follows – Iron 
Ore and Manganese: iron ore, manganese ore and alloys; Coal: metallurgical coal and thermal coal; Copper: copper; Nickel: nickel; Niobium: niobium; 
Phosphates: phosphates; Platinum: platinum group metals; and De Beers: rough and polished diamonds.
The segment results are stated after elimination of inter-segment transactions and include an allocation of corporate costs.

5. UNDERLYING EBIT AND UNDERLYING EARNINGS BY SEGMENT 
The following table analyses underlying EBIT (including the Group’s attributable share of associates’ and joint ventures’ underlying EBIT) by segment and 
reconciles it to underlying earnings by segment. Refer to note 3 for the definition of underlying EBIT and changes in reporting segments. Comparatives have 
been reclassified to align with current year presentation.
Underlying earnings is an alternative earnings measure, which the directors consider to be a useful additional measure of the Group’s performance. 
Underlying earnings is profit for the financial year attributable to equity shareholders of the Company before special items and remeasurements and is 
therefore presented after net finance costs, income tax expense and non-controlling interests. For a reconciliation from ‘Loss for the financial year attributable 
to equity shareholders of the Company’ to ‘Underlying earnings for the financial year’, see note 9.

6. SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS
Special items are those items of financial performance that the Group believes should be separately disclosed on the face of the income statement to assist 
in the understanding of the underlying financial performance achieved by the Group. Such items are material by nature or amount to the year’s results and 
require separate disclosure in accordance with IAS 1 paragraph 97. Special items that relate to the operating performance of the Group are classified as 
operating special items and principally include impairment charges, onerous contract provisions and restructuring costs. Non-operating special items  
include costs in relation to closure of operations, profits and losses on disposals of investments and businesses as well as certain adjustments relating to 
business combinations.
Remeasurements comprise other items which the Group believes should be reported separately to aid an understanding of the underlying financial 
performance of the Group. Remeasurements include:
 • Unrealised gains and losses on financial assets and liabilities that represent economic hedges, including accounting hedges related to financing 
arrangements. Where the underlying transaction is recorded in the income statement, the realised gains or losses are reversed from remeasurements and 
are recorded in underlying earnings in the same year as the underlying transaction for which the instruments provide the economic hedge. If the underlying 
transaction is recorded in the balance sheet, for example capital expenditure, the realised amount remains in remeasurements on settlement of the 
derivative. Such amounts are classified in the income statement as operating when the underlying exposure is in respect of the operating performance of the 
Group and otherwise as financing.
 • Foreign exchange impacts arising in US dollar functional currency entities where tax calculations are generated based on local currency financial information 
and hence deferred tax is susceptible to currency fluctuations. Such amounts are included within income tax expense.
 • The remeasurement and subsequent depreciation of a previously held equity interest as a result of a business combination.

Operating special items
Minas-Rio
The Minas-Rio iron ore project (Minas-Rio) (Iron Ore and Manganese) in Brazil was acquired in two separate transactions in 2007 and 2008. Production 
commenced in the last quarter and successful delivery of First Ore On Ship (FOOS) was announced on 27 October 2014. The project is currently ramping 
up to capacity of 26.5 Mtpa over the next 18-20 months, and work continues to progress on the regular cycle of required licence and permit renewals. 
An impairment charge of $4,960 million (before tax) was recorded in 2012 against the carrying value of Minas-Rio. This was based on the value in use of the cash 
generating unit (CGU) and reflected an increase in estimate of attributable project capital expenditure to $8.8 billion, including a $0.6 billion contingency as well as 
the impact of high inflation on operational costs. The long term iron ore price used in the 2012 valuation was within the range of published analyst forecasts.
The successful progress of the project up to delivery of FOOS indicates that the $0.6 billion of contingency will not be fully utilised and consequently total 
capital expenditure for the project now is estimated at $8.4 billion, on an attributable basis. In 2014, a material worsening of the pricing environment for iron 
ore has been in evidence, driven by revisions to the outlook for global GDP growth, especially in the context of weaker Chinese construction activity, whilst 
at the same time supply from Western Australia has ramped up to outstrip weakening demand. The value in use of Minas-Rio has been updated to reflect 
management’s best estimate of the future iron ore prices based on a detailed analysis of market fundamentals in the medium and long term. The long term 
price which is used in the valuation from 2024 onwards is within the range of published analyst forecasts and broadly in line with the mean.
The valuation of Minas-Rio at 31 December 2014 determined on a pre-tax discounted cash flow basis (real pre-tax discount rate of 8.5%) is $5.6 billion. 
Based on this valuation, the Group has recorded an impairment charge of $3,800 million (before tax) against the carrying value of the CGU. Of this charge, 
$971 million has been recorded against mining properties and $2,829 million against capital works in progress, with an associated deferred tax credit of 
$320 million. The post-tax impairment charge is $3,480 million. The valuation remains sensitive to price and further deterioration in long term prices may 
result in additional impairment.

6. SPECIAL ITEMS AND REMEASUREMENTS continued
Coal
In September 2014, the Group announced that it had decided, in view of the subdued hard coking coal price environment, to place Peace River Coal in British 
Columbia, Canada on care and maintenance to preserve the long term future of the operation. The recoverable amount of the Peace River Coal CGU has been 
assessed based on the operation’s fair value less costs of disposal, measured using discounted cash flow projections (see note 1).
Despite the decision to place the operation on care and maintenance, the decrease in hard coking coal prices has driven a decrease in the valuation of Peace 
River Coal to $0.1 billion. Based on this valuation, the Group has recorded an impairment charge of $265 million (before tax) against the carrying value of the 
CGU. The post-tax impairment charge is also $265 million. Of this charge, $124 million has been recorded against plant and equipment, $123 million against 
mining properties and the remainder against capital works in progress. The valuation remains sensitive to price and further deterioration in the pricing outlook 
may result in additional impairment. The long term hard coking coal price used in the valuation from 2019 onwards is within the range of published analyst 
forecasts and broadly in line with the mean. The remaining $98 million of the impairment charge recognised in special items ($69 million after tax) relates to 
other Coal assets in Australia.
Platinum
The charge of $44 million relates to the closure of the declines at the Union operation in the Platinum business. The charge after tax and non-controlling 
interests is $21 million.
Restructuring costs
Restructuring costs of $128 million principally relate to organisational changes as part of the Driving Value programme (2013: $177 million of which 
$146 million related to the implementation of the Platinum portfolio review). Restructuring costs after tax and non-controlling interests amount to $93 million.
2013
Operating special items in 2013 principally comprised impairments and related charges in respect of the Barro Alto nickel project (Nickel), the Platinum 
portfolio review, the Michiquillay copper project (Copper), and the Foxleigh, Isibonelo and Kleinkopje coal operations (Coal).
Operating special items in 2013 also included charges relating to onerous contract provisions, principally at Callide (Coal), the reversal on sale of fair value 
uplifts recognised on inventories as part of the De Beers acquisition accounting, and costs associated with the Platinum portfolio review.
Operating remeasurements
Operating remeasurements reflect a net loss of $1 million (2013: $550 million) which principally comprises gains of $136 million in respect of derivatives 
related to capital expenditure in Iron Ore Brazil offset by a $129 million depreciation and amortisation charge (2013: $131 million) arising due to the fair value 
uplift on the pre-existing 45% shareholding in De Beers, which was required on acquisition of a controlling stake.
Derivatives in relation to Iron Ore Brazil which have been realised during the period had a cumulative net operating remeasurement loss of $140 million 
(2013: $137 million) since their inception.
Non-operating special items
A charge of $222 million ($155 million after tax) has been recognised following the decision by the New South Wales Planning Assessment Committee (PAC) 
not to approve the Group’s application to proceed with the Drayton South project (Coal). The reserves of the existing Drayton operation are expected to be 
depleted during 2015 and the Drayton South project would have extended the life of the operation by approximately 27 years. Management is preparing a 
revised application for the project, to be submitted in the first half of 2015, and continues to work to allow operations to continue at Drayton. However, in view 
of the uncertainty caused by the PAC decision, assets associated with the project and the existing operation have been written down to their residual values, 
and a provision has been made for the cost of meeting contractual and other obligations beyond the life of the existing Drayton mine. 
A $46 million charge has been recognised primarily in relation to the revaluation of deferred contingent consideration for the disposal of Amapá in 2013 
(Corporate and other). The contingent consideration receivable is calculated on the basis of the market price for iron ore, which has seen a material worsening. 
There is no tax impact.
In November 2014, De Beers concluded the refinancing of its Black Economic Empowerment partner, Ponahalo Investments (RF) Proprietary Limited 
(Ponahalo), which owns a 26% share in De Beers’ principal South African subsidiary, De Beers Consolidated Mines (DBCM). The refinancing extended the 
period over which Ponahalo may repay borrowings that were used to finance the purchase of its share in DBCM in 2006 by seven years. A charge of $58 million 
has been recognised and no tax arises in relation to this transaction. 
The Kumba Envision Trust charge of $44 million (2013: $54 million) relates to Kumba’s (Iron Ore and Manganese) broad based employee share scheme 
provided solely for the benefit of non-managerial Historically Disadvantaged South African employees who do not participate in other Kumba share schemes.
2013
Non-operating special items in 2013 principally relate to the loss on disposal of Amapá, the Group’s exit from the Pebble project in Alaska (Copper), the loss 
recognised on the formation of the Lafarge Tarmac joint venture (Corporate and other), the Kumba Envision Trust charge, the gain on deferred proceeds of 
undeveloped coal assets in Australia (Coal) and the gain on disposal of the Group’s interest in Palabora Mining Company Limited (Corporate and other).
Financing special items and remeasurements
Financing special items and remeasurements reflect a net gain of $36 million (2013: net loss of $130 million) principally comprising gains on derivatives 
relating to debt.
Special items and remeasurements tax
Total special items and remeasurements tax relating to subsidiaries and joint operations amounts to a credit of $2 million (2013: $587 million). This includes 
one-off tax charges of $105 million (2013: $188 million), tax credits on special items and remeasurements of $412 million (2013: $902 million) and tax 
remeasurement charges of $305 million (2013: $127 million). 
One-off tax charges of $105 million comprise a $100 million charge for the derecognition of deferred tax assets at Peace River Coal (Coal), a $61 million 
charge for the derecognition of a deferred tax asset in Coal Australia relating to the Mineral Resource Rent Tax which was repealed in 2014, and a $56 million 
credit for the recognition of a deferred tax asset in Barro Alto.
Of the total tax credit of $2 million (2013: $587 million), $31 million relates to a current tax credit (2013: charge of $159 million) and $29 million relates to 
a deferred tax charge (2013: credit of $746 million).

8. INCOME TAX EXPENSE continued
b) Factors affecting tax charge for the year
The effective tax rate for the year of (488.4)% (2013: 74.9%) is lower (2013: higher) than the applicable weighted average statutory rate of corporation tax in 
the United Kingdom of 21.5% (2013: 23.25%). The reconciling items, excluding the impact of associates and joint ventures, are:
US$ million 2014 2013
(Loss)/profit before tax (259)  1,700 
Less: share of net income from associates and joint ventures (208) (168) 
(Loss)/profit before tax (excluding associates and joint ventures) (467)  1,532 
Tax on (loss)/profit (excluding associates and joint ventures) calculated at United Kingdom corporation tax rate of 21.5%

Income tax expense 1,265  1,274 
IAS 1 requires income from associates and joint ventures to be presented net of tax on the face of the income statement. Associates’ and joint ventures’ tax  
is therefore not included within the Group’s income tax expense. Associates’ and joint ventures’ tax included within ‘Share of net income from associates  
and joint ventures’ for the year ended 31 December 2014 is $159 million (2013: $155 million). Excluding special items and remeasurements this becomes 
$113 million (2013: $158 million).
The effective tax rate before special items and remeasurements including attributable share of associates’ and joint ventures’ tax for the year ended 
31 December 2014 was 29.8%. This is lower than the equivalent effective tax rate of 32.0% for the year ended 31 December 2013 due to the impact of certain 
prior year adjustments, the remeasurement of withholding tax provisions across the Group and the recognition of previously unrecognised losses. In future 
periods it is expected that the effective tax rate will remain above the United Kingdom statutory tax rate.
c) Tax amounts included in other comprehensive income
An analysis of tax by individual item presented in the Consolidated statement of comprehensive income is presented below:
US$ million 2014 2013

d) Tax amounts recognised directly in equity
No significant amounts of tax have been charged directly to equity in 2014 (2013: a deferred tax credit of $106 million and current tax charge of $106 million 
were recognised directly in equity in relation to the disposal of a 24.5% interest in Anglo American Sur SA in 2011).

Basic  1.73  2.09

Basic and diluted earnings per share are shown based on headline earnings, a Johannesburg Stock Exchange (JSE) defined performance measure, and 
underlying earnings (explained in note 5) which the directors consider to be a useful additional measure of the Group’s performance. 
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share is based on the following data:
Loss attributable to equity 
shareholders of the Company Headline earnings Underlying earnings
2014 2013 2014 2013 2014 2013

Diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding 1,284  1,281  1,289  1,285  1,289  1,285 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue on the assumption of conversion of all potentially 
dilutive ordinary shares. Potential ordinary shares shall be treated as dilutive when, and only when, their conversion to ordinary shares would decrease 
earnings per share or increase loss per share from continuing operations.
Basic loss per share is equal to diluted loss per share as all 18,431,061 (2013: 16,688,080) potential ordinary shares are anti-dilutive and 178,808 
(2013: 134,679) have been excluded from the calculation of diluted headline earnings per share and diluted underlying earnings per share as they are 
anti-dilutive. 
Basic and diluted number of ordinary shares outstanding represent the weighted average for the year. The average number of ordinary shares in issue 
excludes shares held by employee benefit trusts and Anglo American plc shares held by Group companies.
The calculation of basic and diluted earnings per share, based on headline and underlying earnings, uses the following earnings data:

Of this, $620 million (2013: $618 million) was recognised in the parent company.
Total dividends paid during the year were $1,099 million (2013: $1,078 million). 
The directors are proposing a final dividend in respect of the financial year ended 31 December 2014 of 53 US cents per share. This will result in an estimated 
distribution of $678 million of shareholders’ funds, of which $421 million will be distributed by the parent company. These financial statements do not reflect 
this dividend payable as it is still subject to shareholder approval.
The employee benefit trust has waived the right to receive dividends on the shares it holds (see note 32).

a controlling interest in De Beers in August 2012. Of these, $517 million (2013: $517 million) have indefinite useful lives.
(2) 
Includes $19 million (2013: $20 million) of amortisation arising due to the fair value uplift of the Group’s pre-existing 45% shareholding in De Beers. This has been included within operating 
remeasurements (see note 6).
Impairment tests for goodwill
See note 39f for the Group’s accounting policy on impairment of goodwill.
Goodwill is allocated for impairment testing purposes to cash generating units (CGUs) or groups of CGUs which reflect how it is monitored for internal 
management purposes. This allocation largely represents the Group’s segments. Any goodwill associated with CGUs subsumed within these segments is not 
significant when compared to the goodwill of the Group. The allocation of goodwill to CGUs or groups of CGUs is as follows:
US$ million 2014 2013
Coal South Africa 88  88 
Copper 124  124 
Platinum 230  230 
De Beers 1,895  2,056 
Other 216  170 
 2,553  2,668 
For the purposes of goodwill impairment testing, the recoverable amount of each of the CGUs or group of CGUs has been determined based on a fair value 
less costs of disposal basis. The key assumptions used in determining fair value less costs of disposal are set out in note 1. Management believes that any 
reasonably possible change in a key assumption on which the recoverable amounts are based would not cause the carrying amounts to exceed their 
recoverable amounts.

The cost of inventories recognised as an expense and included in cost of sales amounted to $17,779 million (2013: $17,929 million). In 2013, an additional 
$126 million was recognised as an expense within operating special items relating to the reversal of fair value uplifts on De Beers inventory.
Inventories held at net realisable value amounted to $1,014 million (2013: $308 million).
Write-down of inventories (net of revaluation of provisionally priced purchases) amounted to $153 million (2013: $58 million).
16. TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade receivables do not incur any interest, are principally short term in nature and are measured at their nominal value (with the exception of receivables 
relating to provisionally priced sales, as set out in the revenue recognition accounting policy, see note 39a), net of appropriate provision for estimated 
irrecoverable amounts. Such provisions are raised based on an assessment of debtor ageing, past experience or known customer circumstances.

The historical level of customer default is minimal and as a result the credit quality of year end trade receivables is considered to be high. Of the year end  
trade receivables balance, $61 million (2013: $65 million) were past due at 31 December, stated after an associated impairment provision of $30 million  
(2013: $19 million). The overdue debtor ageing profile is typical of the industry in which certain of the Group’s businesses operate. Given this, the use of 
payment security instruments (including letters of credit from acceptable financial institutions), and the nature of the related counterparties, these amounts 
are considered recoverable.
17. TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES

18. FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
See notes 39m and 39n for the Group’s accounting policies on impairment of financial assets, derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting.
The carrying amounts of financial assets and financial liabilities are as shown below. Where the carrying amount of a financial asset or liability does not 
approximate its fair value, this is also disclosed. 
For financial assets and liabilities which are traded on an active market, such as listed investments or listed debt instruments, fair value is determined by 
reference to market value. For non-traded financial assets and liabilities, fair value is calculated using discounted cash flows, considered to be reasonable and 
consistent with those that would be used by a market participant, and based on observable market data where available, unless carrying value is considered to 
approximate fair value.
All derivatives that have been designated into hedge relationships have been separately disclosed. Comparatives have been reclassified to align with current 
year presentation.

Borrowings designated in fair value hedges represent listed debt. The fair value of these borrowings is $15,339 million (2013: $14,907 million), which is based on the quoted market price 
and consequently categorised as level 1 in the fair value hierarchy. For the majority of borrowings at amortised cost the carrying value is considered to approximate the fair value. In certain 
circumstances the fair value of borrowings at amortised cost is based on management’s estimates of future cash flows and consequently the valuation is categorised as level 3 in the fair 
value hierarchy.

Valued using unadjusted quoted prices in active markets for identical financial instruments. This category includes listed equity shares.
(2) 
Valued using techniques based significantly on observable market data. Instruments in this category are valued using valuation techniques where all of the inputs that have a significant effect 
on the valuation are directly or indirectly based on observable market data.
(3) 
Instruments in this category have been valued using a valuation technique where at least one input (which could have a significant effect on the instrument’s valuation) is not based on 
observable market data. Where inputs can be observed from market data without undue cost and effort, the observed input is used. Otherwise, management determines a reasonable estimate 
for the input. 
Financial assets and liabilities included within level 3 primarily consist of certain cross currency swaps of Brazilian real denominated borrowings (whose 
valuation depends upon regulated interest rates), contingent proceeds and related receivables relating to disposals and unlisted equity investments.
The movements in the fair value of the level 3 financial assets and liabilities are shown as follows:

significantly.

19. DERIVATIVES
See note 39n for the Group’s accounting policy on derivatives.
The fair values of derivatives are separately recorded on the Consolidated balance sheet within ‘Derivative financial assets’ and ‘Derivative financial liabilities’. 
Derivatives are classified as current or non-current depending on the date of expected settlement of the derivative. 
The Group utilises derivative instruments to manage certain market risk exposures. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for speculative 
purposes, however it may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges for accounting purposes. Such derivatives are classified as ‘Held for trading’ 
and fair value movements are recorded in the Consolidated income statement.
The use of derivative instruments is subject to limits and the positions are regularly monitored and reported to senior management.
Cash flow hedges
In certain cases the Group classifies its forward foreign currency contracts, which hedge highly probable forecast transactions, as cash flow hedges. Where 
this designation is documented, changes in fair value are recognised in equity until the hedged transactions occur, at which time the respective gains or losses 
are transferred to the Consolidated income statement (or hedged balance sheet item).
Fair value hedges
The majority of interest rate swaps (taken out to swap the Group’s fixed rate borrowings to floating rate, in accordance with the Group’s policy) have been 
designated as fair value hedges. The carrying value of the hedged debt is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the impact on its fair value of changes 
in market interest rates. Changes in the fair value of the hedged debt are offset against fair value changes in the interest rate swap and recognised in the 
Consolidated income statement as financing remeasurements.
Net investment hedges
In certain instances, the Group uses derivative instruments to hedge exposures in non-US dollar functional subsidiaries to exchange rate fluctuations on  
US dollar denominated borrowings. These derivatives are designated as net investment hedges and principally relate to the Group’s Australian coal operations.  
Fair value changes in these derivatives are recognised within the cumulative translation adjustment reserve and recycled upon disposal of the related subsidiary. 
Held for trading
The Group may choose not to designate certain derivatives as hedges. This may occur where the Group is economically hedged but IAS 39 hedge accounting 
cannot be achieved or where gains and losses on both the derivative and hedged item naturally offset in the Consolidated income statement, as is the case for 
certain cross currency swaps of non-US dollar debt. Fair value changes on these derivatives are recognised in the Consolidated income statement as 
remeasurements and are classified as financing or operating depending on the nature of the associated hedged risk.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not 
closely related to those of their host contract and the host contract is not carried at fair value. 
The fair value of the Group’s open derivative position at 31 December (excluding normal purchase and sale contracts held off balance sheet), recorded within 
‘Derivative financial assets’ and ‘Derivative financial liabilities’ is as follows:

Recognised in the Consolidated income statement is a loss on fair value hedged items of $440 million (2013: gain of $555 million), partly offset by a gain on fair value hedging instruments of 
$381 million (2013: loss of $474 million).
(2) 
Other derivatives primarily relate to forward foreign currency contracts hedging capital expenditure that are accounted for as ‘Held for trading’.
These marked to market valuations are not predictive of the future value of the hedged position, nor of the future impact on the profit of the Group.  
The valuations represent the cost of closing all hedge contracts at year end, at market prices and rates available at the time.
The Group is exposed in varying degrees to a variety of financial instrument related risks. For more information about these risks and the ways in which the 
Group manages them see notes 24 and 38.

Environmental restoration
The Group has an obligation to undertake restoration, rehabilitation and environmental work when environmental disturbance is caused by the development 
or ongoing production of a mining property. A provision is recognised for the present value of such costs, based on management’s best estimate of the legal 
and constructive obligations incurred. These estimates reflect industry best practice and currently applicable legislation. Significant changes in legislation 
could result in changes in provisions recognised. It is anticipated that these costs will be incurred over a period in excess of 20 years.
Decommissioning
Provision is made for the present value of costs relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site restoration work. It is anticipated that these costs will be 
incurred over a period in excess of 20 years.
Employee benefits
Provision is made for statutory or contractual employee entitlements including long service leave, annual leave, sickness pay and similar obligations. It is 
anticipated that these costs will be incurred when employees choose to take their benefits.
Onerous contracts
Provision is made for the present value of certain long term contracts where the unavoidable cost of meeting the Group’s obligations is expected to exceed the 
benefits to be received. It is anticipated these costs will be incurred over a period of up to 16 years.
Other
Other provisions primarily relate to restructuring costs, indemnities, legal and other claims. It is anticipated that the majority of these costs will be incurred over 
a five year period.
Environmental rehabilitation trusts
The Group makes contributions to controlled funds that were established to meet the cost of some of its restoration and environmental rehabilitation liabilities, 
primarily in South Africa. The funds comprise the following investments:
US$ million 2014 2013
Equity 139  149 
Bonds 155  134 
Cash 64  65 
 358  348 
These assets are primarily denominated in South African rand. Cash is held in short term fixed deposits or earns interest at floating inter-bank rates. Bonds 
earn interest at a weighted average fixed rate of 8.2% (2013: 8.2%) for an average period of four years (2013: five years). Equity investments are recorded at 
fair value through profit and loss and bonds are recorded at amortised cost.
These funds are not available for the general purposes of the Group. All income from these assets is reinvested to meet specific environmental obligations. 
These obligations are included in provisions stated above.

The Group also has unused tax credits of $11 million (2013: $17 million) for which no deferred tax asset is recognised in the Consolidated balance sheet. All of 
these credits expire within three months.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, branches, associates and interests in 
joint arrangements where the Group is in a position to control the timing of the reversal of the temporary differences and it is probable that such differences 
will not reverse in the foreseeable future. The aggregate amount of temporary differences associated with such investments in subsidiaries, branches, 
associates and interests in joint arrangements is represented by the contribution of those investments to the Group’s retained earnings and amounted to 
$17,488 million (2013: $19,117 million).

23. NET DEBT
See note 39o for the Group’s accounting policy on cash and debt.
Net debt is a measure of the Group’s financial position. The Group uses net debt to monitor the sources and uses of financial resources, the availability of 
capital to invest or return to shareholders, and the resilience of the balance sheet. Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents 
(including derivatives which provide an economic hedge of net debt, see note 19).

c) Net debt by segment
The Group’s policy is to hold the majority of its cash and borrowings at the corporate centre. Business units may from time to time raise borrowings in 
connection with specific capital projects, and subsidiaries with non-controlling interests have borrowings which are without recourse to the Group. Other than 
the impact of South African exchange controls (see 23d below), there are no significant restrictions over the Group’s ability to access these cash balances or 
repay these borrowings. Net debt by segment is stated after elimination of inter-segment balances.

d) South Africa net debt
The Group operates in South Africa where the existence of exchange controls may restrict the use of certain cash balances. The Group therefore monitors the 
cash and debt associated with these operations separately. These restrictions are not expected to have a material effect on the Group’s ability to meet its 
ongoing obligations. Below is a breakdown of net debt in South Africa.

24. BORROWINGS
See note 39o for the Group’s accounting policy on bank borrowings.
The Group accesses borrowings mostly in capital markets through bonds issued under the Euro Medium Term Note (EMTN) programme, the South African 
Domestic Medium Term Note (DMTN) programme, the Australian Medium Term Note (AMTN) programme and through accessing the United States (US) 
bond markets. The Group uses interest rate and cross currency swaps to ensure that the majority of the Group’s borrowings are floating rate US dollar 
denominated.
During 2014, the Group issued corporate bonds with a US dollar equivalent value of $3.2 billion. These included the following bonds:
 • €750 million 1.75% guaranteed loan notes due 2018 and €750 million 3.25% guaranteed loan notes due 2023 issued under the EMTN programme.
 • $500 million LIBOR plus 0.95% senior floating rate notes due 2016 and $500 million 4.125% senior notes due 2021 through accessing the US bond markets.
 • R650 million 9.49% senior notes due 2021 and R400 million JIBAR plus 1.47% floating rate notes due 2021 issued under the DMTN programme.

The Group ensures that there are sufficient committed loan facilities (including refinancing, where necessary) in order to meet short term business 
requirements, after taking into account cash flows from operations and its holding of cash and cash equivalents, as well as any Group distribution restrictions 
that exist. In addition, certain projects may be financed by means of limited recourse project finance, if appropriate.

Capital risk management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns for shareholders 
and benefits for other stakeholders and, with cognisance of forecast future market conditions and structuring, to maintain an optimal capital structure to 
enable the business to operate effectively.
In order to manage the short and long term capital structure, the Group has a number of options including raising and refinancing debt, adjusting returns to 
equity shareholders, managing the allocation of capital and divesting of non-core assets to reduce debt.
The Group monitors capital using various financial metrics including the ratio of net debt to total capital (gearing). Net debt is calculated as total borrowings 
less cash and cash equivalents (including derivatives which provide an economic hedge of net debt). Total capital is calculated as ‘Net assets’ (as shown in the 
Consolidated balance sheet) excluding net debt. Total capital and gearing are as follows:
US$ million 2014 2013
Net assets 32,177  37,364 
Net debt including related derivatives (note 23) 12,871  10,652 
Total capital 45,048 48,016
Gearing 28.6% 22.2%
Gearing has increased from 22.2% to 28.6% as net debt has increased and total capital has decreased. Net debt increased from $10.7 billion to $12.9 billion at 
31 December 2014 as cash inflows from operating activities were offset by outflows primarily relating to capital expenditure and dividends to Anglo American 
plc shareholders as well as to non-controlling interests. Total capital decreased from $48.0 billion to $45.0 billion primarily due to the impact of impairments 
and the effect of a stronger US dollar on assets denominated in other currencies.

24. BORROWINGS continued 
Market risk
Market risk is the risk that financial instrument fair values and related cash flows will fluctuate due to changes in market prices. The Group manages interest 
rate risks and foreign exchange risks on borrowings and cash with the use of cross currency swaps and interest rate swaps in order to ensure that the majority 
of borrowings are floating rate US dollar denominated. The Group does not hedge foreign exchange exposures on rand denominated borrowings in South 
Africa. For more information regarding the Group’s financial risk management see note 38.

27. RETIREMENT BENEFITS
See note 39t for the Group’s accounting policy on retirement benefits.
The Group operates a number of defined contribution and defined benefit pension plans. It also operates post employment medical plans, principally 
in South Africa. 
Defined contribution plans
The defined contribution pension and medical cost represents the actual contributions payable by the Group to the various plans.
The assets of the defined contribution plans are held separately in independently administered funds. The charge in respect of these plans is calculated on the 
basis of the contribution payable by the Group in the financial year. The charge for the year for defined contribution pension plans (net of amounts capitalised) 
was $244 million (2013: $261 million) and for defined contribution medical plans (net of amounts capitalised) was $81 million (2013: $88 million).
Defined benefit pension plans and post employment medical plans
The Group operates defined benefit pension and medical plans across a number of segments. The most significant plans are in South Africa and the 
United Kingdom.
A summary of the movements in the net pension plan assets and retirement benefit obligations on the Consolidated balance sheet is as follows:
US$ million 2014 2013
Net liability recognised at 1 January (1,013) (1,233) 
Net income statement charge (113) (88) 
Remeasurement of net defined benefit obligation (15)  97 
Employer contributions 132  151 
Other 31 (10)
Currency movements 89 70
Net liability recognised at 31 December (889) (1,013) 
Amounts recognised as:
Defined benefit pension plans in surplus

Retirement benefit obligation – pension plans (615) (727)
Retirement benefit obligation – medical plans (458) (477)
(889) (1,013)
(1) 
Included in ‘Other non-current assets’ on the Consolidated balance sheet.
The majority of the defined benefit pension plans are funded. The assets of these plans are held separately from those of the Group, in independently 
administered funds, in accordance with statutory requirements or local practice in the relevant jurisdiction. The unfunded liabilities are principally in relation 
to termination indemnity plans in Chile. 
The post employment medical plans provide health benefits to retired employees and certain dependants. Eligibility for cover is dependent upon certain 
criteria. The majority of these plans are unfunded and are principally in South Africa. 
Independent qualified actuaries carry out full valuations at least every three years using the projected unit credit method. The actuaries have updated the 
valuations to 31 December 2014. Assumptions are set after consultation with the qualified actuaries. While management believe the assumptions used are 
appropriate, a change in the assumptions used would impact the Group’s other comprehensive income.
Characteristics and risks of plans
The defined benefit plans are exposed to risks such as longevity, investment risk, inflation risk, interest rate risk and foreign exchange risk. 
The weighted average duration of the South African plans is 12 years (2013: 12 years), United Kingdom plans is 18 years (2013: 19 years) and plans in other 
regions is 14 years (2013: 14 years). This represents the average period over which future benefit payments are expected to be made. 
Employer contributions are made in accordance with the terms of each plan and may vary from year to year. Employer contributions made in the year ended 
31 December 2014 were $132 million to pension plans and in addition $27 million of benefits were paid in relation to post employment medical plans. The 
Group expects to contribute $134 million to its pension plans and $25 million to its post employment medical plans in 2015.
The responsibility for the governance of the funded retirement benefit plans, including investment and funding decisions, lies with the Trustees of each scheme.
South Africa
The pension plans in South Africa are in surplus, with the asset recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet restricted to the amount in the Employer Surplus 
Account, being plan assets less plan liabilities less any contingency reserves as recommended by the funds’ actuaries.
The Employer Surplus Account is the amount that the Group is entitled to by way of refund. All pension plans in South Africa are closed to new members and 
the majority of plans are closed to future benefit accrual. As the plans are in surplus no employer contributions are currently being made.
The Group’s provision of anti-retroviral therapy to HIV positive staff does not significantly impact the post employment medical plan liability. 
United Kingdom
The Group operates funded pension plans in the United Kingdom. These plans are closed to new members. The only plan still open to future benefit accrual 
will close to accrual on 30 September 2015. 
Certain assets held by the main plans in the United Kingdom are structured to closely match the characteristics of the liabilities through a variety of 
investment strategies, including the use of interest rate hedging and inflation hedging to manage interest rate risk and inflation rate risk respectively.
The Group is committed to make payments to certain United Kingdom pension plans under deficit funding plans agreed with the respective Trustees. Where 
the present value of the agreed funding payments exceeds the liability in respect of the plans as measured under IFRS, and would therefore, when paid, give 
rise to a surplus as measured under IFRS, a provision is recognised for any part of that surplus that would not be recoverable. Any resulting surplus has been 
assessed to be fully recoverable and as such no provision has been recognised.

27. RETIREMENT BENEFITS continued
Other
Other pension and post employment medical plans primarily comprise obligations in Chile where legislation requires employers to provide for a termination 
indemnity, entitling employees to a cash payment made on the termination of an employment contract. The features of this provision meet the definition of a 
post employment benefit obligation and consequently an unfunded liability is recognised on the Consolidated balance sheet. Other plans are in Brazil, Canada 
and mainland Europe and consist of funded and unfunded pension plans and unfunded medical aid plans. These plans are not considered to be significant 
to the Group.

Expected average increase in healthcare costs 7.9% 8.0% 7.7% 8.2% 8.1% 8.1%
Mortality assumptions are determined based on standard mortality tables with adjustments, as appropriate, to reflect experience of conditions locally. In  
South Africa, the PA90 tables are used. The main plans in the United Kingdom use either SAPS tables or Club Vita models with plan specific adjustments 
based on mortality investigations. The mortality tables used imply that a male or female aged 60 at the balance sheet date has the following future life 
expectancy (shown as weighted averages):
Male Female

The table below summarises the expected life expectancy from the age of 60 for a male or female age 45 at the balance sheet date. When viewed together with 
the respective life expectancy at age 60 in the table above this indicates the anticipated improvement in life expectancy (shown as weighted averages):

Sensitivity analysis
Significant actuarial assumptions for the determination of pension and medical plan liabilities are the discount rate, inflation rate and mortality. The sensitivity 
analysis below has been provided by local actuaries on an approximate basis based on changes in the assumptions occurring at the end of the year assuming 
that all other assumptions are held constant and the effect of interrelationships is excluded. The effect on plan liabilities is as follows:

28. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
See note 39u for the Group’s accounting policy on share-based payments.
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group had share-based payment arrangements with employees relating to shares of the Company, the details 
of which are described in the Remuneration report. All of these Company schemes are equity settled, either by award of ordinary shares (BSP, LTIP and SIP) 
or award of options to acquire ordinary shares (ESOS, DOP and SAYE). The ESOS is now closed to new participants, having been replaced with the BSP. 
No options have been granted under the DOP.
The total share-based payment charge relating to Anglo American plc shares for the year is split as follows:
US$ million 2014 2013
BSP 94  82 
LTIP 60  52 
Other schemes 3 10 
Share-based payment charge relating to Anglo American plc shares

In addition, there are equity settled share-based payment charges of $58 million (2013: $65 million) relating to Kumba Iron Ore Limited shares and $35 million (2013: $52 million) relating 
to Anglo American Platinum Limited shares. Certain business units also operate cash settled employee share-based payment schemes. These schemes had a charge of $8 million  
(2013: nil). 
Schemes settled by award of ordinary shares
The fair value of ordinary shares awarded under the BSP, LTIP and LTIP–ROCE, being the more material share schemes, was calculated using a Black Scholes 
model. The fair value of shares awarded under the LTIP–TSR scheme was calculated using a Monte Carlo model. The assumptions used in these calculations 
are set out below:

American plc shares each has purchased on the market. Tenon paid the Investment Companies 80% of the cost of the Anglo American plc shares including 
associated costs for this right to nominate, which together with subscriptions by Tenon for non-voting participating redeemable preference shares in the 
Investment Companies, provided all the funding required to acquire the Anglo American plc shares through the market. These payments by Tenon were 
sourced from the cash resources of AASA. Tenon is able to exercise its right of nomination at any time up to 31 December 2025 against payment of an average 
amount of $4.69 per share to Epoch, $7.29 per share to Epoch Two and $6.05 per share to Tarl which will be equal to 20% of the total costs respectively 
incurred by Epoch, Epoch Two and Tarl in purchasing shares nominated for transfer to the third party. These funds will then become available for redemption of 
the preference shares issued by the Investment Companies. The amount payable by the third party on receipt of the Anglo American plc shares will accrue to 
Tenon and, as these are own shares of the Company, any resulting gain or loss recorded by Tenon will not be recognised in the Consolidated income statement 
of Anglo American plc.
Under the agreements, the Investment Companies will receive dividends on the shares they hold and have agreed to waive the right to vote on those shares. 
The preference shares issued to the charitable trusts are entitled to a participating right of up to 10% of the profit after tax of Epoch and 5% of the profit after 
tax of Epoch Two and Tarl. The preference shares issued to Tenon will carry a fixed coupon of 3% plus a participating right of up to 80% of the profit after tax 
of Epoch and 85% of the profit after tax of Epoch Two and Tarl. Any remaining distributable earnings in the Investment Companies, after the above dividends, 
are then available for distribution as ordinary dividends to the charitable trusts.
The structure effectively provides Tenon with a beneficial interest in the price risk on these shares together with participation in future dividend receipts. 
The Investment Companies will retain legal title to the shares until Tenon exercises its right to nominate a transferee.
At 31 December 2014 the Investment Companies together held 112,300,129 (2013: 112,300,129) Anglo American plc shares, which represented 8.0% 
(2013: 8.1%) of the ordinary shares in issue (excluding treasury shares) with a market value of $2,100 million (2013: $2,451 million). The Investment 
Companies are not permitted to hold more than an aggregate of 10% of the issued share capital of Anglo American plc at any one time.
The Investment Companies are considered to be structured entities. Although the Group has no voting rights in the Investment Companies and cannot appoint 
or remove trustees of the charitable trusts, the Investment Companies continue to meet the accounting definition of a subsidiary in accordance with IFRS 10, 
and as a result are consolidated by the Group.
Employee benefit trust
The provision of shares to certain of the Company’s share option and share incentive schemes may be facilitated by an employee benefit trust or settled  
by the issue of treasury shares. Shares held by the trust are recorded as own shares, and the carrying value is shown as a reduction within shareholders’  
equity. The employee benefit trust has waived the right to receive dividends on these shares. The costs of operating the trust are borne by the Group but are 
not material.
The market value of the 1 share (2013: 985 shares) held by the trust at 31 December 2014 was $19 (2013: $21,000).

34. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
The Group is subject to various claims which arise in the ordinary course of business. Additionally, the Group has provided indemnities against certain liabilities 
as part of agreements for the sale or other disposal of business operations. Having taken appropriate legal advice, the Group believes that a material liability 
arising from the indemnities provided is remote.
The Group is required to provide guarantees in several jurisdictions in respect of environmental restoration and decommissioning obligations. The Group has 
provided for the estimated cost of these activities.
No contingent liabilities were secured on the assets of the Group at 31 December 2014 or 31 December 2013.
Anglo American South Africa Limited (AASA)
AASA, a wholly owned subsidiary of the Company, is a defendant in a number of lawsuits filed in England and South Africa on behalf of former mineworkers 
(or their dependants or survivors) who allegedly contracted silicosis working for gold mining companies in which AASA was a shareholder and to which AASA 
provided various technical and administrative services.
In England: AASA is a defendant in a lawsuit filed in the High Court in London on behalf of approximately 2,700 named former mineworkers or their dependants.
In South Africa: (i) AASA is a defendant in approximately 4,400 separate lawsuits filed in the North Gauteng High Court (Pretoria) which have been referred to 
arbitration; and (ii) AASA is named as one of 32 defendants in a consolidated class certification application filed in South Africa. 
AASA successfully contested the jurisdiction of the English courts to hear certain claims filed against it in that jurisdiction. AASA is defending the separate 
lawsuits filed in South Africa and will oppose the application for consolidated class certification in South Africa.
AASA, AngloGold Ashanti, Gold Fields, Harmony Gold and Sibanye Gold announced in November 2014 that they have formed an industry working group to 
address issues relating to compensation and medical care for occupational lung disease (OLD) in the gold mining industry in South Africa. The companies 
have begun to engage all stakeholders on these matters, including government, organised labour, other mining companies and legal representatives of 
claimants who have filed legal suits against the companies. These legal proceedings are being defended. The industry working group is seeking a 
comprehensive solution to address legacy compensation issues and future legal frameworks that is fair to past and current employees and enables companies 
to continue to be competitive over the long term. 
Kumba Iron Ore
21.4% undivided share of the Sishen mine mineral rights
Sishen Iron Ore Company (Pty) Limited (SIOC) has not yet been awarded the 21.4% Sishen mining right, which it applied for early in 2014 following the 
Constitutional Court judgment on the matter in December 2013. The Constitutional Court ruled that SIOC held a 78.6% undivided share of the Sishen mining 
right and that, based on the provisions of the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA), only SIOC can apply for, and be granted, the 
residual 21.4% share of the mining right at the Sishen mine. The grant of the mining right may be made subject to such conditions considered by the minister to 
be appropriate, provided that the proposed conditions are permissible under the MPRDA. Kumba Iron Ore is actively continuing its discussions with the 
Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) in order to finalise the grant of the residual right.
Kumba Iron Ore tax
At 31 December 2014, Kumba Iron Ore has certain unresolved tax matters that are currently under review with the South African Revenue Service (SARS). 
Kumba Iron Ore management has consulted with external tax and legal advisers, who support the positions taken. Nonetheless, Kumba Iron Ore management 
is actively discussing the issue with SARS with a view to seeking resolution and believes that the accounting for these matters is appropriate in the results for 
the year ended 31 December 2014.

Refinancing of Atlatsa
In January 2014, Platinum completed the second and final phase of the refinancing transaction for Atlatsa Resources Corporation (Atlatsa). Platinum sold  
its existing 27.0% indirect equity interest in Atlatsa to the controlling Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) shareholders and subscribed for equity shares  
in Atlatsa representing a 22.8% direct interest. In return the level of debt outstanding from Atlatsa was reduced. These transactions resulted in an increase  
in ‘Investments in associates’ of $69 million, a net decrease in ‘Financial asset investments’ of $47 million and a net gain of $22 million recorded within  
‘Non-operating special items’.
The first phase of the refinancing transaction completed in December 2013. Platinum acquired certain properties from Bokoni Platinum Holdings Proprietary 
Limited, which is an associate of the Group and is controlled by Atlatsa. In return the level of debt outstanding from Atlatsa was reduced. A charge of $37 million 
was recorded within ‘Non-operating special items’ for the year ended 31 December 2013 in relation to this transaction.

38. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT
The Board approves and monitors the risk management processes, including documented treasury policies, counterparty limits and controlling and reporting 
structures. The risk management processes of the Group’s independently listed subsidiaries are in line with the Group’s own policy.
The types of risk exposure, the way in which such exposure is managed and quantification of the level of exposure in the Consolidated balance sheet at 
31 December is as follows (subcategorised into credit risk, commodity price risk, foreign exchange risk and interest rate risk). See note 24 for liquidity risk.
Market risks
a) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a counterparty to a financial instrument will cause a loss to the Group by failing to pay for its obligation. The Group’s principal financial 
assets are cash, trade and other receivables, investments and derivative financial instruments. The Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk primarily arises 
from these financial assets and is as follows:
US$ million 2014 2013
Cash and cash equivalents 6,747  7,702 
Trade and other receivables
(1)
 2,465  3,874 
Financial asset investments
(2)
 761  759 
Derivative financial assets 1,133  674 
 11,106 13,009 
(1) 
Trade and other receivables exclude prepayments and tax receivables.
(2) 
Financial asset investments exclude available for sale investments.
The Group limits credit risk on liquid funds and derivative financial instruments through diversification of exposures with a range of financial institutions 
approved by the Board. Counterparty limits are set for each financial institution with reference to credit ratings assigned by Standard & Poor’s, Moody’s and 
Fitch Ratings, shareholder equity (in case of relationship banks) and fund size (in case of asset managers).
Given the diverse nature of the Group’s operations (both in relation to commodity markets and geographically), and the use of payment security instruments 
(including letters of credit from financial institutions), it does not have significant concentration of credit risk in respect of trade receivables, with exposure 
spread over a large number of customers.
A provision for impairment of trade receivables is made where there is an identified loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction 
in the recoverability of the cash flows. Details of the credit quality of trade receivables and the associated provision for impairment are disclosed in note 16.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES 156 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
38. FINANCIAL RISK MANAGEMENT continued
b) Commodity price risk
The Group’s earnings are exposed to movements in the prices of the commodities it produces.
The Group’s policy is to sell its products at prevailing market prices and is generally not to hedge commodity price risk, although some hedging may be 
undertaken for strategic reasons. In such cases, the Group generally uses forward contracts to hedge the price risk.
Certain of the Group’s sales and purchases are provisionally priced, meaning that the selling price is determined normally 30 to 180 days after delivery  
to the customer, based on quoted market prices stipulated in the contract, and as a result are susceptible to future price movements. The exposure of the 
Group’s financial assets and liabilities to commodity price risk is as follows:

(2) 
Includes receivables and payables for commodity sales and purchases not subject to price adjustment at the balance sheet date.
Commodity based contracts that are settled through physical delivery of the Group’s production or are used within the production process are classified as 
normal purchase or sale contracts and are not marked to market.
c) Foreign exchange risk
As a global business, the Group is exposed to many currencies principally as a result of non-US dollar operating costs and, to a lesser extent, from non-US 
dollar revenue. The Brazilian real, South African rand and Australian dollar are the most significant non-US dollar currencies influencing costs. A strengthening 
of the US dollar against the currencies to which the Group is exposed has a positive effect on the Group’s underlying earnings. The Group’s policy is generally 
not to hedge such exposures given the correlation, over the longer term, with commodity prices and the diversified nature of the Group, though exceptions can 
be approved by the Group Management Committee.
In addition, currency exposures exist in respect of non-US dollar approved capital expenditure projects and non-US dollar borrowings in US dollar functional 
currency entities. The Group’s policy is that such exposures should be hedged subject to a review of the specific circumstances of the exposure.
Analysis of foreign exchange risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within note 24. Net 
other financial assets (excluding net debt related balances) are $237 million. This includes net assets of $510 million which are denominated in US dollar, 
$158 million in Brazilian real and $42 million in South African rand, partially offset by net liabilities of $331 million which are denominated in Chilean peso and 
$223 million in Australian dollar. 
d) Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk arises due to fluctuations in interest rates which impact on the value of short term investments and financing activities. The Group is principally 
exposed to US and South African interest rates.
The Group’s policy is to borrow funds at floating rates of interest given the link with economic output and therefore the correlation, over the longer term, with 
commodity prices. The Group uses interest rate swap contracts to manage its exposure to interest rate movements on its debt. Strategic hedging using fixed 
rate debt may also be undertaken from time to time if approved by the Group Management Committee.
In respect of financial assets, the Group’s policy is to invest cash at floating rates of interest and to maintain cash reserves in short term investments (less than 
one year) in order to maintain liquidity, while achieving a satisfactory return for shareholders.
Analysis of interest rate risk associated with net debt balances and the impact of derivatives to hedge against this risk is included within note 24. Of net other 
financial assets (excluding net debt related balances) of $237 million, the majority are non-interest bearing.

e) Financial instrument sensitivities
Financial instruments affected by market risk include borrowings, deposits, derivative financial instruments, trade receivables and trade payables. The 
following analysis is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group’s financial instruments at 31 December to changes in foreign currencies, commodity 
prices and interest rates.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared on the basis that the components of net debt, the ratio of fixed to floating interest rates of the debt and derivatives 
portfolio and the proportion of financial instruments in foreign currencies are all constant and on the basis of the hedge designations in place at 31 December. 
In addition, the commodity price impact for provisionally priced contracts is based on the related trade receivables and trade payables at 31 December. As a 
consequence, this sensitivity analysis relates to the position at 31 December.
The following assumptions were made in calculating the sensitivity analysis:
 • all income statement sensitivities also impact equity
 • for debt and other deposits carried at amortised cost, carrying value does not change as interest rates move
 • no sensitivity is provided for interest accruals as these are based on pre-agreed interest rates and therefore are not susceptible to further rate changes
 • no sensitivity has been calculated on derivatives and related underlying instruments designated into fair value hedge relationships as these are assumed 
materially to offset one another
 • all hedge relationships are assumed to be fully effective
 • debt with a maturity of less than one year is floating rate, unless it is a long term fixed rate debt in its final year
 • translation of foreign subsidiaries and operations into the Group’s presentation currency has been excluded from the sensitivity.
Using the above assumptions, the following table shows the illustrative effect on the income statement and equity that would result from reasonably possible 
changes in the relevant commodity price.

Without the impact of capitalised interest, the Group’s sensitivity to a 50bps increase and decrease in LIBOR would be $49 million (2013: $44 million) loss and gain respectively.
The above sensitivities are calculated with reference to a single moment in time and are subject to change due to a number of factors including:
 • fluctuating trade receivable and trade payable balances
 • derivative instruments and borrowings settled throughout the year
 • fluctuating cash balances
 • changes in currency mix.
As the sensitivities are limited to year end financial instrument balances, they do not take account of the Group’s sales and operating costs, which are highly 
sensitive to changes in commodity prices and exchange rates. In addition, each of the sensitivities is calculated in isolation whilst, in reality, commodity prices, 
interest rates and foreign currencies do not move independently.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES 158 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
39. ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) and IFRS Interpretations Committee 
(IFRIC) interpretations as adopted for use by the European Union, with those 
parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies reporting under 
IFRS and with the requirements of the Disclosure and Transparency rules  
of the Financial Conduct Authority in the United Kingdom as applicable to 
periodic financial reporting. The financial statements have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention as modified by the revaluation of pension 
assets and liabilities and certain financial instruments. A summary of the 
principal Group accounting policies is set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with generally accepted 
accounting principles requires the use of estimates and assumptions that 
affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of the financial 
statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the 
reporting period. Although these estimates are based on management’s best 
knowledge of the amount, event or actions, actual results ultimately may  
differ from those estimates. 
As permitted by UK company law, the Group’s results are presented in 
US dollars, the currency in which its business is primarily conducted.
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the financial statements, a 
reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Thus the going concern basis of accounting in preparing the financial 
statements continues to be adopted. Further details are contained in the 
Directors’ report on page 212.
Basis of consolidation
The financial statements incorporate a consolidation of the financial 
statements of the Company and entities controlled by the Company (its 
subsidiaries). Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has 
rights, to variable returns from its involvement with the investee and has the 
ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are 
included in the income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up 
to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. 
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the results of subsidiaries, joint 
arrangements and associates to bring their accounting policies into line with 
those used by the Group. Intra-group transactions, balances, income and 
expenses are eliminated on consolidation, where appropriate. 
For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are presented 
in equity separately from the equity attributable to shareholders of the 
Company. Profit or loss and other comprehensive income are attributed to the 
shareholders of the Company and to the non-controlling interest even if this 
results in the non-controlling interests having a deficit balance.
Changes in ownership interest in subsidiaries that do not result in a change  
in control are accounted for in equity. The carrying amounts of the controlling 
and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the changes in their 
relative interests in the subsidiary. Any difference between the amount by 
which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the 
consideration paid or received is recorded directly in equity and attributed 
to the shareholders of the Company.
39a. Revenue recognition
Revenue is derived principally from the sale of goods and is measured at the 
fair value of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts, 
volume rebates, value added tax and other sales taxes. Sales of concentrate 
are stated at their invoiced amount which is net of treatment and refining 
charges. A sale is recognised when the significant risks and rewards of 
ownership have passed. This is usually when title and insurance risk have 
passed to the customer and the goods have been delivered to a contractually 
agreed location.
Revenue from metal mining activities is based on the payable metal sold.
Sales of certain commodities are provisionally priced such that the price is not 
settled until a predetermined future date and is based on the market price at 
that time. Revenue on these sales is initially recognised (when the above 
criteria are met) at the current market price. Provisionally priced sales are 
marked to market at each reporting date using the forward price for the period 
equivalent to that outlined in the contract. This mark to market adjustment is 
recognised in revenue.
Revenues from the sale of material by-products are included within revenue. 
Where a by-product is not regarded as significant, revenue may be credited 
against the cost of sales.
Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to the principal 
outstanding and at the effective interest rate applicable.
Dividend income from investments is recognised when the shareholders’ 
rights to receive payment have been established.
39b. Borrowing costs
Interest on borrowings directly relating to the financing of qualifying capital 
projects under construction is added to the capitalised cost of those projects 
during the construction phase, until such time as the assets are substantially  
ready for their intended use or sale which, in the case of mining properties, 
is when they are capable of commercial production. Where funds have been 
borrowed specifically to finance a project, the amount capitalised represents 
the actual borrowing costs incurred. Where the funds used to finance a 
project form part of general borrowings, the amount capitalised is calculated 
using a weighted average of rates applicable to relevant general borrowings 
of the Group during the period. All other borrowing costs are recognised in 
the income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
39c. Tax
The tax expense includes the current tax and deferred tax charge recognised 
in the income statement.
Current tax payable is based on taxable profit for the year. Taxable profit 
differs from net profit as reported in the income statement because it 
excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other 
years and it further excludes items that are not taxable or deductible. The 
Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of temporary differences between the 
carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and  
the amounts used for taxation purposes. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available 
against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets 
and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the 
initial recognition of goodwill or of an asset or liability in a transaction (other  
than in a business combination) that affects neither taxable profit nor 
accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and associates 
except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each reporting date 
and is adjusted to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable 
profit will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the 
period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised, based on the laws 
that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date. 
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when 
it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the 
deferred tax is also taken directly to equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes 
levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its 
current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis in that taxation authority.

Financial statements
39. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
39d. Business combinations and goodwill arising thereon
The identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary, 
a joint arrangement or an associate, which can be measured reliably, are 
recorded at their provisional fair values at the date of acquisition. Goodwill 
is the fair value of the consideration transferred (including contingent 
consideration and previously held non-controlling interests) less the fair  
value of the Group’s share of identifiable net assets on acquisition. 
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously 
held interests in the acquiree are remeasured to fair value at the acquisition 
date and the resulting gain or loss is recognised in the income statement. 
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date 
that have previously been recognised in other comprehensive income are 
reclassified to the income statement, where such treatment would be 
appropriate if that interest were disposed of.
Transaction costs incurred in connection with the business combination  
are expensed. Provisional fair values are finalised within 12 months of the 
acquisition date.
Goodwill in respect of subsidiaries and joint operations is included within 
intangible assets. Goodwill relating to associates and joint ventures is 
included within the carrying value of the investment. 
Where the fair value of the identifiable net assets acquired exceeds the  
cost of the acquisition, the surplus, which represents the discount on the 
acquisition, is recognised directly in the income statement in the period  
of acquisition.
For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are initially 
recorded at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values of  
net assets recognised at acquisition.
39e. Non-mining licences and other intangibles
Non-mining licences and other intangibles are measured at cost less 
accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Intangible 
assets acquired as part of an acquisition of a business are capitalised 
separately from goodwill if the asset is separable or arises from contractual or 
legal rights and the fair value can be measured reliably on initial recognition. 
Intangible assets are amortised over their estimated useful lives, usually 
between 3 and 20 years, except goodwill and those intangible assets that 
are considered to have indefinite lives. For intangible assets with a finite life, 
the amortisation period is determined as the period over which the Group 
expects to obtain benefits from the asset, taking account of all relevant facts 
and circumstances including contractual lives and expectations about the 
renewal of contractual arrangements without significant incremental costs. 
An intangible asset is deemed to have an indefinite life when, based on an 
analysis of all of the relevant factors, there is no foreseeable limit to the period 
over which the asset is expected to generate cash flows for the Group. 
Amortisation methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are 
reviewed at least annually.
39f. Impairment of goodwill
Goodwill arising on business combinations is allocated to the group of cash 
generating units (CGUs) that is expected to benefit from synergies of the 
combination, and represents the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored 
by the Group’s board of directors for internal management purposes. The 
recoverable amount of the CGU, or group of CGUs, to which goodwill has 
been allocated is tested for impairment annually, or when events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that it may be impaired.
Any impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Impairment of goodwill is not subsequently reversed.
39g. Property, plant and equipment
Mining properties and leases include the cost of acquiring and developing 
mining properties and mineral rights.
Mining properties are depreciated to their residual values using the unit  
of production method based on Proved and Probable Ore Reserves and,  
in certain limited circumstances, other Mineral Resources. Mineral Resources 
are included in depreciation calculations where there is a high degree of 
confidence that they will be extracted in an economic manner. For diamond 
operations, depreciation calculations are based on Diamond Reserves and 
Resources included in the Life of Mine Plan. Depreciation is charged on new 
mining ventures from the date that the mining property is capable of 
commercial production. When there is little likelihood of a mineral right being 
exploited, or the value of the exploitable mineral right has diminished below 
cost, an impairment loss is recognised in the income statement. 
Capital works in progress are measured at cost less any recognised 
impairment. Depreciation commences when the assets reach commercial 
production, at which point they are transferred to the appropriate asset class. 
Buildings and plant and equipment are depreciated to their residual values at 
varying rates on a straight line basis over their estimated useful lives or the 
Reserve Life, whichever is shorter. Estimated useful lives normally vary from 
up to 20 years for items of plant and equipment to a maximum of 50 years for 
buildings. Land is not depreciated.
When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have different useful 
lives, they are accounted for as separate items (major components).
Depreciation methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are 
reviewed at least annually.
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease 
term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined 
by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the carrying amount. The gain 
or loss is recognised in the income statement.
39h. Deferred stripping
The removal of overburden and other mine waste materials is often necessary 
during the initial development of a mine site, in order to access the mineral ore 
deposit. The directly attributable cost of this activity is capitalised in full within 
mining properties and leases, until the point at which the mine is considered 
to be capable of commercial production. This is classified as expansionary 
capital expenditure, within investing cash flows.
The removal of waste material after the point at which a mine is capable of 
commercial production is referred to as production stripping. 
When the waste removal activity improves access to ore extracted in the 
current period, the costs of production stripping are charged to the income 
statement as operating costs in accordance with the principles of IAS 2 
Inventories. 
Where production stripping activity both produces inventory and improves 
access to ore in future periods the associated costs of waste removal are 
allocated between the two elements. The portion which benefits future ore 
extraction is capitalised within stripping and development capital expenditure. 
If the amount to be capitalised cannot be specifically identified it is determined 
based on the volume of waste extracted compared with expected volume for 
the identified component of the orebody. Components are specific volumes 
of a mine’s orebody that are determined by reference to the Life of Mine Plan. 
In certain instances significant levels of waste removal may occur during the 
production phase with little or no associated production. This may occur at 
both open pit and underground mines, for example longwall development. 
The cost of this waste removal is capitalised in full.
All amounts capitalised in respect of waste removal are depreciated using the 
unit of production method based on Proved and Probable Ore Reserves of 
the component of the orebody to which they relate. 
The effects of changes to the Life of Mine Plan on the expected cost of waste 
removal or remaining reserves for a component are accounted for 
prospectively as a change in estimate.

ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES 160 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
39. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
39i. Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets excluding goodwill
At each reporting date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its 
property, plant and equipment and intangible assets to determine whether 
there is any indication that those assets are impaired. If such an indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of any impairment. Where the asset does not generate cash flows 
that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable 
amount of the CGU to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset with an 
indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is 
an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs of disposal and value 
in use (VIU). In assessing VIU, the estimated future cash flows are discounted 
to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current 
market assessments of the time value of money and the risks specific to the 
asset for which estimates of future cash flows have not been adjusted.
If the recoverable amount of an asset or CGU is estimated to be less than its 
carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset or CGU is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised in the income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount  
of the asset or CGU is increased to the revised estimate of its recoverable 
amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the 
carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment  
been recognised for the asset or CGU. A reversal of an impairment loss  
is recognised in the income statement.
39j. Exploration, evaluation and development expenditure
Exploration and evaluation expenditure is expensed in the year in which it  
is incurred. When a decision is taken that a mining property is economically 
feasible, all subsequent evaluation expenditure is capitalised within property, 
plant and equipment including, where applicable, directly attributable  
pre-production development expenditure. Capitalisation of such expenditure 
ceases when the mining property is capable of commercial production.
Exploration properties acquired are recognised in the balance sheet at cost 
less any accumulated impairment losses. Such properties and capitalised 
evaluation and pre-production development expenditure prior to commercial 
production are assessed for impairment in accordance with the Group’s 
accounting policy stated above.
39k. Associates and joint arrangements
Associates are investments over which the Group has significant influence, 
which is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investee, but without the ability to exercise control or joint 
control. Typically the Group owns between 20% and 50% of the voting equity 
of its associates.
Joint arrangements are arrangements in which the Group shares joint control 
with one or more parties. Joint control is the contractually agreed sharing of 
control of an arrangement, and exists only when decisions about the activities 
that significantly affect the arrangement’s returns require the unanimous 
consent of the parties sharing control. 
Joint arrangements are classified as either joint operations or joint ventures 
based on the rights and obligations of the parties to the arrangement. In joint 
operations, the parties have rights to the assets and obligations for the 
liabilities relating to the arrangement, whereas in joint ventures, the parties 
have rights to the net assets of the arrangement. 
Joint arrangements that are not structured through a separate vehicle are 
always joint operations. Joint arrangements that are structured through a 
separate vehicle may be either joint operations or joint ventures depending 
on the substance of the arrangement. In these cases, consideration is given 
to the legal form of the separate vehicle, the terms of the contractual 
arrangement and, when relevant, other facts and circumstances. When the 
activities of an arrangement are primarily designed for the provision of output 
to the parties, and the parties are substantially the only source of cash flows 
contributing to the continuity of the operations of the arrangement, this 
indicates the parties to the arrangements have rights to the assets and 
obligations for the liabilities.
The Group accounts for joint operations by recognising the assets, liabilities, 
revenue and expenses for which it has rights or obligations, including its share 
of such items held or incurred jointly.
Investments in associates and joint ventures are accounted for using the 
equity method of accounting except when classified as held for sale. The 
Group’s share of associates’ and joint ventures’ net income is based on their 
most recent audited financial statements or unaudited interim statements 
drawn up to the Group’s balance sheet date.
The total carrying values of investments in associates and joint ventures 
represent the cost of each investment including the carrying value of 
goodwill, the share of post acquisition retained earnings, any other 
movements in reserves and any long term debt interests which in substance 
form part of the Group’s net investment. The carrying values of associates 
and joint ventures are reviewed on a regular basis and if there is objective 
evidence that an impairment in value has occurred as a result of one or more 
events during the period, the investment is impaired. 
The Group’s share of an associate’s or joint venture’s losses in excess of its 
interest in that associate or joint venture is not recognised unless the Group 
has an obligation to fund such losses. Unrealised gains arising from 
transactions with associates and joint ventures are eliminated against the 
investment to the extent of the Group’s interest in the investee. Unrealised 
losses are eliminated in the same way, but only to the extent that there is no 
evidence of impairment.
39l. Financial asset investments
Investments, other than investments in subsidiaries, joint arrangements and 
associates, are financial asset investments and are initially recognised at fair 
value. At subsequent reporting dates, financial assets classified as  
held-to-maturity or as loans and receivables are measured at amortised cost, 
less any impairment losses. Other investments are classified as either at fair 
value through profit or loss (which includes investments held for trading)  
or available for sale financial assets. Both categories are subsequently 
measured at fair value. Where investments are held for trading purposes, 
unrealised gains and losses for the period are included in the income 
statement within other gains and losses. For available for sale investments, 
unrealised gains and losses are recognised in equity until the investment is 
disposed of or impaired, at which time the cumulative gain or loss previously 
recognised in equity is recycled to the income statement.
39m. Impairment of financial assets (including receivables)
A financial asset not measured at fair value through profit or loss is assessed 
at each reporting date to determine whether there is any objective evidence 
that it is impaired. A financial asset is impaired if objective evidence indicates 
that a loss event has occurred after the initial recognition of the asset.
An impairment loss in respect of a financial asset measured at amortised cost 
is calculated as the difference between its carrying amount and the present 
value of the estimated cash flows discounted at the asset’s original effective 
interest rate. Losses are recognised in the income statement. When a 
subsequent event causes the amount of impairment loss to decrease, the 
decrease in impairment loss is reversed through the income statement.
Impairment losses relating to available for sale investments are recognised 
when a decline in fair value is considered significant or prolonged. These 
impairment losses are recognised by transferring the cumulative loss that has 
been recognised in the statement of comprehensive income to the income 
statement. The loss recognised in the income statement is the difference 
between the acquisition cost and the current fair value.
39n. Derivative financial instruments and hedge accounting
In order to hedge its exposure to foreign exchange, interest rate and 
commodity price risk, the Group enters into forward, option and swap 
contracts. The Group does not use derivative financial instruments for 
speculative purposes. Commodity based (own use) contracts that meet 
the scope exemption in IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement are recognised in earnings when they are settled by 
physical delivery.

Financial statements
39. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
All derivatives are held at fair value in the balance sheet within ‘Derivative 
financial assets’ or ‘Derivative financial liabilities’ except if they are linked  
to settlement and delivery of an unquoted equity instrument and the fair  
value cannot be measured reliably, in which case they are carried at cost. 
A derivative cannot be measured reliably where the range of reasonable  
fair value estimates is significant and the probabilities of various estimates 
cannot be reasonably assessed.
Changes in the fair value of derivative financial instruments that are 
designated and effective as hedges of future cash flows (cash flow hedges) 
are recognised directly in equity. The gain or loss relating to the ineffective 
portion is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the cash flow 
hedge of a firm commitment or forecast transaction results in the recognition 
of a non-financial asset or liability, then, at the time the asset or liability is 
recognised, the associated gains or losses on the derivative that had 
previously been recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement 
of the asset or liability. For hedges that do not result in the recognition of a 
non-financial asset or liability, amounts deferred in equity are recognised in 
the income statement in the same period in which the hedged item affects 
profit or loss. 
For an effective hedge of an exposure to changes in fair value, the hedged 
item is adjusted for changes in fair value attributable to the risk being hedged. 
The corresponding entry, along with gains or losses from remeasuring the 
associated derivative, are recognised in the income statement.
The gain or loss on hedging instruments relating to the effective portion 
of a net investment hedge is recognised in equity (within the cumulative 
translation adjustment reserve). The ineffective portion is recognised 
immediately in the income statement. Gains or losses accumulated in the 
cumulative translation adjustment reserve are recycled to the income 
statement on disposal of the foreign operations to which they relate.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires  
or is sold, terminated, exercised, revoked, or no longer qualifies for hedge 
accounting. At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity is retained until the forecast transaction 
occurs. If a hedge transaction is no longer expected to occur, the net 
cumulative gain or loss previously recognised in equity is recycled to the 
income statement for the period.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that are not designated 
in a hedge relationship are recognised immediately in the income statement 
and are classified within other gains and losses (operating costs) or net 
finance costs depending on the type of risk to which the derivative relates.
Derivatives embedded in other financial instruments or non-financial host 
contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and 
characteristics are not closely related to those of their host contracts and the 
host contracts themselves are not carried at fair value with unrealised gains  
or losses reported in the income statement.
39o. Cash and debt
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and on demand deposits, 
together with short term, highly liquid investments that are readily convertible 
to a known amount of cash and that are subject to an insignificant risk of 
changes in value. Bank overdrafts are shown within short term borrowings in 
current liabilities on the balance sheet. Cash and cash equivalents in the cash 
flow statement are shown net of overdrafts. Cash and cash equivalents are 
measured at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classified and accounted for  
as debt or equity according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into.
Bank borrowings
Interest bearing bank loans and overdrafts are initially recognised at fair 
value, net of directly attributable transaction costs. Finance charges, 
including premiums payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue 
costs are recognised in the income statement using the effective interest 
method. They are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the 
extent that they are not settled in the period in which they arise.
FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION NOTES TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
ADDITIONAL DISCLOSURES
39p. Derecognition of financial assets and financial liabilities
Financial assets are derecognised when the right to receive cash flows from  
the asset has expired, the right to receive cash flows has been retained but  
an obligation to on-pay them in full without material delay has been assumed 
or the right to receive cash flows has been transferred together with 
substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership.
Financial liabilities are derecognised when the associated obligation has  
been discharged, cancelled or has expired.
39q. Inventories
Inventory and work in progress are measured at the lower of cost and net 
realisable value. The production cost of inventory includes an appropriate 
proportion of depreciation and production overheads. Cost is determined  
on the following basis:
 • Raw materials and consumables are measured at cost on a first in, first  
out (FIFO) basis or a weighted average cost basis.
 • Work in progress and finished products are measured at raw material cost, 
labour cost and a proportion of manufacturing overhead expenses.
 • Metal and coal stocks are included within finished products and are 
measured at average cost.
At precious metals operations that produce ‘joint products’, cost is  
allocated amongst products according to the ratio of contribution of these 
metals to gross sales revenues.
39r. Environmental restoration and decommissioning 
obligations
An obligation to incur environmental restoration, rehabilitation and 
decommissioning costs arises when disturbance is caused by the 
development or ongoing production of a mining property. Such costs  
arising from the decommissioning of plant and other site preparation work, 
discounted to their net present value, are provided for and capitalised at the 
start of each project, as soon as the obligation to incur such costs arises. 
These costs are recognised in the income statement over the life of the 
operation, through the depreciation of the asset and the unwinding of the 
discount on the provision. Costs for restoration of subsequent site damage 
which is created on an ongoing basis during production are provided for 
at their net present values and recognised in the income statement as 
extraction progresses.
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of 
plant or other site preparation work (that result from changes in the estimated 
timing or amount of the cash flow or a change in the discount rate), are added 
to or deducted from the cost of the related asset in the current period. If a 
decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess 
is recognised immediately in the income statement. If the asset value is 
increased and there is an indication that the revised carrying value is not 
recoverable, an impairment test is performed in accordance with the 
accounting policy set out above.
For some South African operations annual contributions are made to 
dedicated environmental rehabilitation trusts to fund the estimated cost  
of rehabilitation during and at the end of the life of the relevant mine.  
The Group exercises full control of these trusts and therefore the trusts are 
consolidated. The trusts’ assets are disclosed separately on the balance sheet 
as non-current assets. The trusts’ assets are measured based on the nature of 
the underlying assets in accordance with accounting policies for  
similar assets.
39s. Non-current assets and disposal groups held for sale 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale if their 
carrying amount will be recovered through a sale transaction rather than 
through continuing use. This condition is regarded as met only when a sale is 
highly probable within one year from the date of classification, management 
is committed to the sale and the asset or disposal group is available for 
immediate sale in its present condition.
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held for sale from 
the date these conditions are met and are measured at the lower of carrying 
amount and fair value less costs to sell. Any resulting impairment loss 
is recognised in the income statement. On classification as held for sale the 
assets are no longer depreciated. Comparative amounts are not adjusted. 162 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
39. ACCOUNTING POLICIES continued
39t. Retirement benefits
The Group operates both defined benefit and defined contribution pension 
plans for its employees as well as post employment medical plans. For 
defined contribution plans the amount recognised in the income statement 
is the contributions paid or payable during the year.
For defined benefit pension and post employment medical plans, full actuarial 
valuations are carried out at least every three years using the projected unit 
credit method and updates are performed for each financial year end. The 
average discount rate for the plans’ liabilities is based on AA rated corporate 
bonds of a suitable duration and currency or, where there is no deep market 
for such bonds, is based on government bonds. Pension plan assets are 
measured using year end market values.
Remeasurements comprising actuarial gains and losses, movements in asset 
surplus restrictions and the return on scheme assets (excluding interest 
income) are recognised immediately in the statement of comprehensive 
income and are not recycled to the income statement. Any increase in the 
present value of plan liabilities expected to arise from employee service during 
the year is charged to operating profit. The net interest income or cost on the 
net defined benefit asset or liability is included in investment income and 
interest expense respectively.
Past service cost is recognised immediately to the extent that the benefits are 
already vested and otherwise amortised on a straight line basis over the 
average period until the benefits vest.
The retirement benefit obligation recognised on the balance sheet represents 
the present value of the deficit or surplus of the defined benefit plans. Any 
recognised surplus is limited to the present value of available refunds or 
reductions in future contributions to the plan.
39u. Share-based payments
The Group makes equity settled share-based payments to certain employees, 
which are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a 
straight line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of 
shares that will eventually vest. For those share schemes with market related 
vesting conditions, the fair value is determined using the Monte Carlo method 
at the grant date. The fair value of share options issued with non-market 
vesting conditions has been calculated using the Black Scholes model. For all 
other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market 
value of the shares at the grant date. For all share schemes with non-market 
vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when 
determining the relevant charge. Vesting assumptions are reviewed during 
each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations.
39v. Black Economic Empowerment (BEE) transactions
Where the Group disposes of a portion of a South African based subsidiary 
or operation to a BEE company at a discount to fair value, the transaction is 
considered to be a share-based payment (in line with the principle contained 
in South Africa interpretation AC 503 Accounting for Black Economic 
Empowerment (BEE) Transactions). 
The discount provided or value given is calculated in accordance with IFRS 2 
and the cost, representing the fair value of the BEE credentials obtained by 
the subsidiary, is recorded in the income statement.
39w. Foreign currency transactions and translation
Foreign currency transactions by Group companies are recognised in the 
functional currencies of the companies at the exchange rate ruling on the date 
of the transaction. At each reporting date, monetary assets and liabilities that 
are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing 
on the reporting date. Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in 
the income statement for the period and are classified as either operating or 
financing depending on the nature of the monetary item giving rise to them.
Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date 
of the transaction.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign operations 
are translated into the presentation currency of the Group at exchange rates 
prevailing on the reporting date. Income and expense items are translated 
at the average exchange rates for the period where these approximate the 
rates at the dates of the transactions. Any exchange differences arising are 
classified within the statement of comprehensive income and transferred to 
the Group’s cumulative translation adjustment reserve. Exchange differences 
on foreign currency balances with foreign operations for which settlement is 
neither planned nor likely to occur in the foreseeable future, and therefore 
form part of the Group’s net investment in these foreign operations, are offset 
in the cumulative translation adjustment reserve.
Cumulative translation differences are recycled from equity and recognised 
as income or expense on disposal of the operation to which they relate.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of foreign entities 
are treated as assets of the foreign entity and translated at the closing rate.
39x. Leases
In addition to lease contracts, other significant contracts are assessed to 
determine whether, in substance, they are or contain a lease. This includes 
assessment of whether the arrangement is dependent on use of a specific 
asset and the right to use that asset is conveyed through the contract.
Rental costs under operating leases are recognised in the income statement 
in equal annual amounts over the lease term.

FINANCIAL STATEMENTS AND OTHER FINANCIAL INFORMATION FINANCIAL STATEMENTS OF THE PARENT COMPANY
3) Accounting policies: Anglo American plc (the Company)
The Company balance sheet and related notes have been prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (UK GAAP)) and in accordance with UK company law. The financial information has been prepared on a historical cost basis 
as modified by the revaluation of certain financial instruments.
A summary of the principal accounting policies is set out below.
The preparation of financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of 
assets and liabilities at the date of the financial statements and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the period. Actual results may differ 
from those estimated.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006, the profit and loss account of the Company is not presented as part of these financial statements. 
The profit after tax for the year of the Company amounted to $2,019 million (2013: $700 million).
Significant accounting policies
Investments
Investments represent equity holdings in subsidiaries and are held at cost less provision for impairment.
Share-based payments
The Company has applied the requirements of FRS 20 Share-based Payment.
The Company makes equity settled share-based payments to the directors, which are measured at fair value at the date of grant and expensed on a straight 
line basis over the vesting period, based on the Company’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. For those share schemes with market vesting 
conditions, the fair value is determined using a Monte Carlo model at the grant date. The fair value of share options issued with non-market vesting conditions 
has been calculated using a Black Scholes model. For all other share awards, the fair value is determined by reference to the market value of the share at the 
grant date. For all share schemes with non-market vesting conditions, the likelihood of vesting has been taken into account when determining the associated 
charge. Vesting assumptions are reviewed during each reporting period to ensure they reflect current expectations.
The Company also makes equity settled share-based payments to certain employees of certain subsidiary undertakings. Equity settled share-based 
payments that are made to employees of the Company’s subsidiaries are treated as increases in equity over the vesting period of the award, with a 
corresponding increase in the Company’s investments in subsidiaries, based on an estimate of the number of shares that will eventually vest.
Any payments received from subsidiaries are applied to reduce the related increases in investments in subsidiaries.
Accounting for share-based payments is the same as under IFRS 2 and details on the schemes and option pricing models relevant to the charge included  
in the Company financial statements are set out in note 28 to the Consolidated financial statements of the Group for the year ended 31 December 2014.
New accounting standards, amendments and interpretations not yet adopted
Anglo American plc intends to apply FRS 101 in its separate financial statements for the financial year ended 31 December 2015. Any objections should be 
notified to the Company Secretary by 31 May 2015. 166 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014

Underlying EBIT is operating profit presented before special items and remeasurements and includes the Group’s attributable share of associates’ and joint ventures’ underlying EBIT. 
Underlying EBIT of associates and joint ventures is the Group’s attributable share of revenue less operating costs before special items and remeasurements of associates and joint ventures.
(4) 
Underlying earnings is profit attributable to equity shareholders of the Company before special items and remeasurements, and is therefore presented after net finance costs, income tax and 
non-controlling interests.
(5) 
Underlying EBITDA is underlying EBIT before depreciation and amortisation in subsidiaries and joint operations and includes the Group’s attributable share of associates’ and joint ventures’ 
underlying EBIT before depreciation and amortisation.
(6) 
Underlying EBITDA interest cover is underlying EBITDA divided by net finance costs, excluding net foreign exchange gains and losses, unwinding of discount relating to provisions and other 
liabilities, financing special items and remeasurements, and including the Group’s attributable share of associates’ and joint ventures’ net finance costs, which in 2011 resulted in a net finance 
income and therefore the ratio is not applicable.
(7) 
Total capital employed is net assets excluding net debt (including related hedges and net debt in disposal groups) and financial asset investments. Comparatives are presented on a 
consistent basis.
(8) 
Capital expenditure is defined as cash expenditure on property, plant and equipment including related derivatives, and is now presented net of proceeds from disposal of property, plant and 
equipment and includes direct funding for capital expenditure from non-controlling interests in order to match more closely the way in which it is managed. Comparatives have been 
re-presented to align with current year presentation.
(9) 
Net debt is calculated as total borrowings less cash and cash equivalents (including related hedges and net debt in disposal groups). 
(10) 
Net debt to total capital is calculated as net debt (including related hedges and net debt in disposal groups) divided by total capital. Comparatives are presented on a consistent basis.

Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources
INTRODUCTION
The Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates presented in this  
Annual Report are prepared in accordance with the Anglo American plc 
(AA plc) Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore 
Reserves standard. This standard requires that the Australasian Code for 
Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves 
2012 edition (the JORC Code) be used as a minimum standard. Some 
Anglo American plc subsidiaries have a primary listing in South Africa 
where public reporting is carried out in accordance with the South African 
Code for Reporting of Exploration Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral 
Reserves (the SAMREC Code). The SAMREC Code is similar to the  
JORC Code and the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource terminology 
appearing in this section follows the definitions in both the JORC (2012) 
and SAMREC (2007 Edition as amended July 2009) Codes. Ore Reserves 
in the context of this Annual Report have the same meaning as ‘Mineral 
Reserves’ as defined by the SAMREC Code and the CIM (Canadian 
Institute of Mining and Metallurgy) Definition Standards on Mineral 
Resources and Mineral Reserves.
The information on Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources was prepared 
by or under the supervision of Competent Persons as defined in the  
JORC or SAMREC Codes. All Competent Persons have sufficient 
experience relevant to the style of mineralisation and type of deposit  
under consideration and to the activity which they are undertaking. All  
the Competent Persons consent to the inclusion in this report of the 
information in the form and context in which it appears. The names of the 
Competent Persons are lodged with the Anglo American plc Company 
Secretary and listed in the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource Report 2014 
along with their affiliation and years of relevant experience.
Anglo American Group companies are subject to a comprehensive 
programme of reviews aimed at providing assurance in respect of Ore 
Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates. The reviews are conducted by 
suitably qualified Competent Persons from within the Anglo American 
Group, or by independent consultants. The frequency and depth of the 
reviews is a function of the perceived risks and/or uncertainties associated 
with a particular Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource. The overall value of 
the entity and time that has lapsed since an independent third-party review 
is also considered. Those operations/projects that were subjected to 
independent third-party reviews during the year are indicated in footnotes 
to the tables.
The JORC and SAMREC Codes require due consideration of reasonable 
prospects for eventual economic extraction for Mineral Resource 
definition. These include long-range commodity price forecasts which  
are prepared by in-house specialists largely using estimates of future 
supply and demand and long-term economic outlooks. The calculation  
of Mineral Resource and Ore Reserve estimates are based on long-term 
prices determined at the beginning of the second quarter each year. Ore 
Reserves are dynamic and are more likely to be affected by fluctuations in 
the prices of commodities, uncertainties in production costs, processing 
costs and other mining, infrastructure, legal, environmental, social and 
governmental factors which may impact the financial condition and 
prospects of the Group. Mineral Resource estimates also change and  
tend to be influenced mostly by new information pertaining to the 
understanding of the deposit and secondly by the conversion to Ore 
Reserves. Unless otherwise stated, Mineral Resources are additional  
to (exclusive of) those resources converted to Ore Reserves and are 
reported on a dry tonnes basis.
The appropriate Mineral Resource classification is determined by the 
appointed Competent (or Qualified) Persons. The choice of appropriate 
category of Mineral Resource depends upon the quantity, distribution and 
quality of geoscientific information available and the level of confidence in 
these data.
To accommodate the various factors that are important in the development 
of a classified Mineral Resource estimate, a scorecard approach is 
generally used. Mineral Resource classification defines the confidence 
associated with different parts of the Mineral Resource. The confidence 
that is assigned refers collectively to the reliability of the Grade and 
Tonnage estimates. This reliability includes consideration for the fidelity  
of the base data, the geological continuity predicated by the level of 
understanding of the geology, the likely precision of the estimated grades 
and understanding of grade variability, as well as various other factors  
(in particular density) that may influence the confidence that can be  
placed on the Mineral Resource. Most business units have developed 
commodity-specific scorecard-based approaches to the classification  
of their Mineral Resources.
The estimates of Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources are stated as  
at 31 December 2014. The figures in the tables have been rounded and,  
if used to derive totals and averages, minor differences with stated results 
could occur. 
This section of the Annual Report presenting the Ore Reserve and  
Mineral Resource estimates, should be considered the only valid source  
of Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource information for the Anglo American 
group exclusive of Kumba Iron Ore and Anglo American Platinum Limited 
which publish their own independent annual reports.
It is accepted that mine design and planning may include some  
Inferred Mineral Resources. Inferred Mineral Resources in the Life of  
Mine Plan (LOM Plan) are described as ‘Inferred (in LOM Plan)’ separately  
from the remaining Inferred Mineral Resources described as ‘Inferred  
(ex. LOM Plan)’, as required. These resources are declared without 
application of any modifying factors. Reserve Life reflects the scheduled 
extraction period in years for the total Ore Reserves in the approved  
Life of Mine Plan.
The Attributable Percentage that Anglo American holds in each operation 
and project is presented beside the name of each entity. Operations and 
projects which fall below the internal threshold for reporting (25% 
attributable interest) are excluded from the Ore Reserves and Mineral 
Resources estimates. 
In South Africa, the Minerals and Petroleum Resources Development  
Act, Number 28 of 2002 (MPRDA) was implemented on 1 May 2004 
(subsequently amended by the Minerals and Petroleum Resources 
Development Amendment Act 49 of 2008) effectively transferred 
custodianship of the previously privately held mineral rights to the State. 
A Prospecting Right is a right issued in terms of the MPRDA that is valid for 
up to five years, with the possibility of a further extension of three years. 
A Mining Right is a right issued in terms of the MPRDA and is valid for  
up to 30 years, with the possibility of a further extension of 30 years. The 
Minister of Mineral Resources will grant a renewal of the Mining Right if the 
terms and conditions of the Mining Right have been complied with and the 
applicant is not in contravention of any relevant provisions of the MPRDA.
In preparing the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource statement for  
South African assets, Anglo American plc has adopted the following 
reporting principles in respect of Prospecting Rights and Mining Rights:
 • Where applications for Mining Rights and Prospecting Rights have been 
submitted and these are still being processed by the relevant regulatory 
authorities, the relevant Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources have been 
included in the statement.
 • Where applications for Mining Rights and Prospecting Rights have been  
initially refused by the regulatory authorities, but are the subject of 
ongoing legal process and discussions with the relevant authorities  
and where Anglo American plc has reasonable expectations that the 
Prospecting Rights will be granted in due course, the relevant Mineral 
Resources have been included in the statement (any associated 
comments appear in the footnotes).

IRON ORE  
estimates as at 31 December 201 4
EXPLANATORY NOTES
Kolomela – Ore Reserves: The decrease is primarily due to production. Ore Reserves are reported above a cut-off of 42.0 %Fe inclusive of dilution.
Sishen – Ore Reserves: In addition to production, the decrease is due to an alignment of the Ore Reserve economic assumptions with budget parameters as well 
as a strategic redesign of the Sishen Mine waste pushback strategy in 2014 in order to achieve a lower cost (lower stripping ratio) Life of Mine Plan solution. A minor 
decrease in Ore Reserves due to the re-allocation of a portion of the conglomeratic ore body to Inferred Mineral Resource in accordance with the Kumba Iron Ore 
Mineral Resource Classification Guideline. Ore Reserves are reported above a cut-off of 40.0 %Fe inclusive of dilution. 
Thabazimbi – Ore Reserves: The decrease is primarily due to production. The Thabazimbi Mine is subject to a Life of Mine Plan review, which is currently ongoing. 
As a result, it was considered prudent to revert to the 2013 Ore Reserves (and Mineral Resources to retain alignment) in terms of public reporting. The 2014 Ore 
Reserve Statement for Thabazimbi Mine is therefore based on the 2013 Ore Reserves, depleted with the 2014 production. Ore Reserves are reported above a 
cut-off of 54.3 %Fe inclusive of dilution.
Kolomela – Mineral Resources: The increase is due to new information that results in the initial declaration of resources from Kapstevel South orebody and 
updated geological models for Leeuwfontein. Mineral Resources are reported above a cut-off of 50.0 %Fe.
Sishen – Mineral Resources: The increase is primarily due to incorporation of the previous ‘Stockpile’ material (Measured Resources: 7.3 Mt at 53.1 %Fe and 
Indicated Resources: 22.8 Mt at 50.8 %Fe) into the Mineral Resources as these are now considered as part of the modifying factors and therefore not reported 
separately. Mineral Resources are reported above a cut-off of 40.0 %Fe.
Thabazimbi – Mineral Resources: The increase is due to incorporation of the previous ‘Stockpile’ material into the Mineral Resources as these are now considered 
as part of the modifying factors and therefore not reported separately. The 2014 Resource Statement for Thabazimbi Mine is based on the 2013 Mineral Resources 
(aligned with the decision to revert back to the 2013 Ore Reserves), depleted with the 2014 production. Mineral Resources are reported above a cut-off of 55.0 %Fe.
Zandrivierspoort: The Zandrivierspoort Project Mineral Resources are reported above a cut-off of 21.7 %Fe. 
 
Mineral Tenure
Sishen: On 12 December 2013 the Constitutional Court (of South Africa) ruled that the Sishen Iron Ore Company (SIOC) had a 78.6% undivided share of the Sishen 
mining right. The Constitutional Court ruled further that, based on the provisions of the Mineral and Petroleum Resources Development Act (MPRDA), only SIOC 
can apply for and be granted the residual 21.4% undivided share of the Sishen Mining Right. The grant of the Mining Right may be made subject to such conditions 
considered by the Minister (of Mineral Resources) to be appropriate. SIOC has lodged applications to be granted the residual 21.4% undivided share of the Sishen 
Mining Right. Kumba Iron Ore is actively continuing its engagement with the South African Department of Mineral Resources (DMR) in order to finalise the grant of 
the residual right.
Based on the outcome of the Constitutional Court ruling, SIOC has a reasonable expectation for the grant of the 21.4% Mining Right and therefore declares 100% 
of the Sishen Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources in terms of the provisions of the SAMREC Code. SIOC derives 100% of the economic benefit of the material 
extracted from the Sishen Mine, and is not required to account to any other entity for the value thus derived. SIOC is mining lawfully in accordance with its approved 
Mine Works Programme. SIOC has submitted its applications to be granted the 21.4% Mining Right. At the time of reporting, the Mining Right had not yet been 
granted. In 2013, the attributable percentage was based on the Mining Rights held. For 2014, the attributable percentage is based on the full economic benefit 
to Sishen.
A Section 102 application to incorporate the old Transnet railway properties transecting the mining area from north to south was granted by the DMR on 28 February 
2014. This resulted in Probable Reserves being upgraded back to Proved Reserves. ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES

EXPLANATORY NOTES
Minas-Rio: Minas-Rio comprises the Serra do Sapo operation and the Itapanhoacanga project. Metallurgical test work confirms that the Compact Itabirite at Serra 
do Sapo is softer than Compact Itabirite mined in the Carajás and Iron Quadrangle areas. From 2014 onwards at Serra do Sapo, Compact Itabirite will be referred to 
as Itabirite and Semi-Compact Itabirite as Semi-Friable Itabirite.
Serra do Sapo – Ore Reserves: Ore Reserves are reported above a cut-off of 25.0 %Fe inclusive of dilution. ROM Tonnes and grades are on a dry basis. Saleable 
Product tonnes are on a wet basis (average moisture content is 8.0 wt% of the wet mass) with quality stated on a dry basis. The increase in Friable Itabirite and 
Hematite is due to new drilling information and updated economic assumptions. Itabirite Ore Reserves are declared and included in the mine plan for the first time 
due to metallurgical studies confirming the viability of processing this ore type and results in an increase in the Reserve Life. 
The Ore Reserves exclude 1.9Mt (at 37.9 %Fe) of material stockpiled during pre-stripping operations.
Serra do Sapo – Mineral Resources: Mineral Resources are reported above a cut-off of 25.0 %Fe. In-situ tonnes and grade are on a dry basis. 
Friable Itabirite and Hematite includes Friable Itabirite, Semi-Friable Itabirite, High Alumina Friable Itabirite, Soft Hematite and Canga.
The decrease in Itabirite Mineral Resources is primarily due to coversion of resources to reserves which is partially offset by new drilling information which indicates 
additional resources in the Central domain.
Itapanhoacanga: Mineral Resources are reported above a cut-off of 25.0 %Fe. In-situ tonnes and grade are on a dry basis.
Friable Itabirite and Hematite includes Friable Itabirite, Semi-Compact Itabirite, Soft Hematite and Hard Hematite
Serro: Mineral Resources are reported above a cut-off of 25.0 %Fe. In-situ tonnes and grade are on a dry basis.  
Friable Itabirite and Hematite includes Friable Itabirite, Semi-Compact Itabirite and Hard Hematite.

MINERAL RESOURCES INCLUDE ORE RESERVES. 
 
Mining method: OP = Open Pit, UG = Underground. Reserve Life = The scheduled extraction period in years for the total Ore Reserves in the approved Life of Mine Plan. 
The tonnage is quoted as dry metric tonnes. 
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Mineral Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Mineral Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated or 
Measured Resource after continued exploration. 
 
EXPLANATORY NOTES
GEMCO – Ore Reserves: The decrease is due to production. Ore Reserves are reported above a cut-off of 40%Mn with a minimum of 1m thickness. Manganese 
grades are given as per washed ore samples and should be read together with their respective yields.
Mamatwan – Ore Reserves: The decrease is primarily due to production as well as the use of a new block model. Ore Reserves for all zones are reported above 
a cut-off of 35.0 %Mn.
Wessels – Ore Reserves: The change is due to depletion from mining which is offset by the use of a new block model. Ore Reserves for the Lower Body-HG ore 
type are reported above a cut-off of 45.0 %Mn and Lower Body-LG and Upper Body ore types are reported above a cut-off of 37.5 %Mn.
GEMCO – Mineral Resources: New drilling information and the consequent updating of the resource model has allowed for the upgrading in resource confidence. 
A 40 %Mn washed product cut-off is used to define the Mineral Resource. 
The Premium Sands (PC-02) Project Mineral Resource estimates above a zero cut-off grade (Indicated: 12.8 Mt at 20.8 %Mn, Inferred: 2.3 Mt at 20.0 %Mn) are 
excluded from the table.
Mamatwan – Mineral Resources: The decrease is due to a new geological model being used which utilised implicit modelling techniques as well as a change in the 
estimation parameters. A cut-off grade of 35.0 %Mn is used to declare Mineral Resources within the M, C and N Zones as well as within the X Zone. The Top Cut 
Resources are declared above a cut-off of 28.0 %Mn.
Wessels – Mineral Resources: The decrease is due to a new geological model being used. A cut-off grade of 45.0 %Mn is used to declare Mineral Resources 
within the Lower Body-HG ore type and 37.5 %Mn in the Lower Body-LG and Upper Body ore types. ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES

COAL  
The Coal Reserve and Coal Resource estimates were compiled in accordance with the Australasian Code for Reporting of Exploration Results,  
Mineral Resources and Ore Reserves (The JORC Code, 2012) as a minimum standard as well as the South African Code for the Reporting of Exploration 
Results, Mineral Resources and Mineral Reserves (The SAMREC Code, 2007 Edition as amended July 2009) as applicable. The figures reported represent 
100% of the Coal Reserves and Coal Resources. Rounding of figures may cause computational discrepancies. Reserve Life is reported from 2014 onwards 
and is aligned with the current approved Life of Mine Plan.

Mining method: OC = Open Cast/Cut, UG = Underground. Reserve Life = The scheduled extraction period in years for the total Ore Reserves in the approved Life of Mine Plan. 
For the multi-product operations, the ROM tonnes apply to each product. 
The Saleable tonnes cannot be calculated directly from the ROM reserve tonnes using the air dried yields as presented since the difference in moisture content is not taken into account. 
Attributable percentages for country totals are weighted by Saleable tonnes and should not be directly applied to the ROM tonnes. Footnotes appear at the end of the section.

COAL  
estimates as at 31 December 201 4
(1)
  Coal Reserves are quoted on a Run Of Mine (ROM) reserve tonnes basis, which represents the tonnes delivered to the plant. Saleable reserve tonnes represents the estimated product tonnes.  
Coal Reserves (ROM and Saleable) are on the applicable moisture basis.
(2) 
ROM tonnes quoted on an As Delivered moisture basis, and Saleable tonnes on a Product moisture basis.
(3)  
Yield – ROM % represents the ratio of Saleable reserve tonnes to ROM reserve tonnes and is quoted on a constant moisture basis or on an air dried to air dried basis whereas Plant % is based on  
the ‘Feed to Plant’ tonnes. The product yields (ROM %) for Proved, Probable and Total are calculated by dividing the individual Saleable reserves by the total ROM reserves per classification.
(4)  
The coal quality for Coal Reserves is quoted as either kilo-calories per kilogram (kcal/kg) or Crucible Swell Number (CSN). Kilo-calories per kilogram represent Calorific Value (CV) on a Gross As 
Received (GAR) basis. Coal quality parameters for the Coal Reserves for Coking, Other Metallurgical and Export Thermal collieries meet the contractual specifications for coking coal, PCI, 
metallurgical coal, steam coal and domestic coal. Coal quality parameters for the Coal Reserves for Domestic Power and Domestic Synfuels collieries meet the specifications of the individual supply 
contracts in the short-term and studies are underway to ensure long-term compliance. CV is rounded to the nearest 10 kcal/kg.
(5)  
Coal Resources are quoted on a Mineable Tonnes In-Situ (MTIS) basis in million tonnes, which are in addition to those resources that have been modified to produce the reported Coal Reserves.  
Coal Resources are on an in-situ moisture basis.
(6)  
The coal quality for Coal Resources is quoted on an in-situ heat content as kilo-calories per kilogram (kcal/kg), representing Calorific Value (CV) rounded to the nearest 10 kcal/kg. 
(7) 
Inferred (in LOM Plan) refers to Inferred Coal Resources that are included in the life of mine extraction schedule of the respective collieries and are not reported as Coal Reserves. 
(8)  
Inferred (ex. LOM Plan) refers to Inferred Coal Resources outside the Life of Mine Plan but within the mine lease area. 
Metallurgical – Coking refers to a high-, medium- or low-volatile semi-soft, soft or hard coking coal primarily for blending and use in the steel industry; quality measured as Crucible Swell Number (CSN).
Metallurgical – Other refers to semi-soft, soft, hard, semi-hard or anthracite coal, other than Coking Coal, such as pulverized coal injection (PCI) or other general metallurgical coal for the export or 
domestic market with a wider range of properties than Coking Coal; quality measured by calorific value (CV). 
Thermal – Export refers to low- to high-volatile thermal coal primarily for export in the use of power generation; quality measured by calorific value (CV). 
Thermal – Domestic refers to low- to high-volatile thermal coal primarily for domestic consumption for power generation; quality measured by calorific value (CV). 
Synfuel refers to a coal specifically for the domestic production of synthetic fuel and chemicals; quality measured by calorific value (CV).
Capcoal comprises opencast operations at Lake Lindsay and Oak Park, an underground longwall operation at Grasstree and the Aquila Project each of which has a different JV structure. The attributable 
shareholding is determined annually on the proportion of the ROM and Saleable tonnes produced by the individual pits, and thus may vary from one year to the next due to differing production schedules.
Jellinbah is not reported as Anglo American’s shareholding is below the internal threshold for reporting. 
Peace River Coal consists of Trend and Roman Mountain mines. The Belcourt Saxon project is a Joint Venture between Peace River Coal and Walter Energy Inc.
 
Estimates for the following operations were updated by depletion (geological models not updated): Capcoal OC, Capcoal UG – Grasstree, Drayton and Trend.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
Australia – Operations:
Callide: Coal Reserves decrease primarily due to a reduction in the Boundary Hill South LOMP which is aligned to the most recent mining lease application 
(additional buffer zone around the homestead required). Proved Reserves have been downgraded to Probable due to contractual obligations (see note 6 to the 
financial statements for further details). Coal Resources decrease due to the rationalisation of upper and lower seam thicknesses, prevailing low commodity prices 
together with a change of mine design, offset by the removal of geological losses.
Dawson: Coal Reserves decrease due to prevailing low commodity price and a revision of the mine plan and mining methodology impacting on the Reserve Life. 
Coal Resources decrease due to a revised mine plan and a change of mining methodology as well as the impact of a revised resource shell based on a lower 
long-term commodity price forecast.
Drayton: Coal Reserves decrease due to production. The current Reserve Life is limited, pending the New South Wales Planning Assessment Commission’s (PAC) 
decision on revised mine plan to be submitted for the Drayton South project.
Foxleigh: Coal Reserves decrease primarily due to production. The current approved Life of Mine Plan includes material amounts of Inferred Resources and 
additional low confidence material.
Moranbah North: Proved Coal Reserves have been downgraded to Probable due to a revision of the resource classification to include seismic data. Coal 
Resources increase due to additional drilling information and the removal of geological loss.
Canada – Operations: (see note 6 to the financial statements for further details)
Trend:  Proved Coal Reserves have been downgraded to Probable due to the mine being placed on care and maintenance at the end of 2014.
Roman Mountain: Proved Coal Reserves have been downgraded to Probable due to the mine being placed on care and maintenance at the end of 2014. 
Colombia – Operations:
Cerrejón: Coal Reserves decrease due to production and revision of the LOM Plan.
South Africa – Operations:
Goedehoop: Coal Reserves decrease due to the reallocation of South Shaft (Seam 4) blocks to resources due to revised economic parameters. This was offset by 
the conversion of the Seam 1 blocks to Coal Reserves and optimisation of the layout. 
Kleinkopje: Coal Reserves decrease primarily due to production.
Kriel: Coal Reserves decrease due to the reallocation of Mini-pits 1 and 2 to resources as a result of delays in the Pre-Feasibility studies affecting the Reserve Life.
Landau: Coal Reserves decrease primarily due to production, seam thickness changes as a result of weathering along the sub-crop and adjustments to geological 
losses.
New Denmark: Coal Resources decrease due to the conversion of Inferred Resource from additional drilling information and the exclusion of panels in dyke 
affected areas. The Reserve Life is limited to 25 years as the current Mining Right expires in 2039.
Zibulo: Coal Reserves decrease primarily due to production and the reallocation to Coal Resources of low yielding blocks. 
Australia – Projects:
Grosvenor: Proved Coal Reserves have been downgraded to Probable due to a revision of the Resource classification to include seismic data. Coal Resources 
increase due to additional drilling and the removal of geological losses. 
Teviot Brook: Coal Resources increase due to the removal of geological losses. The Teviot Brook project area contains additional Coal Resources identified for 
extraction by the adjacent Moranbah North mine. 
South Africa – Projects:
South Rand: Coal Resources increase due to additional drilling information which resulted in classification upgrades.

COPPER  
estimates as at 31 December 201 4
EXPLANATORY NOTES
Copper Reserves: A minimum cut-off of 0.20% (TCu, ICu or ASCu) is applied to determine Ore Reserves on operations.
 Collahuasi – Oxide and Mixed: The increase is due to new economic assumptions in the mine plan for the Rosario Sur I and II areas.
 El Soldado – Sulphide (Flotation): The Ore Reserve estimates include mineralised void-fill material from the collapse of previously mined areas of approximately 
178kt Contained Metal (20.6Mt at 0.86 %TCu)
El Soldado – Oxide (Heap Leach): Production has exhausted the remaining Heap Leach material. 
Los Bronces – Sulphide (Dump Leach): The decrease is due to production and adjustment as a result of a modified cut-off grade strategy applied in the latest life 
of mine plan.
Mantos Blancos – Oxide (Vat and Heap Leach): The decrease is due to production, a modified design of Phase 17 and exclusion of phase 21 from the latest life of 
mine plan. The decrease is partially offset by drilling of the Mercedes Dump and application of new estimation parameters.
Mantos Blancos – Oxide (Dump Leach): The increase is due to a sonic drill campaign on the Mercedes Dump. The Dump Leach Reserves are comprised primarily 
of two major components, Mercedes Dump and Este Dump, split as follows:
Este Dump – Probable: 7kt Contained Metal (3.6 Mt at 0.20 %ASCu).
Mercedes Dump – Proved: 1kt Contained Metal (0.6 Mt at 0.17 %ASCu), Probable: 58kt Contained Metal (29.0 Mt at 0.20 %ASCu).
Mantoverde – Oxide (Dump Leach): The increase is due to the application of new mine designs for Celso, Kuroki and Montecristo pits along with lower cut-off 
grades.
Mineral Tenure:
Los Bronces: As per the latest Life of Mine Plan, the development of the Los Bronces Open Pit will require a modification to the Environmental Permits (EIA 
Process) as of 2030. This in accordance with the current limits approved in the EIA-LBDP 2007 (RCA N° 3159).

EXPLANATORY NOTES
Copper Resources: A test of reasonable eventual economic extraction is applied through consideration of an optimised pit shell. Materials outside the optimised 
shell that have potential of eventual economic extraction via underground means are not included in the Mineral Resource statement. Mineral Resources are quoted 
above variable cut-off grades not lower than 0.2 %TCu.
Los Bronces – Sulphide (Flotation) and Sulphide (Dump Leach): The overall decrease is due to updated economic assumptions leading to conversion of 
resources to reserves and new drilling information. 
Mantos Blancos – Oxide (Dump Leach): The decrease is due to due to removal of material for which metallurgical test work is outstanding. The Dump Leach 
Resources are comprised primarily of two major components, Mercedes Dump and Este Dump, split as follows:
Este Dump – Inferred: 54kt Contained Metal (30.2 Mt at 0.18 %ASCu).
Mercedes Dump – Measured: 2kt Contained Metal (1.0 Mt at 0.18 %ASCu), Indicated: 17kt Contained Metal (10.0 Mt at 0.17 %ASCu), Inferred : 72kt Contained 
Metal (38.6 Mt at 0.19 %ASCu).
Mantoverde – Oxide (Heap Leach): The increase is due to new drilling information at Rebosadero, Quisco and Montecristo areas and the transfer of oxide material 
from the Mantoverde Development Project to the Mantoverde operation as a result of a change in the pit design.
Mantoverde – Oxide (Dump Leach): The increase is due to changes in economic assumptions (lower cut-off grade applied). ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES

EXPLANATORY NOTES
Quellaveco – Ore Reserves: A minimum cut-off of 0.30 %TCu is applied to determine Ore Reserves. The increase is due to a new mine plan which incorporates 
increase plant throughput and a new cut-off grade.
Quellaveco – Mineral Resources: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.3 %TCu cut-off within an optimised pit shell. The decrease is due to a conversion of 
resources to reserves in a new mine plan.
Mantoverde Development Project – Sulphide (Flotation): Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.35 %TCu cut-off.  
Mantoverde Development Project – Oxide (Flotation): Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.1 %ASCu (Dump Leach) or 0.2 %ASCu (Heap Leach) and less 
than 20 %CaCO 3 cut-off. The increase is due to declaration of resources in new areas mainly in the Mantoverde Fault area with additional resources in the 
Mantoruso, Quisco and Celso areas. 
West Wall: Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.3 %TCu cut-off within an optimised pit shell.
Los Bronces Sur (San Enrique Monolito): To align with the location of the deposit within the Los Bronces mining district, San Enrique Monolito will be referred to 
as Los Bronces Sur going forward. The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an underground operation.
Los Bronces Underground (Los Sulfatos): To align with the location of the deposit within the Los Bronces mining district, Los Sulfatos will be referred to as Los 
Bronces Underground going forward. The reported resources include mineralisation inside a 1% nominal copper grade cut-off envelope down to the current 
drillhole depths of 1,000 metres below surface. The test for reasonable prospects of eventual economic extraction is based on an underground operation.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
Barro Alto – Ore Reserves: The decrease is due to increased haulage costs resulting in reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources. This is partially  
offset by a change in the modelling method of dilution. The Ore Reserves are derived from a mine plan which targets a smelter feed with an iron grade below  
19 %Fe and a SiO
2
/MgO ratio less than or equal to 1.80. 
Niquelândia – Ore Reserves: The increase is primarily due to changes in economic assumptions which enables conversion of resources to reserves. The  
Ore Reserves are derived from a mine plan which targets a smelter feed with an iron grade below 19 %Fe and a SiO
2
/MgO ratio less than or equal to 1.75. 
Niquelândia Mine is adjacent to the Codemin Ferro-Nickel smelter which is fed with ore from Barro Alto and is blended with Niquelândia ore to achieve an 
appropriate smelter feed chemistry.
Barro Alto – Saprolite Mineral Resources: The decrease is due to new information enabling improved resource classification of material close to the basal 
contact of the orebody which offsets the reallocation from Ore Reserves. Transfer of material to a Low-MgO Stockpile also contributes to the decrease. 
The Low-MgO material (Measured: 7.2 Mt at 1.59 %Ni, excluded from the table) is used for blending when the appropriate smelter feed chemistry can be achieved. 
Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.9 %Ni cut-off. 
Barro Alto – Ferruginous Laterite Mineral Resources: Material that is scheduled for stockpiling or has already been mined and stockpiled. 
A surface stockpile of 0.8 Mt at 1.36 %Ni (Measured) is excluded from the table.
Niquelândia – Mineral Resources: The decrease is due to conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves. 
Mineral Resources are quoted above a 0.9 %Ni cut-off. 
Jacaré: The Mineral Resources are reported within a pit shell developed for the Concept Study with a cut-off of 1.3 %Ni. A minimum mineralised width of 1m must 
be present to allow material to be categorised as higher-grade Saprolite Mineral Resource. The Saprolite Resources are a combination of higher-grade Mineral 
Resources (> 1.3 %Ni) that are expected to feed a pyrometallurgical treatment facility and lower-grade Mineral Resources (1.3 – 0.9 %Ni) that could be used to 
neutralise the acid in the proposed hydrometallurgical treatment of the Ferruginous Laterite material while still recovering Nickel in the process. The Plano de 
Aproveitamento Economico (PAE) is under consideration by Brazil’s Departamento Nacional de Produção Mineral (DNPM).  ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES

Boa Vista – Oxide Ore Reserves (OP): The remaining Oxide Ore Reserves will be extracted as part of the combined Oxide and Fresh Rock mine plan.
Phosphate Tailings Ore Reserves: The fines portion of the Phosphate tailings from Chapadão are processed in the Niobium Tailings Plant to recover Niobium. 
The increase is a result of optimisation of the Boa Vista Fresh Rock pit design enabling the tailings plant to continue operating once the Oxide Reserves are depleted.
Boa Vista – Oxide Mineral Resources (OP): The decrease is due to conversion of Mineral Resource to Ore Reserves as a result of the increased size of the Fresh 
Rock pit. The Oxide Mineral Resources are reported above a 0.5 %Nb

the basis for reasonable prospect for eventual economic extraction of this material. The decrease is due to a change in the planned pit slope angle which reduces the 
volume of the Resource Shell. A new block model has been completed but the underground design study demonstrating the viability of the extension to the orebody 
has not been completed yet. No Mineral Resource estimates are therefore declared using an underground mining method as the basis for reasonable prospects for 
eventual economic extraction.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef: The pay limits built into the basic mining equation are directly linked to the 2015 Business plan. The pay limit is based on ‘Cost 4’ 
which consists of ‘Direct Cash Cost’ (on and off mine), ‘Other Indirect Costs’ and ‘Stay in Business Capital’ (on and off mine). The Ore Reserve pay-limit varies across 
all operations between 2.1g/t and 5.3g/t (4E PGE). The range is a function of various factors including depth of the orebody, geological complexity, mining method, 
infrastructure and economic parameters. 
Merensky Reef: The global Ore Reserve 4E ounce content and tonnage increased due to conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore Reserves mainly at Bokoni, 
BRPM and Thembelani mines. These increases were partially offset by the decrease in Ore Reserves mainly from Tumela Mine where Ore Reserves have been 
reallocated to Mineral Resources.
UG2 Reef: The primary contribution to the overall decrease is production. Additionally the global Ore Reserve 4E content decreased but the tonnage increased 
largely due to the reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources mainly at Dishaba, Tumela and Modikwa mines. Adjusted modifying factors applied to AAPL 
managed mines resulted in a tonnage increase and a grade decrease. These decreases were partially offset by the conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore 
Reserves mainly at Siphumelele 3 (managed by Aquarius Platinum Ltd), Mototolo and Thembelani mines. 
Platreef: The pay limit is 2.3 g/t 4E for the mining operations and varies between 1.0g/t and 1.7 g/t 4E for the stockpiles.  
The Ore Reserves 4E content and tonnage decreased as a result of a change in the detailed ramp designs associated with Cut 18 during planning optimisation which 
resulted in reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral Resources. The change in the design only affects the southern portion of the Mogalakwena pit. The anticipated 
Life of Mine Plan exceeds the current Mining Right expiry date.
Platreef Primary stockpile: Mined ore retained for future treatment and reported separately as Proved Reserves but included in the Total Platreef Ore Reserves. 
All Reefs – Alternative units: Tonnage in million short tons (Mton) and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton (oz/ton) for 2014 is: 
Total: 2,274.0 Mton (2013: 2,331.7 Mton) at 0.088 oz/ton (2013: 0.089 oz/ton).
Tailings: Operating tailings dams are not reported as part of the published Ore Reserves. At Rustenburg mines dormant dams have been evaluated and are 
separately reported as Probable Ore Reserves. The treatment of tailings is sensitive to both price and volume therefore resulting in tailings dam material being 
reported as Probable Reserves only.
Main Sulphide Zone: The Ore Reserve tonnage and 4E content decreased mainly due to changes in the modifying factors as well as production. Anglo American 
Platinum Limited currently reports an effective 100% interest in Unki Mine, subject to the finalisation of the indigenisation agreement.
Main Sulphide Zone – Alternative units: Tonnage in million short tons (Mton) and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton (oz/ton) for 2014 is: 
Total: 54.5 Mton (2013: 55.8 Mton) at 0.103 oz/ton (2013: 0.108 oz/ton). ORE RESERVES AND MINERAL RESOURCES

EXPLANATORY NOTES
Merensky Reef and UG2 Reef: The Mineral Resources are estimated over a practical minimum mining width suitable for the deposit known as the ‘Resource Cut’. 
The ‘Resource Cut’ width takes cognisance of the mining method and geotechnical aspects in the hanging wall or footwall of the reef.
Merensky Reef: The Mineral Resource 4E content decreased but the tonnage increased mainly due to an improved resource evaluation methodology applied to 
the Tumela Pothole Reef facies, partially offset by the Mineral Resources content and tonnage increase at Union, Rustenburg and Dishaba mines due to lower 
geological losses applied. 
UG2 Reef: The Mineral Resource 4E content and tonnage increased mainly at Union, Dishaba and Bokoni mines due to lower geological losses applied. A decrease 
of Mineral Resources occurred due to the disposal of Driekop, a reconciliation adjustment at Kroondal and Marikana and conversion of Mineral Resources to Ore 
Reserves at Mototolo. 
Platreef: A 1.0g/t 4E cut-off is used to define Platreef Mineral Resources. The Mineral Resources increased due to reallocation of Ore Reserves to Mineral 
Resources mainly as a result of changes in the detailed ramp designs associated with Cut 18. 
All Reefs – Alternative units: Tonnage in million short tons (Mton) and associated grade in troy ounces per short ton (oz/ton) for 2014 is: 
Measured and Indicated: 3,178.7 Mton (2013: 3,085.2 Mton) at 0.125 oz/ton (2013: 0.125 oz/ton).
Total Inferred: 2,564.8 Mton (2013: 2,586.2 Mton) at 0.102 oz/ton (2013: 0.103 oz/ton).
Tailings: Operating tailings dams are not reported as part of the Mineral Resources. At Rustenburg, Amandelbult and Union mines dormant tailings dams have been 
evaluated and are separately reported as Tailings Mineral Resources.

Mining method: OP = Open Pit, UG = Underground. 
LOM = Life of Mine (years) is based on scheduled Probable Reserves including Indicated and some Inferred Resources considered for Life of Mine planning. 
Reported Diamond Reserves/Resources are based on a Bottom Cut Off (BCO) which refers to the bottom screen size aperture and varies between 0.80mm and 3.00mm (nominal square mesh).  
Unless stated otherwise tonnage is quoted as dry metric tonnes. Estimates of Diamond Reserve tonnes reflect the tonnage to be treated.

 Anglo American plc  Annual Report 2014 195
Ore Reserves and Mineral Resources
EXPLANATORY NOTES
Snap Lake: The decrease in Diamond Reserve estimates is primarily due to production and a revision of the Diamond Resource estimates. Indicated Resource 
estimates are continuously generated from information gained from underground footwall drilling ahead of the mining face, resulting in a rolling Probable Reserve. 
Longer-term Diamond Reserve development is considered impractical due to technical and cost considerations. Estimates are based on both micro-diamonds  
and macro-diamonds.
Victor: The decrease is primarily due to production. The Stockpile Probable Reserves at a 1.50mm BCO of 0.03 M¢ (0.25 Mt at 13.5 cpht) are excluded  
from the table. The inclusive Stockpile Resource estimates (including run of mine) at a 1.50 mm BCO of 0.03 M¢ (0.24 Mt at 13.9 cpht) Indicated and  
0.01 M¢ (0.04 Mt at 30.8 cpht) Inferred Resource are excluded from the table. The geographically separate Tango Extension Inferred Resource estimates  
of 4.3 M¢ (22.0 Mt at 19.6 cpht, BCO 1.50mm) are no longer reported as part of the Victor resource. The increase in Tango Extension is due to the inclusion  
of two additional geological units.
Gahcho Kué: The increase in saleable carats is due to the addition of Indicated Resources in the 5034 NE Pipe in combination with a revision of the LOM Plan. 
The estimates for 5034 NE and Tuzo are based on both micro-diamonds and macro-diamonds. During 2014 the Land Use Permit and Water Licence were issued. 
The project has been approved for implementation by Anglo American. The project is expected to treat approximately 35 Mt of ore containing an estimated 54 M¢ 
(100% basis). Scheduled Inferred Resources (1.2 Mt) constitute 2.6% (1.4 M¢) of the estimated carats. The estimates are scheduled tonnes and carats as per the 
2014 Life of Mine Plan.

EXPLANATORY NOTES
Venetia: The LOM is stated as 30 years which reflects the full duration of the current Venetia consolidated OP and UG Life of Mine Plan. The current Mining Right 
expires in 2038; Venetia Mine will apply to extend the Mining Right at the appropriate time in the future.
Venetia (OP): The Life of Mine plan includes the K01, K02 and K03 pipes. The K01 estimates are based on both micro-diamonds and macro-diamonds. The 
planned production for 2015 includes a significant portion of Inferred Resources. The inclusive Old Recovery Tailings Resource estimates at a 0.80 mm BCO of 
1.8 M¢ (0.05 Mt at 3804.4 cpht) Inferred Resource are excluded from the table.
Venetia (UG): The Diamond Reserves increased due to an updated underground mine plan. The project is expected to treat approximately 133 Mt of ore containing 
an estimated 94 M¢. Scheduled Inferred Resources (37.7 Mt) constitute 24% (22.2 M¢) of the estimated carats. The estimates are scheduled tonnes and carats as 
per the 2014 Life of Mine Plan.
Namaqualand: The sale of Namaqualand Mines (excluding the Buffels Marine mining right) to Emerald Panther Investments (PTY) Limited was concluded in 2014. 
The remaining Diamond Resource estimates reflects the tonnes and carats associated with the Buffels Marine mining right.
Voorspoed: The change is due to production and refinement of the geological model. Indicated Resources are reported to a depth of 200mbgl. This has allowed for 
Probable Reserve estimates to be reported.
Kimberley Mines: The decrease in the Diamond Resource estimates is due to production and model refinement. Kimberley Mines Central Treatment Plant (CTP) 
was initially established to treat ore from both Tailings Resources and underground mines. Subsequent to the conclusion of the sale of the underground operations 
to Petra Diamonds in May 2010, only Tailings Resources are being treated. The inclusive Stockpile estimates at a 1.15mm BCO of 0.04M¢ (0.35 Mt at 1 1.3 cpht) 
Inferred Resource are excluded from the table.
EXCLUSIVE DIAMOND RESOURCES
Venetia (OP): 1.00 mm BCO – Indicated: 0.6 M¢ (0.5 Mt at 122.7 cpht); Inferred: 4.8 M¢ (26.5 Mt at 18.1 cpht).

EXPLANATORY NOTES
Damtshaa: The increase in saleable carats is due to the application of revised plant recovery factors. Higher grade Inferred Resources from the BK/12 Kimberlite 
are mined for the first three years before including Probable Reserves from BK/9. The BK/9 and BK/12 inclusive Stockpile Inferred Resource estimates at a 
1.65mm BCO of 0.1 M¢ (1.6 Mt at 8.1 cpht) are excluded from the table.
Jwaneng – Kimberlite: The decrease due to production was largely offset by the increase associated with upgrading of Old Recovery Tailings to Inferred Resource 
status. The 2014 Life of Mine Plan includes the Cut 8 estimates of 91 Mt of ore to be treated containing an estimated 1 10 M¢ (North, Centre and South pipes 
excluding the 4th pipe which is mined as part of waste stripping and stockpiled). Scheduled Inferred Resources (below 401m) included in Cut 8 estimates (68.1 Mt) 
constitute 81% (89.3 M¢) of the estimated carats. The last three years of LOM includes treatment of Kimberlite stockpiles. The Stockpile Probable Reserves at a 
1.47mm BCO of 0.9 M¢ (1.4 Mt at 62.2 cpht) are excluded from the table. The DK/2 inclusive Stockpile estimates at a 1.47mm BCO, consisting of 0.9 M¢ (1.4 Mt at 
62.2 cpht) Indicated Resources and 4.8 M¢ (1 1.3 Mt at 42.7 cpht) Inferred Resources are excluded from the table. 
Jwaneng – TMR: Old Recovery Tailings estimates at a 1.00 mm BCO of 10.2 M¢ (0.1 Mt at 9,500 cpht) Inferred Resource are excluded from the table.
Letlhakane – Kimberlite: The decrease is due to production. DK/1 and DK/2 inclusive Stockpile estimates at a 1.65mm BCO of 0.6 M¢ (3.6 Mt at 17.8 cpht) 
Inferred Resources are excluded from the table. 
Letlhakane – TMR: The decrease in saleable carats is primarily due to a downward adjustment of the TMR plant recovery factor. The project is expected to treat 
approximately 83 Mt of ore containing an estimated 21 M¢. Scheduled Inferred Resources (48.5 Mt) constitute 60% (12.8 M¢) of the estimated carats. 
The estimates are scheduled tonnes and carats as per the 2014 Life of Mine Plan.
Orapa: A total of 91 M¢ is added to the Diamond Resource estimates by the inclusion of new information resulting in new grade estimates in the South Pipe model. 
This is associated with a material increase in the Diamond Reserve. These increases are partially offset by production. The Orapa (AK1 South Pipe) estimates are 
based on both micro-diamonds and macro-diamonds. The AK/1 Stockpile estimates at a 1.65mm BCO of 7.7 M¢ (17.4 Mt at 44.1 cpht) Inferred Resources are 
excluded from the table. The Tailings Resource estimates at a 1.47mm BCO of 88.3 M¢ (151.7 Mt at 58.2 cpht) Inferred Resource are excluded from the table; 
Large Diameter Auger Drilling at a wide spacing took place in 2014.

DIAMOND RESOURCES INCLUDE DIAMOND RESERVES.
 
Mining method: OC = Open Cast, MM = Marine Mining.  
LOM = Life of Mine (years) is based on scheduled Probable Reserves including Indicated and some Inferred Resources considered for Life of Mine planning. 
Reported Diamond Reserves/Resources are based on a Bottom Cut Off (BCO) which refers to the bottom screen size aperture and varies between 0.80mm and 3.00mm (nominal square mesh). 
Unless stated otherwise tonnage is quoted as dry metric tonnes. Estimates of Diamond Reserve tonnes reflect the tonnage to be treated. 
Recovered Grade is quoted as carats per hundred metric tonnes (cpht) or as carats per square meter (cpm²). k m² = thousand square metres. 
 
Due to the uncertainty that may be attached to some Inferred Diamond Resources, it cannot be assumed that all or part of an Inferred Diamond Resource will necessarily be upgraded to an Indicated  
or Measured Resource after continued exploration.
Namdeb Land consists of Elizabeth Bay, Mining Area 1 and Orange River. 
Orange River consist of the Auchas, Daberas, Obib and Sendelingsdrif operations. 
Namdeb Marine consists of Atlantic 1.
EXPLANATORY NOTES
Elizabeth Bay: The decrease in saleable carats is primarily due to production and changes in economic assumptions mainly impacting Inferred Resources.
Mining Area 1: The increase in saleable carats is primarily due to new information in the Ultra Shallow Water A zone (0–7m) at substantially higher grade. 
The increased Life of Mine includes a material portion of scheduled tonnes with low geoscientific confidence, planned to be upgraded to Inferred Resources on 
a continuous two-year rolling basis. Incremental Inferred Resource development is dependent on beach accretion for drilling and sampling. Beach accretion is a 
process through which an existing beach is built seaward to extend into areas previously under water. The accretion is accomplished by sand build-up derived from 
current mining and dredging activities. The inclusive Overburden Stockpile estimates at a 2.00mm BCO of 34 k¢ (9,227 kt at 0.37 cpht) Inferred Resource, the DMS 
and Recovery Tailings Resource estimates at a 2.00mm BCO of 679 k¢ (52,987 kt at 1.28 cpht) Inferred Resource are excluded from the table.
Orange River: The decrease is primarily due to production. The mining transition from Daberas to Sendelingsdrif will be completed within the next three years.
Atlantic 1: The decrease in reserve carats is primarily due to a planning methodology change. The Life of Mine remains the same and includes a material portion of 
Inferred Resources. Previously all Indicated Resources were used to declare the Diamond Reserve, whereas now only scheduled Indicated Resources in the Life of 
Mine are converted. This reduction in Diamond Reserve carats is partially offset by new information allowing conversion of additional Diamond Resources to 
Diamond Reserves and a faster mining rate which allows a lowering of the cut-off grade. Due to the high costs associated with resource development, Indicated 
Resources are converted to Diamond Reserves on an annual basis to ensure scheduled reserves are available two years ahead of current mining.
Bogenfels: The increase in carats is due to application of a different estimation methodology.
Bottom screen cut off details for Inferred Resource estimates are as follows: 
1.40 mm BCO: 524 k¢ (7,913 kt at 6.62 cpht). 
2.00 mm BCO: 228 k¢ (3,042 kt at 7.50 cpht).
Midwater: The Midwater Resource comprises the offshore portion of the Diamond Area No. 1 (DA1) Mining Licences 43, 44 and 45, as well as the offshore licences 
ML 128A, B and C, at water depths greater than 30m. Midwater is not part of current operations or a project.
The Aeolian, Fluvial and Marine inclusive Diamond Resource estimates at a 2.00mm BCO, consisting of 492 k¢ (2,533 k m² at 0.19 cpm²) Indicated Resources and 
930 k¢ (12,720 k m² at 0.07 cpm²) are excluded from the table.

Audits related to the generation of the Ore Reserve and Mineral Resource estimates were carried out by independent consultants during 2014 at Atlantic 1. 202 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
Throughout this report a number of financial and non-financial measures  
are used to assess the Group’s performance. The measures are defined  
as follows:
Underlying EBIT
Underlying EBIT is operating profit presented before special items and 
remeasurements and includes the Group’s attributable share of associates’ 
and joint ventures’ underlying EBIT. Underlying EBIT of associates and joint 
ventures is the Group’s attributable share of associates’ and joint ventures’ 
revenue less operating costs before special items and remeasurements of 
associates and joint ventures. See notes 3 and 5 to the financial statements 
for underlying EBIT.
Underlying earnings
Underlying earnings is an alternative earnings measure, which the directors 
consider to be a useful additional measure of the Group’s performance. 
Underlying earnings is profit for the financial year attributable to equity 
shareholders of the Company before special items and remeasurements  
and is therefore presented after net finance costs, income tax expense and 
non-controlling interests. See note 9 to the financial statements for the basis 
of calculation of underlying earnings. See note 6 to the financial statements 
for the definition of special items and remeasurements.
Net debt
Net debt includes related hedges and net debt in disposal groups.  
See note 23 to the financial statements.
Capital expenditure
Capital expenditure is defined as cash expenditure on property, plant  
and equipment, including related derivatives, and is now presented net of 
proceeds from disposal of property, plant and equipment and includes  
direct funding for capital expenditure from non-controlling interests in order 
to match more closely the way in which it is managed. Comparatives have 
been re-presented to align with current year presentation.
Underlying EBITDA
Underlying EBITDA is underlying EBIT before depreciation and amortisation 
in subsidiaries and joint operations and includes the Group’s attributable 
share of associates’ and joint ventures’ underlying EBIT before depreciation 
and amortisation. EBITDA, as presented in the net debt table on page 20 of 
this report excludes the Group’s attributable share of associates’ and joint 
ventures’ EBITDA.
Real cash costs
Real cash costs are the annual increase/decrease in the Group’s  
operating cash costs versus the prior year, excluding depreciation, the 
impact of Consumer Price Inflation (CPI) and foreign exchange, and is  
after capitalisation of stripping costs.
Copper equivalent production
Copper equivalent production, expressed as copper equivalent tonnes,  
is a metric used to show changes in underlying production volume. Each 
commodity’s volumes are expressed as revenue, and then converted  
into a copper equivalent volume by dividing revenue by copper price  
(per tonne). The prices used for conversion by Anglo American are those  
from 30 June 2013. When aggregated, these give the Group’s production 
expressed in units of copper equivalent. Production volumes considered 
include both equity and purchased volumes (e.g. platinum concentrate from 
joint operation partners), as well as volumes from mines in pre-commercial 
production. Thabazimbi (iron ore) and domestic thermal coal production  
is excluded.
Copper equivalent unit costs
Copper equivalent unit costs divide the gross costs associated with unit  
costs, by relevant copper equivalent volume. Only own equity volumes  
(and costs) are considered. Thabazimbi (iron ore) and domestic thermal  
coal production is excluded, as are operations not in commercial production. 
Both the copper equivalent production and copper equivalent unit cost 
metrics have been adjusted for the 532 koz of platinum production lost due  
to the strikes at Platinum operations.
Fatal-injury frequency rate (FIFR)
FIFR is the number of employee or contractor fatal injuries due to all causes 
per 200,000 hours worked.
Lost time injury frequency rate (LTIFR)
LTIFR is the number of lost time injuries (LTIs) for both employees and 
contractors per 200,000 hours worked. An LTI is a work related injury 
resulting in the person being unable to attend work or perform the routine 
functions of his/her job, on the next calendar day after the day of the injury, 
whether a scheduled workday or not. Restricted work cases are therefore 
counted as LTIs.
Total recordable case frequency rate (TRCFR)
TRCFR is the number of fatal injuries, lost time injuries and medical treatment 
cases for both employees and contractors per 200,000 hours.
New cases of occupational disease (NCOD)
NCOD is the sum of occupational diseases due to asbestosis, noise-induced 
hearing loss, silicosis, coal-workers’ pneumoconiosis, chronic obstructive 
airways disease, occupational tuberculosis, occupational asthma, hand/arm 
vibration syndrome, musculoskeletal disorders, dermatitis, occupational 
cancers and other occupational diseases.
Total energy consumed
Total amount of energy consumed is the sum of total energy from  
electricity purchased, total energy from fossil fuels and total energy  
from renewable fuels and is measured in million gigajoules (GJ). 
Total new water consumed
Total amount of water used is the total new or make-up water entering the 
operation and used for the operation’s primary operational activities and is 
measured in million m

OTHER INFORMATION PERFORMANCE MEASURES
Attributable return on capital employed (ROCE)
Attributable ROCE definitions:
 • ROCE is a ratio that measures the efficiency and profitability of a company’s capital investments. It displays how effectively assets are generating profit for 
the size of invested capital and is calculated as underlying EBIT divided by capital employed.
 • Adjusted ROCE is calculated as underlying EBIT divided by adjusted capital employed. Adjusted capital employed is net assets excluding net debt and 
financial asset investments, adjusted for remeasurements of a previously held equity interest as a result of business combinations and impairments incurred 
in the current year and reported since 10 December 2013. Earnings and return impacts from such impairments (due to reduced depreciation or amortisation 
expense) are not taken into account.
 • Attributable ROCE is the return on the adjusted capital employed attributable to equity shareholders of Anglo American plc, and therefore excludes the portion 
of underlying EBIT and capital employed attributable to non-controlling interests in operations where Anglo American plc has control but does not hold 100% 
of the equity. Joint ventures, joint operations and associates are included in their proportionate interest and in line with appropriate accounting treatment.
 • Attributable ROCE is based on realised prices and foreign exchange rates, and includes the below adjustments to capital employed.
Adjustments
 • Structural adjustments for the De Beers acquisition assuming ownership of 85% of De Beers for 1 January 2012 and disposals from Anglo American Sur 
assuming ownership of 50.1% from the start of 2012 have been included
 • The De Beers fair value uplift which resulted from the revaluing upward of Anglo American plc’s pre-existing 45% share in De Beers is removed from 
opening 2012 capital employed onwards
 • Impairments announced after 10 December 2013 are not removed from total capital employed. Earnings and return impacts from such impairments (due to 
reduced depreciation or amortisation expense) are not taken into account
 • The impairments and disposals which will be removed from opening capital employed from 2012 and onwards, on a post-tax basis, are:
– Pebble loss on exit
– Michiquillay impairment
– Barro Alto furnace write-down consequent on the rebuild of both furnaces (not the impairment)
– Khomanani, Khuseleka 2 and Union Mine North declines, plus 2012 Platinum project asset scrappings
– Isibonelo and Kleinkopje impairments.
The 2014 attributable EBIT of $3,429 million is the underlying EBIT attributable to equity shareholders of Anglo American plc.

Details of borrowings and facilities are set out in note 24 and net debt is set 
out in note 23.
The directors have considered the Group’s cash flow forecasts for the  
period to the end of March 2016. The Board is satisfied that the Group’s 
forecasts and projections, taking account of reasonably possible changes  
in trading performance, show that the Group will be able to operate within  
the level of its current facilities for the foreseeable future. For this reason  
the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its  
financial statements.
Dividends
An interim dividend of 32 US cents per ordinary share was paid on  
18 September 2014. The directors are recommending that a final dividend  
of 53 US cents per ordinary share be paid on 28 April 2015 to ordinary 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 20 March 2015, 
subject to shareholder approval at the AGM to be held on 23 April 2015.  
This would bring the total dividend in respect of 2014 to 85 US cents per 
ordinary share. In accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRS), the final dividend will be accounted for in the financial 
statements for the year ended 31 December 2015.
Share capital
The Company’s issued share capital as at 31 December 2014, together  
with details of share allotments and issue of treasury shares during the year,

retraining for, any employees in the workforce who become disabled during 
their employment. Where possible we will adjust a person’s working 
environment to enable them to stay in our employment.
Further, the Group is committed to treating employees at all levels with 
respect and consideration, to investing in their development and to ensuring 
that their careers are not constrained by discrimination or arbitrary barriers.
The Good Citizenship Business Principles are supplemented by four Anglo 
American ‘Way’ documents, covering the safety, environmental, occupational 
health and social aspects of responsible operation and sustainable 
development. These set out specific standards for each of these subject 
areas, in line with international best practice. 
Copies of the Good Citizenship Business Principles and the Anglo American 
‘Way’ documents may be accessed on the Company’s website.
In addition, all Anglo American suppliers must commit to adhering to the 
requirements set out in the ‘Sustainable Development in Supply Chain Policy’, 
which is available on the Company’s website.
The Business Integrity Policy and its 11 Performance Standards support our 
anti-corruption commitment by making it clear that we will neither give, nor 
accept, bribes, nor permit others to do so in our name, either in our dealings 
with public officials or with our suppliers and customers. The Policy sets out 
the standards of conduct required at every level of Anglo American, including 
our subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates, in combating corrupt 
behaviour of all types. It also sets out the requirements of those with whom 
we  do business and those who work on our behalf.
The Business Integrity Policy and Performance Standards have been 
translated into all the main languages that we use at our operations. Two 
dedicated business integrity managers, who operate within a broader risk 
management and business assurance team, oversee implementation of the 
policy by working with senior managers in our business units and corporate 
functions and assisting them to put in place adequate procedures for 
managing corruption risks (including extensive face-to-face training of 
employees in high-risk roles).
Our internal audit team provide assurance on anti-corruption controls on an 
annual basis and all stakeholders are able to confidentially report breaches, 
or potential breaches, of the Business Integrity Policy through our 
independently-managed Speak Up facility.
The Group has a social intranet called Eureka! which helps employees 
to connect, communicate and collaborate more effectively. In addition, the 
Company regularly publishes Optima (available on the Company’s website) 
and Our World, which contain items of news, current affairs and information 
relevant to Group employees.
Political donations
No political donations were made during 2014. Anglo American has an 
established policy of not making donations to, or incurring expenses for the 
benefit of, any political party in any part of the world, including any political 
party or political organisation as defined in the Political Parties, Elections and 
Referendums Act 2000.
Additional information for shareholders
Set out below is a summary of certain provisions of the Company’s current 
Articles and applicable English law concerning companies (the Companies 
Act 2006 (the ‘Companies Act’)) required as a result of the implementation of 
the Takeovers Directive in English law. This is a summary only and the relevant 
provisions of the Articles or the Companies Act should be consulted if further 
information is required.
Dividends and distributions
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company may, by 
ordinary resolution, from time to time declare dividends not exceeding the 
amount recommended by the Board. The Board may pay interim dividends 
whenever the financial position of the Company, in the opinion of the Board, 
justifies such payment.
The Board may withhold payment of all, or any part of any dividends or other 
monies payable in respect of the Company’s shares, from a person with a 
0.25% interest or more (as defined in the Articles) if such a person has been 
served with a notice after failing to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Act.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares
The rights and obligations attaching to the ordinary and preference shares 
are set out in the Articles. The Articles may only be changed by a special 
resolution passed by the shareholders.
Voting
Subject to the Articles generally and to any special rights or restrictions as to 
voting attached by or in accordance with the Articles to any class of shares, on 
a show of hands every member who is present in person at a general meeting 
shall have one vote and, on a poll, every member who is present in person or 
by proxy shall have one vote for every share of which he/she is the holder. It is, 
and has been for some years, the Company’s practice to hold a poll on every 
resolution at shareholder meetings.
Where shares are held by trustees/nominees in respect of the Group’s 
employee share plans and the voting rights attached to such shares are not 
directly exercisable by the employees, it is the Company’s practice that such 
rights are not exercised by the relevant trustee/nominee.
Under the Companies Act, members are entitled to appoint a proxy, who need 
not be a member of the Company, to exercise all or any of their rights to attend 
and to speak and vote on their behalf at a general meeting or class meeting. 
A member may appoint more than one proxy in relation to a general meeting 
or class meeting provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights 
attached to a different share or shares held by that member. A member that 
is a corporation may appoint one or more individuals to act on its behalf at a 
general meeting or class meeting as a corporate representative. The debate 
around s323 of the Companies Act has been resolved so that where a 
shareholder appoints more than one corporate representative in respect 
of its shareholding, but in respect of different shares, those corporate 
representatives can act independently of each other, and validly vote in 
different ways.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall, unless the directors otherwise determine, be entitled in 
respect of any share held by him/her to vote either personally or by proxy 
at a shareholders’ meeting, or to exercise any other right conferred 
by membership in relation to shareholders’ meetings, if any call or other sum 
presently payable by him/her to the Company in respect of that share remains 
unpaid. In addition, no member shall be entitled to vote if he/she has been 
served with a notice after failing to provide the Company with information 
concerning interests in those shares required to be provided under the 
Companies Act.
Issue of shares
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act relating to authority and 
pre-emption rights and of any resolution of the Company in a UK general 
meeting, all unissued shares of the Company shall be at the disposal of the 
directors and they may allot (with or without conferring a right of 
renunciation), grant options over, or otherwise dispose of them to such 
persons at such times, and on such terms, as they think proper. 214 Anglo American plc Annual Report 2014
OTHER INFORMATION DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Shares in uncertificated form
Directors may determine that any class of shares may be held in uncertificated 
form, and title to such shares may be transferred by means of a relevant 
system, or that shares of any class should cease to be so held and transferred. 
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the CREST regulations and 
every other statute, statutory instrument, regulation or order for the time 
being in force concerning companies and affecting the Company (together, 
the Statutes), the directors may determine that any class of shares held on the 
branch register of members of the Company resident in South Africa, or any 
other overseas branch register of the members of the Company, may be held 
in uncertificated form in accordance with any system outside the UK that 
enables title to such shares to be evidenced and transferred without a written 
instrument and which is a relevant system. The provisions of the Articles shall 
not apply to shares of any class that are in uncertificated form to the extent 
that the Articles are inconsistent with the holding of shares of that class in 
uncertificated form, the transfer of title to shares of that class by means of 
a relevant system or any provision of the CREST regulations.
Deadlines for exercising voting rights
Votes are exercisable at a general meeting of the Company in respect of 
which the business being voted upon is being heard. Votes may be exercised 
in person, by proxy, or in relation to corporate members, by corporate 
representative. The Articles provide a deadline for submission of proxy forms 
of not less than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the 
meeting or adjourned meeting.
Variation of rights
Subject to statute, the Articles specify that rights attached to any class of 
shares may be varied with the written consent of the holders of not less than 
three-quarters in nominal value of the issued shares of that class, or with the 
sanction of an extraordinary resolution passed at a separate general meeting 
of the holders of those shares. At every such separate general meeting  
the quorum shall be two persons holding, or representing by proxy, at least  
one-third in nominal value of the issued shares of the class (calculated 
excluding any shares held as treasury shares). The rights conferred upon the 
holders of any shares shall not, unless otherwise expressly provided in the 
rights attaching to those shares, be deemed to be varied by the creation or 
issue of further shares ranking pari passu with them.
Transfer of shares
All transfers of shares that are in certificated form may be effected by transfer 
in writing in any usual or common form or in any other form acceptable to the 
directors and may be under hand only. The instrument of transfer shall be 
signed by, or on behalf of, the transferor and (except in the case of fully paid 
shares) by or on behalf of the transferee. The transferor shall remain the 
holder of the shares concerned until the name of the transferee is entered in 
the register of shareholders. All transfers of shares that are in uncertificated 
form may be effected by means of the CREST system.
The directors may decline to recognise any instrument of transfer relating to 
shares in certificated form unless it:
(a) is in respect of only one class of share; and
(b)  is lodged at the transfer office (duly stamped if required) accompanied 
by the relevant share certificate(s) and such other evidence as the 
directors may reasonably require to show the right of the transferor to 
make the transfer (and, if the instrument of transfer is executed by some 
other person on his/her behalf, the authority of that person so to do).
The directors may, in the case of shares in certificated form, in their absolute 
discretion and without assigning any reason therefore, refuse to register any 
transfer of shares (not being fully paid shares) provided that, where any 
such shares are admitted to the Official List of the London Stock Exchange, 
such discretion may not be exercised in such a way as to prevent dealings 
in the shares of that class from taking place on an open and proper basis. 
The directors may also refuse to register an allotment or transfer of shares 
(whether fully paid or not) in favour of more than four persons jointly.
If the directors refuse to register an allotment or transfer, they shall send the 
refusal to the allottee or the transferee within two months after the date on 
which the letter of allotment or transfer was lodged with the Company.
A shareholder does not need to obtain the approval of the Company, or of 
other shareholders of shares in the Company, for a transfer of shares to 
take place.
Directors
Directors shall not be fewer than 10 nor more than 18 in number. A director  
is not required to hold any shares of the Company by way of qualification.  
The Company may by ordinary resolution increase or reduce the maximum  
or minimum number of directors.
Powers of directors
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act and any directions given by special 
resolution, the business of the Company will be managed by the Board who 
may exercise all the powers of the Company.
The Board may exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money and 
to mortgage or charge any of its undertaking, property and uncalled capital 
and to issue debentures and other securities, whether outright or as collateral 
security, for any debt, liability or obligation of the Company or of any 
third party.
The Company may by ordinary resolution declare dividends, but no dividend 
shall be payable in excess of the amount recommended by the directors. 
Subject to the provisions of the Articles and to the rights attaching to any 
shares, any dividends or other monies payable on or in respect of a share may 
be paid in such currency as the directors may determine. The directors may 
deduct from any dividend payable to any member all sums of money (if any) 
presently payable by him/her to the Company on account of calls or otherwise 
in relation to shares of the Company. The directors may retain any dividends 
payable on shares on which the Company has a lien, and may apply the same 
in or towards satisfaction of the debts, liabilities or engagements in respect of 
which the lien exists.
Appointment and replacement of directors
The directors may from time to time appoint one or more directors.
The Board may appoint any person to be a director (so long as the total 
number of directors does not exceed the limit prescribed in the Articles). 
Any such director shall hold office only until the next AGM and shall then be 
eligible for election.
The Articles provide that at each AGM all those directors who have been in 
office for three years or more since their election, or last re-election, shall 
retire from office. In addition, a director may at any AGM retire from office and 
stand for re-election. However, in accordance with the Code, all directors will 
be subject to annual re-election.
Significant agreements: Change of control
At 31 December 2014, Anglo American had committed bilateral and 
syndicated borrowing facilities totalling $11.0 billion with a number of 
relationship banks which contain change of control clauses. $6.2 billion of the 
Group’s bond issues also contain change of control provisions. In aggregate, 
this financing is considered significant to the Group and in the event of a 
takeover (change of control) of the Company, these contracts may be 
cancelled, become immediately payable or be subject to acceleration. In the 
ordinary course of its business the Group’s subsidiaries enter into a number of 
other commercial agreements, some of which would alter or terminate upon a 
change of control of the Company. None of these are considered by the 
Group to be significant to the Group as a whole.  
Purchases of own shares
At the AGM held on 24 April 2014, authority was given for the Company to 
purchase, in the market, up to 208.9 million Ordinary Shares of 54
86
⁄ 91 
US cents each. The Company did not purchase any of its own shares under 
this authority during 2014.
Indemnities
To the extent permitted by law and the Articles, the Company has made 
qualifying third-party indemnity provisions for the benefit of its directors 
during the year, which remain in force at the date of this report. Copies of 
these indemnities are open for inspection at the Company’s registered office.

Electronic communication
Shareholders may elect to receive, electronically, notification of the 
availability on the Company’s website of future shareholder correspondence 
e.g. Annual Reports and Accounts and Notices of AGMs. 
By registering for this service, UK shareholders can also vote online in respect 
of future AGMs and access information on their shareholding including, for 
example, dividend payment history, sales and purchases and indicative share 
prices. In order to register for the services, UK shareholders should contact 
the UK registrars or log on to www.shareview.co.uk and follow the 
on-screen instructions. It will be necessary to have a shareholder reference 
number when registering, which is shown on share certificates, dividend tax 
vouchers and proxy cards. New UK shareholders also have the option to elect 
via their proxy card.
Dividends
Dividends are declared and paid in US dollars to shareholders with registered 
addresses in all countries except the UK, eurozone countries and South Africa 
where they are paid in sterling, euros and South African rand respectively. 
Shareholders outside South Africa may elect to receive their dividends in 
US dollars.
Shareholders with bank accounts in the UK or South Africa can have their 
cash dividends credited directly to their own accounts. Shareholders should 
contact the relevant registrar to make use of this facility. South African branch 
register shareholders would need South African exchange control approval to 
mandate their dividends to an account outside South Africa.
The Company operates a dividend reinvestment plan (DRIP), which  
enables shareholders to reinvest their cash dividends into purchasing  
Anglo American shares. Details of the DRIP and how to join are available

shares which might be considered uneconomic to sell are able to donate  
them to charity. Donated shares are aggregated and sold by ShareGift,  
the proceeds being passed on to a wide range of charities. For those 
shareholders who wish to use ShareGift, transfer forms are available from  
the Registrars and further details of the scheme can be found on the website 
www.sharegift.org.

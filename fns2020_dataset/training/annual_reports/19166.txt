STRATEGIC REPORT
CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT 
The year to January 2015 was a good year for NEXT.  Underlying Earnings Per Share (EPS) grew by 15% to 420p and 
we propose to increase our total full year ordinary dividend by 16% to 150p.  This is the sixth consecutive year that 
our EPS and ordinary dividend have grown by 15% or more.
Sales for NEXT Directory, our online and catalogue business, increased by 12% and NEXT Retail by 5%.  Total Group 
sales rose 7% and reached £4 billion for the first time.
Our share price rose by 14% during the year, from £62.80 to £71.50.  As a result of the increase we did not buy back 
as many of our own shares as in previous years.  Instead we returned surplus cash to shareholders through special 
dividends.  Cash flow remained strong and we returned £572 million to shareholders through a combination of 
dividends (£434 million) and buybacks (£138 million).  We paid another special dividend of 50 pence per share in 
February and have since announced a further special dividend of 60 pence, to be paid in May.  We will continue 
to undertake buybacks but only when it would give an effective return on the cash expended of at least 8%.
Returning cash to shareholders has not been at the expense of investment in the business nor has it increased 
our net debt, which ended the year at the same level as last year.  NEXT Retail continues to invest in new, often 
larger, stores.  NEXT Directory continues to increase its active customer base, it now delivers to 71 countries and 
has a growing business in the sale of third party branded products through the LABEL.  We are also increasing our 
warehouse capacity and improving our distribution capabilities.
We have had a number of changes to the Board. Christos Angelides left the Company in September after 28 
years’ service.  Christos was a very able and effective Director and we wish him well in his new endeavours in the 
United States.  David Keens, who has been with NEXT for 29 years and our Finance Director for 24 years, retires from 
the Board in April.  David has seen many changes over that time and has been an outstanding guardian of our 
finances.  Our financial position today is testament to his diligence and hard work.  I am delighted that Amanda 
James, our Brand Finance Director, will succeed him on the Board.
Jonathan Dawson, our Senior Independent Director, is leaving the Board in May.  Jonathan has made a major 
contribution as a non-executive.  I would like to thank him for the wise counsel which he has given both me and 
the Board over the last ten years.  Francis Salway will replace Jonathan as the Senior Independent and Caroline 
Goodall will become Chairman of the Remuneration Committee.
Finally, I am pleased that Dame Dianne Thompson has joined us as a non-executive Director.  She has had a long 
and distinguished career with Camelot and is a good addition to our Board.
The continued success of NEXT is built on the hard work and dedication of our management team and all the 
people who work for NEXT.  I would like to thank them all for their contribution during the year.
2015 will bring new challenges and opportunities.  Our strategy will remain the same, focussed on our products, 
our profitability and returning cash to our shareholders.

CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
OVERVIEW
NEXT has had another good year.  Overall sales increased by 7.2% which was close to the top end of guidance 
we issued in March 2014.  However, it was a year of two very different halves.  NEXT Brand sales in the first half were 
exceptionally strong, up +11%, whilst the second half was relatively disappointing and up just +5%.
Growth in underlying profit before tax of £782m was up 12.5%.  This figure is flattered by 1.3% as a result of a £9m 
accounting profit on currency instruments, which is unlikely to recur in the year ahead.  Strong cash generation 
enabled us to buy back 1.4% of the shares outstanding which, along with the effect of buybacks in the previous 
year, meant that underlying Earnings Per Share (EPS) grew by 14.7%.
For much of the year the Company’s share price was above our internal buyback price limit and we were unable 
to return all surplus cash through share buybacks.  As a result, and in keeping with our stated intentions, we 
returned a further £223m to shareholders through three special dividends of 50 pence each.  Ordinary dividends 
for the full year will increase by 16.3%, to £1.50.

NEXT’s Financial Objective
In last year’s annual review we refined the Company’s core financial objective. Up until that point, our goal had 
been the delivery of long term, sustainable growth in EPS.  However this measure did not take account of the 
value created by paying out surplus cash as dividends; and this has become much more important as we have 
increasingly paid special dividends in lieu of share buybacks.
So we restated our objective as the delivery of long term, sustainable growth in Total Shareholder Returns (TSR).  We 
define TSR as growth in Earnings per Share added to the total dividend yield.  Taking dividends as a percentage of 
our share price at the beginning of our financial year (February 2014) our TSR is set out in the table below:
Total Shareholder Returns
Growth in underlying EPS +14.7%
* Based on £63.45, being the average share price for the  
   first month of the financial year (i.e. to 25 February 2014)
Special Dividend Yield* 150p +2.3%
Ordinary Dividend Yield* 150p +2.3%
Total Shareholder Returns* +19.3%
The inclusion of growth in EPS in Total Shareholder Returns is grounded in the belief that, over time, share price 
growth will follow growth in EPS.  The graph below shows how our share price has tracked EPS over the last 16 years. 
The graph also demonstrates that our shares now enjoy a rating well above their historical average.  It is important to 
point out that the high rating means that the deployment of surplus cash, as special dividends or share buybacks, 
will provide lower returns for shareholders than if the shares were at a lower rating.

STRATEGIC REPORT
PRODUCT AND THE NEXT BRAND
Over the course of the year we have focused on improving the design content of our ranges.  We believe the 
investment in time, effort and resources has been worthwhile.  Unusually, our ranges in Spring and Summer 2014 
were successful across all of our five product divisions (Womenswear Clothing, Women’s Shoes and Accessories, 
Menswear, Childrenswear and Home).  The focus on design continues in the year ahead with further investment in 
our fabric and print resources.
We also aim to develop and improve our buying processes.  Traditionally, NEXT has begun to develop design 
themes eight months before the launch of a season.  We will continue to work this way but believe that we can 
make much better use of the intervening time to improve our fabrics, design details, prints, trims, shapes and prices 
on long lead-time product. 
In addition to our more traditional buying cycle, we also develop a small amount of product much closer to the 
season, using shorter lead time territories and quicker response suppliers.  This approach to buying is newer and 
less comfortable for NEXT, and requires a different mind-set to our traditional techniques.  We aim to build on the 
success we have had with shorter lead-time product and make more of this buying method going forward. 
RETAIL
Total Retail sales were 4.8% ahead of last year, of which new space contributed 3.4%.
RETAIL SPACE EXPANSION
Space added in the year
Trading space increased by 330,000 square feet to 7.4 million square feet.  Store numbers remained broadly the 
same, with the increase from new stores being offset by the closure of smaller, less profitable stores.

Returns on Capital and Profitability
Profitability of stores opened in the last 12 months is forecast to average 20% and payback on the net capital 
invested is expected to be 20 months.  Both figures are within Company investment hurdles of 15% store profitability 
and 24 months capital payback.  The table below sets out the profitability and returns of new space, broken down

Aspirational Out-of-Town Architecture
An unusually large percentage, 75%, of new space was large format Home and Fashion stores.  These side-by-side 
stores give the Company the opportunity to re-define the way we trade out of town, investing in the architecture 
of our buildings and the quality of shop-fit.  We have radically changed the appearance of existing retail park 
buildings, adding glass frontages, light-wells, and improved facades.  We have also built two stores from the ground 
up (Hedge End and Maidstone), and these have enabled us to create beautiful and iconic buildings.  Over the 
next three years we hope, subject to planning, to open at least eight more of these bespoke new stores.
Maidstone – Opened November 2014
Retail Space – Pipeline to 2017 
We continue to look for opportunities to profitably increase UK selling space.  For the coming year we expect to add 
350,000 square feet (net of closures).  Looking further ahead into 2016 and 2017 our pipeline is less certain, but we 
believe that we will add around 350,000 square feet of net trading space in each of these two years.

STRATEGIC REPORT
THE LONG VIEW – RETAIL PORTFOLIO ECONOMICS & LEASE TERMS
Since the beginning of the credit crunch in 2008, sales in our existing stores have moved backwards in almost 
every season.  The combined effect of a weak economy and growth in online sales has meant that same-store 
growth has been hard to achieve across the sector.  Despite this, the profitability of our store portfolio remains 
extremely healthy.  The reason for this apparent contradiction is that the active expansion and relocation of our 
portfolio has allowed us to manage the economics of our retail portfolio to reflect the current retail environment.
In the seven years since 2008 NEXT has increased its net trading space from 5.2 million square feet to 7.4 million 
square feet.  Of the 539 stores we trade in today, almost half are either new or have been significantly extended. 
Those stores represent 60% of our current trading space.  The table below shows the changes to store numbers and 
square footage since 2008.
Store
Numbers Sq. Ft.
January 2008 502 5.2m
New stores, including re-sites (63) 179 2.6m
Closures - 142 - 0.8m
Extensions (82) gross 1.8m sq.ft. 0.4m
January 2015 539 7.4m
Long Term Profitability Comparisons
The table below gives key measures of performance since 2008. It shows how the 26% fall in sales per square foot have 
not resulted in the proportionate increase that might be expected in rent, rates, depreciation and branch wages.
In fact, store profitability (before central overheads) has moved forward in the period.  This is because savings 
achieved through more effective Sale stock clearance, lower shrinkage and management of other branch costs 
have more than offset any increases in rents and rates.  Wages have reduced as a percentage of sales, because 
productivity improvements have more than compensated for the dis-economies of lower sales per square foot and 
inflationary wage increases.
The table below shows key branch costs as a percentage of VAT inclusive sales in 2008 and 2015.
Store Variables 2007/8 2014/15

Current Profitability Profile
As a result of the active management of our store portfolio, the vast majority of our stores make a healthy profit, with 
97% of our space delivering a net branch profit of more than 10%.  The table below sets out the percentage of our

Lease Terms
Over the last ten years we have seen a move away from long lease terms.  We are currently only entering into leases 
of more than 10 years in situations where (1) we believe that the trading location is very unlikely to deteriorate 
within 20 years, (2) landlords are making a very substantial investment in a new trading location or (3) we are 
swapping out of an existing store with a significant number of unexpired years on the lease.
The graph below shows the remaining lease commitment in years by percentage of our portfolio (by rental value). 
This shows that in 2008 approximately 50% of our store leases would have expired in just over ten years’ time.  Today 
50% of our leases will expire in just six years’ time.

STRATEGIC REPORT
RETAIL SERVICE
At the beginning of last year we set ourselves the objective of improving our customer service across the Group.  
Our starting point was a rather disappointing set of customer surveys conducted in June 2013.  We re-defined what 
we meant by great service, focusing on serving our customers in the way they want to be served, not on traditional 
retail salesmanship designed to maximise short term sales.
Over the last eighteen months we have:
 ❚ Overhauled our recruitment process, focusing on attitude rather than experience
 ❚ Increased our lowest wage rates by 6%
 ❚ Introduced new service training
 ❚ Changed our store staff bonus scheme to be awarded on the basis of service, rather than sales
 ❚ Re-allocated contract hours throughout the day to achieve better service at peak times
 ❚ Increased the average contract hours worked per member of staff.  (Any consequent reduction in head count 
has been achieved through natural wastage and without any redundancies)
 ❚ Introduced a shift market-place to allow staff to offer up, swap and accept additional shifts
 ❚ Changed our staff appraisal and performance management systems
We believe that all the above changes have had a significant and positive effect on the levels of service we 
provide in our stores.  The two charts below are taken from an independent survey which assesses the number of

RETAIL PROFIT ANALYSIS 
Full year operating margin improved by 0.8% to 16.3%.  The table below sets out significant margin movements by 
major heads of costs.
Net operating margin on total sales last year 15.5%
Bought-in gross margin Underlying gross margin improved by +0.3% due to a planned increase in 
Home furniture.  In addition, we were able to buy currency at slightly better 
rates than initially anticipated, resulting in a margin gain of +0.2%.
+0.5%
Higher markdown Retail stock for Sale was up 13% and markdown sales were up 8.5%.  Margin 
reduced as a result of markdown sales growing faster than full price sales 
and lower Sale clearance rates.
- 0.4%
Decrease in occupancy 
costs
This improvement was due to (1) store asset write-offs in the prior year 
+0.5%, (2) lower depreciation due to fully depreciated assets +0.3% and 
(3) leverage of fixed costs from strong first half sales +0.3%.

STRATEGIC REPORT
DIRECTORY DEVELOPMENT – UK
We have developed the UK business through improving our delivery service, improving the levels of customer 
service, and increasing the frequency of our publications.
Delivery Service
During the year we extended the ordering window for deliveries to stores.  From October store orders could be 
placed until midnight for next day delivery.  This service provided the ground work for the much harder exercise of 
extending our window for deliveries to home, we have recently extended our cut-off to 11pm and hope to extend 
to midnight by August.  Currently we take around 9% of our orders between 10pm and midnight.
NEXT Directory Customer Service 
We have made some progress in improving customer service in our call centres.  We have taken many of the lessons 
learnt from Retail and used them to change our recruitment methods, training courses, staff bonus schemes and 
appraisal methods. 
Enquiry levels and complaints have fallen.  However, we still feel we have a long way to go to get to the levels of 
service we would like.  In particular we need to ensure that more enquiries are dealt with first time.  Of course, much 
of the effort is about preventing mistakes in the first place.  To that extent, our warehouses and distribution network 
can contribute more to preventing repeat enquiries than our call centres.
We also aim to improve the functionality of our website, with particular emphasis on:
 ❚ Improvements to payment processing and account management screens
 ❚ Re-launch of our iPad and iPhone Apps in addition to a redesign of our mobile site (m.next.uk)
 ❚ Improvements to the operation of specialist Home product web pages where clothing search and selection 
methods are inappropriate (e.g. dining chairs, tables, fitted wardrobes and beds)
Publications
In 2013 we experimented with a number of small “New In” publications.  These are now published at six week 
intervals between the launch our four big hardback Spring, Summer, Autumn and Winter catalogues.
During the year we increased the size and extended the distribution of these publications.  In the year ahead we 
will add one further small new publication in May to offer High Summer and holiday product.

FOCUS ON NEXT DIRECTORY CREDIT BUSINESS
Over the last few years, NEXT Directory has made the transition from Catalogue to Online.  In doing so, we have 
made it easy for new customers to trade using a debit card or credit card (we refer to these customers as “Cash” 
as opposed to “Credit” customers).  This has dramatically increased the reach of the NEXT Directory and we now 
have 900,000 active Cash customers.  However, this has meant that, over the last few years, our Credit customer 
growth has slowed and this year it has declined by -2.6%.  The graph below shows the growth in total Directory sales 
relative to our Credit customer base, the figures are indexed to 2007.  The dotted line shows the growth in Credit 
sales in the same period.

Effect on Profitability
Net interest income accounts for 8% of the 25.4% net margin made on Credit sales.  However, the difference in 
the profitability of our Cash customers is not as great as might first be expected.  Our Cash business experiences 
much lower returns and marketing costs, boosting the profitability of Directory Cash sales to 23%, and narrowing 
the difference to 2.4%.
Effect on Credit Sales
Interestingly, the decline in Credit customers has not yet been matched by a decline in Credit sales.  Growth in 
sales to our Credit customers is more than compensating for the decline in customer numbers.  Interest income 
has also started to grow slightly faster than Credit sales.  We believe that this is because the customers who are 
leaving are those who are most likely to have been paying down their balance in full. 
Both of these effects do not change the underlying reality, that our Credit business is in decline, but they do mean 
that the decline is likely to be slower than we initially anticipated.
Promoting the Credit Offer
We have not directly promoted our Credit business but will begin to do so over the course of this year. In addition to 
providing flexible payments, the account also allows customers to try items before they buy them (customers have 
at least 28 days to return items without incurring interest charges on them).  Most Credit account holders are also 
eligible to get early access to our End of Season online Sale.  Whilst it is very unlikely that we will return to our Credit 
customer base growing in line with Directory’s total UK sales, we may be able to take steps to arrest the decline. We 
will have further information on this subject at the half year.

STRATEGIC REPORT
DEVELOPING DIRECTORY OVERSEAS
NEXT’s online business continues to do well overseas.  Around 85% of Directory’s overseas sales come from our own 
website, the remainder is being sold through local third party home shopping operators.
Over the last three years the emphasis of our work overseas has been on opening new territories, translating our 
website and accepting local currencies.  Much of this work is now done and we will shift our focus to improving our 
delivery service.  This can be achieved either through increasing the speed of distribution from our UK warehouses 
through 3rd party networks or by distributing from our overseas hub warehouses.
Faster From the UK
We have recently improved our delivery service to Germany and France, offering most of our customers a next day 
delivery service.  Initial sales response has been encouraging and we will look to extend this service to other close 
European countries.
Local Distribution Hubs
In September 2014 we successfully opened a local hub in Northern Ireland.  This has allowed us to offer next day 
delivery in both Northern Ireland and Eire.  We will shortly open a local distribution hub and, later in the year, a call 
centre in Russia.  Total investment in this project is £2.5m.  Our current delivery promise in Russia is 8 to 12 days.  
The new hub will allow us to offer a stated day service, next-day to customers in Moscow and St Petersburg, and 
between 2–5 days for our other Russian customers.
New Territories – China
The only significant new territory launched last year was China.  Sales started slowly but are now exceeding our 
expectations and we believe that China will shortly be one of our top ten trading territories. We are currently 
working on a local distribution hub to serve mainland China, Hong Kong, Taiwan and Japan.  We hope to be 
operational within the current year.  Our aim is to reduce mainland China lead times for most of our customers 
from 14 days to 1–2 days.
Sales, Profitability History and Outlook for the year ahead
The table below sets out the last three years’ sales, profits and net margins for overseas online.  The fourth column

Profitability 19% 18% 18% 18%(e) 
We expect our international online sales to grow by 25% in the year ahead, to around £205m.  This rate of growth is 
significantly lower than last year.  This is partly because we have now opened in all our target territories and have 
limited further opportunities to add local currencies and languages.  In addition two of our largest markets, Russia 
and Ukraine, have both suffered significant currency devaluations.  We have had to increase our prices in local 
currency to maintain profitability in these territories and as a result sales (measured in £ Sterling) are no longer 
growing.  We believe that both countries will return to growth if and when their currencies stabilise.  Despite the 
tough trading environment we remain confident that our Russian distribution hub will be operational with the next 
two months.
LABEL
We launched our first LABEL catalogue in March last year.  The business was an extension of the small number of 
third party brands we had been selling through the NEXT Directory.  The aim was to offer premium non-competing 
brands to the 4 million NEXT Directory customer base, leveraging the next day service we are able to offer through 
our warehouses and distribution networks.
The business has started well and we continue to recruit new, premium brands to the business. Last year we added 
34 new major brands to LABEL.  In the year ahead we intend to add at least another 30 premium brands.  LABEL 
will publish four catalogues a year with around 400 pages in each.  LABEL products can be ordered through a 
dedicated part of the NEXT website and through LABELONLINE.CO.UK

Profitability in the year just ended was lower than the previous year, 
partly as a result of more partner brands switching to trade with 
LABEL on a commission basis.  This means we take a commission 
on sales rather than purchase wholesale.  The commission model 
is less profitable for us, but gives partner brands far more freedom 
to manage the ranges they sell through LABEL and allows us to 
draw on their selection expertise.  Our experience so far is that 
brands which switch to trading on commission can dramatically 
increase their sales. 
DIRECTORY PROFIT ANALYSIS
Operating margin reduced by 1.6% to 24.5%.  The table below sets out significant margin movements by major 
heads of costs.
Net operating margin last year 26.1%
Bought-in gross margin Underlying gross margin improved by +0.3% due to a planned 
increase in Home furniture margin.  In addition, we were able to buy 
currency at slightly better rates than initially anticipated, resulting in 
a gain of +0.2%.  This has been offset by an increase in Branded and 
International sales which have lower margins.
- 0.1%
Markdown Directory stock for Sale increased by more than Sales, up 25%.  In 
addition lower clearance rates have reduced overall margin.
- 0.4%
Stock write downs More stock was damaged whilst in transit.  In particular flat pack 
furniture and items returned via our stores. In addition, we incurred a 
£0.9m one-off sofa recall cost.
- 0.3%
Interest income Interest income increased, but at a lower rate than total sales. Interest 
income was also reduced by a 1% APR reduction made in September 
2014.
- 0.4%
Bad Debt Bad debt costs have reduced, increasing margin. +0.3%
Warehouse & distribution Margins have reduced by -0.6% due to increasing International 
sales.  This has been partially offset by savings in International parcel 
rates, operational savings and increased use of our store network for 
customer returns.

STRATEGIC REPORT
COST INFLATION AND COST CONTROL
This year we have offset cost increases with cost savings.  The tables below outline the main contributors to cost 
increases and cost savings over the last year.  Cost control remains at the heart of the business and we remain 
determined that cost savings must come through innovation and efficiency rather than any compromise to our 
product quality or services.

Cost of living awards and other wage related inflation  19 
Rent, rates & other occupancy costs 6 
Systems investments (mainly new till systems) 5 
Additional costs associated with overseas deliveries 4

Non-recurring prior year store asset write-offs 12
Fully depreciated store assets no longer incurring a depreciation charge 8 
Directory distribution efficiencies 4 
Retail manpower productivity improvements 4 
Lower bad debt charges 2
Total Cost Savings 42
In the year ahead we expect cost increases of around £36m.  Anticipated wage increases account for £18m of 
this, the majority of which comes from our annual wage award.  We again expect cost increases to be more than 
offset by cost savings.  In NEXT Retail, the profit from new stores should offset lower profits from existing stores.  In NEXT 
Directory, profit from growth in UK sales should exceed that from growth in International sales.
Head Office, Warehouse and Systems Projects 
The rapid growth of our Online and Home businesses meant that we commenced an unusual number of big 
systems, warehousing and Head Office Infrastructure projects in 2014. 
These projects will give some operational benefits but are mainly required to facilitate continued growth or replace 
obsolete systems and buildings.  Most systems development costs are revenue costs and written off in the year they 
are incurred. Hardware and other infrastructure are depreciated over the life of the asset.
The table below sets out the largest projects and their revenue and capital costs for the year ended and estimates 
for the year ahead.  The biggest number is the £20m investment in fitting out a new automated Home Sofa and 
Furniture warehouse, located next to our existing warehouses in Doncaster.  We expect to spend a further £12m on 
this project in the year to January 2017.

OTHER TRADING BUSINESSES
NEXT SOURCING
NEXT Sourcing (NS) continues to provide more than 40% of NEXT Brand stock from our global supplier base, 
sourcing from 18 countries.  It employs 3,600 people in 12 countries, including 2,700 in factories which we own.  NS 
provides the Group with an insight into manufacturing and the relative technical strengths of different parts of the 
world.  Although wholly owned, it operates as a stand-alone business and must compete (without favour) with our 
other suppliers.
NS trades mainly in US Dollars and its sales were up 10% in Dollars.  The table below shows sales and profits in 
Sterling.
£m 2015 2014
Sales (mainly inter-company) 600.6 571.2 +5.1%
Operating margin % 6.9% 6.0%
Operating profit 41.4 34.1 +21.3%
We are forecasting NS profits of £47m for the year ahead, which includes a £3m currency benefit from the stronger 
Dollar.  NEXT Sourcing has made excellent progress controlling costs, and its margins are now approaching 
historical highs.  There is an opportunity for NS to be more competitive and their Board has taken the decision to 
lower their commission rate by 1% for Spring 2016 stock.
INTERNATIONAL RETAIL AND FRANCHISE STORES
Our franchise partners operate 188 stores in 37 countries, sales and profits were little changed on the year.  We own 
13 stores in Central Europe, which made a small profit.  We have no plans to open our own stores in new territories.  
Revenue and profit are set out below.  We are budgeting for International Retail to make £10m profit in the year 
ahead.  The anticipated drop in profit is due to the economic difficulties being experienced by our franchise 
partners in some eastern European countries.
£m 2015 2014
Franchise income 71.9 71.0
Own store sales 14.3 14.6
Total revenue 86.2 85.6 +0.7%
Operating profit 11.7 12.1 - 2.9%
LIPSY
Lipsy performed well, and profit increased to £5.1m.  Lipsy sales are broken down by distribution channel in the 
table below.  Lipsy sells stock directly through its own stores, website, to wholesale customers and to franchise 
partners.  Lipsy also sells stock in 34 units inset into NEXT Retail stores and through the NEXT Directory.  Sales made 
through NEXT Retail and Directory are now reported in those divisions (see Note 1 to the financial statements).
£m 2015 2014
Lipsy.co.uk, standalone stores, franchise and wholesale 36.8 35.3 +4%
NEXT Retail 12.9 12.1 +7%
NEXT Directory 23.3 15.5 +50%
Total Sales 73.0 62.9 +16%
Operating Profit 5.1 2.7
Currently, the majority of Lipsy’s sales are of Lipsy branded merchandise.  Lipsy also sells some other, third party, 
young fashion brands.  These third party branded sales now account for 12% of Lipsy’s sales and we anticipate that 
this participation will increase in the year ahead.
Outlook for Sales and Profits
One of Lipsy’s major wholesale customers, Bank, recently went into administration and this customer contributed 
£1.3m to profit.  We believe that some of the lost turnover will be recovered through other channels and the 
balance of lost profit will be made up for with organic growth.  We anticipate that Lipsy profit for the year ahead 
will be broadly in line with last year.

CENTRAL COSTS AND OTHER ACTIVITIES
The table below sets out other Group and non-trading activities.  In aggregate these activities contributed £25m 
to the growth in profit, a far greater difference than we would normally expect from these activities.  Of this £25m, 
the most significant was a £15m swing in unrealised accounting gains/losses on currency hedging instruments.
£m 2015 2014
Property management 6.9 1.8
Central costs (23.4) (30.7)
Unrealised foreign exchange 8.9 (5.9)
Associates 0.9 2.5
Total (6.7) (32.3)
Property Management
The Property Management profit of £7m includes a £4m one-off profit on sale of a NEXT Retail store lease.  In the year 
ahead we anticipate a similar one-off profit will be achieved from the development of at least one other new store.
Central Costs
The reduction in Central Costs is due primarily to lower share-based employee incentives, in the prior year the rate 
of share price growth and the provisions required had been particularly high.
Unrealised Foreign Exchange IAS 39
The £9m gain this year compares with a £6m loss in the previous year.  This accounting volatility is unhelpful and 
hard to predict, we are working on the basis of no gain or loss in the year ahead.
INTEREST AND TAXATION
The interest charge was £30m as forecast and we expect a similar figure for the year ahead. 
Our tax rate of 20.4% was unchanged and is commensurate with current headline UK corporation tax rates.  We 
expect our effective tax rate will be no higher than 21% in each of the next two years.
EXCEPTIONAL DISPOSAL GAINS
During the year we sold our investment in Cotton Traders for £15m, which was £11m above book value.  We also 
released £2m of other prior year disposal provisions.

BALANCE SHEET AND ORDINARY DIVIDENDS
The balance sheet remains strong.  Net debt at the end of the year was virtually unchanged at £515m.  During 
the coming year net debt is expected to move between a minimum of £500m and a maximum of £750m, and 
is expected to finish at around the same level as it started.  Our bonds and committed bank facilities of £1,088m 
remain unchanged, as set out below.

Total bonds nominal value 788

Total debt facilities available 1,088
FINAL ORDINARY DIVIDEND
We have proposed raising our final ordinary dividend to 100p, taking the total ordinary dividend for the year to 
150p.  The increase of 16% is marginally ahead of growth in underlying EPS, although cover remains at 2.8 times.
CASH GENERATION, SHARE BUYBACKS AND SPECIAL DIVIDENDS
CASH GENERATION
Over the last year we generated £363m of surplus cash after capex, interest, ordinary dividends and tax.  We 
returned £361m of this to shareholders, through special dividends of £223m and share buybacks of £138m.
We expect to generate around £360m surplus cash in the year ahead and, again, we intend to return this to 
shareholders.  We paid a £74m special dividend in February and have committed to a further £90m which will be 
paid in May.  If our share price remains above our maximum limit for buybacks and our profit expectations remain 
unchanged, then we intend to pay further quarterly special dividends in August and November this year.
SHARE BUYBACK LIMIT GOING FORWARD
We have, on several occasions, set out the criteria by which we would decide the maximum price the Company 
would pay to buy back shares.  We use the concept of Equivalent Rate of Return (ERR).  This is the pre-tax return 
required from an alternative investment, if that investment were to produce the same level of earnings enhancement 
as the proposed buyback.  We set the minimum ERR at 8%, which we consider a reasonable target for a return on 
equity investments.
For the year to January 2016, the mid-point of our guidance for profit before tax is £810m.  On this basis an 8% ERR 
gives a new upper limit for buybacks of £68.27.

SALES OUTLOOK FOR NEXT
Although the consumer economy looks benign, we remain very cautious in our sales budgets.  Whilst we are 
happy with most of our current product ranges, we recognise that some collections are not as strong as they 
were at this point last year.  In addition, during the Spring and Summer seasons, we face very tough comparative 
numbers from last year, when sales were assisted by unusually warm weather.  There is a potential upside in the 
second half as the comparative performance last year weakens, particularly in the third quarter.
We are currently budgeting for full price sales growth for the full year to be up between +1.5% and +5.5%, with the 
first half expected to be up 0% to 3%, and the second half up 3.5% to 7.5%.

The table below sets out our guidance for the full year.  For the purposes of this guidance, we have assumed that 
surplus cash of £360m is generated and returned as special dividends rather than buybacks.  In reality the choice 
between buybacks and special dividends will depend on the prevailing share price as explained above.  We have 
expressed the dividend return as a percentage of our average share price during the first month of this financial year.
Guidance Estimates 
Lower end  
of guidance
Upper end  
of guidance
Total full price NEXT Brand sales % growth +1.5% +5.5%
Group profit before tax £m £785m £835m
Group profit before tax % growth +0.4% +6.7%
Ordinary dividend yield (based on £72.33 share price) +2.1% +2.1%
Special dividend yield (based on £72.33 share price) +3.3% +3.3%
Total Shareholder Returns +5.8% +12.1%
This guidance is based on 52 weeks for the years ending January 2015 and 2016.  This year will actually be the 53 
weeks to 30 January 2016.  Our Interim accounts will be for the comparable 26 weeks to 25 July 2015.
First Quarter Trading Update
Our next statement will cover the first thirteen weeks of the year, to 25 April 2015, and is provisionally scheduled for 
Wednesday 29 April 2015.
CONCLUSION – A TOUGHER YEAR BUT PLENTY TO DO
Whilst the prospective returns detailed above would be very respectable by most standards, they are low by 
comparison to NEXT’s historical performance.  However, they are based on realistic sales estimates and we believe 
that it would be a mistake to be over-optimistic at this stage.  Our experience is that starting with prudent sales 
budgets is the key to coping with lower sales growth.  Stock purchases and other costs can then be tailored to get 
the business through the year in good shape.
Whatever the sales environment in the current year, the Company has plenty of opportunities to lay foundations for 
future growth.  Of these, the most important are: further improvement to our buying techniques, customer service, 
delivery capabilities, growing our store portfolio, initiating overseas fulfilment operations, and growing our third 
party branded business through LABEL.

STRATEGIC REPORT
BUSINESS MODEL
NEXT is a UK based retailer offering exciting, beautifully designed, excellent quality clothing, footwear, accessories 
and home products.  NEXT is one of the largest clothing and home products retailers in the UK by sales, and a 
member of the FTSE-100 index.  The Group is primarily comprised of:
 ❚ NEXT Retail, a chain of more than 500 stores in the UK and Eire.
The majority of our stores sell clothing, footwear, accessories and home products; we also operate over 60 large Home Standalone and 
department style stores.  The predominantly leased store portfolio is actively managed, with openings and closures based on store profitability 
and cash payback. Around 60% of Group sales are from NEXT Retail.
 ❚ NEXT Directory , an online and catalogue shopping business with over 4 million active customers and international 
websites serving approximately 70 countries.
By embracing the internet, providing exceptional customer service and developing overseas opportunities, over the last ten years NEXT 
Directory’s sales have grown by more than 150% and now represent almost 40% of Group sales.
There are strong synergies between NEXT Retail and NEXT Directory: through efficient stock management and customer service opportunities 
(such as handling Directory collections and returns in-store) the Group has been able to successfully develop both parts of the business.
 ❚ NEXT International Retail, with around 200 mainly franchised stores across the world.
NEXT’s franchise partners operate over 180 stores in 37 countries; there are also a small number of stores which NEXT operates directly. 
International Retail accounts for around 2% of Group sales.
 ❚ NEXT Sourcing, which designs, sources and buys NEXT branded products.
Last year, around 40% of the Group’s products were procured or produced by NEXT Sourcing.  Further information on the Group’s supply chain 
and NEXT’s commitment to ethical trading can be found on page 28.
 ❚ Lipsy, which designs and sells Lipsy branded younger women’s fashion products.
Lipsy trades from around 40 stores, online, and through wholesale and franchise channels.  Lipsy contributes around 2% of Group sales.
Further detail on the performance and development of the Group’ s businesses can be found in the Chief Executive’ s 
Review on pages 3 to 21, which forms part of this Strategic Report along with Key Performance Indicators (page 
23), Risks & Uncertainties (page 24), Employees (page 27), Social, Community and Human Rights (page 28) and 
Environmental Matters (page 29).
BUSINESS STRATEGIES AND OBJECTIVES
The primary financial objective of the Group is to deliver long term returns to shareholders through a combination 
of sustainable growth in earnings per share (“EPS”) and payment of cash dividends.  Underlying EPS increased 
by 14.7% from last year.  Over the last ten years EPS has increased by 250%, and the share price has increased by 
350%.  This long term value has been created through the pursuit of the following strategies:
 ❚ Improving and developing our product ranges, success in which is measured by sales performance.
 ❚ Profitably increasing retail selling space.  New store appraisals must meet demanding financial criteria before 
the investment is made, and success is measured by achieved profit contribution and return on capital against 
appraised targets.
 ❚ Increasing the number of profitable NEXT Directory customers and their spend, both in the UK and through 
international online sales.
 ❚ Managing gross and net margins through efficient product sourcing, stock management and cost control.
 ❚ Focussing on customer service and satisfaction levels in both Retail stores and Directory.
 ❚ Maintaining the Group’s financial strength through an efficient balance sheet and secure financing structure.
 ❚ Generating and returning surplus cash to shareholders by way of share buybacks or, more recently, special 
dividends.  Further information on the criteria we use to determine the method by which surplus cash is returned 
can be found in the Chief Executive’s Report.

STRATEGIC REPORT
RISKS & UNCERTAINTIES
The Board has a policy of continuous identification and review of key business risks and oversees the development 
of processes to ensure that these risks are managed appropriately.  Executive directors and operational 
management are delegated with the task of implementing these processes and reporting to the Board and Audit 
Committee on their outcomes.  The principal risks and uncertainties are described below:
Description of risk or uncertainty How the risk or uncertainty is managed or mitigated
BUSINESS STRATEGY DEVELOPMENT & 
IMPLEMENTATION 
If the Board adopts the wrong business strategy 
or does not implement its strategies effectively, the 
business may suffer.  The Board therefore needs to 
understand and properly manage strategic risk in 
order to deliver long term growth for the benefit of 
NEXT’s stakeholders.
The Board reviews business strategy on a regular basis to 
determine how sales and profit budgets can be achieved 
or bettered, and business operations made more efficient.  
This process includes the setting of seasonal and annual 
budgets and longer term financial objectives to identify 
ways to increase shareholder value. Critical to these 
processes are the consideration of wider economic and 
industry specific trends that affect the Group’s businesses, 
the competitive position of its product offer and the financial 
structure of the Group.  In addition, the Audit Committee 
monitors strategic and operational risk regularly and any 
significant matters are reported to the Board. 
MANAGEMENT TEAM
The success of NEXT relies on the continued 
service of its senior management and technical 
personnel, and on its ability to continue to attract, 
motivate and retain highly qualified employees. 
The retail sector is very competitive and NEXT’s 
staff may be targeted by other companies.
The Remuneration and Nomination Committees identify 
senior personnel, review remuneration at least annually 
and formulate packages to retain and motivate these 
employees, including share incentive schemes.  In addition, 
the Board considers the development of senior managers 
to ensure adequate career development opportunities for 
key personnel, with orderly succession and promotion to 
important management positions. 
PRODUCT DESIGN & SELECTION
NEXT’s success depends on designing and 
selecting products that customers want to buy, at 
appropriate price points and in the right quantities. 
This includes anticipating and responding to 
changing consumer preferences and trends, as 
well as taking into account the wider consumer 
and economic environment.  In the short term, a 
failure to properly manage this area may mean 
that NEXT is faced with surplus stocks that cannot 
be sold at full price and may have to be disposed 
of at a loss.  In the longer term, the reputation of 
the NEXT Brand may suffer.  Product design and 
selection is therefore at the heart of the business.
Executive directors and senior management continually 
review the design, selection and performance of NEXT’s 
product ranges.  This ensures, so far as possible, that there is 
a well-balanced product mix that is good value for money, 
and available in sufficient quantities and at the right time to 
meet customer demand.  To some extent, product risk is also 
mitigated by the diversity of NEXT’s ranges.

KEY SUPPLIERS & SUPPLY CHAIN 
MANAGEMENT
NEXT relies on its supplier base to deliver products 
on time and to the quality standards it specifies. 
Failure to do so may result in an inability to service 
customer demand or adversely affect NEXT’s 
reputation.
NEXT continually seeks ways to develop its supplier base 
so as to reduce over-reliance on individual suppliers of 
products and services, and maintain the quality and 
competitiveness of its product offer. The Group’s risk 
assessment procedures for key suppliers identify alternatives 
and develop contingency plans in the event of key supplier 
failure.
Changes in global manufacturing capacity and 
costs may impact on profit margins.
Existing and new sources of supply are developed in 
conjunction with NEXT Sourcing, external agents and/or 
direct suppliers.
Non-compliance by suppliers with the NEXT Code 
of Practice may increase reputational risk.
NEXT carries out regular inspections of its suppliers’ 
operations to ensure compliance with the standards set 
out in this code; covering production methods, employee 
working conditions, quality control and inspection 
processes.  Further details can be found on page 28. 
NEXT also monitors and reviews the financial, political and 
geographical aspects of its supplier base to identify any 
factors that may affect the continuity or quality of supply of 
its products.
WAREHOUSING & DISTRIBUTION
NEXT regularly reviews the warehousing and 
distribution operations that support the business. 
Risks include business interruption due to physical 
damage, access restrictions, breakdowns, 
capacity shortages, IT systems failure (see next 
page), inefficient processes and third party 
failures.
Planning processes are in place to ensure there is sufficient 
warehouse handling capacity for expected future business 
volumes over the short and longer terms.  In addition, 
service levels, warehouse handling, inbound logistics and 
delivery costs are monitored continuously to ensure goods 
are delivered to our warehouses, Retail stores and Directory 
customers in a timely and cost-efficient manner.  Business 
continuity plans and insurance are in place to mitigate the 
impact of business interruption.
CUSTOMER EXPERIENCE
NEXT’s performance depends on the recruitment 
and retention of customers, and on its ability to 
drive and service customer demand.  This includes 
having an attractive, functional and reliable 
website and effective call centres, operating 
successful marketing strategies, and providing 
both Retail and Directory customers with service 
levels that meet or exceed their expectations.
The Group continuously monitors website and call centre 
operations that support the business to ensure that there is 
sufficient capacity to handle volumes.  Capacity forecasting 
is used to manage peak demands and growth in business 
volumes.
Market research is used to assess customer opinions and 
satisfaction levels, and regular customer experience visits to 
our stores help to ensure that our staff remain focussed on 
delivering excellent customer service.

STRATEGIC REPORT
Description of risk or uncertainty How the risk or uncertainty is managed or mitigated
RETAIL STORE NETWORK 
NEXT Retail’s performance depends on profitably 
developing the trading space of the store 
network. The successful development of new 
stores depends on a number of factors including 
the identification of suitable properties, obtaining 
planning permissions and the negotiation of 
acceptable lease terms. Prime retail sites will 
generally remain in demand, and increased 
competition for these can result in higher future 
rents.
The predominantly leased store portfolio is actively 
managed by senior management, with openings, refits and 
closures based on store profitability and cash payback.
NEXT will continue to invest in new space where its financial 
criteria are met, and will renew and refurbish its existing 
portfolio when appropriate. New store appraisals include 
the estimated effects of sales deflection from existing stores, 
but there remains a risk that actual performance may differ 
from those estimates.
INFORMATION SECURITY , BUSINESS 
CONTINUITY & CYBER RISK
NEXT is dependent upon the continued availability 
and integrity of its IT systems, which must record 
and process substantial volumes of data and 
conduct inventory management accurately and 
quickly. The Group’s systems require continuous 
enhancement and investment to prevent 
obsolescence and maintain responsiveness. The 
threat of unauthorised or malicious attack is an 
on-going risk, the nature of which is constantly 
evolving. 
Systems’ vulnerability and penetration testing, business 
continuity plans and back up facilities are in place and 
are tested regularly to ensure that business interruptions 
are minimised and data is protected from corruption or 
unauthorised access or use. IT risks are also managed 
through the application of internal policies and change 
management procedures, contractual service level 
agreements with third party suppliers, and IT capacity 
management.
The Audit Committee received regular briefings on cyber 
risk during the year (see page 45).
FINANCIAL, TREASURY , LIQUIDITY & 
CREDIT RISKS
The main financial risks are the availability of funds 
to meet business needs, default by counterparties 
to financial transactions, the effect of fluctuations 
in foreign exchange rates and interest rates, and 
compliance with regulation.
NEXT operates a centralised treasury function which is 
responsible for managing its liquidity, interest and foreign 
currency risks.  The Group’s treasury function operates under 
a Board-approved policy.  This includes approved counter-
party and other limits which are designed to mitigate NEXT’s 
exposure to financial risk. Further details of the Group’s 
treasury operations are given in Note 27 to the financial 
statements.
NEXT has a longstanding policy of returning surplus 
cash to shareholders through share buybacks 
and special dividends, whilst maintaining an 
appropriate level of debt. Adequate financing 
facilities are therefore required to support the 
operational needs of the business.
NEXT has adequate medium and long term financing in 
place to support its business operations, and the Group’s 
cash position and forecasts are regularly monitored and 
reported to the Board.
NEXT is also exposed to credit risk, particularly 
in respect of its Directory customer receivables, 
which at £712m represents the largest item on the 
Group balance sheet.
Rigorous procedures are in place with regard to the 
Group’s Directory account customers, including the use 
of external credit reference agencies and applying set risk 
criteria before acceptance.  These procedures are regularly 
reviewed and updated.

EMPLOYEES
NEXT’s employees are key to achieving business objectives.  NEXT has established policies for recruitment, training 
and development of personnel and is committed to achieving excellence in the areas of health, safety, welfare 
and protection of employees and their working environment.
Equal opportunities and diversity
NEXT is an equal opportunities employer and will continue to ensure it offers career opportunities without 
discrimination.  Full consideration is given to applications for employment from disabled persons, having regard to 
their particular aptitudes and abilities.  The Group has continued the employment wherever possible of any person 
who becomes disabled during their employment.  Opportunities for training, career development and promotion 
do not operate to the detriment of disabled employees.  The following table shows the gender mix of the Group’s 
employees at the end of the financial year:
2015 2014
Males Females Males Females

Subsidiary directors and other senior managers 29 15 29 13
Total employees 15,447 32,115 15,929 34,138
Training and development
NEXT aims to realise the potential of its employees by supporting their career progression and promotion wherever 
possible.  It makes significant investment in the training and development of staff and in training and education 
programmes which contribute to the promotion prospects of employees.
Employee communication
NEXT has a policy of providing employees with financial and other information about the business and ensures 
that the suggestions and views of employees are taken into account.  NEXT has an employee forum made up of 
elected representatives from throughout the business who attend meetings at least twice a year with directors and 
senior managers.  This forum enables and encourages open discussion on key business issues, policies and the 
working environment.
Employee share ownership
Approximately 11,600 employees held options or awards over 6.4 million shares in NEXT at January 2015, being 4.2% 
of the total shares in issue. Its employee share ownership trust (“ESOT”) purchases shares for issue to employees 
when their options are exercised.  At the year end the ESOT held 5.0 million shares; the Trustee generally does not 
vote on this holding on any resolution at General Meetings.
Pension provision
NEXT offers pension benefits to participating employees, details of which are set out in the Remuneration Report 
and in Note 21 to the financial statements.  At January 2015, there were 1,093 (2014: 1,169) active members in the 
Defined Benefit Section of the NEXT Group Pension Plan and 2,853 (2014: 2,775) UK active members of the Defined 
Contribution Section.  In addition, 12,114 employees (2014: 10,134) participate in the Group’s Auto Enrolment 
defined contribution scheme.

STRATEGIC REPORT
SOCIAL, COMMUNITY AND HUMAN RIGHTS
NEXT is committed to the principles of responsible business.  This means addressing key business related social, 
ethical and environmental matters in a way that aims to bring value to all of its stakeholders, including customers 
and shareholders.  Continuous improvement lies at the heart of NEXT’s approach and is achieved by acting 
in an ethical manner, developing positive relationships with suppliers, recruiting and retaining successful and 
responsible employees, taking responsibility for our impact on the environment and through contributions to 
charities and community organisations.
NEXT has a Corporate Responsibility (“CR”) forum of 15 senior managers and directors representing key areas 
of the business to develop and implement strategy. The forum identifies potential issues and opportunities and 
evaluates the success of NEXT’s response.  The CR Manager holds regular updates with the executive director 
responsible for CR.
A third party provides independent assurance on the Group’s CR report which is published on the Company’s 
website each year.  NEXT’s commitment to CR matters is recognised externally by its membership of the FTSE4Good 
Index Series.
Suppliers
In common with other retailers, NEXT’s product supply chain is both diverse and dynamic.  Last year, NEXT used 
over 500 third party suppliers with products manufactured across some 40 countries.  The challenge of trading 
ethically and acting responsibly towards the workers within our own and our suppliers’ factories is a key priority. 
NEXT is a member of the Ethical Trading Initiative and operates its Code of Practice (“COP”), an established set of 
ethical trading standards, as an integral part of its operations.  The NEXT COP has ten key principles that stipulate 
the minimum standards with which suppliers are required to comply in relation to workers’ rights and conditions 
of work including working hours, minimum age of employment, health, safety, welfare and environmental issues. 
NEXT seeks to ensure all products bearing the NEXT brand are produced in a clean and safe environment and in 
accordance with all relevant laws.
NEXT is committed to its supplier audit and management programme and has a COP audit team of 45 staff 
(2014: 45) which carried out more than 1,900 factory audits last year.  The COP team works directly with suppliers 
to identify and address causes of non-compliance.  Each audited factory is measured against the COP’s six tier 
rating system and the supplier is made aware of its rating and what is required to improve via a corrective action 
plan.  This direct approach allows NEXT to build knowledge and understanding in local communities and monitor 
suppliers through its auditing process.
Human rights
NEXT is committed to upholding all basic human rights, as outlined in the United Nations’ Guiding Principles of 
Business and Human Rights.  In 2014 we carried out an initial risk assessment of potential human rights impacts 
across our business, looking at the activities of our own direct operations, as well as those of our UK and overseas 
partners.  Labour rights in our supply chain is a key potential impact area, and is monitored and managed through 
the Next COP programme which reflects international labour conventions. In 2015 we will be using the findings 
from our initial human rights assessment to engage specific business functions as well as some external partners, 
and to prioritise our broader human rights activity.
Customers
NEXT is committed to offering stylish, excellent quality products to its customers, which are well made, functional, 
safe and are sourced in a responsible manner.  NEXT works closely with buyers, designers and suppliers to ensure 
NEXT products comply with all relevant legislation and its own internal standards where these are higher.  The 
expertise of independent safety specialists for clothing, footwear, accessories, beauty and home products is used 
where required.
NEXT endeavours to provide a high quality service to its customers, whether they are shopping through its stores, 
catalogues or website.  These different ways of shopping must be easily accessible for all customers and be 
responsive to their needs.
NEXT Customer Services interacts with Retail and Directory customers to resolve enquiries and issues.  Findings are 
recorded and the information is used by other areas of the business to review how a product or service can be 
improved.

Health and safety
NEXT recognises the importance of health and safety and its management is designed to contribute to business 
performance.  Policies and procedures are reviewed and audited regularly to make safety management more 
robust and current.
The Group’s objective is to manage all aspects of its business in a safe manner and take practical measures to 
ensure that its activities and products do not harm the public, customers, employees or contractors.  Procedures 
exist to enable two way communication and consultation about health, safety and welfare issues in order to 
achieve a high level of safety awareness.

ENVIRONMENTAL MATTERS
NEXT recognises that it has a responsibility to manage the impact of its business on the environment both now and 
in the future.  For several years we have measured and reported against environmental targets for NEXT in the UK 
and Eire.  The targets are measured from 2007 and look forward to 2015/16.
Key areas of focus are:

STRATEGIC REPORT
Greenhouse gas emissions
In our Corporate Responsibility Report last year we provided detailed information on NEXT’s global emissions 
footprint.  In accordance with the disclosure requirements for listed companies under the Companies Act, the 
table below shows the Group’s greenhouse gas emissions during the financial year: 
2015
Tonnes 
of CO
2 
equivalent
2014
Tonnes 
of CO
2
 
equivalent
Combustion of fuel & operation of facilities (Scope 1) 48,747 47,764
Electricity, heat, steam and cooling purchased for own use (Scope 2) 129,491 117,950
Total Scope 1 and Scope 2 emissions 178,238 165,714
Intensity metric: tonnes of CO
2
e per £m of sales 44.25 44.09
Note: 2014 Scope 1 has been re-stated as a result of data reclassification relating to transport from Scope 3 to Scope 1
Methodology
The methodology used to calculate our emissions is in compliance with the ‘Environmental Reporting Guidelines: 
Including mandatory greenhouse gas emissions reporting guidance’ and the UK Government’s GHG Conversion 
Factors for Company Reporting (June 2014) issued by the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs 
(DEFRA).  We report our emissions data using an operational control approach which means we include emissions 
from all parts of the business where we are able to control activities and operating policies.  This approach meets 
the definitional requirements of the Regulations in respect of those emissions for which we are responsible, following 
the guidelines and principles of the WBCSD/WRI Greenhouse Gas Protocol.
NEXT remains committed to reducing its carbon footprint by reducing energy consumption throughout its operations, 
minimising and recycling waste, cutting transport emissions and reducing the packaging in our products.

(Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 in respect of employee matters (including the employment, training 
and advancement of disabled persons), future developments, political donations and greenhouse gas emissions 
are given in the Strategic Report.  Information on financial instruments is given in Notes 27 to 30 of the financial 
statements.
ANNUAL GENERAL MEETING & OTHER MATTERS
Notice of the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) is on pages 121 to 131 and includes the following business:
Dividends
The Directors recommend that a final dividend of 100p per share be paid on 3 August 2015 to shareholders on 
the register of members at close of business on 10 July 2015. This resolution relates only to the final dividend.  As 
described in the Chief Executive’s Review on page 19 the directors may in future decide to pay special dividends 
as long as NEXT’s share price remains consistently above the Board’s buyback price limit.  This arrangement will 
ensure the Company continues to return surplus cash to shareholders, whilst maintaining the flexibility to return to 
buying back shares if and when the share price returns to levels commensurate with the required Equivalent Rate 
of Return.  Any such special dividends will be declared by the directors as interim dividends.  The announcement 
of any dividend will clearly indicate whether it is a special dividend or not.
The Trustee of the NEXT Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) has waived dividends paid in the year on the 
shares held by it, see Note 26. 
Directors 
Dame Dianne Thompson was appointed as a non-executive director on 1 January 2015. Dame Dianne has 
significant senior management experience including 14 years as Chief Executive of Camelot Group after joining 
in 1997 as Commercial Operations Director. During her 42 year career she has also worked in marketing for several 
retail companies and more recently was Chairman of RadioCentre and a non-executive director of the Home 
Office. She is currently President of the Market Research Society.
Amanda James, Group Finance Director from 1 April 2015 following the retirement of David Keens, has been at 
NEXT for 19 years, led the management accounting and commercial finance teams from 2005 and became NEXT 
Brand Finance Director in 2012.  Amanda has comprehensive knowledge of NEXT’s operations and has played a 
central role in the financial management of the business. 
On 15 May 2014, following the 2014 AGM, Christine Cross stepped down as a non-executive director after nine 
years of service and on 10 June 2014 Christos Angelides, Group Product Director, resigned from the Board to pursue 
an external career opportunity.
The UK Corporate Governance Code recommends that all directors of FTSE companies stand for election every 
year and all members of the Board will do so at this year’s AGM, other than Jonathan Dawson who is stepping 
down. Directors’ biographies are set out on page 38.  Each of the directors standing for re-election has undergone 
a performance evaluation and demonstrated that they remain committed to the role and continue to be an 
effective and valuable member of the Board.  The Board is satisfied that each non-executive director offering 
themselves for election or re-election is independent in both character and judgement, and their knowledge and 
other business interests enable them to contribute significantly to the work and balance of the Board.
When Jonathan Dawson steps down from the Board in May, Francis Salway will succeed him as Senior Independent 
Director and Caroline Goodall will succeed him as Remuneration Committee Chair.
The interests of the directors who held office at 24 January 2015 and their families are shown in the Remuneration 
Report on page 56.

DIRECTORS’ REPORT
Auditor
Ernst & Young LLP have expressed their willingness to continue in office and their reappointment will be proposed 
at the AGM. 
Disclosure of information to the auditor
In accordance with the provisions of Section 418 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”), each of the persons 
who is a director at the date of approval of this report confirms that:
 ❚ so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; 
and
 ❚ each director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a director to make themselves aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information. 
The NEXT Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
Ordinary resolution 14 seeks authority from shareholders to allow the continued operation of the NEXT Long Term 
Incentive Plan (“LTIP”).  This plan, which was previously named the NEXT 2006 Performance Share Plan, has been 
operated by NEXT for senior executives since it was initially approved by shareholders at the 2006 AGM.
The LTIP is a senior executive share plan, and its key features remain in line with market and best practice.
Whilst not a provision of the LTIP rules, it is the Company’s policy that for awards granted after January 2014 main 
Board executive director participants must retain the shares acquired for a holding period of 2 years from vesting 
(allowing for any sales to cover payment of tax).  In addition, the Company includes suitable claw-back provisions 
in those executives’ service agreements.
The Company’s initial 10 year authority to operate the LTIP will expire in 2016 and, accordingly, in resolution 14 the 
Company is asking shareholders for a renewed authority to operate the LTIP for a further 10 years.  The directors 
believe that it is appropriate to renew a share plan which has operated as intended and which remains “fit for 
purpose” rather than introducing an entirely new share plan where it is not necessary to do so.  The Company is also 
proposing to renew its standard authority to operate LTIP with appropriate amendments in overseas jurisdictions 
where this is necessary to take account of local laws and regulations.
A summary of the principal terms of the LTIP is set out at Appendix 1 to the Notice of the AGM on page 124.  The 
NEXT LTIP rules will be available for inspection at the registered office of the Company, and at the offices of Pinsent 
Masons, 30 Crown Place, Earl Street, London EC2A 4ES during normal working hours from the date of the Notice of 
the AGM up to the date of the AGM and at the Meeting itself.
Authority to allot shares
Under the 2006 Act, the directors may only allot shares or grant rights to subscribe for, or convert any security into, 
shares if authorised to do so by shareholders in general meeting.  The authority conferred on the directors at last 
year’s AGM under section 551 of the 2006 Act expires on the date of the forthcoming AGM and ordinary resolution 
15 seeks a new authority to allow the directors to allot ordinary shares up to a maximum nominal amount of 
£5,000,000, representing approximately one third of the Company’s existing issued share capital as at 18 March 
2015.  In accordance with institutional guidelines, resolution 15 will also allow directors to allot further ordinary 
shares, in connection with a pre-emptive offer by way of a rights issue, up to a total maximum nominal amount of 
£10,000,000, representing approximately two thirds of the Company’s existing issued share capital as at that date.  
As at 18 March 2015 (being the latest practicable date prior to publication of this document) the Company’s 
issued share capital amounted to £15,287,356 comprising 152,873,556 ordinary shares of 10 pence each, none of 
which are held in treasury.  The directors have no present intention of exercising this authority which will expire at 
the conclusion of the AGM in 2016 or, if earlier, 1 August 2016.

Authority to disapply pre-emption rights
Special resolution 16 will, if passed, renew the directors’ authority pursuant to sections 570 to 573 of the 2006 Act to 
allot equity securities for cash without first offering them to existing shareholders in proportion to their holdings.  This 
resolution limits the aggregate nominal value of ordinary shares which may be issued by the directors on a non 
pre-emptive basis to £764,000, being less than 5% of the issued ordinary share capital as at 18 March 2015.  This 
authority also allows the directors, within the same aggregate limit, to sell for cash, shares that may be held by the 
Company in treasury.  The directors do not have any present intention of exercising this authority which will expire 
at the AGM in 2016 or, if earlier, 1 August 2016. In accordance with the Pre-Emption Group’s Statement of Principles, 
the directors do not intend to issue more than 7.5% of the share capital of the Company for cash under this or 
previous authorities in any rolling three year period without prior consultation with shareholders.
On-market purchase of own shares
NEXT has been returning capital to its shareholders by share repurchases as well as special and ordinary dividends 
since March 2000 as part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in earnings per share.  Over 
this period, and up to 18 March 2015, NEXT has returned over £3.2bn to shareholders by way of share buybacks 
and over £2bn in dividends, of which £297m comprised special dividends.  This buyback activity has enhanced 
earnings per share, given shareholders the opportunity for capital returns (as well as dividends) and has been 
transparent to the financial markets. Share buybacks have not been made at the expense of investment in the 
business.  Over the last five years, NEXT has invested over £567m in capital expenditure to support and grow the 
business.
Special resolution 17 will renew the authority for the Company to make market purchases (as defined in Section 
693 of the 2006 Act) of its ordinary shares of 10p each provided that:
a) the aggregate number of ordinary shares authorised to be purchased shall be the lesser of 22,915,000 ordinary 
shares of 10p each (being less than 15% of the issued share capital at 18 March 2015) and no more than 
14.99% of the issued ordinary share capital outstanding at the date of the AGM, such limits to be reduced by 
the number of any shares to be purchased pursuant to special resolution 18: Off-market purchases of own 
shares, see below;
b) the payment per ordinary share is not less than 10p and not more than 105% of the average of the middle 
market price according to the Daily Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five business days 
immediately preceding the date of purchase or, if higher, the amount stipulated by Article 5(1) of the Buy-back 
and Stabilisation Regulation 2003; and
c) the renewed authority will expire at the AGM in 2016 or, if earlier, 1 August 2016.
The directors intend that this authority to purchase the Company’s shares will only be exercised if doing so will 
result in an increase in earnings per share and, being in the interests of shareholders generally, it is considered to 
promote the success of the Company.  The directors will also give careful consideration to financial gearing levels 
of the Company and its general financial position. The purchase price would be paid out of distributable profits. It 
is the directors’ present intention to cancel any shares purchased under this authority. 
The repurchase of ordinary shares would give rise to a stamp duty liability of the Company at the rate currently of 
0.5% of the consideration paid.
The total number of employee share awards and share options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 18 March 
2015 was 6,223,008.  This represents 4.1% of the issued share capital at that date.  If the Company were to buy 
back the maximum number of shares permitted pursuant to both the existing authority granted at the 2014 AGM 
(which will expire at the 2015 AGM) and the authority sought by this resolution, then the total number of options 
to subscribe for shares outstanding at 18 March 2015 would represent 5.7% of the reduced issued share capital.

Off-market purchases of own shares
The directors consider that share buybacks are an important means of returning value to shareholders and 
maximising sustainable long term growth in EPS.  Contingent contracts for off-market share purchases are an 
integral part of the Company’s buyback strategy and offer a number of additional benefits compared to on-
market share purchases:
 ❚ Contingent contracts allow the Company to purchase shares at a discount to the market price prevailing 
at the date each contract is entered into.  No shares have been bought back under contingent purchase 
contracts pursuant to the authority granted at the 2014 AGM up to 18 March 2015.
 ❚ Low share liquidity can often prevent the Company from purchasing sufficient numbers of shares on a single day 
without risk of affecting the prevailing market price.  Contingent contracts enable the Company to purchase 
shares over time without risk of distorting the prevailing share price, and also spread the cash outflow.
 ❚ Contingent contracts entered into prior to any close period allow the Company to take delivery of shares 
during these periods. 
 ❚ Competitive tendering involving up to five banks is used which minimises the risk of hidden purchase costs.  The 
pricing mechanism ensures the Company retains the benefit of declared and forecast dividends.
 ❚ The Company would also have the option to set a suspension price in individual contracts whereby they would 
automatically terminate if the Company’s share price was to fall.
As with any share buyback decision, the directors would use this authority only after careful consideration, taking 
into account market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities and the overall financial 
position of the Company.  The directors will only purchase shares using such contracts if, based on the contract 
discounted price (rather than any future price), it is earnings enhancing and promotes the success of the Company 
for the benefit of its shareholders generally.  It is the directors’ present intention to cancel any shares purchased 
under this authority. 
Special resolution 18 will give the Company authority to enter into contingent purchase contracts with any of 
Goldman Sachs International, UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Bank plc and Barclays Bank plc under which 
shares may be purchased off-market at a discount to the market price prevailing at the date each contract is 
entered into.  The maximum which the Company would be permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority would 
be the lower of 3,000,000 shares or a total cost of £200 million.
The principal features of the contracts are set out in Appendix 2 to the Notice of the AGM. Copies of the agreements 
the Company proposes to enter into with any of the banks (the “Programme Agreements”) will be available for 
inspection at the registered office of the Company, and at the offices of Pinsent Masons, 30 Crown Place, Earl Street, 
London EC2A 4ES during normal working hours from the date of the Notice of the AGM up to the date of the AGM 
and at the Meeting itself.
Notice of General Meetings
The notice period required by the 2006 Act for general meetings of the Company is 21 days unless shareholders 
approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be less than 14 clear days. However, the Company’s AGM 
must always be held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.  At the AGM of the Company held in 2014, shareholders 
authorised the calling of general meetings other than an AGM on not less than 14 clear days’ notice and it is 
proposed that this authority be renewed.  The authority granted by special resolution 19, if passed, will be effective 
until the Company’s AGM in 2016.  In order to be able to call a general meeting on less than 21 clear days’ notice, 
the Company will make electronic voting available to all shareholders for that meeting.  The flexibility offered by 
this resolution will not be used as a matter of routine for such meetings, but only where the directors consider it 
appropriate, taking account of the business to be considered at the meeting and the interests of the Company 
and its shareholders as a whole.

Recommendation
The Board are of the opinion that all resolutions which are to be proposed at the 2015 AGM will promote the 
success of the Company and are in the best interests of its shareholders as a whole and, accordingly, unanimously 
recommend that you vote in favour of the resolutions. 
Share capital and major shareholders
Details of the Company’s share capital are shown in Note 23 to the financial statements.
The Company was authorised by its shareholders at the 2014 AGM to purchase its own shares.  During the year the 
Company purchased and cancelled 2,158,761 ordinary shares with a nominal value of £215,876 (none of which 
were purchased off-market), at a cost of £137.9m, representing 1.4% of its issued share capital at the start of the 
year.  Share buybacks enhanced this year’s earnings per share by around 2%.  Buybacks during the year were 
made out of cash and profits generated during the year, and therefore did not result in a reduction in the Group’s 
net assets or an increase in debt compared with January 2014.
At the financial year end (24 January 2015) the Company had 152,873,556 shares in issue, which remained the 
same as at 18 March 2015.
The following information has been received from holders of notifiable interests in the Company’s issued share 
capital: 
Notifications received up to 24 January 2015 and as at date of notification
No. of voting rights % of voting rights Nature of holding
FMR LLC (Fidelity) 21,470,075 13.99 Indirect interest
BlackRock, Inc. 15,449,829 9.97 Indirect interest
NEXT plc Employee Share Option Trust 6,190,747 3.99 Direct interest
No other notifications were received after 24 January up to 18 March 2015.
Additional information
Shareholder and voting rights
All members who hold ordinary shares are entitled to attend and vote at the AGM.  On a show of hands at a 
general meeting every member present in person and every duly appointed proxy shall have one vote and on a 
poll, every member present in person or by proxy shall have one vote for every ordinary share held or represented.  
It is intended that voting at the 2015 AGM will be on a poll.  The Notice of Meeting on pages 121 to 131 specifies 
deadlines for exercising voting rights.
The Company is not aware of any agreements between shareholders that may result in restrictions on the transfer 
of securities and voting rights.  There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares in the Company other 
than certain restrictions imposed by laws and regulations (such as insider trading laws and market requirements 
relating to close periods) and requirements of the Listing Rules whereby directors and certain employees of the 
Company require Board approval to deal in the Company’s securities.
The Company’s articles of association may only be amended by a special resolution at a general meeting. 
Directors are elected or re-elected by ordinary resolution at a general meeting; the Board may appoint a director 
but anyone so appointed must be elected by ordinary resolution at the next general meeting.  Under the articles of 
association, directors retire and may offer themselves for re-election at a general meeting at least every three years.  
However, in line with the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code, all directors will stand for re-election at 
the 2015 AGM other than David Keens who is retiring from the Board in April 2015 and Jonathan Dawson who is 
stepping down from the Board at the 2015 AGM.

Change of control
The Company is not party to any significant agreements which take effect, alter or terminate solely upon a change 
of control of the Company following a takeover bid.  However, in the event of a change of control, the Company’s 
medium term borrowing facilities may be subject to early repayment if a majority of the lending banks give written 
notice to the Company within 30 days of the change of control. In addition, should a change of control cause a 
downgrading in the credit rating of the Company’s corporate bonds to sub-investment grade which is not rectified 
within 120 days after the change in control, holders of the bonds have the option to call for redemption of the 
bonds by the Company at their nominal value together with accrued interest. 
The Company’s share option plans, and its long term incentive and share matching plans, contain provisions 
regarding a change of control.  Outstanding options and awards may vest on a change of control, subject to the 
satisfaction of any relevant performance conditions.
Directors’ service contracts are terminable by the Company on giving one year’s notice.  There are no agreements 
between the Company and its directors or employees providing for additional compensation for loss of office or 
employment (whether through resignation, redundancy or otherwise) that occurs because of a takeover bid.

The directors are responsible for preparing the Strategic Report, Directors’ Report and the financial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
As a listed company within the European Union, the directors are required to prepare the Group Financial 
Statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRSs”) as adopted by the EU.  The 
directors have elected to prepare the parent company financial statements in accordance with Companies Act 
2006 and UK Accounting Standard FRS 101 “Reduced Disclosure Framework”.
Under company law the directors must not approve the financial statements unless they are satisfied that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and the Company and of the profit or loss of the Group for 
that period. In preparing the financial statements, the directors are required to:
 ❚ select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
 ❚ make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
 ❚ present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable 
and understandable information;
 ❚ in respect of the Group financial statements, provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific 
requirements of IFRS is insufficient to enable users to understand the impact of particular transactions, other 
events and conditions on the Group’s financial position and performance; and
 ❚ state that the Group has complied with IFRS, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the 
financial statements.
 ❚ in respect of the parent company financial statements, state whether applicable UK accounting standards 
have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and explained in the financial statements; 
and
 ❚ prepare the financial statements on a going concern basis, unless they consider that to be inappropriate. 
The directors confirm that the financial statements comply with the above requirements.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are sufficient to show and explain 
the Company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and the Group and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.  They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection 
of fraud and other irregularities.
Responsibilities Statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
a) the Group financial statements, which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and results of the Group; and 
b) the Strategic Report contained in this annual report includes a fair review of the development and performance 
of the business and the position of the Company and the Group, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Chairman’s introduction
Effective corporate governance is essential to the long term success of our business.
As Chairman, my role is to manage the Board, ensuring it operates effectively and contains the right balance of 
skills and experience to successfully execute the strategy.  The Board is collectively responsible for the long term 
success of the Company and for setting and executing the strategy.
Over many years, NEXT has successfully grown its business and created significant shareholder value against the 
backdrop of a challenging and changing external environment.  This is the ultimate measure of our success and 
reflects our strong corporate governance structure and the effective management team we have in place. We 
remain committed to the robust approach to governance which has served the business well.
Code compliance
Except as noted below under Board composition, the Group complied throughout the year under review with the 
provisions set out in the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code (copies of which can be downloaded from the 
Financial Reporting Council website www.frc.org.uk) and the UK FCA Disclosure and Transparency Rules. Disclosures 
required by DTR 7.2.6 with regard to share capital are presented in the ‘Share capital and major shareholders’ and 
‘Additional information’ sections of the Directors’ Report.
Board composition and succession
During the year there have been a number of Board changes.  The Board currently includes five independent 
non-executive directors and the Chairman who bring considerable knowledge, judgement and experience to 
the Group. The Board has a good record of recruiting new non-executive directors at regular intervals to achieve 
appropriate rotation and continuity. 
Provision B.1.2 of the UK Corporate Governance Code requires that at least half of the Board, excluding the 
Chairman, should comprise non-executive directors determined by the Board to be independent.  The Group 
complied with this requirement save for a four week period between the retirement of Christine Cross, a non-
executive director, on 15 May 2014 and the resignation of Christos Angelides, NEXT’s Group Product Director, on  
10 June 2014. Mr Angelides resigned to pursue an external career opportunity.
On 1 January 2015 Dame Dianne Thompson was appointed to the Board as a non-executive director.  Her 
appointment will ensure the continued good balance of skills and experience on the Board after Jonathan 
Dawson stands down from the Board at the end of the 2015 AGM.  Francis Salway will become Senior Independent 
Director in place of Mr Dawson, and Caroline Goodall will succeed him as Chair of the Remuneration Committee. 
The Board considers that all of its non-executive directors are independent in character and judgement, and their 
knowledge, diversity of experience and other business interests continue to enable them to contribute significantly 
to the work of the Board.  Terms and conditions of appointment of non-executive directors are available for 
inspection at the Company’s registered office during normal business hours.
As announced last year, David Keens will retire as Group Finance Director shortly and Amanda James will be 
appointed in his place.  Amanda has been with NEXT for 19 years and her appointment continues to demonstrate 
NEXT’s successful history of promoting internal candidates to most senior management and executive Board 
positions through career development.
The Company’s Articles of Association require directors to submit themselves for re-election by shareholders at 
least once every three years, however the Board has determined that all directors will stand for re-election at each 
AGM in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Board responsibilities
The Board is responsible for major policy decisions whilst delegating more detailed matters to its committees 
and officers including the Chief Executive.  The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control and 
for monitoring implementation of its policies by the Chief Executive.  The system of internal control is designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only provide reasonable 
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for it and holds regular meetings where it approves major 
decisions, including significant items of capital expenditure, investments, treasury and dividend policy.  Board 
papers including reports from the Chief Executive and other executive directors are circulated in advance of each 
Board meeting.  The Board is responsible for approving semi-annual Group budgets.  Performance against budget 
is reported to the Board monthly and any substantial variances are explained.  Forecasts for each half year are 
revised and reviewed monthly.  Certain other important matters are subject to weekly or monthly reporting to the 
Board or Board Committee, including sales, treasury operations and capital expenditure.  There is a regular flow of 
written and verbal information between all directors irrespective of the timing of meetings.
All new directors receive a personalised induction programme, tailored to their experience, background and 
understanding of the Group’s operations. Individual training needs are reviewed regularly and training is provided 
where a need is identified or requested.  All directors receive frequent updates on a variety of issues relevant to the 
Group’s business, including regulatory and governance issues.
Meetings of the non-executive directors without the executive directors being present are held at least annually, 
both with and without the Chairman.  The Company Secretary attends all Board meetings and is responsible for 
advising the Board on corporate governance matters and facilitating the flow of information within the Board.
The Board has appointed committees to carry out certain of its duties, three of which are detailed below.  Each of 
these is chaired by a different director and has written terms of reference which are available for inspection on the 
Company’s website (www.nextplc.co.uk) or on request. 
Attendance at meetings
The Board held ten formal meetings during the year and these were fully attended with the exception that Christine 
Cross missed two meetings and Dianne Thompson missed one meeting.  The Audit Committee held five meetings 
which were fully attended. The Remuneration Committee held nine meetings which were fully attended with the 
exception that Francis Salway and Christine Cross each missed one meeting.  The Nomination Committee held 
one meeting which was fully attended.  In advance of the meetings that the directors missed, they reviewed the 
meeting papers and communicated their comments to the Company Secretary and Chairman who ensured 
these were considered at the meetings.

Audit Committee
The Committee consists of the current five independent non-executive directors including the senior non-executive 
director and at least one member (Steve Barber, the Committee Chairman) with recent and relevant financial 
experience.  Dame Dianne Thompson was appointed to the Committee in February 2015. Jonathan Dawson 
will stand down at the 2015 AGM following which the Committee will consist of four independent non-executive 
directors.  The Audit Committee Report on page 45 describes the role and activities of the Committee.
Remuneration Committee
The Committee consists of the Chairman and currently five independent non-executive directors.  The Committee 
is chaired by Jonathan Dawson, who will stand down at the 2015 AGM and will be succeeded by Caroline Goodall. 
Dame Dianne Thompson was appointed to the Committee in February 2015.  The Committee determines the 
remuneration of the executive directors in accordance with the Remuneration Policy and reviews the remuneration 
of senior management.  Page 64 of the Remuneration Report summarises the role and activities of the Committee. 
Nomination Committee
The Committee consists of the Chairman and currently five independent non-executive directors (Jonathan 
Dawson will stand down at the 2015 AGM), including the senior non-executive director.  Dame Dianne Thompson 
was appointed to the Committee in February 2015.  The Committee meets whenever necessary to consider 
succession planning for directors and other senior executives, to ensure that requisite skills and expertise are 
available to the Board to address future challenges and opportunities.
External consultants may be used to assist in identifying suitable external Board candidates, based on a written 
specification for each appointment.  The Chairman is responsible for providing a shortlist of candidates for 
consideration by the Committee which then makes its recommendation for final approval by the Board.  In seeking 
a suitable candidate for the recent non-executive vacancy, JCA Group, an external executive search agency, was 
engaged. JCA Group has no other connection with the Company.
Appointments to the Board, as with other positions within the Group, are made on merit according to the balance 
of skills and experience offered by prospective candidates.  Whilst acknowledging the benefits of diversity, individual 
appointments are made irrespective of personal characteristics such as race, religion or gender. The number of 
directors, senior managers and employees by gender is given in the Strategic Report.
Chairman
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the offices of Chairman and Chief Executive, which is set out in 
writing and agreed by the Board.  The Chairman manages the Board to ensure: that the Group has appropriate 
objectives and an effective strategy; that there is a high calibre Chief Executive with a team of executive directors 
able to implement the strategy; that there are procedures in place to inform the Board of performance against 
objectives; and that the Group is operating in accordance with a high standard of corporate governance.
The current Chairman became a member of the Board in 2002 and was an independent non-executive director 
of the Company prior to his appointment as Chairman on 17 May 2006.  His other significant commitments are 
noted on page 38, and the Board considers that these are not a constraint on his agreed time commitment to 
the Company.
Chief Executive
The Board sets objectives and annual targets for the Chief Executive to achieve.  The Board is responsible for 
general policy on how these objectives are achieved and delegates the implementation of that policy to the Chief 
Executive.  The Chief Executive is required to report at each Board meeting all material matters affecting the Group 
and its performance.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE
Management delegation
The Chief Executive has delegated authority for the day to day management of the business to operational 
management drawn from executive directors and other senior management who have responsibility for the 
respective areas.  The most important management meetings are the weekly NEXT Brand trading and capital 
expenditure meetings which consider the performance and development of the NEXT Brand through its different 
distribution channels.  These meetings cover risk management of all business areas in respect of the NEXT Brand 
including product, sales, property, warehousing, systems and personnel. Key performance indicators are monitored 
daily and weekly. 
Directors’ conflicts of interest
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association, the Board has a formal system in place for directors to 
declare situational conflicts to be considered for authorisation by those directors who have no interest in the matter 
being considered.  In deciding whether to authorise a situational conflict, the non-conflicted directors consider 
the situation in conjunction with their general duties under the Companies Act 2006.  They may impose limits 
or conditions when giving an authorisation or subsequently if considered appropriate.  Any situational conflicts 
considered by the Board, and any authorisations given, are recorded in the Board minutes and in a register of 
conflicts which is reviewed annually by the Board. 
Performance evaluation
This year an internal board and committee evaluation was completed with the process being facilitated by the 
Company Secretary.  The senior independent non-executive director appraises the performance of the Chairman 
through discussions with all the directors individually and, together with the Chairman, appraises the performance 
of the Chief Executive. The performance of the executive directors is monitored throughout the year by the Chief 
Executive and the Chairman.  The Chairman also monitors the performance of the non-executive directors.
An externally facilitated review was carried out in 2012/13 by PricewaterhouseCoopers; this concluded that there 
were no significant weaknesses or risks that required attention.  The Board intends to conduct the next externally 
facilitated review during 2015/16 in line with the UK Corporate Governance Code’s recommendation that one is 
conducted every three years.

Risk management
The Board is responsible for the Group’s risk management process and has delegated responsibility for its 
implementation to the Chief Executive and senior management best qualified in each area of the business.  
The Board sets guidance on the general level of risk which is acceptable and has a considered approach to 
evaluating risk and reward.
Risk management and internal control is a continuous process and has been considered by the Board on a 
regular basis throughout the year.  This includes identifying and evaluating key risks, determining control strategies 
and considering how they may impact on the achievement of the business objectives.  The Board promotes the 
development of a strong control culture within the business.  The Audit Committee regularly reviews strategic and 
operational risk, and has reviewed the key risks (described on pages 24 to 26) and the associated controls and 
mitigating factors.
The Board confirms that it has reviewed the Group’s system of internal control and risk management (including 
financial, operational, compliance and risk management) and considers it to be appropriate and effective.  The 
risk management process has been in place for the year under review and up to the date of approval of the 
Annual Report.
The Board considers that the Group’s management structure and continuous monitoring of key performance 
indicators provide the ability to identify promptly any material areas of concern. Business continuity plans, 
procedures manuals and codes of conduct are maintained in respect of specific major risk areas and business 
processes.  Through these measures the management of business risk is an integral part of Group policy and the 
Board will continue to develop risk management and internal controls where necessary.
The use of a Group accounting manual and prescribed reporting requirements for finance teams throughout the 
Group ensures that the Group’s accounting policies are clearly established and consistently applied.  Information 
is appropriately reviewed and reconciled as part of the reporting process and the use of a standard reporting 
package by all entities in the Group ensures that information is presented consistently to facilitate the production 
of the consolidated financial statements.
Personal use of company assets
The Board carried out a review during the year and confirmed that there has been no improper personal use of 
company assets by directors.  Policies are in place to ensure approval procedures are applied to expense claims 
and that these are in accordance with service agreements.  The Remuneration Committee has reviewed the level 
of benefits in kind provided to executive directors, and considers them to be appropriate.

Relations with shareholders
The Board’s primary role is to promote the success of the Company and the interests of shareholders.  The Board is 
accountable to shareholders for the performance and activities of the Group.
The Board communicates with its shareholders in respect of the Group’ s business activities through its Annual Report, 
yearly and half yearly announcements, interim management statements and other regular trading statements.  
Full year, interim and other public announcements are presented in a consistent format with a particular focus on 
making the presentations as meaningful, understandable and comparable as possible.  This information is also 
made publicly available via the Company’s website. 
All shareholders have an opportunity to ask questions or represent their views to the Board at the Annual General 
Meeting.  The Company’s largest shareholders are invited to the annual and interim results presentations, at which 
executive and non-executive directors are present.  Non-executive directors attend other meetings with shareholders 
if requested. Shareholder views are also communicated to the Board through the inclusion in Board reports of 
shareholder feedback and statements made by representative associations.  Whilst the Board recognises that it is 
primarily accountable to the Company’s shareholders, the views of other providers of capital are also considered.
The Board takes care not to disseminate information of a share price sensitive nature which is not available to the 
market as a whole.
Going concern
The Group’s business activities, together with the factors likely to affect its future development, performance and 
position are set out in the Strategic Report.  The Strategic Report also describes the Group’s financial position, cash 
flows and borrowing facilities, further information on which is detailed in the financial statements.  Information on 
the Group’s financial management objectives, and how derivative instruments are used to hedge its capital, credit 
and liquidity risks is provided in Note 27 to the financial statements.
The Directors report that, having reviewed current performance and forecasts, they have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources to continue its operations for the foreseeable future.  For this reason, they 
have continued to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements.

AUDIT COMMITTEE REPORT
Audit Committee and external audit
The composition of the Committee is described on page 41.
The Committee holds regular, structured meetings and consults with external auditors and senior management, 
including internal audit, where appropriate.  The Committee frequently requests that executive directors and senior 
managers attend meetings in order to reinforce a strong culture of risk management and to keep the Committee 
up to date with events in the business.  The Group Finance Director attended all of this year’s meetings and the 
Group Chairman attended all but one.
The Audit Committee regularly reviews strategic and operational risk, and has reviewed the key risks (described on 
pages 24 to 26) and the associated controls and mitigating factors.  The Audit Committee receives regular reports 
and briefings from internal audit and has reviewed the level of internal audit resource available within the Group 
and believes that it is adequate for the size, structure and business risks of the Group and is supplemented with 
appropriate external resources where needed.
The Committee’s review of the interim and full year financial statements focused on the following areas of 
significance:
a)  Directory receivables and related provisions for doubtful debts.  These, at £712m, represent the largest asset 
class on the Group’s balance sheet.  The Committee regularly reviews the basis and level of provisions and was 
satisfied that the judgements taken were reasonable, consistent and appropriate;
b)  Pension scheme funding, accounting and actuarial reports. Prepared in accordance with International 
Accounting Standards, the Group’s balance sheet shows a net surplus of £38m, comprised of £775m assets 
and £737m liabilities.  This compares with a net surplus of £70m in the previous year.  The assumptions underlying 
the calculations are highly sensitive to small changes, particularly in respect of discount rates (see Note 21 to 
the accounts), and are not intended to reflect the full cost of a fully funded pension buy-out;
c)  Foreign currency hedging. Forward contracts and options are used to manage the Sterling cost of future 
product purchases; this enables selling prices and gross margins to be set.  The systems and processes in 
relation to the valuation and accounting treatment of such contracts were reviewed with management and 
agreed with the external auditor;
d)  Judgemental accounting areas.  There is a requirement for industry specific and general accounting estimates, 
including those in respect of stock valuation, product returns rates, onerous leases, gift card redemptions, 
taxation and share schemes.  The Committee satisfied itself as to the reasonableness and consistency of these 
estimates through discussions with management and the external auditor.
These were also addressed at the planning stage of the external audit and there were no significant differences 
between management and external auditor conclusions.
The Audit Committee performed a detailed review of the Group’s projected cash flows, facilities and covenants 
and reported to the Board that, in its view, the going concern assumption remains appropriate.
The operations of the Group and, in particular the Directory business, are highly reliant on the Group’s IT systems. 
The Committee receives regular briefings from the IT and operations teams covering various aspects of IT and cyber 
security.  In this rapidly moving area, there is inevitably a risk that a systems failure or cyber-attack could cause 
significant business disruption.  Significant resources are therefore devoted to the development, maintenance and 
security of the IT systems.
The Committee also received reports and presentations from senior management on significant activities of the 
Group, including Directory marketing and e-commerce, regulatory developments, critical supplier risk management, 
property, corporate responsibility and Code of Practice (ethical and responsible sourcing).  The Group’s internal 
control functions in areas such as Finance, IT, and Product are regularly reviewed by the Committee.  Frequent 
briefings are received on Health and Safety, Risk Management, Business Continuity, Whistleblowing and Corporate 
Governance generally.

The Committee is aware of the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) proposal for bringing all leases 
on to the balance sheet. The Chairman of the Committee and Group Finance Director have had meetings with 
representatives of accounting standard setters, and other interested parties, to express the Group’s opposition to 
the current proposals.  Implementation of the IASB proposal would fundamentally change the Group’s balance 
sheet by bringing on some £2bn (undiscounted) of theoretical “right to use” assets, together with broadly matching 
lease liabilities.  The proposals would have no impact on the Group’s cash flows; but would add volatility, complexity 
and assumptions to the balance sheet as the Group actively manages the 500+ properties from which it trades or 
leases, as well as adding compliance costs.
The Committee had discussions with the external auditor on audit planning, fees, accounting policies, audit 
findings and internal control.  The external auditor attended all of this year’s Committee meetings. Meetings are 
also held with the auditor without management present.  The effectiveness of the audit was assessed through 
the review of audit plans, reports and conclusions and through discussions with management and the external 
auditor.  The Committee was satisfied that the audit was effective.
The Audit Committee is responsible for recommending the appointment, re-appointment and removal of 
the external auditor.  Consideration is given each year to an audit tender process, however, a tender was not 
considered necessary during the current year. EY , or its predecessor firms, have been the Group’s auditor for over 20 
years.  There has been regular partner rotation, most recently in 2012.  The Committee is satisfied that EY continues 
to possess the skills and experience required to fulfil its duties effectively and efficiently.  The appointment of the 
external auditor will continue to be reviewed annually and a tendering process will be undertaken to coincide 
with the rotation of the current audit partner in 2017, or earlier if the Committee considers it appropriate.  The 
Committee also acknowledges the recent change in the law requiring mandatory auditor rotation.
EY have reported to the Committee that, in their professional judgement, they are independent within the meaning 
of regulatory and professional requirements and the objectivity of the audit engagement partner and audit staff 
is not impaired.  The Audit Committee has assessed the independence of the auditor, and concurs with this 
statement.
In order to ensure the continued independence and objectivity of the Group’s external auditor, the Board has 
strict policies regarding the provision of non-audit services by the external auditor.  The Audit Committee’s approval 
is required in advance for the provision of any non-audit services if the fee exceeds £100,000 for an individual 
assignment, or if the aggregate non-audit fees for the year exceed either £150,000 or 20% of the audit fee.  The 
Committee reviews audit and non-audit fees twice a year.  Proposed assignments of non-audit services with 
anticipated fees in excess of £50,000 are generally subject to competitive tender and decisions on the award 
of work are made on the basis of competence, cost-effectiveness and legislation.  A tender process may not be 
undertaken where existing knowledge of the Group enables the auditor to provide the relevant services more cost-
effectively than other parties.  The Group’s external auditor is prohibited from providing any services that would 
conflict with their statutory responsibilities or which would otherwise compromise their objectivity or independence. 
During the year, EY’s audit fee amounted to £0.5m and EY’s non-audit fees were less than £0.1m in total. 
The Committee has reviewed its Terms of Reference and composition, and believes that both are appropriate.

REMUNERATION REPORT
This report sets out the remuneration of NEXT’s directors for the year to January 2015 and is in three parts: (1) 
Remuneration Committee Chairman’s statement, (2) annual report on remuneration, and (3) the directors’ 
remuneration policy which was approved by shareholders at the 2014 AGM.  Each part is prepared in accordance 
with Schedule 8 to the Large and Medium-sized Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) (Amendment) 
Regulations 2013 (“the new regulations”), UK Listing Rules and UK Corporate Governance Code. 
PART 1: REMUNERATION COMMITTEE CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
The approach of NEXT’s Remuneration Committee has remained consistent with previous years; executive directors 
receive a mix of annual and long term incentives which reward strong business and financial performance in line 
with the Company’s strategy and which are measured against robust benchmarks.  We place special importance 
on rewarding consistently strong performance over longer periods and, therefore, the balance of incentives is 
tilted towards the Long Term Incentive Plan, with its 3 year performance period and 2 year holding period following 
vesting. 
During the past year NEXT has achieved record profit before tax of £782.2m and record Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) 
of 419.8p (both measured before exceptional disposal gains) representing annual growth of 12.5% and 14.7% 
respectively; over the past 3 years EPS has grown by a compound annual average of 18% and profit before tax by 
11%.  Ordinary dividends have grown by a compound annual average of 19% and a further £223m was paid as 
special dividends.  The Committee considers that the remuneration arrangements promote the long term success 
of the Company within a suitable risk framework, are suitably aligned to enhancing shareholder value and that 
the actual remuneration earned by the executive directors continues to be a good reflection of their and NEXT’s 
overall performance.
The Committee has addressed the following matters this year:
Remuneration Policy
Our remuneration policy was approved at the 2014 AGM with 98% of votes cast in favour.  The Committee gave 
full consideration to the operation of the policy prior to proposing it to shareholders at the AGM and considers the 
level of support obtained to be a strong endorsement.  The Committee is not proposing changes to the current 
policy.
Base salaries
Base salaries for executive directors were increased in February 2015 by 1% (having increased by 2% in both 2013 
and 2014), in line with the wider company award. 
Earlier in the year, the Committee determined that the base salaries for Michael Law and Jane Shields would be 
reappraised.  Michael and Jane were promoted to the Board in July 2013 but did not receive salary increases at 
that time.  The Committee agreed that from August 2014 their base salaries should increase from £306k to £400k 
due to their development and contribution as executive directors since their promotion.  This progression reflects 
the Committee’s belief that salary increases should be timed to reflect performance and contribution rather than 
simply promotion, and is consistent with the approved remuneration policy.
Annual bonus
As has been the case for many years at NEXT, annual bonus is calculated with reference to pre-tax EPS, including 
the impact of share buybacks.  In last year’s Remuneration Report we set out the basis on which we would ensure 
that executive directors are not incentivised to recommend share buybacks to the Board in preference to special 
dividends, or vice versa.  This is achieved by making a notional adjustment to EPS growth for special dividends, 
on the basis that the cash distributed had instead been used to purchase shares at the prevailing share price on 
the day of the special dividend payment.  Had no adjustment been made, this year’s performance would have 
resulted in a bonus of 98%. After adjustment, the bonus increased to the capped maximum potential of 100% of 
salary (150% for Lord Wolfson, with 50% payable in shares deferred for two years).  It should also be noted that we 
have excluded exceptional gains of £12.6m from this EPS calculation. Details of the targets set for last year are on 
page 50.

REMUNERATION REPORT
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) and Share Matching Plan (“SMP”)
As set out in the Remuneration Report last year, the Committee simplified the overall structure of longer term 
incentives for executive directors.  They are now granted only LTIP awards and no longer receive SMP awards.  We 
believe that a single award is appropriate and in line with our philosophy of clarity to shareholders.
LTIP awards are granted twice a year (each at 100% of base salary for executive directors) and, therefore, during 
the year, the Committee approved two grants and two awards matured.  Over the performance periods for the 
maturing awards, i.e. August 2011 to January 2015, NEXT’s share price rose from £23.36 to £71.50 and its market 
capitalisation grew from £4.0 billion to £10.9 billion.  £792m was paid to shareholders in ordinary and special 
dividends and a further £778m was returned to shareholders through share buybacks.  The LTIP for the three year 
performance period to July 2014 vested 100% as NEXT’s TSR ranked first out of 21 companies in the comparator 
group and the LTIP for the period to January 2015 also vested 100% as NEXT’s TSR ranked fourth.  Details of the 
comparator group are set out on pages 60 to 61. 
The estimated value of these matured awards is substantial (see the Single Total Figure of Remuneration table on 
page 52); as there was no change in the basis of grant, this is largely due to the 206% rise in NEXT’s share price 
over the performance periods.  As disclosed last year, since executive directors are no longer granted SMP awards, 
the Committee removed the self-imposed £2.5m cap on the maximum value of LTIPs vesting for any participant in 
any one year for LTIP awards granted after January 2014.  The cap will remain in force for LTIPs with performance 
periods ending in the financial years to January 2015 and 2016.  Accordingly, the cap will be applied again this 
year and, as a result, Lord Wolfson’s LTIP payments are expected to be reduced by an estimated £1,402k (2014 
reduction £1,457k).
During 2014 the Committee reviewed the LTIP to ensure that it continues to operate as intended, and as a result 
made a modification to the rules to ensure that the Committee has the ability to reduce or withdraw awards where 
a person is subject to disciplinary processes.  Taking into account the successful operation of the current LTIP , the 
Committee agreed to recommend to shareholders at the 2015 AGM to support a resolution to renew the LTIP 
rules for a further 10 years.  The rules are the same as for the current LTIP and are consistent with best practice; the 
principal terms are set out in the Notice of Meeting Appendix 1 on page 124. 
SMP
While the Committee decided last year that executive directors should no longer participate in the SMP , legacy 
awards will run their course.  The 2012 SMP met its performance condition and will vest in full in April 2015, subject 
to the continued employment of participants. Lord Wolfson did not participate in the 2012 SMP .  The SMP remains 
open to a small number of senior executives below Board level.
EPS and performance measurement
The Committee reviews each year the basis and performance measures used for the annual bonus and LTIP .  The 
performance measure for the annual bonus continues to be based on growth in pre-tax EPS.
The principal reasons for using the EPS measure have been set out in previous Remuneration Reports.  They are:
 ❚ it is consistent and transparent to participants and shareholders;
 ❚ NEXT is predominantly a single business selling products through a number of channels under the NEXT and 
third party brands.  No significant earnings are derived from uncorrelated businesses and, therefore, a group 
metric such as EPS is logical and consistent with strategy;
 ❚ EPS continues to be the core financial measure by which the Board assesses overall performance; and
 ❚ the use of EPS is complemented by the application of TSR and consideration of the general economic underpin 
condition for the LTIP .

As set out in previous years, we consider it right that the impact of share buybacks on EPS should be included 
in performance measurement as, for more than a decade, share buybacks have been one of NEXT’s primary 
strategies in generating value for shareholders.  Share buybacks are regularly considered by the Board and are 
subject to prior approval as to timing, price and volume.  Shares are only bought when the Board is satisfied 
that the ability to invest in the business and to grow the ordinary dividend will not be impaired.  Similarly, the 
Board sets the minimum return required from share buybacks and makes special dividend payments where that 
return cannot be achieved.  As I explained last year, the Committee concluded that the basis of calculation for 
this purpose should incorporate an appropriate adjustment to reflect the benefit to shareholders from special 
dividends paid in the period.  This ensures there is no unintentional reward or penalty for management arising from 
buybacks or special dividends as a means of returning value to shareholders.  The Board will maintain the same 
robust discipline over the level of special dividends as it does with regard to share buybacks.
Recommendation
Each year the Committee reviews the level of performance-related pay earned by the executive directors.  The 
Committee considers that the remuneration earned continues to be a fair reflection of NEXT’s operating and 
financial performance and is aligned to shareholders’ experience over the past 3 years.  We believe that the 
simplicity and transparency of our remuneration arrangements and their consistent application have contributed 
positively to NEXT’s strong management team continuing to deliver resilient performance. 
We focus on maintaining an appropriate balance between annual and long term incentive elements and also 
between cash and share-based elements, with the aim of ensuring that remuneration drives the right behaviours 
and rewards the right outcomes.  We believe that weighting rewards towards the long term ensures proper 
shareholder alignment, which is illustrated by the significant proportion of directors’ performance-related pay 
derived from growth in NEXT’s share price.
There are no proposed changes to the remuneration policy approved last year by shareholders and accordingly 
this year there is only an advisory vote on the implementation of the policy together with a separate resolution 
to renew the LTIP .  The Committee believes that last year’s remuneration has been in line with both the approved 
policy and its spirit. Therefore, on behalf of the Committee, I commend the report and the renewal of the LTIP to you 
for approval.
This is my final report to shareholders as Remuneration Committee chairman as I retire from the Board in May after 
the AGM.  It has been a great privilege serving on the Board.  I have the highest confidence in NEXT and all of its 
employees and I wish the Company every success in the future.

REMUNERATION REPORT
PART 2: ANNUAL REPORT ON REMUNERATION
Sections of the annual report on remuneration which have been subject to audit are noted accordingly.
IMPLEMENTATION OF REMUNERATION POLICY
The Committee has operated the remuneration policy in accordance with the policy approved by shareholders 
at the AGM in May 2014.  The table below sets out the way that the policy was implemented in 2014 and any 
significant changes in the way the policy will be implemented in 2015.
Element of Remuneration Changes for 2014 and 2015
Salary The Committee determined that the base salaries of Michael Law and Jane Shields 
would be reappraised after their appointment to the Board. Michael and Jane were 
appointed in July 2013 but did not receive an increase in base salary at that time. 
The Committee agreed that from August 2014 their base salaries should increase 
from £306k to £400k due to their growing experience and contribution over the year. 
These increases reflect the Committee’s belief that salary increases should reward 
performance and contribution rather than simply promotion.  While the Committee 
does not place significant emphasis on benchmark data, it is worth noting that the 
increased salaries remain below a median level for directors of equivalent companies. 
Base salaries of the executive directors increased by 1% in February 2015, in line with 
the wider company award. Base salaries for the executive directors from February 2015 
are:
£’000
Lord Wolfson 751
David Keens 501
Michael Law 404
Jane Shields 404
Annual Bonus No change.
Annual bonus is calculated on pre-tax EPS and we ensure that the executive directors 
are not incentivised to recommend share buybacks in preference to special dividends, 
or vice versa. This is achieved by making a notional adjustment to EPS for special 
dividends, on the basis that the cash distributed had instead been used to purchase 
shares at the prevailing share price on the day of the special dividend payment.
For the year to January 2015, performance targets were set requiring pre-tax EPS growth 
on the prior year, adjusted for special dividends and excluding exceptional gains, of 
5% before any bonus became payable (being pre-tax EPS of 483p).  Maximum bonus 
of 100% and 150% of salary for the executive directors and Chief Executive respectively 
was payable if pre-tax EPS exceeded growth of 15% (being pre-tax EPS of 529p).
Pre-tax EPS growth achieved in the year excluding exceptional gains was 14.7%, which 
became 16.9% after making the prescribed adjustment for special dividends and was 
well in excess of the 15% EPS growth at which point bonus reached its capped level. 
Accordingly, a bonus of 100% of salary for the executive directors and 150% of salary 
for the Chief Executive was earned. 
Bonus performance targets for the year ahead have been set but are not disclosed 
in advance for reasons of commercial sensitivity.  The targets and performance will be 
disclosed in next year’s Remuneration Report.

Element of Remuneration Changes for 2014 and 2015
LTIP No change. See Single Total Figure of Remuneration table, note 5 for details of LTIP 
vestings in the year.
Claw-back & holding 
periods
The Committee previously introduced malus/claw-back provisions in the service 
contracts of all executive directors to cover the bonus and LTIP, and a 5 year from 
grant holding period (comprising a 3 year vesting period and a 2 year holding period) 
under the LTIP for executive directors.  They reconsidered these matters following the 
introduction of the new Corporate Governance Code and concluded that these 
provisions remain appropriate.
SMP No change to policy and with effect from 2014 executive directors are no longer eligible 
to receive grants.
Chairman and non-
executive director fees 
The fees of the Chairman and non-executive directors were increased by 1% in February 
2015, in line with the wider company award.  The Chairman will be paid an annual 
fee of £262,701 (2014/15: £260,100).  The basic non-executive director fee is £54,086 
(2014/15: £53,550), with a further £10,817 (2014/15: £10,710) paid to the Chairmen of 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees, and to the Senior Independent Director.

*  Lord Wolfson waived his entitlement to the 2011 SMP award that would have matured in April 2014 at a value of £4.3m. Had he not done so, Lord Wolfson’s total remuneration would have been £8,947,000 for 2013/14.
†  Christos Angelides stepped down from the Board in June 2014 and continued in his role as Group Product Director until he left the business in September 2014. The table shows his remuneration only for the period he remained 
on the Board.  Similarly, Andrew Varley stepped down from the Board in May 2013 and continued in his role as Group Property Director until he retired from the business in May 2014; LTIP remuneration of £631,000 and £842,000 
(for the three year performance periods ending July 2013 and January 2014 respectively) was paid to him after he stepped down from the Board and prior to his retirement.  During this time his 2011 SMP award also vested at a 
value of £2.1m. Christine Cross stepped down from the Board in May 2014.  No compensation for loss of office was paid to these directors.
‡  Michael Law and Jane Shields joined the Board in July 2013.  The 2013/14 values disclosed for salary, benefits and salary supplement relate only to the period of their executive directorship in that financial year.  Performance-
related remuneration includes pay relating to the period before they became executive directors but paid after their appointment. 
Total emoluments paid to directors (salary/fees, benefits, salary supplements and annual bonus) for the year to January 2015 were £5,440,000 (2014: £5,828,000).

Note 2: Pension 
Pension values are calculated using the method required by remuneration regulations, i.e. the total pension 
accrued at January 2015 less the total pension accrued at the end of the previous year, adjusted for inflation 
and multiplied by a factor of 20.  It does not necessarily represent the economic value of the pension rights 
accrued and this benefit is not immediately available to the director.  Consistent with other staff participating 
in the plans, directors’ salaries are frozen for pension purposes at October 2012, but directors may continue to 
accrue pensionable service.
In summary, the pension entitlements of the directors are as follows:
Age at 
January 
2015
Years of 
pensionable 
service
Accrued 
annual 
pension 
£’000

Years of pensionable service shown above may include bought-in service from the transfer of other pension 
entitlements into the Plan.  Directors’ pension arrangements are subject to the same actuarial reduction as other 
employees on termination or early retirement.
Note 3: Salary supplement in lieu of pension
Supplements of 15% of base salary are paid in lieu of pension provision after the directors became deferred 
members of the defined benefit section of the NEXT Group Pension Plan.  David Keens, Jane Shields and Andrew 
Varley received this supplement from 2011, Michael Law from April 2012 and Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides 
from November 2012.
Note 4: Annual bonus
Details of the performance targets for the annual bonus are set out on page 50. For the year to January 2015 a 
bonus of 150% of salary for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for the other executive directors was earned. 
To provide a retention element in the case of the Chief Executive, any annual bonus in excess of 100% of base 
salary is payable in shares, deferred for a period of two years and subject to forfeiture if he voluntarily resigns prior 
to the end of that period.
Note 5: LTIP
Performance targets for the LTIP are set out on page 69.  For the three year period to July 2014, NEXT’s TSR ranked 
first in the comparator group of 21 and 100% of the grant made in the second half of 2011 vested.  The Committee 
reviewed the Company’s financial performance against underlying economic and other conditions (‘the 
economic underpin’) and noted that, during this period, the Company’s compound average annual growth in 
underlying EPS and pre-tax profits was 19.0% and 9.7% respectively, significantly ahead of RPI (2.9%).  Ordinary 
dividends also increased broadly in line with EPS and some £894m was returned to shareholders through share 
buybacks and special dividends.  The Company’s performance also compared favourably against its principal 
retail competitors and FTSE 100 companies.  The Committee confirmed that the economic underpin performance 
condition had been satisfied and, as a consequence, 100% of the award vested. 
For the three year period to January 2015, NEXT’s TSR ranked fourth in a comparator group of 21 which gives 
an expected vesting of 100% of the award made in January 2012.  In March 2015 the Committee reviewed 
the Company’s financial performance on the same basis as described above and noted that the Company’s 
compound annual growth in EPS and pre-tax profit was 18.0% and 11.1% respectively, significantly ahead of RPI 
(2.4%). Ordinary dividends continued to increase in line with EPS and £898m was returned to shareholders through 
share buybacks and special dividends.  The Committee also assessed earnings growth against the comparator 
group of 21 retailers and concluded that NEXT had performed favourably.  The Company’s performance also 
compared favourably against its principal retail competitors and FTSE 100 companies.  The Committee confirmed 
that the economic underpin performance condition had been satisfied and, as a consequence, 100% of the 
award vested.
LTIP values for the January 2015 single figure table comprise the actual value of awards that have vested and 
been paid for the performance period ending July 2014 plus the estimated value of awards that will vest for the 
performance period ending January 2015 based on the average NEXT share price over the final three months of 
£66.66.  For the January 2014 figures, numbers have been updated to the actual values of the LTIP awards that 
vested in respect of performance periods ending in that financial year.
The maximum value of LTIP awards that vest for a participant in a year is capped at £2.5m.  This cap was applied 
to awards that vested in the year to January 2014 for Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides and their payments 
were reduced by £1,457k and £1,089k respectively. For the awards vesting in the year to January 2015, the cap will 
again be applied and the payment to Lord Wolfson will be reduced by an estimated £1,402k.  The cap will remain 
in force for vesting LTIPs with performance periods ending in the financial year January 2016 and, in conjunction 
with the SMP decision made by the Committee during 2013/14, will be removed thereafter. 
Note 6: SMP
Whilst executive directors will not receive further grants, legacy awards will run their course.  The performance 
targets are set out on page 61. 
Estimated values for the 2012 award assume maximum vesting in April 2015 and are based on the average 
NEXT share price over the three months to January 2015 of £66.66.  Strong growth in EPS means the maximum 
performance target for this SMP has been achieved and therefore it will vest in full in April 2015, subject to the 
continued employment of participants.  The estimated total pre-tax value for executive directors is £827k, of which 
£450k (54%) derives from the growth in NEXT’s share price since investment in 2012.
The SMP values for January 2014 are actual values at the date of vesting.  23849.04    8 April 2015 7:29 AM    Proof 2
REMUNERATION REPORT
Executive directors’ external appointments
No current executive director holds any non-executive directorships outside the Group.
PENSION ENTITLEMENTS (AUDITED)
In 2013 all active members of the NEXT Group Pension Plan (the “NEXT Plan”), were transferred to the new 2013 
NEXT Group Pension Plan (the “2013 Plan”) so that pensioners of the NEXT Plan could be issued individual policies 
with Aviva.  Most deferred pensioners and pensioners who had not previously been subject to a buy-in through 
Aviva were also transferred to the 2013 Plan. Benefits within the 2013 Plan mirror those in the previous NEXT Plan.
Executive directors are now members of the 2013 Plan which has been approved by HM Revenue & Customs and 
consists of defined benefit and defined contribution sections. 
The trustee of both Plans is a limited company, NEXT Pension Trustees Limited (the “Trustee”).  The Board of the 
Trustee includes members of the 2013 Plan, a pensioner member and a Chairman who is independent with no 
other connection to NEXT.  Two of the directors are member nominated directors and cannot be removed by 
NEXT. The other directors, including the independent director, are appointed by and can be removed by NEXT.  All 
directors of the Trustee receive a fee for their services, including those directors who are also employees of NEXT.  
No director of the Company is a director of the Trustee.
The Plans’ investments are kept separate from the business of the NEXT Group and the Trustee holds them in 
separate trusts.  Responsibility for investment of the Plans’ funds has been delegated to professional investment 
managers.
The Group operates a salary sacrifice scheme whereby members from either section can elect to receive a 
reduced gross salary in exchange for enhanced employer pension contributions.  The participation of members 
in the salary sacrifice scheme does not result in any overall increase in costs to the Group.
Defined contribution section
Employees of the Group can join the defined contribution section of the 2013 Plan. Members elect to pay either 
3% or 5% of their pensionable earnings which is matched by the Company.  For death prior to retirement, a lump 
sum of three times the member’s base salary at the previous April is payable along with the current value of the 
member’s fund.

Defined benefit section
The defined benefit section was closed to new members in 2000.  Since 2012 the accrual of pension benefits has 
been based on pensionable salary frozen at October 2012, rather than final earnings. In addition, those employees 
can elect to receive up to a 15% salary supplement or additional contributions to the defined contribution section.  
The defined benefit section now provides members with a retirement benefit of one sixtieth or one eightieth 
(depending on the member’s chosen contribution rate) of pensionable earnings at October 2012 for each year 
of pensionable service. 
Lord Wolfson and a small number of senior employees, on completion of at least 20 years’ pensionable service 
at age 65, receive a retirement benefit of two-thirds of pensionable earnings at October 2012, which accrues 
uniformly throughout their pensionable service.  The deferred pensions for Christos Angelides, David Keens, Jane 
Shields and Michael Law are based on their pensionable earnings at the time they became deferred pensioners 
and accrued uniformly throughout their pensionable service. 
The defined benefit section provides a lump sum death in service benefit and dependants’ pensions on death in 
service or following retirement.  Pensions are only payable to deceased members’ children after death in service.  
In the case of ill-health retirement, only the accrued pension is payable.  All benefits are subject to 2013 Plan limits. 
Increases to pensions in payment are at the discretion of the Trustee although pensionable service post-1997 is 
subject to limited price indexation.  From 2006, sales and profit related bonuses were excluded from pensionable 
earnings and the normal retirement age under the Plan was increased from 60 to 65.  There are no additional 
benefits payable to directors in the event of early retirement.
Members contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings, whilst the Company currently makes contributions at the 
rate of 17.5%.  The last full triennial valuation of the NEXT Plan was carried out as at March 2013, and the first triennial 
valuation of the 2013 Plan was carried out as at October 2013.  As calculated in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards, the net pension surplus at January 2015 was £37.9m; further details are given in 
Note 21 to the financial statements.
Certain members (including Lord Wolfson) whose accrued or projected pension fund value exceeds their 
personal lifetime allowance are provided with benefits through an unfunded, unapproved arrangement.  The 
relevant members contribute towards the additional cost of providing these benefits by a payment of 5% on 
all pensionable earnings.  Since April 2011, where existing members have reached either the annual or lifetime 
pension contributions limits, the Company has offered those members the choice of leaving the defined benefit 
section and either joining the defined contribution section (with an enhanced Company contribution) or taking 
a salary supplement, in both cases equal to 10% or 15% of their salary (depending on their existing contributions 
and benefits).

1. As disclosed in the 2014 Annual Report, Lord Wolfson waived his potential entitlement under the 2011 SMP (options over 67,098 shares).
2. For LTIP awards, the date in this column is the end of the three year performance period. Actual vesting will be the date on which the Committee 
determines whether any Performance Condition has been satisfied.
3. The market value of shares at the time the deferred bonus vested was £63.35.
4. For LTIP awards granted prior to February 2014 the maximum value of LTIP awards that vest for a particular year is capped at £2.5m. The cap was 
applied to the awards that vested in the year to January 2014 for Lord Wolfson and Christos Angelides. The impact of this cap was to reduce 
the shares vested by 21,693 and 16,221 respectively. 
5. See page 53 for details of the performance conditions and vesting levels applicable to the LTIP schemes vesting in the year.
6. The LTIP price at award date is NEXT’s average share price over the three months prior to the start of the performance period.
7. David Keens, Jane Shields and Michael Law exercised their SMP options on 30 April 2014 when the market price for the shares was £65.20. 
Christos Angelides exercised on 1 May 2014 when the market price was £66.50.
8. The market price for the shares at the date of Sharesave exercise was £67.55 for Michael Law and Jane Shields (1 December 2014) and £71.50 
for David Keens (23 January 2015).
9. Within the above table, all awards are subject to performance conditions except for Sharesave options and Deferred Bonus Shares. 
The aggregate gains of directors arising from the exercise of options granted under the SMP , Sharesave and LTIP 
that vested in the year totalled £18,872,000 (2014: £14,150,000).

the Chief Executive is deferred for a period of two years and subject to forfeiture if he voluntarily resigns prior to the 
end of that period.  The value of the deferred bonus (£372k) is included in the single total figure of remuneration 
table on page 52.

The comparator group for the LTIP three year performance periods commencing February 2014 and August 
2014 are shown on the previous page.  For preceding performance periods the changes to the February 2014 
comparator group above are: 
1. for the period commencing August 2013 - no change;
2. for the periods commencing February 2013, August 2012 and February 2012 – Kesa added and JD Sports 
removed; 
3. for the period commencing August 2011 – HMV added and Dunelm removed; and
4. for the period commencing February 2011 – HMV and Signet added and Dunelm and Supergroup removed. 
SMP (legacy only)
Vesting of awards is dependent solely on achieving the fully diluted post-tax EPS targets detailed below. 
Date of grant
Required fully diluted EPS (pence)
For 0.5:1 match For 1:1 match For 2:1 match
April 2012 267.2 281.5 310.2
April 2013 314.5 331.3 365.0
These targets require a minimum three year growth in EPS of 12% before any shares vest and a maximum award 
is only achieved if EPS growth reaches 30% over three years.  The effective matching ratio will be calculated on a 
straight line basis for EPS falling between each of the threshold points.  The same EPS growth performance targets 
and matching ratios were also set for the April 2014 SMP (which was not granted to executive directors).  Details of 
the calculation of fully diluted EPS are provided in Note 9 to the financial statements. 
PAYMENTS TO PAST DIRECTORS (AUDITED)
Andrew Varley stepped down from the Board in May 2013 and continued his role as Group Property Director until 
he retired in May 2014.  During the year he was paid £1,536k in relation to two LTIP awards which vested.  The 
second of these vested after he retired and, as a ‘good leaver’, his entitlement was time pro-rated proportionately 
to his actual period of service.  In April 2014 his award under the 2011 SMP also vested and he received shares 
valued at £2,135k at that date.  In November 2014 he exercised 431 options granted at £20.84 under the Sharesave 
scheme, the market price at that time was £64.65. There were no other payments made to past directors.
PAYMENTS FOR LOSS OF OFFICE (AUDITED)
There were no payments made to any director in respect of loss of office.

REMUNERATION REPORT
CONSIDERATION OF MATTERS RELATING TO DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
Remuneration Committee
During the year the Committee comprised the following independent non-executive directors:
Jonathan Dawson (Committee Chairman)
Steve Barber
John Barton
Christine Cross (until May 2014)
Francis Salway
Caroline Goodall
The Committee met nine times during the year under review.  All meetings were fully attended except that Christine 
Cross and Francis Salway were each unable to attend one meeting.  In advance of those meetings they reviewed 
meeting papers and communicated their comments to the Committee Chairman who ensured their comments 
were considered at the meeting.
Role of Remuneration Committee
The Committee determines the remuneration of the Group’s Chairman and executive directors, and reviews that of 
senior executives.  It is also responsible for determining the targets for performance-related pay schemes, approves 
any award of the Company’s shares under share option or incentive schemes to employees and oversees any 
major changes in employee benefit structures.  The Committee members have no conflicts of interest arising from 
cross-directorships and no director is permitted to be involved in any decisions as to his or her own remuneration.  
The remuneration of non-executive directors is decided by the Chairman and executive directors of the Board.  The 
Committee’s terms of reference are available on the Company’s website (www.nextplc.co.uk) or on request from 
the Company Secretary.
Assistance to the Committee 
During the period the Committee received input from the Chief Executive and Group Finance Director.  Aon Hewitt 
Ltd and FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP also provided independent external advice, mostly of a technical nature 
and related to share plans and the implementation of the Directors’ Remuneration reporting regime.  Aon Hewitt 
and FIT have no other connection with the Company and were appointed by the Committee based on their 
expertise in the relevant areas of interest.  Based on the nature of the advice, the relatively small fees and no other 
connection existing with these advisers, the Committee was satisfied that the advice received was objective and 
independent.  PricewaterhouseCoopers provided independent verification services of total shareholder returns for 
NEXT and the comparator group of companies under the Long Term Incentive Plan and other technical assistance 
and Eversheds LLP provided legal advice to the Company.  Aon Hewitt and FIT are members of the Remuneration 
Consultants Group, being the professional body for remuneration consultants and have confirmed to us that they 
adhere to its code of conduct.
During the year Aon Hewitt, FIT Remuneration Consultants LLP and PricewaterhouseCoopers were each paid less 
than £35k for the services described above, charged at their standard rates.

Salary
To provide a satisfactory base salary within 
a total package comprising salary and 
performance-related pay.
Performance-related components and certain 
benefits are calculated by reference to base 
salary.  The level of salary broadly reflects the 
value of the individual, their role, skills and 
experience. 
Reviewed annually, generally effective 1 February.  The Committee focuses 
particularly on ensuring that an appropriate base salary is paid to directors 
and senior managers.  The Committee considers salaries in the context 
of overall packages with reference to market data, individual experience 
and performance, and the level and structure of remuneration for other 
employees and the external environment.  External benchmarking analysis 
is only occasionally undertaken and the Committee has not adopted a 
prescribed objective of setting salaries by reference to a particular percentile 
or benchmark.
There is no guaranteed annual increase.  The Committee considers it 
important that base salary increases are kept under tight control given the 
multiplier effect of such increases on future costs. In recent years, increases in 
executive directors’ salaries have been in line with the wider company cost 
of living awards. 
Under the new regulations the Company is required to specify a maximum 
potential value for each component of pay.  Accordingly, for the period of 
this policy no salary paid to an executive director in any year will exceed 
the median base salary of FTSE 100 Chief Executives as confirmed by 
independent advisers. Currently this is circa £850,000 per annum.
Not applicable
Annual bonus
To incentivise delivery of stretching annual 
financial goals. 
To provide focus on the Company’s key 
financial objectives.
To provide a retention element in the case of 
the Chief Executive as any annual bonus in 
excess of 100% of base salary is payable in 
shares, deferred for a period of two years and 
subject to forfeiture if he voluntarily resigns 
prior to the end of that period.
Performance measures and related performance targets are set at the 
commencement of each financial year by the Committee.  Company policy 
is to set such measures by reference to pre-tax EPS but the Committee retains 
flexibility to use different performance measures during the period of this 
policy if it considers it appropriate to do so.
At the threshold level of performance, 20% of the maximum bonus may 
be earned.  A straight sliding scale of payments operates for performance 
between the minimum and maximum levels.  There is no in-line target level 
although, for the purposes of the scenario charts on pages 52 and 53, 50% of 
maximum bonus has been assumed because it is the mid-point.
At present Company policy is to provide a maximum bonus of 150% of salary 
for the Chief Executive and 100% of salary for other executive directors.
Although the Committee has no current plan to make any changes, for the 
period of this policy the Committee reserves flexibility to:
 ❚ increase maximum bonus levels for executive directors in any financial 
year to 200% of salary.  This flexibility would be used only in exceptional 
circumstances and where the Committee considered any such increase to 
be in the best interests of shareholders and after appropriate consultation 
with key shareholders;
 ❚ lessen the current differentials in bonus maximums which exist between 
the Chief Executive and other executive directors; and 
 ❚ introduce or extend an element of compulsory deferral of bonus 
outcomes if considered appropriate by the Committee. 
While the Committee reserves flexibility to 
apply different performance measures, it 
currently uses stretching pre-tax EPS growth 
targets set annually, which take account of 
factors including the Company’s budgets 
and the wider background of the UK 
economy .  Pre-tax EPS has been chosen as the 
basic metric to avoid executives benefitting 
from external factors such as reductions in 
the rate of corporation tax.  There has to be 
growth in EPS before any bonus is payable to 
executive directors.  By contrast the threshold 
for staff bonuses is set at a lower level than for 
directors.  The Committee reserves flexibility 
to apply discretion in the interests of fairness 
to shareholders and executives by making 
adjustments it considers appropriate. 
As noted in the Committee Chairman’s 
Statement on page 39, the basis of 
performance measurement is changing 
to incorporate an appropriate adjustment 
to EPS growth to reflect the benefit to 
shareholders from special dividends paid in 
any period.

LTIP
To incentivise management to deliver 
superior total shareholder returns (“TSR”) over 
three year performance periods relative to a 
selected group of retail companies.
Retention of key employees over three-year 
performance periods.
A variable percentage of a pre-determined maximum number of shares can 
vest, depending on relative TSR performance against the comparator group 
the Committee selects at grant (current practice is to select a comparator 
group of retail companies (shown on page 64)).
The maximum number of shares that may be awarded to each director is a 
percentage of each director’s base salary at the date of each grant, divided 
by NEXT’s average share price over the three months prior to the start of the 
performance period.
LTIP awards are made twice a year to reduce the volatility inherent in the TSR 
performance measure and to enhance the portfolio effect for participants of 
more frequent, but smaller, grants.
The Company has the option to settle vested LTIP awards in cash.
The LTIP does not credit participants with additional value in respect of 
dividends paid over any vesting period (except that the Committee has 
discretion to award such credit for special dividends).
Since 2008, the maximum aggregate annual award allowed under the 
current plan rules has been over shares worth 200% of base salary (and up 
to 300% in exceptional circumstances).  With effect from 2012, the maximum 
value of any LTIP awards that vest for a participant in a year has been 
capped at £2.5m.
Within this maximum, the Chief Executive and other executive directors receive 
grants equal to 100% and 75% of annual salary respectively every six months. 
The Committee reserves the right to vary these levels within the overall annual 
limits described above.
For 2014 onwards, the Committee has decided that the maximum possible 
aggregate value of awards granted to all executive directors will be 200% 
of annual salary (i.e. 100% every six months).  The Committee reserves the 
right to vary these levels within the overall annual limits described above.  In 
addition, awards granted to executive directors which vest must be taken in 
shares and the net shares (after payment of tax and NIC) must be held for 
a minimum period of two further years.  The Committee reserves the right 
to lengthen (but not reduce) the performance period and to introduce a 
retention period or to further increase this holding period.
In light of the cessation of further grants under the SMP (see below), the 
Committee has reviewed the cap on the maximum value of LTIPs vesting for 
any participant in any one year and has decided it is appropriate to remove 
the cap for LTIP awards granted to executive directors after January 2014.  The 
£2.5m cap will remain in force for vesting LTIPs with three year performance 
periods ending in financial years to January 2015 and January 2016.
Performance is measured over periods of 
three years, which commence in February 
and August, by measuring NEXT’s TSR against 
a group (currently 20 other UK listed retail 
companies) which are, in the view of the 
Committee, most comparable with NEXT in 
size or nature of their business.  Comparison 
against such a group is more likely to reflect 
the Company’s relative performance against 
its peers, thereby resulting in awards vesting 
on an appropriate basis.

If no entitlement has been earned at the end

Before any of the awards vest, the Committee 
must have regard to the performance of the 
Company in the light of underlying economic 
and other circumstances, including EPS 
performance of the Company and of other 
UK retailers over the period.  Whilst not 
disclosed in advance, the factors taken into 
account for these purposes are disclosed in 
the relevant year’s Remuneration Report.
The Committee reserves flexibility to apply 
different performance measures and targets 
in respect of new grants for the period of this 
policy.
SMP
To encourage greater ownership of NEXT 
shares by senior executives, excluding 
executive directors, and thereby further align 
their interests with shareholders. 
Participants who invest a proportion of any annual cash bonus in NEXT 
shares can receive up to a maximum of two times the original number of 
shares they purchase with their bonus. Any matching is conditional upon 
achieving performance measures over the following three years. 
The Committee’s policy is to set such performance measures by reference to fully 
diluted post-tax earnings per share but the Committee retains flexibility to use different 
measures during the period of this policy if it considers it appropriate to do so, 
including adjustments to reflect the benefit to shareholders from special dividends. 
As noted in the Committee Chairman’s statement, executive directors will no 
longer be granted awards under the SMP after January 2014 and participation 
will be restricted to senior executives below Board level, although the Committee 
reserves flexibility to re-introduce executive director participation within the 
period of this policy if it considers it appropriate to do so.
The SMP does not credit participants with additional value in respect of 
dividends paid over any vesting period (except that the Committee has 
discretion to award such credit for special dividends).
The maximum matching ratio available under SMP is 3:1, matching the pre-
tax equivalent of the amount invested in shares. 
Within this maximum matching ratio, a match of up to 2:1 based on the 
actual number of investment shares has been offered in practice, although 
the Company retains flexibility within the period of this policy to offer a different 
matching ratio within the scope of the maximum ratio set out above.
Although the Company reserves flexibility to 
apply different performance measures, the 
Committee currently uses measures based 
on stretching fully diluted post-tax EPS targets.
The targets for awards in each year will be 
detailed in the report and accounts.

Pension
To provide for retirement through Company 
sponsored schemes or a cash alternative for 
personal pension planning.
All executive directors are deferred members of the defined benefit (“DB”) 
section of the 2013 NEXT Group Pension Plan (“the Plan”). 
In addition to being deferred members of the DB section of the Plan, Lord 
Wolfson and Christos Angelides are members of the unfunded, unapproved 
supplementary pension arrangement (“SPA”), described on page 59.  Their 
future pensions will be calculated by reference to their October 2012 salaries, 
rather than final earnings, and future salary changes will have no effect. 
Jane Shields and David Keens ceased to contribute to the Plan in 2011 and 
Michael Law in 2012.  Their pensions are no longer linked to salary and will 
increase in line with statutory deferred revaluation only (i.e. in line with CPI). 
Executive directors receive salary supplements of 15% in lieu of past changes 
to their pension arrangements, in line with other senior employee members 
of the DB benefit section of the Plan. 
New employees of the Group can join the defined contribution (“DC”) 
section of the NEXT Plan or the statutory Auto-Enrolment plan, described on 
page 59.
Bonuses are not taken into account in assessing pensionable earnings in 
the Plan.
Under the DB section and the SPA, the maximum potential pension is only 
achieved on completion of at least 20 years pensionable service at age 
65, when two thirds of the executive director’s annual pensionable salary at 
October 2012 could become payable.  The lump sum payable on death is 
four times base salary. 
No DC contributions, or equivalent salary supplement payments, will be 
made to an executive director in any year that will exceed the median level 
of contributions or payments made to FTSE 100 Chief Executives as at the 
time the rate is set, as confirmed by independent advisers to the Committee.

benefits.
Executive directors receive benefits which may include the provision of a

to professional bodies and staff discount on Group merchandise.  A driver is 
also made available to the executive directors for business purposes.
The Committee reserves discretion to introduce new benefits where it 
concludes that it is in the interests of NEXT to do so, having regard to the 
particular circumstances and to market practice and reserves flexibility to 
make relocation related payments. 
Whilst not considered necessarily to be benefits, the Committee reserves the 
discretion to authorise attendance by directors and their family members 
(at the Company’s cost if required) at corporate events and to receive 
reasonable levels of hospitality in accordance with Company policies.
During the policy period, the value of benefits (other than relocation costs) 
paid to an executive director in any year will not exceed £100,000.  In addition, 
the Committee reserves the right to pay up to £250,000 relocation costs in 
any year to an executive director if considered appropriate to secure the

NEXT can recruit and retain key executives, 
whilst protecting the Company from making 
payments for failure.
The Committee will consider the need for and quantum of any termination 
payments having regard to all of the relevant facts and circumstances at 
that time. 
Future service contracts will take into account relevant published guidance.
Each of the executive directors has a rolling service contract which 
commenced on either 14 March 2013 or, for Michael Law and Jane Shields, 
on 1 July 2013. The contract is terminable by the Company on giving one 
year’s notice.  The Company has reserved the right to make a payment in 
lieu of notice on termination of an executive director’s contract equal to their 
base salary and contractual benefits (excluding performance-related pay). 
If notice of termination is given immediately following a change of control of 
the Company, the executive director may request immediate termination of his 
contract and payment of liquidated damages equal to the value of his base 
salary and contractual benefits. 
In normal circumstances executives have no entitlement in respect of 
loss of performance bonuses and all share awards would lapse following 
resignation.  However, under certain circumstances (e.g. ‘good leaver’ or 
change in control), and solely at the Committee’s discretion, annual bonus 
payments may be made and would ordinarily be calculated up to the date 
of termination only. In addition, awards made under the LTIP and SMP would 
in those circumstances generally be time pro-rated and remain subject to 
the application of the performance conditions at the normal measurement 
date.  The Committee also has a standard discretion to vary the application 
of time pro-rating in such cases. “Good leaver” treatments are applied in 
exceptional cases only. 
In the event of any termination payment being made to a director (including 
any performance-related pay elements), the Committee will take full account 
of that director’s duty to mitigate any loss and, where appropriate, may seek 
independent professional advice and consider the views of shareholders as 
expressed in published guidance prior to authorising such payment.
Consistent with market practice, in the event of removal from office of an executive 
director, the Company may pay a contribution towards the individual’s legal 
fees and fees for outplacement services as part of a negotiated settlement and 
such other amounts as the Committee considers to be necessary, having taken 
legal advice, in settlement of potential claims. Any such fees would be disclosed 
with all other termination arrangements.  The Committee reserves the right, if 
necessary, to authorise additional payments in respect of such professional fees 
if not ascertained at the time of reporting such termination arrangements up to 
a maximum of £10,000. 
A departing gift may be provided up to a value of £1,000 (plus related taxes) 
per director.
Not applicable
Claw-back/malus
To ensure the Company can recover any 
payments made or potentially due to 
executive directors under performance-
related remuneration structures.
Claw-back provisions are in service contracts of all executive directors 
and will be enforced where appropriate to recover performance-related 
remuneration which has been overpaid due to: a material misstatement of 
the Company’s accounts; errors made in the calculation of an award; or a 
director’s misconduct.  These provisions allow for the recovery of sums paid 
and/or withholding of sums to be paid.
Not applicable Not applicable
Chairman and non-executive director 
fees
To ensure fees paid to the Chairman and 
non-executive directors are competitive 
and comparable with other companies of 
equivalent size and complexity.
Remuneration of the non-executive directors is reviewed annually and 
determined by the Chairman and the executive directors.  The Chairman’s 
fee is determined by the Committee (excluding the Chairman).
Additional fees are paid to non-executive directors who chair the 
Remuneration and Audit Committees, and act as the Senior Independent 
Director. The structure of fees may be amended within the overall limits.
External benchmarking is undertaken only occasionally and there is no 
prescribed policy regarding the benchmarks used or any objective of 
achieving a prescribed percentile level.
The total of fees paid to the Chairman and the non-executive directors in 
any year will not exceed the maximum level for such fees from time to time 
prescribed by the Company’s articles of association (currently £750,000 per 
annum).
Non-executive directors receive staff 
discount on Group merchandise but do 
not participate in any of the Group’s bonus, 
pension, share option or other incentive 
schemes.

INDEPENDENT AUDITOR’S REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF NEXT PLC
Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified 
We have audited the financial statements of NEXT plc (the “Company”) and its subsidiaries (together the “Group”) for 
the year ended 24 January 2015 which comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement 
of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, the Consolidated and Company 
Statements of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Cash Flow Statement and the related notes.  The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group financial statements is applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union.  The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Company financial statements is applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the 
Companies Act 2006. Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members 
those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no other purpose.  To the fullest 
extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
In our opinion: 
 ❚ The financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the Company’s affairs as at 
24 January 2015 and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
 ❚ the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union; 
 ❚ the Company financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 ❚ the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 
and, as regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
Overview of our audit approach:
Materiality ❚ Materiality of £40 million representing 5% of pre–tax profit.
 ❚ Audit differences in excess of £2 million reported to the Audit Committee.
Audit scope ❚ NEXT plc (the Company) and NEXT Retail Limited were subject to full scope audits 
with the remaining entities and eliminations subject to specific audit testing based 
on our judgement of risk and materiality.
 ❚ NEXT plc and NEXT Retail Limited account for 98% of the Group’s revenue and 97% 
of total segment profit. 
Principal risk areas ❚ Adequacy of the directory debt provisions.
 ❚ The assessment of inventory provisions required in respect of unsold stock. 
 ❚ The valuation of financial instruments which hedge foreign exchange and interest 
rate fluctuations. 
 ❚ The risk of misstatement arising from management override with regard to estimates 
and other provisions relevant to the retail environment.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement set out on page 37, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the Group and the Company financial statements and for being satisfied that they give a 
true and fair view.  Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the Group and the Company financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).  Those 
standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.

Our audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to 
give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by 
fraud or error.  This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and 
Company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of 
significant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non–financial information in the Annual Report and Accounts to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information that is apparently 
materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of 
performing the audit. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider 
the implications for our report. 
Our application of materiality
We apply the concept of materiality both in planning and performing our audit, and in evaluating the effect of 
misstatements on our audit and on the financial statements.  For the purposes of determining whether the financial 
statements are free from material misstatement we define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement that 
makes it probable that the economic decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person, relying on the financial 
statements, would be changed or influenced.
We also determine a lower level of performance materiality which we use to determine the extent of testing needed 
to reduce to an appropriately low level the probability that the aggregate of any undetected misstatements added 
to uncorrected misstatements exceeds materiality for the financial statements as a whole.
When establishing our overall audit strategy, we determined 
materiality for the Group to be £40 million (2014: £35 million), 
which is approximately 5% of underlying profit before tax.  The 
rationale for using underlying profit before tax as our basis for 
materiality is that it provides a consistent year on year approach 
excluding one off gains, and is considered to be the most 
relevant performance measure to the Group’s stakeholders.
On the basis of our risk assessments, together with our assessment 
of the Group’s overall control environment, our judgement is 
that performance materiality for the Group should be 75% of 
materiality (2014: 50%), namely £30 million, although we reduce 
our testing thresholds in areas of significant risk to appropriately 
reflect our assessment of risk in the business and to focus on 
the key judgements and estimates.  We have increased our 
assessment of performance materiality from 50% to 75% during 
the year as a result of limited historical audit findings in prior 
years, except for the judgements and estimates associated with 
the areas of significant risk.  Our approach is designed to have a 
reasonable probability of ensuring that the total of uncorrected 
and undetected misstatements does not exceed our materiality 
of £40 million for the Group financial statements as a whole.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report to the 
Committee all audit differences in excess of £2 million, as well 
as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted 
reporting on qualitative grounds.
We evaluated any uncorrected misstatements against both the quantitative measures of materiality discussed 
above and in light of other relevant qualitative considerations.

An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit scope focused on six entities along with group eliminations on consolidation.  Two of these entities, 
NEXT plc (the “Company”) and NEXT Retail Limited, were full scope with the remaining entities and eliminations 
component subject to specific audit testing based on our judgement of risk and materiality.
The full scope audit of NEXT Retail Limited which includes the Retail and Directory business operations accounts for 
98% of the Group’s external revenue and 97% of total segment profit. The overseas Group purchasing division (NEXT 
Sourcing Limited), Lipsy Limited, and Property Management (NEXT Group plc) contribute 1% of the Group’s external 
revenue and 2% of total segment profit and were subject to specific scope audits in areas where we assessed 
there was a risk of material misstatement. 
NEXT Sourcing Limited and Lipsy Limited are both subject to local statutory audits in their jurisdictions but these 
are completed after the date of this report.  The remaining adjustments to segment profit in deriving Group profit 
before tax are incorporated within our full scope audit of the Company or specific scope audit of the elimination 
components.
All the significant risks noted below are included in the full scope entities, NEXT Retail Limited and NEXT plc, and 
the Group eliminations component. 
The audits of the entities are performed at a materiality level calculated by reference to a proportion of the Group 
materiality appropriate to the relevant scale of the business concerned.  The full scope entities were allocated 
80% of the Group performance materiality.  The range of performance materiality allocated to the specific scope 
entities was 20% to 30% of the Group performance materiality. 
For the elimination components of the Group, we performed other procedures to confirm there were no significant 
risks of material misstatement in the Group financial statements. The audit of both the full scope entities and all 
specific scope entities, other than NEXT Sourcing Limited, were undertaken by one audit team in the UK.  The NEXT 
Sourcing Limited audit was performed by an EY team in Hong Kong.

Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
We consider that the following areas present the greatest risk of material misstatement in the Group financial 
statements and consequently have had the greatest impact on our audit strategy, the allocation of resources, and 
the efforts of the engagement team, including the more senior members of the team.  In addition to understanding 
the risks in each of these areas and how management controls these risks, our audit responses are set out below:
Principal risk area and rationale 
for there being a risk of material 
misstatement Audit response
Adequacy of the directory debt 
provisions.
This is one of the largest provisions 
within the Group financial statements 
relating to a net debtor balance of 
£712.5 million, see Note 14. 
Whilst the provision is calculated 
using a combination of internally and 
externally sourced information there is 
significant judgement in determining 
the assumptions.
Key assumptions:
1. the assumed default rates 
representing the likelihood of 
eventual default for debt within 
each category of the debtor book; 
and
2. the assumed recovery rate for debt 
that has defaulted and passed to 
debt collection agencies. 
Management record a provision where a loss event has occurred using historical 
default rates and credit score information to determine the extent to which a loss event 
will result in an actual loss.
 ❚ We tested management’s categorisation of the debtor book by stage of current 
default based on whether payments have been made in accordance with “the 
NEXT terms and conditions” for Directory accounts. 
 ❚ We challenged the reasonableness of the key assumptions in determining 
management’s provision as follows:
1. We compared the credit score data used by NEXT plc to stratify the customer 
base back to third party data obtained. We recalculated the historical default 
rates for each category of customer by comparison to prior year customer 
balances and actual default during the last year, as support for the assumed 
default rates. 
2. We compared the assumed recovery rates to historical recovery rates, current 
performance, and any observed changes in debtor profile in the current period. 
 ❚ We checked how the credit score data used in determining the future default rates 
was applied to the debtor book.
 ❚ We tested the arithmetical accuracy of the provision based on management’s 
assumptions in respect of default rates and expected recovery rates, and we also 
checked the underlying debtor book categorisation to recent customer payment 
history.
The assessment of inventory 
provisions required in respect of 
unsold stock. 
The net stock balance at the year 
end, £416.8 million, is significant to the 
overall balance sheet. 
The provision is calculated using post 
year end trading performance and 
historical sales patterns. Changes in 
trading performance can result in 
significant judgement in determining 
the provision required.
 ❚ We tested a sample of stock items categorised as Spring Summer 2015, Autumn 
Winter 2014, and older items, to gain comfort over the categorisation of stock used 
in the provision calculation.
 ❚ We examined the Group’s historical trading patterns of stock sold at full price, stock 
marked down below full price in a sale period, and the element of inventory that 
is passed to a clearance route; together with the related margins/losses achieved 
for each of these sales channels. 
 ❚ We challenged the reasonableness of the inventory provision by projecting future 
sales levels to calculate our own estimate of the required provision, taking into 
account a combination of the evidence of these historical trading patterns and 
any observed changes to the current year buying cycle and observed sales 
trends. We also retrospectively assessed the appropriateness of the provision by 
comparing the net inventory balance to actual post period end sales.

Principal risk area and rationale 
for there being a risk of material 
misstatement Audit response
Valuation of financial instruments 
which hedge foreign exchange and 
interest rate fluctuations. 
The nature of the business is such that 
there is exposure to foreign currency 
receipts and purchases. The Group’s 
hedging strategy to manage this risk is 
such that at any one point in time there 
is a significant value of outstanding 
financial instruments, which are 
marked to market and whose values 
are estimated based upon market 
inputs, rather than being directly 
observable market values. Note 27 
summarises the instruments held.
 ❚ We identified the different types of financial instruments held by the Group and 
assessed the level of risk inherent in each of the transaction types such as forwards, 
options and swaps. 
 ❚ We analysed the features of a sample of the year end instruments per the 
contractual agreements and checked the details match to the counterparty 
valuations. 
 ❚ We selected a sample of instruments for valuation testing. This sample covered 
each instrument, and counterparty combinations for each type of instrument.
 ❚ The Group audit team was supported by EY experts who independently valued the 
sample in order to challenge the reasonableness of the counterparty valuations 
used by the Group.
The risk of misstatement arising from 
management override of internal 
controls with regard to estimates and 
other provisions relevant to the retail 
environment. 
Other than stock and debtors dealt 
with separately above, these primarily 
relate to property related provisions. 
 ❚ We performed analytical procedures and journal entry testing in order to identify 
and test the risk of misstatement arising from management override of controls, 
which in addition to the risks disclosed above, focused on accruals and provisions 
of a judgemental nature capable of being manipulated through management 
override.
 ❚ For material items we re–performed the calculation of the accrual to test 
mathematical accuracy.
 ❚ We understood the different accruals and provisions in order to challenge 
management’s underlying assumptions for under or over provision. 
 ❚ We compared these assumptions to subsequent outcomes where available. 
Where subsequent outcomes were not available to assess their accuracy, we 
considered the appropriateness of management’s previous estimates against 
historical outcomes. 
 ❚ We considered each of the key judgements and estimates for any 
evidence of bias, indicating management override of internal controls. 
The above risks are the same as in the prior year. Consistent with the prior year we have excluded revenue 
recognition as this was not one of the areas requiring greatest audit effort.
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion:
 ❚ the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with 
the Companies Act 2006; and
 ❚ the information given in the Strategic Report and the Directors’ Report for the financial year for which the Group 
financial statements are prepared is consistent with the Group financial statements.

GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Basis of preparation
The financial statements of NEXT plc and its subsidiaries (“the Group”) have been prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (“IFRS”) adopted for use in the European Union and in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006.  The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis except for 
certain financial instruments, pension assets and liabilities and share–based payment liabilities which are measured 
at fair value.  The financial statements are for the 52 weeks to 24 January 2015 (last year 52 weeks to 25 January 2014).
Except for the change to sales presentation described below, there have been no changes to our accounting 
policies this year and the principal policies adopted are set out below.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements incorporate the financial statements of NEXT plc (“the Company”) and 
its subsidiary undertakings.  All intra–group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on 
consolidation.
The results of any subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income 
statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective date of disposal.  The results and net assets of 
associated undertakings are incorporated into these financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Foreign currencies
The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds Sterling, which is the Company’s functional and 
presentation currency.  The Group includes foreign entities whose functional currencies are not Sterling.  On 
consolidation, the assets and liabilities of those entities are translated at the exchange rates at the balance 
sheet date and income and expenses are translated at weighted average rates during the period. Translation 
differences are recognised in equity.
Transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currency are recorded at the exchange rate on the 
transaction date, whilst assets and liabilities are translated at exchange rates at the balance sheet date.  Exchange 
differences are recognised in the income statement.
Revenue
Revenue represents the fair value of amounts receivable for goods and services and is stated net of sales taxes 
and returns. Sales of goods are recognised on delivery.  Directory account interest is accrued on a time basis by 
reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate.  Revenue from the sale of gift cards is deferred 
until their redemption.  Where third party goods are sold on a commission basis, only the commission receivable 
is included in statutory revenue.
Underlying profit and exceptional items
Exceptional items are significant items of an unusual or non-recurring nature which are shown separately in the 
income statement to provide a clearer understanding of the underlying financial performance during the year.  
Further details are given in Note 6.
Property, plant & equipment
Property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment.
Depreciation is charged so as to write down the cost of assets to their estimated residual values over their remaining 
useful lives on a straight line basis.  Estimated useful lives and residual values are reviewed at least annually and 
are summarised as follows: 
Freehold and long leasehold property 50 years
Plant and fittings:
 Plant, machinery and building works 10 – 25 years
 Fixtures and fittings 6 – 15 years
 Vehicles, IT and other assets  2 – 6 years
 Leasehold improvements the period of the lease, or useful life if shorter
Goodwill
Goodwill is initially measured at cost, being the excess of the acquisition cost over the Group’s interest in the assets 
and liabilities recognised.  Goodwill is not amortised, but is reviewed for impairment annually or whenever there is 
an indication of impairment.
ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS JANUARY 2015
85
plc 23849.04    8 April 2015 7:29 AM    Proof 2
Other intangible assets
Separately identifiable intangible assets obtained in a business acquisition are initially recognised at fair value, if 
this can be measured reliably and the asset arises from contractual or other legal rights.  Other intangible assets 
are amortised on a straight line basis over their expected useful lives as follows:
Lipsy brand names and trademarks 10 years
Lipsy customer relationships 4 years
Other intangible assets are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate their 
carrying value may not be recoverable.
Investments
Investments in subsidiary companies and equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active 
market and whose fair value cannot be reliably measured are stated at cost, subject to review for impairment.
Impairment
The carrying values of non-financial assets are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine whether there is 
any indication of impairment.  If any impairment loss arises, the asset value is adjusted to its estimated recoverable 
amount and the difference is recognised in the income statement.
Pension arrangements
The Group offers pension benefits which include both defined benefit and defined contribution arrangements. 
Pension assets are held in separate trustee administered funds and the Group also provides other, unfunded, 
pension benefits to certain plan members.
The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit and unfunded arrangements are determined using the 
projected unit credit method, with actuarial valuations being carried out at each balance sheet date.  The net 
defined benefit pension asset or liability represents the fair value of the defined benefit plan assets less the present 
value of the defined benefit and unfunded liabilities.  A net pension asset is only recognised to the extent that it is 
expected to be recoverable in the future.
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in full in the period in which 
they occur.  Other income and expenses are recognised in the income statement.
The cost of the defined contribution section is recognised in the income statement as incurred.
Inventories 
Inventories (stocks) are valued at the lower of standard cost or net realisable value.  Net realisable value is based 
on estimated selling prices less further costs to be incurred to disposal.
Directory and other receivables
Directory customer receivables represent outstanding customer balances less any allowance for impairment 
which is based on objective evidence and recent default experience by customer account category.  Other trade 
receivables are stated at invoice value less any allowance for impairment.
Cash and cash equivalents
For the purposes of the consolidated cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and short 
term deposits, less bank overdrafts which are repayable on demand.  Short term deposits are those with an original 
maturity of three months or less.
Corporate bonds and bank borrowings
Corporate bonds and bank borrowings are initially recognised at fair value and subsequently adjusted where hedge 
accounting applies (see interest rate derivatives below).  Accrued interest is included within other creditors and accruals.
Share–based payments
The fair value of employee share options is calculated when they are granted using a Black–Scholes model and 
the fair value of equity settled LTIP awards is calculated at grant using a Monte Carlo model.  The resulting cost is 
charged in the income statement over the vesting period of the option, and is regularly reviewed and adjusted for 
the expected and actual number of options vesting.

Additional information Parent Company accounts Governance Consolidated accounts Business reports
For cash–settled awards, the fair value of the liability is determined at each balance sheet date and the cost is 
recognised in the income statement over the vesting period. 
Taxation
Taxation, comprised of current and deferred tax, is charged or credited to the income statement unless it relates to 
items in other comprehensive income or directly in equity. In such cases, the related tax is also recognised in other 
comprehensive income or directly in equity.
Current tax liabilities are measured at the amount expected to be paid, based on tax rates and laws that are 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method and is calculated using rates of taxation enacted 
or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date which are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences.  Deferred tax assets are 
only recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible 
temporary differences can be utilised.  Deferred tax is not recognised in respect of investments in subsidiaries and 
associates where the reversal of any taxable temporary differences can be controlled and are unlikely to reverse 
in the foreseeable future.
Other financial assets and liabilities: derivative financial instruments and hedge 
accounting
Derivative financial instruments (“derivatives”) are used to manage risks arising from changes in foreign currency 
exchange rates relating to the purchase of overseas sourced products and changes in interest rates relating to 
the Group’s debt. In accordance with its treasury policy, the Group does not enter into derivatives for speculative 
purposes.  Foreign currency and interest rate derivatives are stated at their fair value, being the estimated amount 
that the Group would receive or pay to terminate them at the balance sheet date based on prevailing foreign 
currency and interest rates.
Foreign currency derivatives
Changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are designated and effective as hedges of future 
cash flows are recognised in equity in the fair value reserve, and subsequently transferred to the carrying amount of 
the hedged item or the income statement.  Realised gains or losses on cash flow hedges are therefore recognised 
in the income statement in the same period as the hedged item.
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised, or no 
longer qualifies for hedge accounting.  At that time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging instrument previously 
recognised in equity is retained in equity until the hedged transaction occurs.  If the hedged transaction is no longer 
expected to occur, the net cumulative gain or loss recognised in equity is then transferred to the income statement.
Changes in the fair value of foreign currency derivatives which are ineffective or do not meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting in IAS 39 are recognised in the income statement.
Interest rate derivatives
The Group uses interest rate derivatives to hedge part of the interest rate risk associated with the Company’s 
corporate bonds.  The carrying values of the relevant bonds are adjusted only for changes in fair value attributable 
to the interest rate risk being hedged.  The adjustment is recognised in the income statement and is offset by 
movements in the fair value of the derivatives.
Changes in the fair value of interest rate derivatives which are ineffective or do not meet the criteria for hedge 
accounting in IAS 39 are recognised in the income statement.
Share buybacks
The Group has regularly returned surplus cash to shareholders through share buybacks.  Shares purchased for 
cancellation are deducted from retained earnings at the total consideration paid or payable.  The Company also 
uses contingent share purchase contracts and irrevocable closed period buyback programmes; the obligation to 
purchase shares is recognised in full at the inception of the contract, even when that obligation is conditional on 
the share price.  Any subsequent reduction in the obligation caused by the expiry or termination of a contract is 
credited back to equity at that time.

plc 23849.04    8 April 2015 7:29 AM    Proof 2
GROUP ACCOUNTING POLICIES
Shares held by ESOT
The NEXT Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) provides for the issue of shares to Group employees, principally 
under share option schemes. Shares in the Company held by the ESOT are included in the balance sheet at cost 
as a deduction from equity.  The ESOT may also use contingent share purchase contracts and irrevocable closed 
period share purchase programmes which are accounted for as described above.
Provisions
A provision is recognised where the Group has a legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event and it 
is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required to settle the obligation.
Leasing commitments
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to income on a straight line basis over the period of the 
lease. Contingent rentals payable based on store revenues are accrued in line with the related sales.
Premiums payable, rent free periods and capital contributions receivable on entering an operating lease are 
released to income on a straight line basis over the lease term.
The Group does not have significant finance leases.
Significant areas of estimation and judgement
The preparation of the financial statements requires judgements, estimations and assumptions to be made that 
affect the reported values of assets, liabilities, revenues and expenses.  The nature of estimation and judgement 
means that actual outcomes could differ from expectation. Significant areas of estimation and judgement for the 
Group include:
 ❚ Expected future cash flows applied in measuring impairment of Directory customer receivables (Note 14).  Bad 
debt provisions are calculated using a combination of internally and externally sourced information, including 
historical collection rates and other credit data.
 ❚ Estimated selling prices applied in determining the net realisable values of inventories.  Historical sales patterns 
and post year-end trading performance are used to determine these.
 ❚ The assumptions applied in determining the defined benefit pension obligation (Note 21), which is particularly 
sensitive to small changes in assumptions. Advice is taken from a qualified actuary to determine appropriate 
assumptions at each balance sheet date.
Other areas of estimation and judgement include sales returns rates, onerous lease provisions, gift card redemption 
rates, taxation and share schemes.
Change to sales presentation
NEXT operates an increasing number of commission based agreements with third party brands, including some 
which are sourced by Lipsy and sold on next.co.uk and in our Directory and Label publications.  Lipsy brand 
products are also sold through NEXT Directory and in some NEXT Retail stores.
To ensure consistency with all other non-NEXT brands sold by NEXT, this year we have adopted the following 
approach (prior year figures have been restated, see Note 1 to the financial statements):
1. Lipsy sales made through NEXT Directory (£23m this year) are now reported in NEXT Directory rather than Lipsy.
2. Lipsy sales made in NEXT Retail stores (£13m this year) are now reported in NEXT Retail rather than Lipsy.
Total Sales includes the full customer sales value of commission-based sales, whereas Statutory Revenue (which in 
total remains as previously reported) includes only the net commission receivable from the supplier.
This change of presentation has no impact on profit.
New accounting standards 
Various new or revised accounting standards have been issued which are not yet effective, including IFRS 15 
‘Revenue from Contracts with Customers’ and IFRS 9 ‘Financial Instruments’.  Neither of these have yet been 
endorsed by the European Union.  Our initial assessment is that they are unlikely to have a significant impact on 
the Group.

1. Segmental analysis 
The Group’s operating segments under IFRS 8 have been determined based on management accounts reviewed 
by the Board.  The performance of operating segments is assessed on profits before interest and tax, excluding 
equity settled share option charges recognised under IFRS 2 Share-Based Payment and unrealised foreign 
exchange gains or losses on derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting. The activities, products and 
services of the operating segments are detailed in the Strategic Report on page 22.  The Property Management 
segment holds properties and property leases which are sub-let to other segments and external parties.

434.4 433.9 73.9
The fourth special dividend was announced on 30 December 2014 and shares in NEXT plc traded ex–dividend 
from 15 January.  The liability of £73.9m is recorded in the January 2015 balance sheet on the basis that it could 
not realistically have been cancelled after the ex–dividend date and it was paid on 2 February 2015.
It is intended that this year’s ordinary final dividend of 100p per share will be paid to shareholders on 3 August 2015. 
NEXT plc shares will trade ex–dividend from 9 July 2015 and the record date will be 10 July 2015. The estimated 
amount payable is £148.4m.
The proposed final dividend is subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has not 
been included as a liability in these financial statements.  The Trustee of the ESOT has waived dividends paid in the 
year on shares held by the ESOT.
9. Earnings per share
2015 2014
Basic earnings per share
 Total 428.3p 366.1p
 Underlying 419.8p 366.1p
Basic earnings per share is based on the profit for the year attributable to the equity holders of the parent company 
and the weighted average number of shares ranking for dividend less the weighted average number of shares 
held by the ESOT during the period.
Underlying earnings per share is based on profit before the exceptional gains described in Note 6.
2015 2014
Diluted earnings per share
 Total 417.9p 355.6p
 Underlying 409.7p 355.6p
Diluted earnings per share is based on the weighted average number of shares used for the calculation of basic 
earnings per share as increased by the dilutive effect of potential ordinary shares.  Dilutive shares arise from 
employee share option schemes where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s 
ordinary shares during the period.  Their dilutive effect is calculated on the basis of the equivalent number of nil-
cost options.  Where the option price is above the average market price, the option is not dilutive and is excluded 
from the diluted EPS calculation. There were 0.7m such share options in the current year (2014: nil).

NEXT Sourcing 30.5 30.5

42.6 42.5
Goodwill is tested for impairment at the balance sheet date on the basis of value in use.  As this exceeded carrying 
value for each of the cash generating units concerned, no impairment loss was recognised (2014: £nil).
NEXT Sourcing
The key assumptions in the calculation are the future sourcing requirements of the Group and the ability of NEXT 
Sourcing to meet these requirements based on past experience.  In assessing value in use, the most recent financial 
results and internal budgets for the next year were used and extrapolated for four further years with no subsequent 
growth assumed, and discounted at 10% (2014: 10%).
Lipsy
In assessing the recoverable amount of goodwill and intangibles, the most recent financial results and internal 
budgets for next year were used and extrapolated for nine further years using a growth rate of 2% (2014: 2%) and 
discounted at 12% (2014: 12%).  The key assumption is that Lipsy will continue to trade profitably through its different 
sales channels.
For both NEXT Sourcing and Lipsy, the calculated value in use significantly exceeded the carrying value of the 
goodwill and other intangible assets and no further sensitivity calculations were necessary to conclude that there 
was no impairment.

14. Customer and other receivables (continued)
Expected irrecoverable amounts on overdue balances are provided for based on past default experience. 
Receivables which are impaired, other than by age or default, are separately identified and provided for as 
necessary.
The credit quality of customer receivables that are neither past due nor impaired can be assessed by reference to 
the historical default rate for the preceding 365 days of approximately 1% (2014: 1%), although default rates over 
shorter periods may show significant variations.
Other debtors and prepayments do not include impaired assets.  The maximum exposure to credit risk at the 
reporting date is the carrying value of each class of asset.  The Group does not hold any collateral over these 
balances.

21. Pension benefits
The Group’s UK pension arrangements include defined benefit and defined contribution sections.  The Group also 
provides unfunded retirement benefits to some plan members whose benefits would otherwise be restricted by 
the lifetime allowance.  Pension assets are held in separate trustee administered funds which have equal pension 
rights with respect to members of either sex and comply with the Employment Equality Regulations (2006).  Further 
information on the Group’s pension arrangements is given in the Remuneration Report on pages 54 and 55.
The defined benefit section was closed to new members in 2000 and over recent years the Group has taken steps 
to manage the on-going risks associated with it:
 ❚ In 2010, most pensions in payment were subject to a buy-in contract with an insurance company. This was 
followed in 2012 by a further buy-in contract for pensions that had come into payment since 2010;
 ❚ From November 2012, the future accrual of benefits for remaining employee members is based on pensionable 
earnings frozen at that time, rather than final earnings.  Those employees receive either additional contributions 
to the defined contribution section, or a salary supplement;
 ❚ To enable future conversion of the buy-in to buy-out, in 2013 a new Plan was established for members whose 
pensions are not insured through the buy-in contracts and the associated assets and liabilities were transferred 
across.  It is intended that the pensions and matching insurance contracts held by the original Plan will be 
converted to buy-out and the original Plan will then be dissolved.

21. Pension benefits (continued)
The following table summarises the principal risks associated with the Group’s defined benefit arrangements:
Investment Risk The present value of defined benefit liabilities is calculated using a discount rate set by 
reference to high quality corporate bond yields.  To the extent that the return on plan assets 
is lower than the discount rate, the pension surplus may reduce and a deficit may emerge.
Interest Rate Risk A fall in bond yields would increase the value of the liabilities.  This would be only partially 
offset by an increase in the value of bond investments held.
Inflation Risk An increase in inflation would increase the value of pension liabilities.
Longevity Risk The present value of the defined benefit liabilities is calculated having regards to a best 
estimate of the mortality of plan members.  If members are expected to live longer, this will 
increase the liabilities.
The buy–in contracts represent approximately 22% of the total pension liabilities and provide a partial hedge to 
the risks described above.

The most recent full actuarial valuation of the original Plan was undertaken at March 2013.  The IAS 19 valuation of 
the defined benefit obligation was undertaken by an independent qualified actuary as at January 2015 using the 
projected unit credit method.  The principal actuarial assumptions used in the valuation were as follows:

The key sensitivities in the calculation are the discount rate and the inflation assumption.  A decrease of 0.25% in 
the discount rates used would increase the gross liabilities by approximately £37m, which would be partly mitigated 
by an increase of approximately £5m on the insurance assets.  An increase of 0.25% in the inflation assumption 
would increase the gross liabilities by £24m, offset by an increase of approximately £3m on the insurance assets.
Members of the defined benefit section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings whilst the employer contribution 
rate is 17.5%.  Members of the defined contribution section contribute 3% or 5% of pensionable earnings which is 
matched by the employing company.  Contribution rates are expected to remain the same for the year ahead.
Total employer contributions of £18.4m (2014: £32.5m) were made during the year, including £9.6m (2014: £9.1m) 
in respect of the defined contribution section, £7.4m (2014: £22.2m) in respect of the defined benefit section and

therefore be credited back to equity in 2015/16.
24. Other reserves
Other reserves in the consolidated balance sheet comprise the reserve created on reduction of share capital 
through a Scheme of Arrangement under Section 425 of the Companies Act 1985 (£1,460.7m) less share premium 
account (£3.8m) and capital redemption reserve (£8.7m) at the time of a capital reconstruction in 2002, plus the 
accumulated amount of goodwill arising on acquisition after taking into account subsequent disposals (£0.7m), 
less the unrealised component of revaluations of properties arising under previous accounting standards (£5.1m) 
as at the date of transition to IFRS.
25. Share-based payments
The Group operates a number of share-based payment schemes as follows:
Management share options
The NEXT Management Share Option Plan provides for options over shares, exercisable between three and ten 
years following their grant, to be allocated to Group employees at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. 
This plan is primarily aimed at middle management and senior store staff. No options were granted to any directors 
or changes made to existing entitlements in the year under review. No employee is entitled to be granted options 
under the scheme and be included in NEXT’s LTIP or the SMP in the same year.
The total number of options which can be granted is subject to shareholder approved limits. There are no cash 
settlement alternatives and they are therefore accounted for under IFRS 2 as equity-settled awards.  Options are set 
at the prevailing market price at the time of grant.  The maximum total market value of shares (i.e. the acquisition 
price of shares) over which options may be granted to any person during any financial year of the Company 
is three times salary, excluding bonuses and benefits in kind.  This limit may be increased to five times salary in 
circumstances considered by the Committee to be exceptional, for example on the grant of options following 
recruitment. Grants are generally made annually. 
Sharesave options
The Company’s Save As You Earn (Sharesave) scheme is open to all employees.  Invitations to participate are 
generally issued annually and the scheme is subject to HMRC rules.  The current maximum monthly savings limit 
for the schemes detailed below is £250.  Options are granted at the prevailing market rate less a discount of 20% 
and are exercisable three or five years from the date of grant.  Sharesave options are also accounted for as equity–
settled awards under IFRS 2.

Share Matching Plan (SMP) and Long Term Incentive Plan (LTIP)
As explained in the Remuneration Report, the Group operates LTIP and SMP schemes for executive directors and 
other senior executives.  The SMP is an equity-settled scheme. Prior to January 2014, all LTIP awards were accounted 
for as cash–settled share based payments.  From January 2014 onwards, new LTIP grants to executive directors will 
be settled in shares with no cash settlement alternative.  Those awards are therefore accounted for under IFRS 2 
as equity-settled.  Awards to other senior executives and legacy awards to executive directors will continue to be 
treated as cash-settled.  From January 2014, executive directors are no longer granted SMP awards. Performance 
conditions for SMP and LTIP awards are detailed in the Remuneration Report.

Fair value calculations
The fair value of Management, Sharesave and SMP options granted is calculated at the date of grant using a 
Black–Scholes option pricing model.  Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of 
the Company’s share price over a period equivalent to the expected life of the option.  The expected life applied 
in the model is based on historical analyses of exercise patterns, taking into account any early exercises. The 
following table lists the inputs to the model used for options granted in the years ended 24 January 2015 and 25 
January 2014 based on information at the date of grant:

The NEXT 2003 Employee Share Ownership Trust (“ESOT”) has an independent trustee resident in Jersey and 
provides for the issue of shares to Group employees, including share issues under share options, at the discretion 
of the Trustee.  All Management and Sharesave options which were exercised during the year were satisfied by 
shares issued from the ESOT.
At 24 January 2015 the ESOT held 5,010,614 (2014: 6,190,747) ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company, the 
market value of which amounted to £358.3m (2014: £388.8m).  Details of outstanding share options are shown in 
Note 25.
The consideration paid for the ordinary shares of 10p each in the Company held by the ESOT at 24 January 2015 
and 25 January 2014 has been shown as an ESOT reserve and presented within equity for the Company and the 
Group.  All other assets, liabilities, income and costs of the ESOT have been incorporated into the accounts of the 
Company and the Group.
The table below shows the movements in equity from ESOT share purchases and commitment movements during 
the year:

Proceeds of £45.0m (2014: £42.9m) were received on the exercise of Management and Sharesave options.  The 
amount shown in the Statement of Changes in Equity of £42.9m (2014: £38.4m) is after the issue of nil-cost LTIP , SMP 
and Deferred Bonus shares.  The weighted average cost of shares issued by the ESOT was £84.4m (2014: £74.0m).
At 18 March 2015, employee share options over 191,411 shares had been exercised subsequent to the balance 
sheet date and had been satisfied by ordinary shares issued by the ESOT.
27.  Financial instruments: risk management and hedging activities
NEXT operates a centralised treasury function which is responsible for managing the liquidity, interest and foreign 
currency risks associated with the Group’s activities. As part of its strategy for the management of these risks, the 
Group uses derivative financial instruments.  In accordance with the Group’s treasury policy, derivative instruments 
are not entered into for speculative purposes.  Treasury policy is reviewed and approved by the Board and specifies 
the parameters within which treasury operations must be conducted, including authorised counterparties, 
instrument types and transaction limits, and principles governing the management of liquidity, interest and foreign 
currency risks.
The Group’s principal financial instruments, other than derivatives, are cash and short term deposits, bank 
overdrafts and loans, and corporate bonds.  The main purpose of these financial instruments is to raise finance 
for the Group’s operations. In addition, the Group has various other financial assets and liabilities such as trade 
receivables and trade payables arising directly from its operations.
Liquidity risk
The Group manages its cash and borrowing requirements centrally to minimise net interest expense within 
risk parameters agreed by the Board, whilst ensuring that the Group has sufficient liquid resources to meet the 
operating needs of its businesses.  The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored to ensure 
that adequate headroom remains under committed borrowing facilities.

At 24 January 2015 the Group had borrowing facilities of £300m (2014: £300m) in respect of which all conditions 
precedent have been met and which are committed to May 2019 (2014: December 2016).  None of this facility 
was drawn down at January 2015 (2014: £nil).
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to fair value interest rate risk on its fixed rate corporate bonds and cash flow interest rate risk 
on floating rate bank loans and overdrafts.  The forecast cash and borrowings profile of the Group is monitored 
regularly to assess the mix of fixed and variable rate debt, and the Group uses interest rate derivatives where 
appropriate to reduce its exposure to changes in interest rates and the economic environment. 
Interest rates: fair value hedges
The Group has interest rate swap agreements in place as fair value hedges of part of the interest rate risk associated 
with the Company’s corporate bonds. Under the terms of the swaps, which have the same key features as the 
bonds, the Group receives a fixed rate of interest equivalent to the relevant coupon rate, and pays a variable rate. 
Details of the effective rates payable are given in Note 20. 
The fair values of the Group’s interest rate swaps, including accrued interest, are as follows:
2015
£m
2014
 £m
Derivatives in designated fair value hedging relationships 53.9 16.8
The fair values of derivatives have been calculated by discounting the expected future cash flows at prevailing 
interest rates and are based on market prices at the balance sheet date.

27. Financial instruments: risk management and hedging activities (continued)
Foreign currency risk
The Group’s principal foreign currency exposures arise from the purchase of overseas sourced products. Group 
policy allows for these exposures to be hedged for up to 24 months ahead in order to fix the cost in Sterling.  This 
hedging activity involves, inter alia, the use of spot, forward and option contracts.
The market value of outstanding foreign exchange contracts is reported regularly at Board level, and reviewed 
in conjunction with percentage cover taken by season and current market conditions in order to assess and 
manage the Group’s ongoing exposure.
The Group does not have a material exposure to currency movements in relation to translation of overseas 
investments and consequently does not hedge any such exposure.  The Group’s net exposure to foreign currencies, 
taking hedging activities into account is illustrated by the sensitivity analysis in Note 30.
Foreign currency hedges
The fair values of foreign exchange derivatives are as follows:
2015
£m
2014
£m
Derivatives in designated hedging relationships 53.7 (20.0)

The total notional amount of outstanding foreign exchange contracts at the balance sheet date is as follows:
2015
£m
2014
£m
US Dollar 1,066.1 752.8
Euro 163.6 64.8
Other 28.3 8.2
1,258.0 825.8
Prior to its disposal, the Group had entered agreements to supply its associated company, Cotton Traders, with US 
Dollars.  The notional value of contracts outstanding at January 2015 was £13.2m (2014: £22.8m). 
Credit risk
Investments of cash surpluses, borrowings and derivative instruments are made through banks and companies 
which must fulfil credit rating and investment criteria approved by the Board.  Concentrations of risk are mitigated 
by the use of various counterparties at any one time. All customers who wish to trade on credit terms are subject 
to credit verification procedures.  Receivable balances are monitored on an ongoing basis and provision is made 
for estimated irrecoverable amounts.  The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Directory customer base 
being large and diverse.  The Group’s outstanding receivables balances are detailed in Note 14.
Capital risk
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, as analysed in Note 31, and equity attributable to the equity 
holders of the parent company, comprising issued capital, reserves and retained earnings as shown in the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity.  The Group manages its capital with the objective that all entities 
within the Group continue as going concerns while maintaining an efficient structure to minimise the cost of 
capital.  The Group is not restricted by any externally imposed capital requirements.
As part of its strategy for delivering sustainable long term growth in earnings per share, the Group has been 
returning capital to shareholders by way of share buybacks in addition to dividends (including special dividends).  
Share buybacks are transacted through both on-market purchases and contingent contracts for off-market share 
purchases.

based significantly on observed market data.
29. Financial instruments: fair values
The fair values of each category of the Group’s financial instruments are the same as their carrying values in the 
Group’s balance sheet, other than as noted below:

The fair values of corporate bonds are their market values at the balance sheet date (IFRS 13 Level 1).  Market 
values include accrued interest and changes in credit risk and interest rate risk, and are therefore different to the 
reported carrying amounts.
30. Financial instruments: sensitivity analysis
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The Group’s principal foreign currency exposures are to US Dollars and the Euro.  The table below illustrates the 
hypothetical sensitivity of the Group’s reported profit and closing equity to a 10% increase and decrease in the 
US Dollar/Sterling and Euro/Sterling exchange rates at the year end date, assuming all other variables remain 
unchanged.  The sensitivity rate of 10% represents the directors’ assessment of a reasonably possible change, 
based on historic volatility.
The analysis assumes that exchange rate fluctuations on currency derivatives that form part of an effective cash 
flow hedge relationship affect the fair value reserve in equity and the fair value of the hedging derivatives.  For 
foreign exchange derivatives which are not designated hedges, movements in exchange rates impact the income 
statement.

Year end exchange rates applied in the above analysis are US Dollar 1.50 (2014: 1.65) and Euro 1.33 (2014: 1.21). 
Strengthening and weakening of Sterling may not produce symmetrical results depending on the proportion and 
nature of foreign exchange derivatives which do not qualify for hedge accounting.
Interest rate sensitivity analysis
The table below illustrates the hypothetical sensitivity of the Group’s reported profit and closing equity to a 0.5% 
increase or decrease in interest rates, assuming all other variables were unchanged. The sensitivity rate of 0.5% 
represents the directors’ assessment of a reasonably possible change, based on historic volatility.
The analysis has been prepared using the following assumptions:
 ❚ For floating rate assets and liabilities, the amount of asset or liability outstanding at the balance sheet date is 
assumed to have been outstanding for the whole year.
 ❚ Fixed rate financial instruments that are carried at amortised cost are not subject to interest rate risk for the 
purpose of this analysis.
Positive figures represent an increase in profit or equity.

vehicles and equipment.  These non-cancellable leases have remaining terms of between one month and 
approximately 25 years.  Contingent rentals are payable on certain retail store leases based on store revenues.  
The majority of the Group’s property leases provide for their renewal by mutual agreement at the expiry of the

NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
C1.  Accounting policies
The parent company financial statements of NEXT plc have been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006 and Financial Reporting Standard 101 Reduced Disclosure Framework (“FRS 101”), which was first applied last 
year.  FRS 101 enables the financial statements of the parent company to be prepared in accordance with EU-adopted 
IFRS but with certain disclosure exemptions.  The main areas of reduced disclosure are in respect of equity-settled share 
based payments, financial instruments, the cash flow statement, and related party transactions with Group companies.  
The Company’s reported profits and net assets were unaffected by the transition to FRS 101 and remain consistent with 
EU-adopted IFRS which was applied previously.  The accounting policies adopted for the parent company, NEXT plc, are 
otherwise consistent with those used for the Group which are set out on pages 85 to 88.  As permitted by Section 408 of 
the Companies Act 2006, the income statement of the Company is not presented as part of the financial statements.  
The profit after taxation dealt with in the accounts of the holding company was £576.1m (2014: profit of £478.8m).
C2. Investments
The Company has taken advantage of section 410(2) of the Companies Act 2006 to list only its subsidiary and 
associated undertakings which principally affect the figures shown in the financial statements. All of these are 
wholly owned by the Company or its subsidiary undertakings, registered in England and Wales, and operate 
predominantly in the United Kingdom unless otherwise stated.

APPENDIX 1
FURTHER INFORMATION ON RESOLUTION 14: SUMMARY OF THE PRINCIPAL TERMS OF 
THE NEXT LONG TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (“LTIP”) 
Operation
The Remuneration Committee of the Board of directors of the Company (the “Committee”) will supervise the 
operation of the LTIP .
Eligibility
Any employee (including an executive director) of the Company and any of its subsidiaries will be eligible to 
participate in the LTIP at the discretion of the Committee.
Grant of awards
The Committee may grant an award in one of two forms:
(i)  a conditional award, where a participant will receive free ordinary shares in the Company (“Shares”) on the 
vesting of his/her award; or
(ii)  nil or nominal cost options, where a participant can decide when to exercise his/her award over Shares during 
a limited period of time after it has vested.
The Committee may also allow the grant of cash-based awards of an equivalent value to share–based awards 
or may allow share-based awards to be settled in cash (in whole or part) where the Committee considers it 
appropriate to do so. 
The Committee may normally grant awards within six weeks following the Company’s announcement of its results 
for any period.  The Committee may also grant awards when there are exceptional circumstances which the 
Committee considers justifies the granting of awards.
Awards may only be granted within 10 years of the 2015 AGM. No payment will be required for the grant of an 
award. Awards are not transferable (other than to the participant’s personal representatives in the event of death). 
Awards are not pensionable.
Individual limit
The maximum number of Shares that may be awarded to a participant in any financial year will be limited so that 
the market value of such Shares when awarded and in the aggregate will not exceed 200% of the individual’s 
base salary.  However, if the Committee decides that exceptional circumstances exist in relation to the recruitment 
or retention of an individual, then the individual may be granted awards over Shares with a market value of up to 
300% of the individual’s base salary in a financial year. In calculating these limits, the average closing share price 
over the 3 months preceding the start of the period over which performance conditions are measured (or such 
later date as specified by the Committee) will be used.
Overall LTIP limits
The LTIP may operate over new issue Shares, treasury Shares or Shares purchased in the market. The current intention 
is that all awards will be satisfied using shares purchased in the market.
In any period of ten years the Company may not issue (or have the possibility to issue) more than:
a)  10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company under the LTIP and any other employees’ share plan 
adopted by the Company; and
b)  5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company under the LTIP and any other executive share plan 
adopted by the Company.
Treasury Shares will count as new issue Shares for the purposes of this limit but they will also cease to count towards 
this limit if institutional investor bodies decide that they need not count.

NOTICE OF MEETING
Vesting of awards
Awards will normally vest on the later of: (a) the expiry of the vesting period; (b) the third anniversary of the grant 
date; (c) the date that the Committee determines the extent to which the applicable performance conditions 
(see below) have been satisfied; and (d) such later date (within three months of the third anniversary of the grant 
date) as specified by the Committee; and provided the participant is still a director or employee in the Company’s 
group. 
Performance conditions 
The performance conditions for awards will be set each year in line with the Company’s approved directors’ 
remuneration policy.  The Committee will also have the power to vary the terms of existing performance conditions 
if an event occurs that causes the Committee to consider that the performance condition would not, if left 
unamended, achieve its original purpose.  However, the amended performance condition will have to be, in the 
Committee’s view, no less difficult to satisfy as a result of the change. 
Reduction of vesting of awards
If at any time before an award vests a participant has been either suspended for a disciplinary matter or the 
subject of an investigation in relation to a disciplinary matter, or if the participant has performed in a manner 
considered by the Committee to be unsatisfactory (as evidenced by notifying the participant in writing) then 
the Committee may reduce the vesting of that award in such manner as it considers appropriate or withhold the 
vesting of that award pending further investigation.
Leaving employment
As a general rule, an award will lapse upon a participant leaving the employment of the Company’s group. 
However, if before the vesting of an award a participant ceases to be a director or employee within the Company’s 
group by reason of death or in other circumstances which the Committee in its absolute discretion determines are 
exceptional circumstances, then the award will be retained and may vest on the normal vesting date to the extent 
determined by the performance conditions measured over the full performance period.  The Committee may, at 
its discretion, allow awards to vest in such circumstances at the time of cessation of employment, in which case 
awards would normally be subject to the performance conditions as measured over the shorter period.
In either case, there will also be a pro-rata reduction in the size of the award for the time that has elapsed up to 
the date of cessation compared to a three-year vesting period unless the Committee determines that it would be 
inappropriate to apply a pro-rata reduction in the particular circumstances. The Committee may also apply further 
restrictions on the vesting of awards held by individuals who cease employment.
Corporate events
In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or winding up of the Company (not being an internal corporate 
reorganisation), all awards would vest early to the extent that the performance conditions have, in the opinion of 
the Committee, been satisfied at that time.  The awards would normally be pro–rated to reflect the shorter than 
normal period of time between the date of the award and the time of vesting.  The Committee can decide not to 
pro-rate awards if it regards it as inappropriate to do so in the particular circumstances.
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, awards will be replaced by equivalent new awards over 
shares in a new holding company, unless the Committee decides that awards should vest on the same basis as 
described above.
Awards may also vest on the same basis if a demerger, special dividend or other similar event is proposed which, 
in the opinion of the Committee, would affect the market price of the Shares to a material extent.
Participants’ rights
Awards structured as conditional awards and options will not confer any shareholder rights on participants until 
the awards have vested and the participants have received their Shares.  The LTIP does not credit participants with 
additional value in respect of dividends paid over any vesting period (except that the Committee has discretion 
to award such credit for special dividends).

plc 23849.04    8 April 2015 7:29 AM    Proof 2
Rights attaching to Shares
Any Shares allotted when an award vests (or for an award structured as an option, when it is exercised) will rank 
equally with all other Shares then in issue (except for rights arising by reference to a record date prior to their 
allotment).
Variation of capital
In the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital, or in the event of a demerger, payment of a special 
dividend or other similar event which materially affects the market price of the Shares, the Committee may make 
such adjustments as it considers appropriate to the number of Shares subject to an award and/or the exercise 
price payable (if any).
Alterations to the LTIP
The Committee may, at any time, amend the provisions of the LTIP in any respect, provided that the prior approval 
of shareholders must be obtained for any amendments that are to the advantage of participants in respect of the 
rules governing eligibility, limits on individual participation, the overall limits on the issue of Shares or the transfer of 
Shares held in treasury, the basis for determining a participant’s entitlement to, and the terms of, the Shares or cash 
to be provided under the LTIP and the adjustment of awards or options.
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of shareholders will not, however, apply to any minor alteration made to 
benefit the administration of the LTIP , to take account of a change in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable 
tax, exchange control or regulatory treatment for participants or for any company in the Company’s group.
Overseas plans
The Board may at any time without further shareholder approval establish further plans in overseas territories, any 
such plan to be similar to the LTIP , but modified to take account of local tax, exchange control or securities laws. 
Any Shares made available under such further plans will count against the LTIP’s limits on individual and overall 
participation.

APPENDIX 2
FURTHER INFORMATION ON RESOLUTION 18: OFF MARKET PURCHASES OF OWN 
SHARES
As noted on page 34 in the Directors’ Report, approval will be sought from shareholders to renew the Company’s 
authority to make off-market purchases of its shares. 
By virtue of special resolution number 18 passed at the Company’s 2014 Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
shareholder authority was given to the Company to make on-market purchases of shares.  This authority was 
limited to a maximum of 23.239 million shares and expires on the earlier of the date of the AGM held in 2015 or  
1 August 2015. At the same AGM, authority was granted to the Company to make off-market purchases of shares 
for cancellation under contingent purchase contracts to be entered into with any of Goldman Sachs International, 
UBS AG, Deutsche Bank AG, HSBC Bank plc and Barclays Bank plc (the “Bank(s)”).  This authority was limited to 
a maximum of 4 million shares and expires on the earlier of the date of the AGM to be held in 2015 or 1 August 
2015.  Pursuant to those authorities and up to 18 March 2015, the Company has bought back 2,158,761 shares for 
cancellation, representing 1.4% of its issued share capital as at the date of the 2014 AGM, at a total cost of £137.9 
million. No shares were bought back under contingent purchase contracts.
Under sections 693 and 694 of the Companies Act 2006 (the “2006 Act”), the Company is not permitted to make 
off-market purchases or contingent purchases of its shares unless it obtains advance shareholder approval to 
the proposed contract terms.  Furthermore, under the rules of the UK Listing Authority (the “Listing Rules”) the 
Company may not purchase its shares at a time when any director is in receipt of unpublished price sensitive 
information about the Company.  Accordingly, no purchases of shares would normally be made in periods when 
the directors might be in receipt of unpublished price sensitive information (“Close Periods”).  Typically, these 
include the periods from the Company’s half year end up to the announcement of its interim results in September 
and from the January year end up to the announcement of the full year results in March each year. These Close 
Periods inevitably reduce the number of shares the Company is able to purchase.
In order to achieve maximum flexibility in its share purchase activities, the Company is able to enter into irrevocable 
and non-discretionary programmes to allow it to buy shares during Close Periods.  Another method of providing 
flexibility and reducing the cost, is for the Company to enter into contingent forward purchase contracts outside 
of Close Periods. As in previous years, the Company intends to enter into new agreements (the “Programme 
Agreements”), with each of the Banks, under which the Company may (although it is not obliged to) enter into 
contingent forward trades (“Contingent Forward Trades” or “CFT”) from time to time. 
The terms of a CFT will be agreed between the Company and the Bank before it is entered into.  The Company 
is committed to purchase shares under a CFT on the day it is executed subject to the terms of the Programme 
Agreement.  The terms of each CFT will provide for the Company to purchase a fixed number of shares each week 
over a period of between 20 to 30 weeks. The maximum number of shares that can be purchased under each CFT 
is limited to 30,000 shares per week. 
Whether or not the Company purchases shares in a particular week during the term of a CFT is dependent upon 
the Company’s share price either not rising to, or above, a level (the “Upper Suspension Level”) or, if applicable, 
falling to or below a level (the “Lower Suspension Level”).  The Suspension Levels and duration are determined by 
the Company and are set at the time the CFT is entered into.  The Upper Suspension Level must be set between 
104% and 110% of the Company’s share price at the start of the CFT. If the Company chooses to incorporate a 
Lower Suspension Level, it must be set between 80% and 95% of the price at the start of the CFT. The inclusion of a 
Lower Suspension Level would help mitigate the Company’s financial commitment under a CFT if its share price 
was to fall below this level after the CFT had been executed.  If the Lower Suspension Level is not included, the level 
of discount to the market share price would be higher.
The price at which the Company may purchase shares during the term of a CFT (the “Forward Price”) shall also 
be fixed at the start of the CFT. The Forward Price will be determined by the Bank with reference to the volume 
weighted average price for shares traded in NEXT on the day the CFT is entered into.  The Forward Price is subject 
to a maximum of 99% of the share price at the start of the contract and a minimum of 10 pence (the par value 
of an ordinary share).  The minimum and maximum amount of time between entering a CFT and shares being 
purchased is 5 days and 30 weeks respectively.  The Company will announce the details of each CFT on the 
day it is entered into and any subsequent termination via the UK Listing Authority’s Regulatory News Service.  This

structure would allow the Company to purchase shares at a discount to the market price (as at the time each 
CFT commences), for so long as the Suspension Levels are not reached, without breaching the Listing Rules. If any 
Suspension Level is reached, the CFT would terminate automatically at that time and no further shares would be 
purchased under that contract.
Under the provisions of sections 693 and 694 of the 2006 Act, the Programme Agreements and Contingent Forward 
Trades are contingent purchase contracts to purchase shares by the Company off-market.  Accordingly resolution 
18, which will be proposed as a special resolution, seeks shareholder approval to the terms of the Programme 
Agreements to be entered into between the Company and each of the Banks.  The Programme Agreements 
will have a duration of the shorter of the period to the date of the next AGM to be held in 2016 or 1 August 2016 
and will incorporate the terms of an ISDA Master Agreement and Schedule.  The Programme Agreements will be 
entered into and each CFT will be effected outside a Close Period but shares may be purchased during a Close 
Period by the Company. 
Should shareholder approval be granted, any number of CFT may be effected with the Banks at any time, provided 
that: 
 ❚ the total maximum number of shares which the Company is permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority 
would be 3 million, representing circa 2.0% of its issued share capital at 18 March 2015;
 ❚ the total cost of shares that the Company would be permitted to purchase pursuant to this authority may not 
exceed £200 million (including costs);
 ❚ the Forward Price may not exceed the higher of 105% of the average middle market closing price of the 
Company’s shares as derived from the Official List of the London Stock Exchange for the five days immediately 
preceding the day on which the CFT was effected and the amount stipulated by Article 5(1) of the Buy–back 
and Stabilisation Regulation 2003; 
 ❚ the Forward Price will be no more than 99% of the share price at the time the Contingent Forward Trade was 
effected;
 ❚ the minimum price that can be paid for any share is £0.10; and
 ❚ only one Contingent Forward Trade will be entered into on any particular day. 
Shares purchased under the Programme Agreements will reduce the number of shares that the Company may 
purchase under any authority granted at the AGM on 14 May 2015 for on–market purchases.  No shares will be 
purchased under that authority on the same day that a CFT is entered into.  The authority granted to the Company 
under this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the AGM of the Company held in 2016 or on 1 August 2016, 
whichever is the earlier, unless such authority is renewed prior to that time (except in relation to the purchase of 
shares under any CFT effected before the expiry of such authority and which might be completed wholly or partly 
after such expiry).  The purchase of shares under the Programme Agreements will always be physically settled by 
delivery of shares to the Company (except in the case of certain events of default or termination events). 
A copy of each of the Programme Agreements will be available at the AGM on 14 May 2015. Copies will also be 
available for inspection at the Company’s registered office at Desford Road, Enderby, Leicester LE19 4AT and at the 
offices of Pinsent Masons, 30 Crown Place, Earl Street, London EC2A 4ES during usual business hours until the date 
of the AGM and at the Meeting itself.
The total number of employee share awards and share options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 18 March 
2015 was 6,223,008.  This represents 4.1% of the issued share capital at that date. If the Company were to buy 
back the maximum number of shares permitted pursuant to both the existing authority for off–market purchases 
granted at the 2014 AGM (which will expire at the 2015 AGM) and the authority sought by this special resolution, 
then the total number of options to subscribe for shares outstanding at 18 March 2015 would represent 4.3% of 
the reduced issued share capital.

NOTICE OF MEETING
MEETING FORMALITIES AND VOTING
Attending the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”)
To be entitled to attend and vote at the AGM (and in accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association and 
pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001) and for the purposes of determining 
the number of votes shareholders may cast, shareholders must be registered in the register of members of the 
Company as at 6pm on 12 May 2015 or, if the meeting is adjourned, shareholders must be entered on the 
Company’s register of members at 6pm on the day two days before the adjourned meeting. 
The total number of the Company’s issued share capital on 18 March 2015, which is the latest practicable date 
before the publication of this Notice, is 152,873,556 ordinary shares. All of the ordinary shares carry one vote each 
and there are no shares held in treasury.  On a vote by a show of hands every member who is present has one vote 
and every proxy present who has been duly appointed by a member entitled to vote has one vote. On a poll vote 
every member who is present in person or by proxy has one vote for every ordinary share they hold.
In line with best practice, all resolutions will be put to poll votes.  This means that the votes of all shareholders, 
including those who cannot attend the meeting but who validly appoint a proxy, are counted. The procedures for 
the poll votes will be explained at the AGM.
In respect of resolution 18 on off–market share purchase contracts, the 2006 Act provides that this resolution 
will not be effective if any member of the Company holding shares to which it relates (i.e. those which may be 
purchased pursuant to the Programme Agreements) exercised the voting rights carried by any of those shares in 
voting on the resolution and the resolution would not have been passed if they had not done so.  Therefore, NEXT 
intends to disregard any poll votes which are cast in favour of resolution 18 attaching to 3.0 million shares (being 
the total maximum number of shares which the Company is permitted to purchase pursuant to the Programme 
Agreements) from both the total number of votes cast in favour of this resolution and the total number of votes 
cast.
The results of the AGM will be posted on the Company’s website (www.nextplc.co.uk) after the meeting and 
notified to the UK Listing Authority.
Voting and proxies
Whether or not you intend to attend the AGM in person, you are requested to complete and return the form of 
proxy to Equiniti, to arrive as soon as possible but in any event not later than 9.30am on 12 May 2015 (or 48 
hours before any adjourned meeting).  The completion and return of the form of proxy will not prevent you from 
attending and voting at the meeting if you so wish. 
A shareholder who is entitled to attend and vote at the AGM may appoint one or more proxies to attend, speak 
and vote instead of him/her, provided that each proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different 
share or shares held by that shareholder.  A proxy need not also be a shareholder of the Company and may vote 
on any other business which may properly come before the meeting. 
The statements of the rights of members in relation to the appointment of proxies in the above paragraph and 
in the paragraphs headed “Electronic Voting” and “CREST voting facility” below do not apply to a Nominated 
Person. The rights described in these paragraphs can only be exercised by registered members of the Company. 
Nominated persons are reminded that they should contact the registered holder of their shares (and not the 
Company) on matters relating to their investments in the Company.
In the case of joint holders, where more than one of the joint holders purports to appoint a proxy, only the 
appointment submitted by the most senior holder will be accepted, the senior holder being the first named of the 
joint holders to appear in the Company’s share register.
A member who appoints as their proxy someone other than the Chairman, is responsible for ensuring that the 
proxy attends the meeting and is aware of the voting intention of the member. If no voting instruction is given, the 
proxy has discretion on whether and how to vote.

NOTICE OF MEETING
A person to whom this notice is sent who is a person nominated under section 146 of the 2006 Act to enjoy 
information rights (a “Nominated Person”) may, under an agreement between them and the shareholder by 
whom they were nominated, have a right to be appointed (or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for 
the AGM.  If a Nominated Person has no such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise it, they may, 
under any such agreement, have a right to give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of voting rights.
If a member submits more than one valid proxy appointment, the appointment received last before the latest time 
for the receipt of proxies will take precedence. 
Electronic voting
As an alternative to completing and returning a form of proxy, you may submit your proxy electronically by accessing 
our Registrar’s website www.sharevote.co.uk.  You will require your unique Voting ID, Task ID and Shareholder 
Reference Number as printed on the proxy card.  The use by members of the electronic proxy appointment service 
will be governed by the terms and conditions of use which appear on the website. Electronic proxies must be 
completed and lodged in accordance with the instructions on the website by no later than 48 hours before the 
AGM. 
CREST voting facility
Those shareholders who hold shares through CREST may choose to appoint a proxy or proxies using CREST for the 
AGM to be held on 14 May 2015 and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures described in the CREST 
Manual. CREST personal members or other CREST sponsored members, and those CREST members who have 
appointed a voting service provider(s), should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s), who will 
be able to take the appropriate action on their behalf.
In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST 
message (a “CREST Proxy Instruction”) must be properly authenticated in accordance with Euroclear UK & Ireland 
Limited’s specifications and must contain the information required for such instructions, as described in the CREST 
Manual. The message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment of a proxy or is an amendment to the 
instruction given to a previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid, be transmitted so as to be received 
by the issuer’s agent (ID RA19) by the latest time(s) for receipt of proxy appointments specified in the notice 
of meeting.  For this purpose, the time of receipt will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp 
applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the 
message by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. After this time any change of instructions to 
proxies appointed through CREST should be communicated to the appointee through other means.
CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers should note that Euroclear 
UK & Ireland Limited does not make available special procedures in CREST for any particular messages. Normal 
system timings and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of CREST Proxy Instructions.  It is the 
responsibility of the CREST member concerned to take (or, if the CREST member is a CREST personal member or 
sponsored member or has appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his CREST sponsor or voting 
service provider(s) take(s)) such action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is transmitted by means 
of the CREST system by any particular time. In this connection, CREST members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting service provider(s) are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST Manual concerning 
practical limitations of the CREST system and timings. The CREST Manual is available at www.euroclear.com.
The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of 
the Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001.
Corporate representatives
Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its 
behalf all of its powers as a member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares.
Right to ask questions
Any shareholder attending the meeting has the right to ask questions.  The Company must answer any such 
question relating to the business being dealt with at the meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do 
so would interfere unduly with the preparation for the meeting or involve the disclosure of confidential information, 
(b) the answer has already been given on a website in the form of an answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable 
in the interests of the Company or the good order of the meeting that the question be answered.

FORWARD LOOKING STATEMENTS
This Report and Accounts contains “forward looking statements” which are all matters that are not historical facts, 
including anticipated financial and operational performance, business prospects and similar matters.  These 
forward looking statements are identifiable by words such as “aim”, “anticipate”, “believe”, “budget”, “estimate”, 
“expect”, “forecast”, “intend”, “plan”, “project” and similar expressions.  These forward looking statements reflect 
NEXT’s current expectations concerning future events and actual results may differ materially from current 
expectations or historical results. Any such forward looking statements are subject to risks and uncertainties, 
including but not limited to those risks described in “Risks & Uncertainties” on pages 24 to 26; failure by NEXT 
to predict accurately customer fashion preferences; decline in the demand for merchandise offered by NEXT; 
competitive influences; changes in level of store traffic or consumer spending habits; effectiveness of NEXT’s

the inability of NEXT to successfully implement relocation or expansion of existing stores; insufficient consumer 
interest in NEXT Directory; acts of war or terrorism worldwide; work stoppages, slowdowns or strikes; and changes 
in financial or equity markets. These forward looking statements do not amount to any representation that they 
will be achieved as they involve risks and uncertainties and relate to events and depend upon circumstances 
which may or may not occur in the future and there can be no guarantee of future performance.  Undue reliance 
should not be placed on forward looking statements which speak only as of the date of this document. NEXT does 
not undertake any obligation to update publicly or revise forward looking statements, whether as a result of new 
information, future events or otherwise, except to the extent legally required.

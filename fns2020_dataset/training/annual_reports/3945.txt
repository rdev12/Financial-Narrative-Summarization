 Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Revenue from products and services
What we do Our strategy
•  Leading supplier of drug 
delivery devices to the global 
pharmaceutical industry, with  
a market leading share in devices 
for respiratory therapies
•  Leading US supplier of disposable 
medical products used by 
anaesthetists in the establishment 
and maintenance of patient 
airways
•  Global reputation for innovation, 
design for manufacture and high 
quality volume manufacture in 
regulated markets
•  Diversiﬁcation strategy into 
new drug delivery and airway 
visualisation devices broadening 
market opportunities for growth
We have invested in increased R&D 
resources and have a growing portfolio of 
signiﬁcant new products due for launch in 
both divisions over the next ﬁve years.
New product 
development
We are diversifying the Bespak division  
into adjacent areas of drug delivery and 
diagnostics to open up new and high  
growth market opportunities. We are 
expanding the King Systems division  
into international markets where it was 
previously not represented.
Increased 
market reach
We look to increase the value add offered  
to our customers. In the Bespak division this 
would include drug handling, for example. In 
King Systems this includes the development  
of more sophisticated higher value products 
such as the King Vision laryngoscope.

Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 1 Chairman’s statement
Record results
Peter Fellner 
Chairman
The Company saw record revenues and proﬁts  
for the last ﬁnancial year, and has strengthened  
the product pipeline.
2 I 
am very pleased to report that 
the Company has delivered record 
revenues and proﬁts before tax for  
the last ﬁnancial year. In particular, there 
has been a very strong performance 
within the Bespak business unit.  
New product launches and additional 
programme wins have positioned the 
business well for sustained growth.
Continuing growth 
Revenues from products and services 
grew by 8% to £136.6m (2011:£126.8m) 
and operating proﬁt before special items 
grew by 5% to £21.5m (2011: £20.5m). 
EBITDA increased by 15% to £28.8m 
(2011: £25.0m). Adjusted earnings per 
share increased by 15% to a record 52.2p.
Group cash ﬂow continued to be strong, 
and net debt remains tightly managed at 
1.3 x EBITDA.
Pipeline strengthening
The Bespak division continued to perform 
well, with encouraging trading in its core 
respiratory franchise and good progress 
in executing its strategy of diversiﬁcation 
into adjacent markets such as Point-of-
Care (POC) diagnostics and nasal drug 
delivery. The approval by the FDA and 
subsequent launch of the ﬁrst device to 
use Bespak’s proprietary Integrated 
Dose Counter is particularly pleasing, 
as it represents the culmination of a 
number of years’ development of this 
device. The development contract that 
was won to scale up Kind Consumer’s 
Oxette nicotine delivery device also 
represents a signiﬁcant potential 
opportunity for Bespak.
The King Systems division delivered mixed 
results for the year in challenging markets, 
with margin pressure from higher material 
prices not being passed on to customers. 
However, airways products and 
international sales achieved growth 
and the King Vision laryngoscope has 
been well received. This product, along 
with the beneﬁts to be delivered 
by the manufacturing automation 
programme, will position the division 
for growth going forwards. 
Board changes 
Several changes within the Board of 
Directors will occur during this year.
Toby Woolrych, Group Finance Director, 
has decided to leave after nearly four 
years with the Company. He will be 
stepping down later this month. 
The Board would like to thank him for 
his continued contribution to the growth 
and development of the Company during 
this period, and wishes him every success 
in the future.
He will be succeeded as Group Finance 
Director by Richard Cotton, who will join 
the Company and will be appointed as 
an Executive Director, with effect from 
25 June 2012. 
From 2008 to 2011 Richard served as 
Group Finance Director of Vitec Group plc, 
from 2005 to 2008 he was Group Finance 
Director of Wagon plc, and from 2001 to 
2005 he was Group Finance Director of 
McLeod Russell plc. He qualiﬁed as a 
Chartered Management Accountant. 
After six years of service, Chris Banks 
and Jim Dick have decided to retire as 
non-executive directors at the Company’s 
AGM on 30 August 2012. Chris Banks was 
appointed in April 2006. He chairs the 
Audit Committee and is a Member of the 
Nomination Committee. Jim Dick, who 
was also appointed in April 2006, chairs 
the Corporate and Social Responsibility 
Committee, and is a member of the 
Remuneration, Audit and Nomination 
Committees. The Board would like to 
thank Chris and Jim for their valuable 
contributions during their tenures as 
Directors of the Company, and wishes 
them well for the future. 
The Company has therefore recruited two 
new non-executive directors, and I am 
delighted to announce the appointments, 
from 13 June 2012, of Steve Crummett and 
Ian Nicholson to the Board. 
Steve Crummett is Group Finance Director 
of Filtrona plc, a FTSE 250 company, 
having been appointed to the role in 2008. 
Filtrona is a leading international supplier of 
speciality plastic, ﬁbre and foam products. 
From 2003 to 2006, Steve was Group 
Director, Mergers & Acquisitions of the 
FTSE 100 company Exel plc. Steve 
qualiﬁed as a Chartered Accountant with 
Arthur Andersen. He will Chair the Audit 
Committee, and join the Nomination 
Committee. 
Ian Nicholson has been Chief Executive 
of Chroma Therapeutics Limited, a drug 
discovery and development company 
since 2004. He is Chairman of Bioventure 
Ltd, a diagnostics company, and a 
non-executive director of Symphogen A/S, 
an antibody therapeutics company. 
From 2000 to 2004 Ian was Senior Vice 
President, Business Development at 
Celltech Group plc, then the UK’s largest 
biotechnology company. He has extensive 
experience in licensing, mergers and 
acquisitions, and market development in 
the UK, Europe and the US. He will join 
the Nomination Committee. 
We warmly welcome the appointment 
of Richard, Steve and Ian to the Board. 
They bring substantial and wide-ranging 
experience and we look forward to 
working with them as we grow Consort 
for the beneﬁt of our stakeholders.
Finally, I would like to pay tribute to our 
employees, and to thank them for their 
commitment throughout the year. I would 
also like to thank our shareholders for their 
continued support for the Company.

invested in R&D
C
onsort Medical is a specialist 
medical device manufacturer with 
more than 50 years’ experience 
serving the healthcare industry. It has two 
divisions: Bespak, based in the UK, is a 
global leader in drug delivery systems; 
and King Systems is a US leader in 
disposable products for airway 
management. Together the Group 
manufactures over 500 million devices 
every year.
In our last Annual Report, I outlined  
how the new management team had 
repositioned the business over the past 
three years, in particular investing in 
innovative new products that would 
reinvigorate the top line and drive growth. 
I am therefore very pleased to report that 
this year the Group has delivered record 
revenues and proﬁts and that our 
compound operating proﬁt growth over 
the past three years has now been 7.4%. 
The King Vision digital video laryngoscope 
has been in the market for ten months, 
and in that short time has already 
recorded higher revenues than we 
achieved with the previous laryngoscope 
product. Market feedback has been 
consistently positive, and we have  
further iterations of the King Vision in 
development. Just before the year end  
we were also able to report FDA approval 
for and market launch of the ﬁrst device  
to contain Bespak’s Integrated Dose 
Counter (IDC). The IDC represents a major 
long-term market opportunity for us, and 
it is an important milestone that it has now 
passed the FDA approval process.
During the year we added three more 
projects to the Bespak product pipeline, 
two for nasal drug delivery and one to 
design for high volume manufacture a 
nicotine delivery device that can be used 
as a substitute for tobacco cigarettes.  
Two of these contracts will involve 
handling drugs on our Kings Lynn site, 
which will take us further up the value 
chain in line with our stated strategy  
and will offer important cost beneﬁts to 
our customers.
We were also pleased to report in July 
2011 that the Group was participating in a 
further funding round for Atlas Genetics, 
a POC diagnostics company in which we 
took a 19% stake in February 2011. In this 
round, worth up to £17.5m to Atlas, we 
were joined by two global healthcare 
companies with signiﬁcant diagnostic 
interests and two leading healthcare 
investors. Their participation adds to the 
comfort that we gained during our own 
due diligence process. Atlas is making 
good progress in its development work.
We are pleased to have continued to  
grow our strong core platform businesses. 
The further diversiﬁcation into additional 
growing markets such as nasal drug 
delivery, POC diagnostics and airway 
visualisation continues to open up new 
opportunities and de-risks the portfolio.  
I believe the business is well positioned to 
deliver sustainable earnings growth in the 
future. We continue to seek to enhance 
our organic growth through selected 
acquisitions, strategic investments  
and alliances.

further diversiﬁcation 
into additional growing 
markets has continued  
to open up new 
opportunities
5 Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Governance Chief Executive’s review
it has been a very 
successful year, 
delivering record 
revenues and proﬁts 
in a challenging 
global environment
The year ended 30 
April 2012 was another 
successful one. We have 
continued to deliver 
both revenue and proﬁt 
growth to the top end of 
the market’s expectations 
whilst maintaining a 
strong balance sheet,  
with both cash and 
borrowing facilities 
available for investment  
in opportunities.
Revenues from products and services 
grew by 8% to £136.6m and operating 
proﬁts before special items increased 
by 5% to £21.5m. Proﬁt before tax and 
special items increased by 12% to £19.4m. 
The Bespak Division increased revenues 
by 12% to £93.3m and its operating proﬁt 
before special items by 17% to £18.2m. 
The respiratory business continued 
to drive strong growth, with a very 
strong product mix in valves more than 
offsetting further price reductions in a 
major device contract. Valve volumes 
increased by 12%, and included good 
growth in emerging market sales as well 
as additional business for two major 
western customers and ﬁrst sales of our 
valve into the important Chinese market. 
Device services revenues were up on 
last year with increased volumes. The 
approval of our proprietary IDC with 
Teva’s QNASL ™ product is an important 
milestone in the development of our dose 
counter franchise. We are also ramping 
up pre-approval inventory build for the 
DEV750 Dry Powder Inhaler. However, 
we have been less fortunate in achieving 
approval on time for our two injector 
programmes and two valve programmes. 
Some programme delays are the norm 
rather than the exception in a highly 
regulated industry such as ours, and we 
allow for delays to customer timelines  
in our own ﬁnancial planning. None of 
these programmes has been cancelled 
and we are conﬁdent that they will 
launch in 2013. 
Looking to the mid-term pipeline for 
Bespak, we were delighted to add Kind 
Consumer’s Oxette nicotine delivery 
device development programme and 
also two nasal drug delivery programmes 
to the portfolio. The Bespak Innovations 
team has doubled in size and is making 
encouraging progress in a number  
of areas.
King Systems experienced a challenging 
year, with constant currency revenues 
up 2% to £43.3m but operating proﬁts 
down 31% to £3.3m, although £0.9m of 
this related to an increased allocation 
of corporate overheads. Underlying 
sales of core products to end users has 
remained ﬂat in a ﬂat market, but this 
was distorted in our revenues by the 
impact of an inventory pipeline ﬁll in the 
ﬁrst half of the 2010/11 year. Revenues 
from the King Vision were encouraging 
and in line with our expectations. The 
launch in the coming years of further 
products to enhance and deepen the 
King Vision range is expected to be a 
major driver of revenue and proﬁt growth 
for the Division. We also continue to see 
good growth in Airway sales, in particular 
of our King Laryngeal Tube. Following 
the very successful commissioning of 
the Flex2 breathing circuit automation 
line this year, the manufacturing 
transformation programme is reaching 
the ﬁnal stages of execution in the 
coming year. The breathing bag and 
mask automation lines will be installed in 
the second half of this calendar year, with 
full commissioning to take place in the 
ﬁrst months of 2013. The H&M Rubber 
facility is scheduled to close around the 
end of the calendar year following a 
successful inventory build programme. 
In summary, it has been a very successful 
year, delivering record revenues 
and proﬁts in a challenging global 
environment. The strategy that we put  
in place some years ago and the 
dedication of our employees are now 
delivering results.

A
t Bespak, we have delivered three 
new development contracts this 
year and moved up the value 
chain into drug handling for our customers
Bespak is a world leading manufacturer  
of drug delivery devices for the healthcare 
industry. All our product is made here  
in the UK, most of it in Kings Lynn,  
making us one of the more successful  
UK manufacturers and exporters.
We have been seeking to accelerate 
growth by building on our already strong 
and proﬁtable foundations. Fundamental 
to this growth strategy is an understanding 
of how our proven core competencies of 
design for manufacture and high volume 
manufacture in regulated markets can be 
used in new growth opportunities. 
Over the past year we have continued to 
deliver on our strategy of diversiﬁcation 
and moving up the value chain, winning 
new development contracts in the 
nasal and consumer respiratory space, 
expanding our Point-of-Care Diagnostics 
investment and doubling our innovation 
investment to accelerate the development 
of new products. 
Our core business continues to do well. 
We are the number one supplier of 
metered dose inhaler valves, dry powder 
inhalers and medical check valves, 
producing over 500 million devices 
every year. We have now added to that 
capability and can manufacture integrated 
dose counters, diagnostic devices, 
autoinjectors, nasal devices and other 
products. We have expanded to meet 
new markets overseas as well, winning 
business from China to South America.
Bespak is an exciting place to be right 
now: we are delivering on our strategy, 
we are hiring more people and delivering 
more product for our customers.

he core skill set of Bespak is 
of designing, moulding and 
assembling millions of perfect 
devices in a highly regulated environment 
and we are one of very few companies 
worldwide that can do that. 
Every device we make meets strict 
regulatory requirements, which starts 
from excellent process design, purchase 
and installation of ﬁrst class production 
assets, well trained people and excellent 
attention to detail.
Every raw material is traceable, even 
beyond Bespak’s immediate supply chain. 
Suppliers are selected with care, audited 
regularly, and everything they send to us 
is analysed before use.
Every stage of our own production 
processes is tested, checked, challenged 
and logged. Leading-edge metrology 
devices measure precise dimensions of 
samples from each batch to within microns.
All our production lines are designed and 
built using custom designed equipment 
and tooling – we supply unique expertise 
in all areas.
Our employees are key to the process. 
Most have long service with us and all are 
trained in Good Manufacturing Production 
(GMP) standards. They are passionate 
about working in a business which saves 
patients’ lives.
Our Continuous Improvement teams save 
around £1m every year by increasing 
efﬁciency, without ever risking quality.
In the last year we have invested over 
£8m in the manufacturing line to produce 
our proprietary Integrated Dose Counter 
that was approved for launch with a 
customer product in April. It is particularly 
pleasing to see this product come to 
market after years of development  
and we are very proud of the new 
production line.

Having a healthy product pipeline is central 
to our growth strategy and our challenge is 
to continually identify and create solutions  
for the unmet needs of the patient and our 
customers. Our focus is very much on 
making the patient’s life easier.
Here, we are working on the future 
generations of existing product ranges,  
such as our autoinjectors, as well as some 
new concepts such as our nasal products. 
We are not short of ideas: at any time we 
have a broad pipeline of concepts. The 
challenge is to reduce to just two or three 
that will make it successfully to market.
It could be something completely new, or a 
reﬁnement of something we’ve already tried. 
We aim to generate platform solutions, so it 
is particularly satisfying when we can transfer 
proven technologies from one application to 
something completely new.
We work closely with customers, clinical staff 
and patients from a very early stage to ensure 
that our ideas are relevant and commercial.
All of the team get a “buzz” when products 
we have worked on are approved and in a 
patient’s hands, but what actually makes it all 
worthwhile is when it is clear you have made 
someone’s life that little bit easier.

O
ur US Division, King Systems, is also 
undergoing a signiﬁcant transformation  
with new products, such as the King Vision,  
and new manufacturing processes. 
We have made investments over the last three years that have 
revolutionised the manufacture of the Flex2 breathing circuit, 
one of King’s best-selling products.
The patented Flex 2 circuit is one of the most advanced 
breathing circuits on the market, offering a range of clinical and 
operational beneﬁts. However, it was historically manufactured 
using a laborious manual process in our factory.
This manual process was labour intensive. Limited capacity and 
operational gearing made consistent quality harder to achieve 
and presented environmental challenges.
We have now commissioned a bespoke automated production 
line. This was a challenge as it has never been automated before.
The innovation has created huge advantages for the company. 
Productivity is higher, output has increased, margins have 
improved and we have improved the working environment.
Innovation through automation has the power to improve our 
business and free up capacity on our site to bring in new higher 
margin products like the King Vision.
There’s an exciting feeling that we are delivering King Systems 
into a new phase of its growth as a company.

REVIEW OF THE YEAR
Bespak is a leading global drug delivery 
device manufacturer which manufactures 
over 500 million devices per year, 
mainly for the respiratory segment. The 
business strategy is to leverage its unique 
competencies of design for manufacture 
and high volume manufacture in regulated 
markets into new market segments, 
broadening and diversifying the number 
of growth opportunities and where 
possible expanding up the value chain. 
The Bespak division enjoyed another 
strong performance in the year to 30 
April 2012. Revenues increased by 12% to 
£93.3m and operating proﬁts by 17% to 
£18.2m. Operating margins increased for 
the fourth successive year to 19.6% (2011: 
18.7%). This was despite doubling our 
investment in our Innovations Centre in 
Cambridge, where we will be expanding 
again in the coming year. 
The development portfolio has progressed 
very well. One of the major programmes 
in our pipeline has launched on schedule. 
We have also added three new 
development programmes, signiﬁcantly 
increasing the potential revenues for the 
division and achieving the strategic goals 
of handling drug for our customers and 
of entry into a new drug delivery device 
market (nasal). Some of the programmes 
in the pipeline that were scheduled for 
launch in 2012 are now expected to launch 
in 2013: a level of delay that is common 
in our industry. However, no programmes 
have been cancelled and since we assume 
in our ﬁnancial projections that there will 
be some slippage, we have not changed 
our revenue expectations for 2012/13 and 
beyond. We believe that the net present 
value (NPV) of the overall development 
portfolio has increased signiﬁcantly over 
the past 12 months.
Bespak Respiratory
The core respiratory business continued 
to perform very well in the last year. 
Revenues increased by 12% to £91.9m. 
Valve volumes were the driver of growth, 
increasing by 12% over the prior year. This 
was driven by particularly strong sales 
in the ﬁrst half when certain customers 
needed exceptionally high volumes. In 
July, we announced that Bespak had 
renewed its largest valve contract on an 
exclusive basis for the long term. We also 
announced in October that International 
Aluminium Components (IAC), Bespak’s 
facility that manufactures aluminium 
ferrules for its valves, had signed a long-
term extension to its contract with its 
other large pharmaceutical and personal 
care customer. Bespak has also won its 
ﬁrst business in China, which is a large 
potential market, with increasing demand 
driven by increasing industrialisation and  
a move away from traditional medicines. 
Good progress was also made with the 
next generation of new products that 
is expected to support medium-term 
growth. Signiﬁcantly, we announced in 
April that Teva had received FDA approval 
to launch their QNASL ™ drug for the 
treatment of rhinitis with a device that

MDI valves
The valve on a metered 
dose inhaler ensures  
that the patient  
receives an identical  
and precisely metered 
dose of drug every time 
over the multi-year life  
of the product.
Medical check valves
Widely used in a broad 
range of devices, from 
masks and airway  
devices to catheters. 
They allow the controlled 
inﬂation and deﬂation  
of medical devices.
Dry powder inhalers
Breath actuated inhaler 
devices whereby the 
patient directly inhales 
the medication into  
the lung.
Autoinjectors
Pre-loaded single use 
devices. When pressed 
against the skin they 
insert the needle, deliver 
the drug and retract  
the needle into the  
used device.
Needle-free injectors
These devices inject small 
quantities of drug by 
forcing droplets through 
the skin rather than using 
a needle.
Integrated dose counters
Increasingly required on 
metered dose inhalers  
so that patients can be 
aware of the number  
of doses remaining in

uses our Integrated Dose Counter (IDC). 
This programme was listed as IDC220 in 
the development portfolio. This is the ﬁrst 
regulatory approval for our proprietary 
IDC. The FDA has provided guidance 
that new drugs delivered by an inhaler 
should have a dose counter and has 
recommended the retro-ﬁtting of dose 
counters to existing products. The QNASL 
programme is an exciting opportunity in 
its own right, but it also reassures other 
potential customers that our device will 
meet regulatory requirements. A number 
of customers are expected to trial the IDC 
in the coming year. The installation of the 
£8m manufacturing line at Kings Lynn 
progressed well over the last year and we 
have installed capacity to meet forecast 
future demand.
The Easiﬁll primeless valve (VAL310) was 
ﬁled for approval with the FDA by our 
lead customer for a systemic application 
on schedule in 2011. The primeless valve’s 
open metering chamber delivers a full 
dose of drug regardless of which way up 
the patient has been storing the device, 
addressing a long-standing compliance 
challenge for pharmaceutical customers. 
Our customer now expects a launch date 
of 2013 rather than late 2012 as previously 
indicated. We have commissioned the 
manufacturing assets for this product 
and have been building some pre-launch 
stocks. The VAL020 valve has also 
completed customer trials successfully. 
Current indications from the customer  
are for a launch in 2013. 
Bespak’s device services business offers 
unique design for manufacture and 
manufacturing capabilities to customers 
who own their own device technologies. 
Revenues on marketed products in this 
segment include the GlaxoSmithKline 
(GSK) Diskus® device and a few smaller 
programmes. The device services business 
performed well over the past year, with 
revenues up 6% on stronger volumes and 
service income. We continued to make 
good progress in industrialising two Dry 
Powder Inhalers (DPIs) for customers. The 
ﬁrst of these (DEV750) is due to launch in 
2012: we are already manufacturing pre-
launch volumes and our customer expects 
approval to launch on schedule in the 
fourth calendar quarter. The second DPI 
(DEV610) is now seeing a greater level of 
activity as the customer continues to work 
towards the goal of approval in late 2015.

Bespak Injectables
Bespak Injectables was created by the 
combination of the ASI
TM
 autoinjector 
technology acquired with The Medical 
House plc in 2009 with the manufacturing 
capabilities of Bespak. The business 
addresses the fast growing autoinjector 
drug delivery segment. Autoinjectors are 
used by patients to self-inject medicines, 
normally to treat chronic diseases, such as 
multiple sclerosis or rheumatoid arthritis, 
or for emergency situations, such as 
epinephrine to treat anaphylactic shock. 
This market segment is expected to 
grow rapidly due to the need to inject 
most biologic drugs, which make up a 
signiﬁcant proportion of the current drug 
development pipeline.

During the year we also announced the 
closure of the Shefﬁeld development 
centre and the transfer of our Injectables 
activities to Kings Lynn. This is expected 
to deliver an enhanced development 
and production capability for Bespak 
Injectables through co-location with the 
greater resources of the Kings Lynn team. 
We appreciate the great professionalism 
of the team at Shefﬁeld in ensuring that 
the transfer has progressed smoothly.
Innovations and Atlas Genetics
The establishment of our Innovations 
Centre in Cambridge has been a key 
part of our diversiﬁcation strategy. The 
team has been exploring a broad range 
of opportunities to expand Bespak into 
related market areas where it can add 
value with its unique skills. 
In its ﬁrst year of operation the 
Innovations team entered into an 
agreement to develop products for the 
Point-of-Care (POC) diagnostics market 
with Atlas. POC diagnostics systems 
deliver rapid patient testing into the 
clinician’s surgery, avoiding the cost and 
delay of referral of samples to central 
laboratories. These systems generally use 
a relatively sophisticated disposable card 
within which the patient sample is tested 
without risk of cross-contamination to 
other samples. Bespak chose to work with 
Atlas, which has a particularly interesting 
technology which appears to offer highly 
selective and speciﬁc performance in a 
very short sub-30-minute time period. 
The system is potentially applicable to 
detect a wide range of diseases, but is 
currently being focused on the important 
and fast growing market for the diagnosis 
of sexually transmitted diseases. Bespak 
has a development contract to design for 
manufacture and scale up the disposable 
cartridge used in the system, and has 
secured long-term manufacturing rights 
for when the system enters commercial 
production. Shortly after Consort made 
its initial investment into Atlas, we were 
pleased to participate in a further funding 
round in which we were joined by Novartis 
Venture Funds and Johnson & Johnson 
Development Corporation, leading global 
healthcare companies with signiﬁcant 
diagnostic interests, as well as two well-
known life science investors. This latest 
round may invest up to £17.5m into Atlas 
phased over three years. Consort has 
invested £2.5m into Atlas which could rise 
to a total of up to £3.8m. During the past 
year extensive progress has been made 
in developing the disposable cartridge for 
Atlas, and working alpha prototypes were 
supplied for evaluation and testing. The 
potential opportunity and the routes to 
market for Atlas remain exciting, although 
we now anticipate a launch in 2014 rather 
than the previously estimated 2013.
In July 2011 we reported that the 
Innovations team had won a contract 
to develop a nasal drug delivery device 
(NAS010) for a major pharmaceutical 
company that is expected to launch in 
2014. This was followed in October by 
the winning of a second nasal contract 
(NAS020) with a leading generics 
company that will use our proprietary 
Unidose™ technology. This programme 
is expected to launch in 2015. We believe 
that we have the right combination of 
proprietary technology and skills to win 
further share in this space in the future.
The Innovations team have also continued 
to develop new technology platforms for 
our core businesses.

REVIEW OF THE YEAR
King Systems is a leading US developer 
and manufacturer of disposable medical 
devices used to establish and maintain 
patient airways. Its strategy is to grow 
through new product launches and 
international expansion. King Systems is 
entering the ﬁnal year of a programme  
to increase margins through the 
automation and improvement of its  
core manufacturing processes.
King Systems recovered from a weak ﬁrst 
half to deliver modest revenue growth 
in an important year which saw ﬁrst 
revenues from the King Vision digital video 
laryngoscope and continuing progress 
in the manufacturing transformation 
programme. Revenues for the year were 
broadly ﬂat (2% growth at constant 
exchange rate) at £43.3m, with growth 
in visualisation and airway products in 
otherwise challenging markets. Operating 
proﬁts fell by 32% (31% at constant 
exchange rate) to £3.3m, although £0.9m 
of this related to an increased allocation of 
our Head Ofﬁce overheads. Excluding the 
change in corporate allocation, like-for-like 
operating proﬁt fell by 10% at constant 
exchange rates. Operating margins were 
slightly down at 8%, reﬂecting higher 
raw material prices and duplicated 
manufacturing costs as new processes 
were commissioned.
Encouraging revenues  
from the King Vision
In October 2010, King Systems launched 
the King Vision video laryngoscope at 
the conference of the Anaesthesiology 
Society of America (ASA), the main 
US conference for anaesthetists and in 
June 2011 shipped the ﬁrst commercial 
product. The King Vision is Kings’ most 
sophisticated product and is expected 
to be a key driver of organic growth. The 
King Vision allows anaesthetists and other 
clinicians to see precisely where they 
are placing an endotracheal tube when 
establishing a patient airway. It consists 
of a reusable handle containing an OLED 
screen and a disposable blade containing a 
camera which allows the clinician to easily 
position the tube in the trachea. It has 
market leading optics, but is being offered 
at a cost that will allow its use in routine 
intubations as well as for the management 
of difﬁcult airways. The King Vision is 
therefore expected to address one of the 
major unmet needs of the airway market. 
The King Vision is also expected to open 
up new channel opportunities for King 
Systems outside the operating room in 
new areas where clinicians have an interest 
in safe and quick establishment of airways, 
such as Emergency Medical Services 
(EMS) and respiratory. 
Shipments of the King Vision commenced 
in June 2011, with revenues in the following 
ten months in line with expectations and 
above the full year peak sales for King 
Systems of the Airtraq product it replaced. 
We have been delighted to have won a 
Medical Design Excellence Award, a highly 
coveted endorsement of important new 
technologies in the US. Feedback from 
clinicians and the sales force has been 
consistently positive, although the rate 
of adoption is expected to be cautious

operating procedure.
Airway devices
King Laryngeal Tubes (KLTs) and King Laryngeal 
Airway Devices (KLAD) are supraglottic airway 
devices, used to establish an airway without 
entering the trachea. These are most often used 
in emergency settings or for brief procedures.
Key products
as anaesthesia is a conservative market. 
We were particularly encouraged by 
revenues in the EMS segment where 
the cost of deploying more expensive 
system platforms across EMS settings, 
such as ambulance ﬂeets, has historically 
been prohibitive. In order to maximise our 
opportunity in this segment and to add 
dedicated sales and marketing resource, 
we have entered into a distribution 
agreement with Bound Tree Medical, 
a leading distributor in the EMS space. 
International revenues for the King  
Vision also grew rapidly as regulatory 
approvals in overseas territories were 
progressively received.
Our R&D team has developed an exciting 
technology road map for the King Vision 
to continually broaden and deepen the 
product range. Further developments of 
the product are forecast to launch in early 
2013 that are expected to signiﬁcantly 
increase the available market.
Transforming manufacturing
King Systems continued to make progress 
with its transformation plan. We have 
been very pleased by the performance 
of the new Flex 2 automation line that 
installed in late 2010 and was validated for 
manufacture on schedule at the end of 
April 2011. Operational performance of the 
new automated line consistently exceeded 
our plans and in January we reported 
that it had manufactured its millionth 
circuit. The line is ultimately expected to 
manufacture over 3 million Flex 2 circuits 
per annum, to an even higher degree of 
quality than the existing product. 
The breathing bag dip lines are being 
installed now and will be commissioned 
and fully operational by calendar year 
end. A successful inventory build of 
breathing bags at the H&M plant has 
been completed and manufacturing of 
breathing bags at H&M will cease at the 
end of July. 
Development of the automated mask 
line has been a little slower than we 
had hoped, and in December 2011 
we reported that the closure of H&M 
would be in the third quarter of 2012, 
a few months behind schedule. The 
automated mask line is expected to be 
installed at Noblesville by the end of 
the calendar year. In order to maintain 
sufﬁcient inventory levels to de-risk this 
programme, we now plan to cease mask 
cushion manufacture at H&M Rubber 
around the end of the calendar year. 
Accordingly the cost savings associated 
with the ﬁnal site closure will not be 
realised in full until FY2013/14, although 
working capital will reduce rapidly in the 
ﬁnal quarter as the transition inventory 
that was built at H&M is consumed.
Growing overseas markets
While King Systems is a market leader in 
the US, with its own sales force covering 
all major territories, the business has 
historically had a lower overseas presence. 
Expansion of international sales offers a 
major opportunity to grow at faster than 
market rates. The strategy to achieve this 
has included increasing the number of 
international distributors, improving the 
business processes to support them, and 
development of new products that will be 
appropriate for international markets of 
which the King Vision is expected to be 
a ﬂagship product. In the year to 30 April 
2012, King Systems grew international 
revenues by 9% to $9m – reﬂecting 13%  
of total sales, up from 10% in 2008/09.
Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 17 Operating review
Corporate responsibility
Our focus is to embed the management  
of these areas into our business operations, 
both managing risk and delivering 
opportunities that can have a positive 
inﬂuence on our business.
Governance
We continue to explore opportunities to 
embed Corporate Responsibility (CR) 
through our CR Committee, chaired by 
non-executive director Jim Dick. This 
committee meets three times a year to 
review performance and challenge the 
businesses to explore opportunities for 
continuous improvement.
Our focus of activities is shaped by the four 
pillars of our CR framework. These cover:
• Community – recognition from the 
communities in which we operate
• Employees – supporting our people
• Environment – managing our 
environmental impact
• Ethical standards – acting with integrity 
to achieve the highest ethical standards
Performance management
Over the past 12 months, the Group, 
facilitated by the CR committee, has 
developed a number of key performance 
indicators to help manage both CR risks 
and opportunities. These KPIs reﬂect 
the four pillars of our CR framework and 
cover: community investment, employee 
turnover, diversity, health and safety, waste, 
carbon reduction, and water consumption. 
Performance is reviewed against these KPIs 
at each of the CR Committee meetings, 
with feedback provided to the business.
Stakeholder engagement
In 2011 Bespak completed a stakeholder 
engagement identiﬁcation and 
prioritisation exercise against each CR 
framework element. This has helped to 
understand key internal and external 
stakeholder groups, the inﬂuence they 
have on delivering Bespak’s CR objectives 
and how a programme of stakeholder 
engagement is developed to ensure the 
business listens and incorporates the views 
of key groups.
Our performance
We continue to see progress in 
embedding CR within our businesses with 
key highlights of our performance over the 
past 12 months summarised below.
Community
We are committed to supporting the 
patient population we serve and the 
communities in which we operate. Both 
local and national charities are considered 
important stakeholders to our businesses. 
To help deliver this commitment Bespak 
and King Systems have both established 
employee-led charity groups, with the aim 
of maximising opportunities to partner 
with external organisations.
Bespak continues to support the Great 
East Anglian Run (GEAR), both through 
employee participation and sponsorship. 
The relationship has been secured for 
a further three years with the business 
agreeing a longer-term sponsorship 
agreement.
Bespak hosted a training day for 
eight 4th year Master of Engineering 
undergraduates from Cambridge 
University. This has helped to connect 
Bespak with the employees of the future, 
whilst providing a resource to help  
facilitate a fresh and enthusiastic approach 
to projects.
Bespak continues to offer local support 
in King’s Lynn by supporting the three 
main High Schools with Science Awards 
and regularly supports visits from local 
schools and work experience placements 
to allow students to gain an insight into 
our business.
As a departure from previous years King 
Systems empowered employees to select 
a charity or charities to beneﬁt from 
business donations. Two charities were 
chosen and fundraising activities provided 
support to these causes. In addition to 
this, a number of activities were initiated 
to engage with employees and help build 
staff morale.
Employees
The businesses constantly seek ways 
to improve employee communications 
to ensure interventions remain effective 
and deliver business value. Both Bespak 
and King Systems have focused efforts 
on more effectively engaging and 
communicating with employees.
In the past 12 months Bespak has initiated 
a number of employee engagement 
and communication programmes which 
include: an anonymous posting facility,  
bi-monthly business wide team brief, 
regular breakfast and lunch meetings 
(hosted by the Operating Board). The  
bi-annual newsletter continues to be a  
well received publication for all employees. 
The employee survey has been postponed 
to the coming year in order to maximise  
its effectiveness.
Over the same period Bespak also 
relaunched the corporate values recognition 
award, enabling employees to nominate

Bespak also expanded its apprenticeship 
scheme with the appointment of 
a Warehousing & Storage and an 
Information Systems apprentice.
King Systems has developed a process 
which enables the business to gather 
and respond to employee opinions and 
perceptions. As with Bespak, this involved 
establishing a number of communication 
channels which include: CEO quarterly 
communication meetings, CEO luncheons 
with small groups of employees, focus 
groups for speciﬁc initiatives, and regular 
function head meetings. King Systems 
has also recognised over 100 employees 
during the year with “value” awards for 
going above and beyond their job.

deliver further business savings and meet 
ambitious energy reduction targets which 
were established in 2010/11 to reduce 
consumption relative to output more than 
20% by 2013/14.
Bespak is actively managing all of its waste 
and has a target to recycle or recover 
more than 90% of the waste it generates.
King Systems has implemented processes 
that have signiﬁcantly improved the 
air quality within manufacturing and is 
utilising the KPIs to drive improvements in 
recycling and resource efﬁciency. Health 
and Safety remains a priority across the 
business. We aim to ensure that all staff 
are fully involved in ensuring that tasks 
within the business are accomplished 
safely through:
• Consistently promoting a culture across 
all staff of Health and Safety awareness. 
This is accomplished through brieﬁngs, 
training, audits, performance measures 
and systems that allow staff to identify 
and resolve hazards in their work areas.
• Driving a Risk Management Programme 
that systematically assesses Health and 
Safety risks in the work environment, 
and prior to the introduction of any new 
processes and equipment.
• Constantly monitoring Health and 
Safety issues. Daily meetings in the work 
environment review reports of near misses 
or accidents over the previous 24 hours.
Ethical standards
We continue to operate to the highest 
ethical standards across the Group. It 
is policy to uphold all laws relevant to 
prevention of bribery and corruption 
in all jurisdictions in which we operate. 
Compliance with the new UK Bribery 
Act has been a priority for the Group, 
with processes and policies put in place 
designed to meet the requirements of  
the Act.
Achievements and goals
• Completed new hire induction process to improve • Bespak and King Systems to launch employee
• Launched Group Community Investment Strategy • King Systems to provide individual
Ongoingreductions to: • Reduce energy consumption at Bespak
• Bespak and King Systems launched a bribery and • Introduce Ethical Standards Policy
Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 19 Operating review
Having strategically repositioned the Group, 
we believe we are now delivering sustained 
revenue and earnings growth from a strong 
platform. The Group operates in defensive 
markets with resilient end customer 
demand and it further benefits from a 
strong balance sheet and cash flows. 
Moreover, we are now seeing the benefits 
of our focus on investment in research 
and development with a growing range 
of product launches due over the next 
few years. Our strategy of diversification 
reduces the risk of being exposed to any 
single market and in the past two years 
we have positioned ourselves to benefit 
from growth markets such as biological 
drug delivery by autoinjector, Point-of-
Care diagnostics and nasal drug delivery. 
We have also this year won contracts 
that will involve us handling drugs for our 
customers. We believe that drug handling 
alongside device manufacture adds value, 
simplifies the supply chain and will give us 
an important future competitive advantage. 
In June 2012, we completed long-term 
refinancing of the Group’s facilities, securing 
funding for investment and potential 
acquisitions and ensuring that the Group 
is well funded in the face of an increase in 
global economic uncertainty.
Income statement 
Revenue from products and services 
in 2011/12 rose by 8% to £136.6m (2011: 
£126.8m), with the greatest growth being 
at Bespak. Bespak revenues rose by 12% to 
£93.3m, driven in particular by strong valve 
sales. Revenue in King Systems was flat at 
£43.3m (which represented 2% growth at 
constant exchange rate (CER)). 
Operating profit (before special items ) 
rose 5% to £21.5m. Bespak contributed 
an operating profit before special items 
of £18.2m, up 17% on prior year. Bespak’s 
operating margin of 19.6% (2011: 18.7%) 
was up for a fourth year in a row (2008 
operating margin: 16.0%). King Systems 
contributed an operating profit before 
special items of £3.3m, with an operating 
margin of 8% (2011: 11%). This included an 
increased allocation of Corporate costs  
of £0.9m as part of an arm’s-length  
transfer pricing initiative. Underlying 
operating profit at King Systems before 
these allocations fell by 10%, mainly as 
a result of higher material costs and 
duplicated manufacturing costs from  
the automation programme.
Profit before tax and special items rose by 
12% to £19.4m (2011: £17 .4m), and was at the 
top end of expectations. Profit before tax 
of £17 .8m was 40% up on the prior period 
(2011: £12.7m).
Profit after tax and special items increased 
by 37% to £14.2m. Basic earnings per share 
therefore increased by 38% to 49.5p while 
adjusted basic earnings per share increased 
by 15% to 52.2p.
Taxation
The taxation charge for the year was 
£3.7m. The underlying tax charge of £4.4m 
reﬂects a rate of 22.9% (2011: 24.5%), a 
little lower than anticipated due to a higher 
balance of UK rather than US earnings. 
During the year we obtained a cash credit 
of over $1m following a tax project in the 
US that will slightly lower our ongoing tax 
rate through ﬁling returns in more states. 
Improved transfer pricing activities and 
R&D tax credit claims in the UK, along with 
a falling UK tax rate, contributed to the 
reduced overall tax charge.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend 
per share of 12.1p (2011: 12.1p) such that the 
total dividend for the period amounts to 
19.1p (2011: 19.1p). The final dividend will be 
paid on 26 October 2012 to shareholders on 
the register on 21 September 2012. Dividend 
cover, based on earnings before special 
items, was 2.7 times (2011: 2.4 times ). 
Special items
Special items of £1.6m included £2.2m of 
continuing amortisation of intangible assets 
following the acquisition of King Systems in 
2005 and TMH in 2009, and a net credit of 
£0.6m for restructuring and other special 
charges. These included restructuring 
costs largely related to the King Systems 
transformation of £1.0m, £0.4m of other 
restructuring costs and £0.4m of impaired 
financing arrangement fees relating to the 
2010 refinancing, offset by provision releases 
of £2.4m previously reported in our interim 
accounts. We again do not anticipate any 
net restructuring costs in the coming year.
Investment in Atlas Genetics Ltd
In July 2011, Consort Medical plc made a 
further investment in Atlas Genetics Ltd 
(Atlas ) in a funding round alongside Novartis 
Venture Funds, Johnson & Johnson 
Development Corporation, Life Science 
Partners and BB Biotech Ventures. The 
new investment round may total £17 .5m 
over three rounds, depending upon the 
achievement of development milestones. 
Consort Medical’s total investment could 
ultimately rise to £3.8m of which £2.5m has 
been invested to date over the two rounds 
in February and July 2011. We are delighted 
to have been joined as co-investors by 
two leading healthcare companies with 
significant diagnostic interests and two 
leading life science investors: we believe 
that their investment underlines the great 
potential of Atlas and the additional funding 
is expected to be sufficient to launch the 
current products for the detection of 
chlamydia and gonorrhoea as well as to 
start development of diagnostic tests for 
other infectious diseases.
Finance review
Record revenues  
and profit growth
Consort Medical plc 
had a successful year 
ended 30 April 2012, 
delivering record 
revenues and proﬁt 
growth at the top end 
of expectations.
20 Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Bespak has retained its long-term 
manufacturing rights to the disposable  
card used in the Atlas system and continues 
with an arm’s-length development contract 
to design for manufacture and scale up 
production of the disposable card. The 
investment will continue to be treated as 
an equity investment in the accounts of 
Consort Medical plc.
Balance sheet
The Group maintained a strong balance 
sheet, with £14.7m of cash and net debt of 
£37 .7m, just 1.3 times EBITDA. Gross assets 
were £182.8m (2011: £166.9m). The pension 
deficit fell to £3.4m (2011: £6.4m) and is 
reviewed separately below. Provisions fell 
from £7 .5m at the beginning of the period 
to £3.7m at 30 April 2012.
Cash flow, financing and liquidity
The Group’s Divisions are strongly cash-
generative. EBITDA rose to £28.8m 
(2011: £25.0m) and cash generated from 
continuing operations was £24.6m (2011: 
£21.3m). Capital expenditure of £11.5m 
was higher than the previous period (2011: 
£8.3m). The majority of capital expenditure 
was at King Systems to support the 
automation programme and in Bespak 
to install capacity to manufacture dose 
counters. Loan repayments totalled £4.0m 
(2011: £8.8m) and pension deﬁcit payments 
£1.9m (2011: £2.9m). A substantial portion 
of the Group’s borrowings are currently 
held in US dollars and qualify as an 
investment hedge against movements in 
the King Systems assets which they were 
used to acquire – hence all gains and losses 
are taken to exchange reserves within 
equity. Net debt rose very slightly  
to £37.7m (2010: £33.8m), a rise of £3.1m  
at constant currency. US dollar interest 
costs are met by US dollar income from 
King Systems and Bespak. 
In April 2010, the Group refinanced its 
principal facilities with the Royal Bank of 
Scotland (RBS) and HSBC, which facilities 
were still in place as at 30 April 2012. These 
were split into two revolving credit facilities 
(RCFs ) and a term loan. The first RCF was 
for $56m, against which we had drawn 
$56m as at 30 April 2012. At 30 April 2012, 
we had also drawn down £11.8m against the 
second RCF and we had £6m outstanding 
in a GBP term loan. Margins were between 
2% and 3% over LIBOR depending upon 
the ratio of net debt to EBITDA prevailing 
at the time. A non-utilisation fee of half 
the margin has been applicable to unused 
headroom and arrangement fees of around 
1.7% (including advisors fees ) were being 
amortised until April 2013. The interest rate 
on most of the USD borrowings and the 
amounts borrowed under the GBP term 
loan has been fixed until January 2014 using 
swaps that fix the interest rate between 
1.48% and 1.78% plus bank margin. As at  
30 April 2012, 67% of our borrowings were 
at fixed rates. 
Subsequent to year end, in June 2012, the 
Group refinanced its principal facilities with 
the Royal Bank of Scotland (RBS) and 
HSBC, in order to secure financing for the 
next four years, given the current economic 
climate. These new facilities will expire 
in November 2016. In order to eliminate 
the risk of volatile currency movements 
affecting our headroom, we have continued 
to split our main facilities into two RCFs but 
with no term loan. The first RCF is for $56m, 
while the second RCF is for up to £40m, 
a total facility of around £75m. Margins 
have remained unchanged between the 
old facilities and the new, with a cost of 
between 2% and 3% over LIBOR depending 
upon the ratio of net debt to EBITDA 
prevailing at the time. The non-utilisation fee 
on unused headroom has reduced to 40% 
of the margin and arrangement fees  
of around 1.5% (including advisors fees ) 
are to be amortised to October 2015. 
Unamortised arrangement fees totalling 
£0.4m from the 2010 financing have been 
expensed as special items in the year 
ended 30 April 2012. Under the terms 
of the refinancing, the Group also now 
has a £25m “accordion” facility, by which 
additional funds may be made available by 
RBS and HSBC under the current terms to 
support significant investment or acquisition 
opportunities that may arise.
The Group maintains levels of sterling cash 
sufficient to meet imminent obligations and 
to be a reserve in case of an adverse event. 
These funds are invested with a range of 
reputable financial institutions approved by 
the Board. 
With net debt at 1.3 times EBITDA, the 
Group remains comfortably within both  
its headroom and its covenants. T aking  
into account the cash balances available,  
the total headroom at the period end  
was £28.8m (2011: £35m). The decrease  
in headroom was largely as a result of  
the repayment of the loans as described 
above and has been reversed following  
the refinancing in June.
Foreign currency and European exposure
The Group monitors its foreign currency 
exposures carefully and seeks to mitigate all 
material transactional exposures. The Group 
currently has low exposure to movements 
in the euro and only a modest exposure to 
US dollar movements. Where necessary 
we buy or sell forward currency to protect 
current period transactions. The Group has 
a translational exposure to the US dollar with 
its King Systems Division which is to some 
extent mitigated by maintaining borrowings 
in US dollars. 
The Group does have significant sales 
into the eurozone. We are vigilant as to 
the growing risks in Europe, but it is an 
important feature of our market that our 
customers are generally very profitable 
and stable entities for whom our products 
are generally a small part of the total cost 
of sales. The majority of them purchase 
product from us in sterling and they are 
generally unable to change their supply 
chains due to the regulatory environment 
in the short or even medium term. We 
continue to monitor the situation closely.
Pension scheme
Bespak operates a defined benefit pension 
scheme in the UK that is closed to new 
employees, who are eligible to join a defined 
contribution pension scheme. As at 30 April 
2012, the deficit was £3.4m compared with 
£6.4m as at 30 April 2011. The movement 
was primarily as a result of gross liabilities 
increasing slightly to £71.5m due to declining 
discount rates, offset by a recovery in asset 
values and a cash contribution by the Group 
of £1.9m. The Group completed its triennial 
revaluation of the pension scheme as at 
30 April 2011, at which point the pension 
scheme was in a small actuarial surplus. 
Following discussions with the T rustees,  
we were therefore pleased to be able to 
cease making cash deficit contributions  
to the scheme from December 2011. 
Risk management 
The Group considers effective risk 
management to be a high priority. Specific 
risk management activities are reviewed  
on pages 22–23 of the Annual Report. 
We are pleased to report that the Group 
incurred no material financial or business 
losses despite the riskier economic and 
business environment.

Group Finance Director

Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 21 Operating review
Risk management
of the Group and improved the Risk 
Mitigation plans that are in place for all 
key risks. Over the coming year, the Risk 
Committee will oversee the introduction 
of a Group-wide Risk Management 
Software system that will automate the 
Risk Register and drive better compliance 
of mitigation actions as well as improving 
the reporting of progress in reducing key 
risk areas.
Principal risks and how  
we mitigate them
There are risks and uncertainties relevant 
to the Group’s business, ﬁnancial condition 
and results of operations that may affect 
the Group’s performance and ability to 
achieve its objectives. The factors below 
are among those that the Group believes 
could cause its actual results to differ 
materially from expected and historical 
results. It is not possible, however, for the 
Group to implement controls to respond 
to all the risks that it may face, and there 
can be no assurance that the steps the 
Group has taken to address certain risks 
will manage these risks effectively or at all. 
Good risk  
management  
is part of our DNA
Manufacturing over 500 million 
devices every year, most of them 
under the watchful eye of the FDA 
and other regulatory bodies, we have 
always made every effort to manage 
quality to the highest standards 
and to minimise the risk of ever 
causing a patient harm. This focus 
on operational risk management is 
expanded into our other areas of risk 
management activity.
Over the past year, we have made 
sweeping improvements to our risk 
management processes from the top 
down in order to better manage risk 
through the coming growth phase of 
the Group. The Board has updated 
its formal Risk Strategy and Risk 
Appetite policies and established a 
Risk Committee, chaired by the Group 
Finance Director, whose responsibility 
is to ensure that the Risk Systems of 
the Group deliver the adopted Board 
strategy. In its ﬁrst year of operation, 
the Risk Committee has standardised 
the risk measurement systems 
Principal risks and  
how we mitigate them
Product quality failure: The Group operates in highly 
regulated markets with strict quality requirements. 
Any quality failure involving the Group’s products 
could lead to loss of reputation, reduction in 
revenues, recall costs or sanction by the regulators.
Risk
Reliance upon key customers: The Bespak division 
has a degree of reliance on a number of key 
customers, which is to a degree inevitable due to  
its strong market share in respiratory devices.
Increasing cost pressures  
and commoditisation of markets
Employee recruitment and retention:
The failure to recruit or the unexpected 
departure of key employees could put at  
risk the business operations.
Supply chain delay or interruption: The Divisions 
are often committed to long-term supply from a 
small number of suppliers by regulatory filings.
Delay to the transformation programme:
King Systems is in the ﬁnal year of an extensive 
automation programme that will result in the 
closure of a manufacturing site.
Regulatory risk: The operations of the Group are 
subject to various regulatory requirements which 
confer a degree of protection as well as an element  
of risk, in particular to delivering growth.
Misallocation of capital: The Group is in 
a strong financial position which could  
be jeopardised by poor use of capital for 
Mergers & Acquisitions (M&A) or investment.
Development risk: The Group is developing 
a range of products at any time, any of which 
may fail in clinical trials or may not become 
commercially successful.
Control of  
ﬁnancial risk
Financial risks are generally 
considered relatively low for 
the Group because of its 
strongly proﬁtable, cash 
generative base, and 
because it is able to take 
action to hedge or insure 
against most material 
ﬁnancial risks. This section 
reviews our key policies for 
control of ﬁnancial risks. 
Credit risk
The Group has implemented policies that require 
appropriate credit checks on potential customers 
before sales over a certain limit are agreed. 
Credit limits and outstanding receivables are 
reviewed monthly and action taken if a new risk 
is identiﬁed. The Group has an excellent record 
on collection of receivables. The Group monitors 
the levels of cash held with ﬁnancial institutions 
and the credit rating of those institutions in order 
to manage credit risk on cash balances.
Risk
 
Mitigation
Interest rate risk
The Group is subject to interest rate risk on its 
revolving bank facility, the terms of which are 
reviewed by the Board on a regular basis.  
The Group’s policy is to convert a large portion  
of its ﬂoating rate debt into ﬁxed rate using 
interest rate swaps. At the end of the ﬁnancial 
year over 90% of the Group’s debt was at a  
ﬁxed rate of interest. Consequently the impact  
of any foreseeable rise in interest rates on 
existing borrowing would not be material.
More information on ﬁnancial instruments is given in note 26 to the accounts.
22 Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Strategy for mitigation Progress in 2011/12 Future targets
The Group has rigorous quality assurance processes.

The Group employment policies and remuneration
Currency risk
The Group is a sterling denominated Group  
that receives some of its income and incurs  
some of its costs in US dollars and, to a much 
smaller extent, Euros. It has hedging agreements 
in place to minimise the impact of currency 
ﬂuctuation. It also has signiﬁcant assets 
denominated in US dollars that are hedged  
by borrowings in the same currency to manage 
translational exposure.
Liquidity risk
The Group has strong cash ﬂows and good 
earnings visibility ensures that its margins are 
sufﬁcient to exceed normal operating costs  
and its major operating subsidiaries are 
cash-generative. Current borrowing levels  
and ﬁnancial covenants can be supported 
comfortably by forecast proﬁt and cash  
ﬂows. Facilities are in place until 2016.
Pension risk
The Group works closely with the Pension 
Trustees to ensure that the Deﬁned Beneﬁt 
Scheme is well funded and that the assets are 
invested appropriately to meet future liabilities  
as they fall due. The Scheme was closed to new 
members in 2002 and was in surplus at the last 
actuarial valuation in 2011.

distribution of income or capital.
Transfers of shares
There are no restrictions on the transfer of ordinary shares or 
on the exercise of voting rights attached to them save where

rights or to prohibit their transfer following the omission of 
their holder or any person interested in them to provide the 
Company with information requested by it in accordance with 
Part 22 of the Companies Act 2006 or where their holder 
is precluded from exercising voting rights by the Financial 
Services Authority Listing Rules or the City Code on Takeovers 
and Mergers. None of the shares carry any special rights with 
regard to the control of the Company.
The directors may refuse to register a transfer of ordinary 
shares where such transfer documents are not lodged by 
acceptable means or proof of title is required.
Purchase of own shares
At the Annual General Meeting on 1 September 2011

price of 527.184p each; 55,000 ordinary shares on 14 October 
Directors’ Report continued
The Group is committed to maximising the level of employee

employees are encouraged, through sponsorship or a 
contribution to costs, to study for job-related qualiﬁcations.
The Group is committed to achieving the highest levels of 
quality. The Bespak Division operates to the internationally 
recognised medical device standard ISO 13485. Staff work 
within a deﬁned quality system and are trained in “Good 
Manufacturing Practice”.

of consultative forums whose members are elected by staff. 
Regular brieﬁngs are given to staff to keep them informed 
of matters concerning the business, including ﬁnancial and 
economic factors affecting the Group.
The Group operates share option schemes, performance-
related bonus schemes and the Company share incentive plan, 
which employees are encouraged to join.

Signiﬁcant agreements – change of control
There are a number of signiﬁcant agreements containing 
provisions that take effect (including provisions permitting 
counterparties to terminate agreements) upon a change 
of control of the Company. These include both commercial 
and bank loan facilities agreements. Maintaining strong 
relationships with all counterparties is an important element 
in the risk management of the business and to help safeguard 
the Company’s interests to help mitigate against any impact 
resulting from any change of control of the Company should  
it occur.
28 Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial 
statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the 
directors have prepared the Group and parent Company 
ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European 
Union. Under company law the directors must not approve 
the ﬁnancial statements unless they are satisﬁed that they give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Group and 
the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of the Group for that 
period. In preparing these ﬁnancial statements, the directors are 
required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
• make judgements and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union have been followed, subject to any material departures 
disclosed and explained in the ﬁnancial statements; and
• prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufﬁcient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any 
time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and the Group and 
enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements and the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report comply with the Companies 
Act 2006 and, as regards the Group ﬁnancial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and 
hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and 
detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Each of the directors, whose names and functions are listed on 
pages 24 and 25, conﬁrm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group ﬁnancial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and 
fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt of 
the Group; and
• the Directors’ Report and divisional Operating Reviews found 
on pages 12 to 17 include a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that it faces.

Executive directors’ remuneration
Policy on executive directors’ remuneration
Our policy is to provide remuneration packages for executive 
directors and senior executives which:
• are sufﬁciently attractive to enable the Company to recruit 
and retain talented individuals with the necessary skills and 
expertise to support the development of Consort Medical and 
grow long-term value for our shareholders; and
• contain appropriate levels of performance related variable 
pay such that they are aligned with the long-term interests of 
our shareholders, motivated to execute the strategy agreed 
by the Board and to develop and grow the Company and 
shareholder value, whilst taking account of internal and 
external risks.
This report sets out the remuneration policy and underlying 
details for the directors of the Company for the year ended  
30 April 2012, including disclosure on directors’ remuneration 
required by law. It will be presented at the Company’s AGM 
for approval by our shareholders. The vote will be advisory 
and will be considered carefully by the Remuneration 
Committee in the formulation and approval of the Company’s 
future remuneration policies.

Remuneration Report 
for year ending 30 April 2012 
30 Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012  
To further promote alignment with the interests of our 
shareholders, executive directors are expected to build up  
and maintain a holding of Consort shares equal to at least  
one-times salary.
When assessing remuneration, the Committee takes care to 
ensure that individuals are not overpaid in relation to their roles 
and responsibilities, and that packages for senior individuals 
are appropriate in comparison to the remuneration of other 
employees within the Company.
Summary of the key components of the executive  
directors’ remuneration
The table below provides an overview of each element of the 
2011/12 remuneration for the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer (CEO), 
Chief Financial Ofﬁcer (CFO) and the Corporate Development 
Director (CDD). Further details can be found in the speciﬁc 
sections following.
This is achieved by:
• setting base pay within a market competitive range by 
reference to relevant comparator companies, and taking 
account of the experience and performance of the individual 
concerned. Where appropriate, it is the policy of the 
Committee to move base salaries to an upper quartile level 
where the incumbent has proven themselves to be of the 
highest calibre, along with demonstrable and sustained 
success in their role;
• operation of an annual bonus (with a longer-term deferred 
share element) where annual performance targets are closely 
tied to core ﬁnancial, operational and strategic performance 
measures linked to the Company’s longer-term strategy. The 
deferred share component of the annual bonus ensures that 
part of the value of payments earned remains tied to our 
share price for a three-year period, thus embedding longer-
term alignment with the interests of our shareholders within 
the annual bonus plan;
• offering participation in our Long-term Incentive Plan, which 
provides for awards of free shares to be earned over a three-
year period, based on meeting stretching shareholder value-
linked performance targets (currently based on relative total 
shareholder return measured against a comparator group  
of companies).

Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 31 Governance
Over the last three years, the Company has undergone 
transformational and successful change with a strong 
improvement not only in ﬁnancial performance but also a 
signiﬁcant increase in market capitalisation and the Committee 
is clear in its view that this is due in large part to the CEO’s 
leadership. The Committee therefore decided that it would be 
appropriate to position base salary for the CEO at the upper 
quartile level and taking this into account, the Committee 
concluded that an increase of 7.9% was appropriate.
The salaries of the CFO and CDD were increased by 2.3% and 
3.9% respectively.
Annual and Deferred Bonus
Overview
The Annual and Deferred Bonus motivates and rewards 
performance measured against a core ﬁnancial measure; 
Proﬁt Before Tax (“PBT”) performance, and is supplemented 
with further personal strategically important goals (both at 
a corporate and individual level) for the deferred element. 
The Committee considers that this combination of measures 
provides an appropriate balance of focus on ﬁnancial and wider 
business and strategic goals.
The strategic measures assigned to the deferred element are 
assessed each year and represent areas that are important for 
the long-term success of the Company including matters such 
as growth, and new value creation, and include an assessment 
of the individual’s personal contribution towards these goals.
The Committee considers that when taken together, the 
annual and deferred bonus strengthen the alignment between 
shareholders and executives, and encourages a longer-term 
focus on shareholder value, by requiring a three-year deferral  
of a proportion of the annual bonus into shares.
2011/12 Annual and Deferred Bonus
The table below shows the annual and deferred bonus 
opportunity for the executive directors for the year ended 
30 April 2012, and the required performance level against 
budgeted PBT.
In determining the actual percentage of deferred shares to be 
awarded, the Committee also made an assessment of individual 
performance against strategically important goals both at a 
corporate and personal level.
Base Salary
The annual salary of each executive director and senior 
executive is determined by the Remuneration Committee 
and is reviewed with effect from 1 August each year. As part 
of the August 2011 review, the Company considered market 
data for companies of a similar size and complexity to Consort 
from two external sources (Hewitt New Bridge Street and 
Deloitte LLP).
In making decisions regarding pay increases, the Committee 
considered the above data and also assessed individual 
performance within each role, prevailing market conditions, 
the Company’s performance and recent salary increases in the 
Company as a whole.
On appointment the base salary of the CEO was set at a low 
level relative to the then benchmark, given this was a new 
appointment to the role.

32 Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 if changes are made to the performance conditions applying 
to the 2012 and ongoing awards, full details will be provided in 
next year’s report.
Awards under the LTIP can either take the form of nil cost 
options, share settled Share Appreciation Rights
1
 or approved 
options (made under the HMRC approved Company Share 
Option Plan
2
). In recent years, only awards of nil cost options 
have been made, as the Company has granted approved 
options up to the value of £30,000 to executive directors.
2011/12 performance conditions
The performance conditions for awards granted during the 
year are based on Total Shareholder Return (TSR) over a three-
year timeframe (as noted above, measured from the date of 
award). Relative TSR was chosen as the performance condition 
which most appropriately reﬂects shareholder value creation.
The comparator group has been selected on the basis of the 
constituents of the FTSE Small Cap Index, excluding investment 
trusts, ﬁnance, property and insurance companies.
The vesting schedule for the 2011/12 LTIP awards is summarised 
as follows:.
Relative TSR performance Vesting schedule
Company TSR less than mean annualised  
comparator TSR
0%
Company TSR equal to mean annualised  
comparator TSR*
25%
Company TSR greater than lower of:
i) mean annualised comparator TSR +7%; and
ii) upper quartile annualised comparator TSR*
100%
* Straight-line vesting applies between these points.
2009 LTIP awards
In April 2012, the performance period for the 2009 LTIP  
awards ended although vesting is not due until October. The 
Committee determined that based on the Company’s relative 
TSR performance in the three years to 30 April 2012 (and in line 
with the plan rules), none of the LTIP shares awarded will vest 
despite a 70% increase in the share price over the period 1 May 
2009 to 30 April 2012.
Other current long-term incentives
Participation in the HM Revenue & Customs approved Share 
Incentive Plan and the UK Savings-Related Share Option 
Scheme (both available to all eligible UK employees) is made 
available to executive directors. Please see note 27 to the 
accounts for further details on these plans.
The operation of the 2002 Executive Share Option Scheme has 
been discontinued except in relation to options already granted 
at the time of discontinuance.

  Details of the Performance shares and SARs can be found in note 27 to 
the accounts.

  The LTIP operates in conjunction with an HMRC approved Company Share 
Option Plan to utilise capacity under the HMRC limits.
The Annual and Deferred Bonus policy for 2011/12 reﬂects a 
small change from earlier years, to align the amount of bonus 
payable (as a percentage of maximum) at various levels of 
performance for each executive director role. The result is a 
small increase in potential bonus payable as a percentage of 
maximum for the CEO for on target performance, but not any 
increase in maximum bonus opportunity.
In 2011/12 the strategic measures for executive directors 
included broadening the depth and range of the product 
portfolios including through innovation, and diversiﬁcation into 
adjacent markets while keeping tight controls on cost.
The Company performed very well against the targets set for 
the 2011/12 annual bonus, which reﬂected the Company’s focus 
on proﬁtability and diversiﬁcation. Reﬂecting this bonuses 
awarded to executive directors for the year 2011/12 were 
as follows:
£000
 
Role Total bonus Cash element
Deferred share element 
(Deferred until 
June 2015)
CEO £565 £372 £193 
CFO £197 £154 £43 
CDD £237 £160 £77 
Annual and Deferred Bonus for Financial Year 2012/13
The approach to Annual and Deferred Bonus for the ﬁnancial 
year ending 30 April 2013 will remain unchanged and the 
strategic measures for executive directors will continue to 
include broadening the depth and range of the product 
portfolios including through innovation and diversiﬁcation into 
adjacent markets while keeping tight controls on cost.
Long-term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
Overview and 2011/12 awards
The LTIP is designed to align the interests of senior executives 
with those of shareholders on a long-term basis. The maximum 
aggregate value of awards that may be granted to executive 
directors under the LTIP is one times salary, with awards 
vesting based on total shareholder return performance as 
described below.
During the year, a review of the LTIP was undertaken and it was 
decided that for awards from 2012 onwards, the measurement 
period used for TSR purposes would be changed such that it 
aligned with the date of the award, rather than the Company’s 
ﬁnancial year. The Committee believes that this approach 
will provide better alignment between LTIP awards and 
company performance.
The Committee also, as part of the review, considered 
the suitability of the current comparator group and the 
performance conditions more generally, to ensure that these 
remain appropriate for the current stage of the Company’s 
development. No decision has been taken yet in this regard but

Non-executive directors’ remuneration
Policy on non-executive directors’ remuneration
The Board is responsible for determining the policy on 
remuneration of non-executive directors. The Company aims to 
attract non-executive directors who, through their experience, 
can further the interests of the Company and make an effective 
contribution to its strategic development.
Terms of appointment of non-executive directors
The non-executive directors have appointment letters, the 
terms of which recognise that their appointments are subject to 
the Company’s Articles of Association and their service is at the 
discretion of the shareholders.
All non-executive directors submit themselves for election at 
the Annual General Meeting following their appointment and 
subsequently at intervals of no more than three years.
The table below shows the appointment dates and expiry dates 
of the non-executive directors of the Company:
Name

appointment Expiry of appointment
P. Fellner 14 November 2005 14 November 2014
J. Dick 11 April 2006 30 August 2012

S. Crummett 13 June 2012 12 June 2015
I. Nicholson 13 June 2012 12 June 2105
Non-executive directors’ fees
The fees for non-executive directors are reviewed on an 
annual basis and are determined by the Board after taking 
into account the level of responsibility, relevant experience and 
specialist knowledge of each non-executive director, as well as 
taking appropriate external advice.
The current fees structure for the non-executive directors 
(other than the Chairman) is shown below:
Role
With effect from 
1 September 2011
Basic fee £36,500
Supplements:
 – Senior Independent Director £7,500
 – Audit Committee Chairman £7,500
 – Remuneration Committee Chairman £7,500
 – Corporate Responsibility Chairman £5,000
The Board does not grant share-based incentives to non-
executive directors. It seeks to encourage non-executive 
directors to hold shares in the Company, in accordance with 
legal and regulatory requirements.
Travel and other reasonable expenses incurred in the course 
of performing their duties are reimbursed to non-executive 
directors.
Pension
The Company provides executive directors with a Group 
Personal Pension Plan, which includes the beneﬁt of a life 
assurance policy. To the extent that contributions would exceed 
the £50,000 Annual Allowance, a taxable cash supplement 
is provided.
The Company’s contribution/cash supplement for the  
executive directors (as a % of base salary) is shown below:
Company contribution/cash supplement
CEO 20%
CFO/CDD 17.5%
Policy on shareholdings
Executive directors are expected to accumulate a shareholding 
equivalent to one times annual salary over a ﬁve-year period, 
and to maintain this level of shareholding. Other senior 
executives are expected to accumulate a lower level of 
shareholding over a similar timeframe.
The Company’s various equity arrangements can provide  
a means to develop this shareholding.
Service contracts
The service contracts for the executive directors are 
summarised below:
Role Name Date of appointment
CEO J. Glenn 26 July 2006 
CFO T. Woolrych 24 June 2008
CDD N. Higgins 4 January 2010 
All executive directors have contracts terminable by the 
Company on one year’s notice and with earlier termination for 
cause. The policy of the Remuneration Committee is to treat 
each case on its merits, in accordance with applicable law.
In the event of early termination, other than for cause, the 
relevant executive director’s current salary and contractual 
beneﬁts (principally car allowance, pension and life assurance) 
will be taken into account in calculating the liability of the 
Company. Annual bonuses and long-term incentives are 
discretionary and dealt with in accordance with the rules  
of the applicable schemes.
There are no other provisions for compensation payable on 
early termination of the above contracts.
External appointments
With the speciﬁc approval of the Board in each case, executive 
directors may accept external appointments as non-executive 
directors of other companies. The directors are entitled to keep 
the fees from external appointments.
None of the executive directors holds any external 
appointments.

his appointment.
The Chief Executive
Jonathan Glenn is the Company’s Chief Executive. His principal 
responsibility is to manage the Group’s business and to lead the 
senior management team to ensure that the Company meets 
its objectives.
The Senior Independent Director
Dr William Jenkins was appointed the Senior Independent 
Director with effect from 1 September 2011 following the 
retirement of George Kennedy. The Senior Independent 
Director is responsible for chairing meetings of the non-
executive directors where the Chairman is not present and  
is available to meet with shareholders.
The non-executive directors
Independence
Each of the non-executive directors (Peter Fellner, Jim Dick, 
Chris Banks, Lynn Drummond and William Jenkins) are free 
from any relationship with the executive management of the 
Company and are free from any business or other relationship 
that could affect or appear to affect the exercise of their 
independent judgement. The Board considers that all of the 
Company’s non-executive directors are independent directors, 
in both character and judgement, in accordance with the 
recommendations of the Code.
The operation of the Board
Reserved matters and delegated authorities
The Board has the authority for ensuring that the Group is 
appropriately managed and achieves the strategic objectives it 
sets. To achieve this, the Board reserves certain matters for its 
own determination including matters relating to Group strategy, 
approval of interim and annual ﬁnancial results, dividend policy, 
major capital expenditure, treasury policy, risk management 
and the effectiveness of the systems of internal control. The full 
schedule of matters reserved to the Board was reviewed during 
2011 and is published on the Company’s website.
The Board performs its responsibilities through an annual 
programme of meetings, and by continuous monitoring of  
the performance of the Group as a whole. The Board also 
delegates the discharge of a number of its responsibilities  
to committees and management.
The various matters delegated by the Board to management 
include:
• maintaining systems that identify and evaluate signiﬁcant risks 
affecting strategies that apply to management’s areas of the 
business;
• identiﬁcation and evaluation of signiﬁcant risks to the 
business, together with the design of mitigating controls; and
• operating the internal control systems.
The UK Corporate Governance Code
The Group is committed to practising good corporate 
governance of its affairs as part of its management of 
relationships with its shareholders and other stakeholders. 
The Group seeks to uphold and to report on compliance in 
accordance with best practice in corporate governance.
Compliance Statement
The directors are satisﬁed that the Group has complied with 
the principles and provisions set out in the UK Corporate 
Governance Code (the Code) which was published in June 
2010 (available from www.frc.org) and was compliant 
throughout the ﬁnancial year under review with the exception 
that Dr Lynn Drummond was unable to attend the AGM due 
to a commitment made prior to her appointment to the Board. 
During the current ﬁnancial year, the Board will continue to 
assess its practices to ensure continued compliance with the 
Code and will monitor any changes required to be made to 
further develop and enhance its governance policies.
The principles of the Code cover ﬁve areas: leadership, 
effectiveness, accountability, remuneration and relations with 
shareholders. With the exception of the directors’ remuneration 
(which is dealt with separately under the Remuneration Report) 
the following sets out how the Board has applied the principles.
The Board is committed to establishing and maintaining high 
standards of corporate governance. Its policy is to appoint 
directors with appropriate skills who have sufﬁcient time 
to carry out their duties adequately. The Board provides 
opportunities through site visits and regular access to senior 
management to permit directors to familiarise themselves with 
the Company and the markets in which it operates.
Leadership
The role of the Board
The Board is responsible for the long-term success of the 
Company. Individual members of the Board have equal 
responsibility for the overall stewardship, management and 
performance of the Group and for the approval of its long-term 
objectives and strategic plans.
Division of responsibilities
There is a clear division of responsibilities between the role of 
the Chairman and that of the Chief Executive of the Company 
and the roles are clearly set out in writing and reviewed by the 
Board. The primary responsibility of the Chairman is to lead and 
manage the Board and to promote high standards of corporate 
governance, and that of the Chief Executive is to manage the 
business of the Group.
The Chairman
Peter Fellner was appointed non-executive Chairman of the 
Company with effect from 1 May 2009. The Chairman is 
responsible for leading and managing the Board and ensuring 
its effectiveness on all aspects of its role. He works closely 
with the Chief Executive on developing Group strategy, and 
provides general advice and support as well as participating in 
the dialogue between the Company and its major shareholders. 
Dr Fellner has attended all Board meetings held during the 
year and commits substantial time to fulﬁlling his role. His other 
signiﬁcant commitments are listed in his biography on page 24.

and conditions are summarised in the Remuneration Report on 
pages 30 to 36 and the terms and conditions of appointment 
of the non-executive directors are available at the Company’s 
Registered Ofﬁce.
Induction and professional development
Upon joining the Board, newly appointed directors receive 
a tailored induction comprising background information on 
the operation and activities of the Group, the role of the 
Board and its committees and those matters reserved for the 
Board’s decision, and the latest ﬁnancial information on the 
Group. They are also encouraged to visit the sites at which 
the Group operates and are invited to meetings with relevant 
members of senior management. Training and development 
needs of directors are reviewed regularly. The directors are 
kept appraised of developments in legal, regulatory and 
ﬁnancial matters affecting the Group from the Group Finance 
Director, the Company Secretary, the Group’s external auditors 
and advisers.
Information and support
Board members are provided with appropriate documentation 
in advance of each Board and committee meeting. Senior 
executives are invited to attend Board meetings periodically 
for the purpose of making presentations on their areas of 
responsibility. In addition to formal Board meetings, the 
Chairman and Chief Executive meet frequently and make 
regular contact with other Board members. The Board and the 
senior executives meet formally once during each ﬁnancial year 
to discuss corporate strategy.
Independent professional advice
The Board has approved a procedure whereby directors 
may consult the Company’s advisers and, if necessary, take 
independent professional advice at the Company’s expense, 
although not in respect of a director’s personal interests. 
Before seeking advice, the director concerned must notify the 
Chairman, or in his absence, the Senior Independent Director. 
No such advice was sought by any director during the year.
Company Secretary
Board members have access to the Company Secretary who 
attends all Board meetings. The appointment and removal of 
the Company Secretary is subject to the approval of the Board.
Performance evaluation
An evaluation of the Board is normally carried out each year.  
A Board evaluation was carried out during the year ended  
30 April 2012 following a rigorous and formal examination 
requiring completion of a questionnaire relating to the 
performance of the Board and its committees and with regard 
to compliance with the Code and Turnbull Guidance. The 
evaluation focused on the role of the directors and the Board; 
the non-executives directors; the executive directors; Board 
meetings; committees of the Board; monitoring performance; 
leadership and culture; and corporate governance. There was 
generally a positive response which indicates that the Board 
Board meetings and attendance
The Board has eight scheduled meetings per year, with other 
meetings convened for speciﬁc matters, some of which are 
delegated to committees, as appropriate. The attendance of 
each of the directors, whether in person or by telephone, at the 
scheduled Board and committee meetings where appropriate,

Effectiveness
The Board’s composition
As of 30 April 2012 the Board of the Company consisted of  
the non-executive Chairman, three executive directors and four 
non-executive directors. The proﬁles of the Board members 
are set out on pages 24 and 25. No individual or group of 
individuals dominates the Board’s decision-making process.  
The non-executive directors occupy, or have occupied, senior 
positions in industry. Together they constitute a valuable body 
of relevant industry experience and expertise.
Board diversity
The Board believes in the importance of diversity (including 
but not limited to gender) and the beneﬁts that it can bring 
to the operation of an effective Board. The Board decided not 
to set a target for the percentage of women it wishes to sit 
on the Board by 2013. Following the appointment of Dr Lynn 
Drummond in February 2011, female representation on the 
Board constitutes 12.5%. We will continue to focus on diversity 
(including gender) in our succession planning.
Appointment of non-executive directors
Non-executive directors are appointed to the Board following 
a formal, rigorous and transparent process, where appropriate 
involving external recruitment agencies, to select appropriate 
individuals who have a depth of relevant experience, thus 
ensuring that the selected candidates will be capable of making 
a considerable contribution to the Board. This process is 
monitored by the Nomination Committee.
Terms of appointment and time commitment
All non-executive directors are appointed for an initial term of 
three years subject to satisfactory performance. After this time 
they may serve additional three-year terms following review by 
Corporate Governance continued
38 Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 The Committee ensures that the search for Board members is 
undertaken against objective criteria and with due regard to the 
beneﬁts of diversity including gender. Appointments are made 
on merit taking into account the importance of maintaining a 
balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge.
Following the decision of Toby Woolrych to leave the company 
with effect from 29 June 2012 and indication from Chris Banks 
and Jim Dick of their intention to resign from the Board at the 
conclusion of the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, the 
Committee appointed a professional search agency to identify 
their replacements with a view to seeking candidates with 
relevant ﬁnancial and business expertise. Richard Cotton has 
been appointed Group Finance Director with effect from 25 
June 2012. Steve Crummett and Ian Nicholson join the Board 
as non-executive directors with effect from 13 June 2012. Ian 
Nicholson brings with him CEO experience and Steve Crummett 
ﬁnancial expertise which will further diversify the Board’s 
composition. Their biographies are below:
Richard Cotton is a chartered management accountant. From 
2008 to 2011 he was Group Finance Director of Vitec Group plc, 
from 2005 to 2008 he was Group Finance Director at Wagon 
plc and from 2001 to 2005 Group Finance Director of McLeod 
Russell plc.
Steve Crummett has been Finance Director of Filtrona plc, a 
FTSE 250 company, since 2008, having joined in 2007. Filtrona 
is a supplier of specialty plastics and ﬁbre products. From 2003 
to 2006, Steve was Group Director, Mergers & Acquisitions, of 
the FTSE 100 company Exel plc. Steve qualiﬁed as a Chartered 
Accountant with Arthur Anderson. He will Chair the Audit 
Committee, following the retirement of Chris Banks, and join 
the Nomination Committee.
Ian Nicholson has been Chief Executive of Chroma 
Therapeutics Limited, a drug discovery and development 
company, since 2004. He is Chairman of Bioventure Ltd, 
a diagnostics company, and a non-executive director of 
Symphogen A/S, an antibody therapeutics company. From 
2000 to 2004, Ian was Senior Vice President, Business 
Development, at Celltech Group plc, then the UK’s largest 
biotechnology company. He has extensive experience in 
licensing, mergers and acquisitions, and market development 
in the UK, Europe and the US. He will join the Nomination 
Committee.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee is comprised entirely of independent 
non-executive directors. Members during the year have been 
Chris Banks (Chairman), Jim Dick, George Kennedy (until his 
retirement) and Lynn Drummond, who joined the Committee 
on 1 September 2011. Chris Banks is the individual who the 
Board considers has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience 
and is a chartered accountant.
The external auditors’ lead partner and the Group Finance 
Director attend each meeting as requested by the Committee. 
The Board considers that the membership of the Committee as 
a whole has recent and relevant ﬁnancial experience properly 
to discharge its functions.
and its committees are operating in an effective manner and 
that the Board provided the effective leadership and control 
required for a listed company. The Board will continue to review 
its effectiveness in the year ahead.
Election and re-election of directors
The Company’s Articles of Association require all directors to 
retire and submit themselves for re-election at the ﬁrst AGM 
after appointment and thereafter at least every three years. 
The Notice of Annual General Meeting will give details of those 
directors seeking re-election.
Meetings of non-executive directors
Led by the Senior Independent Director, the non-executive 
directors meet informally, without the Chairman being present, 
principally to appraise the Chairman’s performance and to 
review his remuneration. The Chairman holds meetings at least 
annually with the non-executive directors without the executive 
directors present.
Board committees
The Board has the three main committees listed below. The 
current terms of reference of each committee may be obtained 
from the Company’s website.
Remuneration Committee
During the year members of this committee were George 
Kennedy (Chairman) until his retirement on 1 September 2011, 
Lynn Drummond who succeeded Mr Kennedy as Chairman, 
Jim Dick, and William Jenkins. The Chairman is invited to attend 
all meetings, but does not attend any part of any meeting 
at which his own service contract is discussed. The Chief 
Executive attends by invitation where appropriate except where 
his own remuneration is being considered.
The Remuneration Committee is primarily responsible for 
determining the structure, components including pension rights 
and compensation payments and level of the remuneration 
packages of the Chairman, the executive directors and 
designated members of the senior management team. Details 
of the role of the Remuneration Committee and attendance 
of Committee members are set out on page 38. The 
Remuneration Committee met ﬁve times during this year.
Nomination Committee
Members during the year were Peter Fellner (Chairman), Chris 
Banks, Jim Dick, Jonathan Glenn, George Kennedy (until his 
retirement on 1 September 2011), William Jenkins and Lynn 
Drummond following her appointment on 9 February 2011.
The Nomination Committee met twice during the year. Details 
of attendance of Committee members are set out on page 38.
The Nomination Committee is primarily responsible for 
reviewing the membership of the Board and identifying 
suitable candidates for appointment and re-appointment as 
directors. In addition, the Board has delegated responsibility 
to the Nomination Committee for succession planning both at 
Board and senior management level. The inclusion of the Chief 
Executive in the membership of the Nomination Committee 
ensures that a balanced view is taken regarding the needs of 
the Group as a whole.
Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 39 Governance
Internal audit
The Committee has considered whether there is a need for 
an internal audit function within the Group and has concluded 
that no internal audit function is immediately required. In 
reaching its conclusion, the Committee considered the size 
and structure of the Group and its ﬁnance function as well as 
the procedures, controls and mechanisms designed to monitor 
and control risk within the Group. The Committee also took 
into account the fact that the business operates within a highly 
regulated industry.
Whistle-blowing
The Audit Committee has reviewed and approved the internal 
procedures whereby employees can raise concerns about 
possible ﬁnancial or other irregularities. The policy gives 
guidance on the type of matters that staff may wish to disclose, 
and a means of doing so via an independent organisation in the 
event that any staff member feels that he or she cannot make a 
disclosure via the usual management channels.
The Company is committed to the highest standards of 
openness, integrity and accountability and the prevention 
of bribery and corruption. The Group operates a whistle-
blowing policy so that employees can report conﬁdentially 
any matter giving rise to concerns about the operation of the 
Group’s business.
Other Committees
The Executive Committee
This Committee is responsible for the executive management 
of the Group. It comprises the Chief Executive, the Group 
Finance Director, the Company Secretary/General Counsel, 
the managing directors of the Group’s businesses, the Director 
of Human Resources, the Group Director of Operations and 
the Corporate Development Director. This Committee meets 
monthly to review and make decisions on operational matters 
not reserved for Board decisions.
The Corporate Responsibility Committee
The Corporate Responsibility Committee is responsible for 
reviewing and prioritising the Group’s Corporate Responsibility 
activities, further details of which can be found in the Corporate 
Responsibility Review on pages 18 and 19 of this report. The 
Committee is chaired by non-executive director Jim Dick. Other 
members include the Chief Executive Ofﬁcer, the managing 
directors of Bespak and King Systems and the HR Director. The 
Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
Internal controls review
The Board acknowledges that it is responsible for the Group’s 
system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. 
Such a system is designed to manage rather than eliminate 
the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can only 
provide reasonable, but not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Board has received regular reports 
on areas of any signiﬁcant risk and on related internal controls. 
The Board reviews the framework of internal controls annually 
and has reviewed the effectiveness of its internal systems 
of control as they have been operated within the year in 
accordance with the Turnbull Guidance (2005). This system has 
been in place for the year under review and up to the date  
of approval of the annual report and accounts.
The Audit Committee met three times during the year. The 
meetings were attended by all members. At each meeting the 
members of the Committee took the opportunity of meeting 
the external auditors without management being present.
The Audit Committee is responsible for reviewing on behalf of 
the Board the Group’s ﬁnancial and reporting practices and 
disclosures, reviewing the integrity of the ﬁnancial statements, 
the Group’s system of internal controls, the work of the external 
auditors and Group compliance with ﬁnancial policies, laws 
and regulations. Audit Committee Terms of Reference may be 
obtained from the Company’s website.
The annual and half-yearly ﬁnancial reports are reviewed by 
the Committee through a process which includes discussion 
with the Group Finance Director and the external auditors. 
The external auditors prepare reports to the Committee on 
signiﬁcant accounting policies and issues and judgements 
applied in the preparation of the ﬁnancial reports. The 
Audit Committee gives its recommendation to the Board 
concerning the adoption and publication of all ﬁnancial reports 
to shareholders.
In addition to the Board, the Audit Committee has conducted 
its annual review of the system of internal controls based on a 
review of signiﬁcant risks identiﬁed, internal reviews, external 
audits and reports from management.
Non-audit services
In accordance with its policy on non-audit services provided 
by the Company’s auditors, the Committee reviews and 
approves the award of any such work. The Audit Committee 
refers to the Board for approval of any work comprising non-
audit services where the fees for such work will represent a 
signiﬁcant proportion of the annual audit fee.
During the year PwC have provided tax advice in relation 
to secondments and due diligence support for corporate 
development opportunities. Ernst & Young have handled the 
Group’s tax compliance programme and audited the deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension scheme. Deloitte have provided remuneration 
advice and valuation service in respect of Long-term Incentive 
Plan grants and performed a review of pricing strategy and 
review controls at King Systems.
Auditors’ independence
The Audit Committee keeps under review the scope and results 
of the external audit work, its cost and the independence and 
objectivity of the auditors. The independent auditors operate 
procedures to safeguard against the possibility that their 
objectivity and independence could be compromised. This 
includes the use of quality review partners, a technical review 
board (where appropriate) and annual independence review 
procedures. The auditors are required to rotate the lead audit 
partner to the Group every ﬁve years. The Committee has 
considered the re-appointment of the auditors of the Group 
and recommended to the Board that PricewaterhouseCoopers 
LLP be proposed for re-appointment, having noted the scope 
and results of their work in relation to this year’s audit as well 
as their objectivity and independence. The Board endorsed 
this recommendation.
Corporate Governance continued
40 Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 The Group has clear authority limits deriving from the list of 
matters reserved for decision by the Board, including capital 
expenditure approval procedures.
Financial reporting
The directors’ responsibility for preparing the accounts is set 
out in the Directors’ Report on page 29.
Going concern
The directors have a reasonable expectation that the Group 
and the parent company have adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future and have 
therefore adopted the going concern basis in preparing  
the accounts.
Remuneration
Our Remuneration report, which describes the level and 
components of the remuneration of the directors, is set out on 
pages 30 to 36.
Relations with shareholders
The Board regards relationships with shareholders as very 
important and it aims to encourage open dialogue with 
them through regular meetings with the Group’s institutional 
shareholders, including regular meetings following the 
announcement of the Company’s interim and annual results. In 
particular, shareholders may meet with any new non-executive 
director if they wish. Meetings are also held at other times with 
institutional investors and other shareholders at their request. 
The Chairman ensures that views expressed at these meetings 
are reported to the Board as a whole. The Company’s brokers 
also attend Board meetings at the request of the Chairman to 
provide feedback on shareholder opinion.
The Senior Independent Director is available to meet with 
shareholders as required.
The Annual General Meeting
All shareholders have the opportunity of discussing the Group’s 
performance and development at the Annual General Meeting, 
which provides a forum for shareholders to raise issues with the 
Board. Members of the Remuneration, Nomination, Audit and 
Corporate Responsibility Committees will also be available at 
the Annual General Meeting so that shareholders may discuss 
any queries they may have.
Our previous AGM was held in Hemel Hempstead on  
1 September 2011 and the full voting results on each of the 
resolutions are published on our website. Our 2012 AGM will  
be held on 30 August 2012 at the Company’s registered ofﬁce 
in Hemel Hempstead.
The review covers all material controls including ﬁnancial and 
ﬁnancial reporting processes, operational, compliance and risk 
management systems.
Controls over the ﬁnancial reporting process and preparation 
of the consolidated accounts consist of extensive reviews 
by qualiﬁed and experienced individuals that ensure that all 
elements of the ﬁnancial statements and appropriate disclosure 
are considered and accurately stated.
Risk management
The Board accepts responsibility for determining the nature 
and extent of the signiﬁcant risks it is willing to take in achieving 
its strategic objectives.
There is an ongoing internal process for identifying, evaluating 
and managing signiﬁcant risks faced by the Company that 
is regularly reviewed ﬁrst by the Executive Committee and 
then by the Board. This process has been in place throughout 
the year and up to the date of this report. During the year 
this process has been enhanced by the establishment of a 
Risk Committee chaired by the Group Finance Director. Its 
members include the Company Secretary/General Counsel; 
the Senior Legal Adviser; the Assistant Company Secretary; 
the Group Financial Controller; the Group Assurance Manager 
and the managing directors and ﬁnance directors of the 
Group’s businesses.
The Risk Committee is responsible for advising the Executive 
Committee on the co-ordination and prioritisation of risk 
management issues throughout the Group and developing 
risk management strategy; ensuring that the Board’s risk 
policy is implemented throughout the Group through effective 
development and review of risk registers, mitigation plans and 
insurance policies and promote risk awareness at all levels.
A risk management strategy encompassing risk assessment 
and risk treatment has been adopted with the key objective to 
ensure that risk management is an integral part of the strategic 
and operational management decision making, planning and 
implementation process. Risk appetite and tolerance has been 
reviewed and agreed by the Board and will be considered 
annually and monitored as appropriate.
The Company’s strategic plan is reviewed annually at an off-site 
meeting involving the Board and the Executive Committee. An 
annual budget is prepared by each of the operating divisions of 
the Company and this is consolidated into a Group Plan, which 
is reviewed and approved by the Board.
Further information on how we manage our business risks is set 
out in the Risk section on pages 22 and 23, which contains a list 
of the principal risks and uncertainties.
Control procedures
Progress against budget is monitored at operating business 
and Group levels throughout the Company via monthly 
reporting of actual ﬁnancial performance against budget and 
prior period actual results. The Executive Committee also 
reviews monthly the key measures of operating performance.

Notes to the Accounts
General information
Consort Medical plc is a public limited company listed on the 
London Stock Exchange and is incorporated and domiciled 
under the laws of England and Wales, registered number 406711. 
The address of the registered ofﬁce is given on page 95. The nature 
of the Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out 
in note 2 and in the operating review on pages 12 to 23.
1. Presentation of the ﬁnancial statements and 
accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation 
and International Accounting Standards and International Financial 
Reporting Standards (collectively referred to as IFRS) and related 
interpretations, as adopted for use in the European Union in 
all cases.
Accounting convention
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared using the historical 
cost convention, as modiﬁed by certain ﬁnancial assets and 
ﬁnancial liabilities (including derivative instruments) at fair value. The 
speciﬁc accounting policies adopted, which have been approved 
by the Board and which have been applied consistently in all years 
presented,  are described within this note.
Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the ﬁnancial statements, 
a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
Consolidation
The ﬁnancial statements include the ﬁnancial statements of the 
Company and all the subsidiaries during the years reported for the 
periods during which they were members of the Consort Medical 
plc group (“the Group”). 
Segmental reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with the 
internal reporting provided to the chief operating decision maker.  
The chief operating decision maker, who is responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance of the operating segments, has been 
identiﬁed as the executive committee that makes strategic decisions.
Subsidiaries 
The consolidated ﬁnancial statements combine the ﬁnancial 
statements of the parent company and all its subsidiaries made 
up to 30 April 2012. Subsidiaries are entities which are directly 
or indirectly controlled by the Group. Control exists where the 
Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies 
of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁts from its activities, generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than one half of the 
voting rights.
The acquisition method of accounting is used to account for the 
acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The cost of an acquisition 
is measured as the fair value of the assets given, equity instruments 
issued and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of completion. 
Identiﬁable assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities 
assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their fair 
values at the acquisition date, irrespective of the extent of any non-
controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the 
fair value of the Group’s share of the identiﬁable net assets acquired 
is recorded as goodwill. If the cost of acquisition is less than the 
fair value of the net assets of the subsidiary acquired, the difference 
is recognised directly in the income statement. From 1 May 2010 
the costs of acquisition are charged to the income statement in the 
period in which they are incurred. 
Inter-company transactions, balances and unrealised gains on 
transactions between Group undertakings are eliminated. Unrealised 
losses are also eliminated but considered an impairment indicator 
of the asset transferred. Uniform accounting policies have been 
adopted across the Group.
In the parent company ﬁnancial statements, investments 
in subsidiaries are accounted for at cost less provision for 
any impairment.
Investments
Equity investments in entities that are neither associates nor 
subsidiaries are held at cost, less any provision for impairment.
 
Foreign currencies
Items included in the ﬁnancial statements of each of Consort 
Medical plc’s entities are measured using that entity’s functional 
currency, which is the currency of the primary economic environment 
in which the entity operates. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements 
are presented in sterling, which is the parent company’s functional 
and presentational currency.
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the 
settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period-
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated 
in foreign currencies are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash ﬂow 
hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
 
The results and ﬁnancial position of all Group undertakings that 
have a functional currency different from the presentational currency 
are translated into the presentational currency with (i) assets and 
liabilities for each balance sheet translated at the closing rate at the 
date of that balance sheet; (ii) income and expenses for each income 
statement translated at average exchange rates for the period; and 
(iii) all resulting exchange differences recognised as a component of 
other comprehensive income.
Exchange differences arising from the translation of the net 
investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other currency 
instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are 
recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of 
a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the foreign 
entity and translated at the closing rate.
The average GBP:USD exchange rate for the ﬁnancial year used in 
the preparation of these ﬁnancial statements was 1.59 (2011: 1.56). 
The closing exchange rate was 1.62 (2011: 1.67). Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 51

accounting policies continued
Revenue
Revenue from sales of products is recognised when the risk and 
rewards of ownership pass to the customer, and is stated net of 
value added tax and other sales taxes. The point at which risk and 
reward is transferred is usually determined from shipping terms, 
which vary from customer to customer. Revenue from sales of 
services is recognised in the period in which the related chargeable 
costs are incurred or when revenue is earned under contractual 
obligations. Revenue from sales of tooling and equipment is 
recognised on acceptance by the customer. Revenue is recognised 
when it is probable that economic beneﬁts associated with the 
transaction will ﬂow to the Group.
Advance payments received from customers are credited to deferred 
income and the related revenue is released to the income statement 
in accordance with the recognition criteria described above.
Post-employment beneﬁts
Group companies operate various pension schemes. The schemes 
are generally funded through payments to insurance companies 
or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial 
calculations. The group has both deﬁned beneﬁt and deﬁned 
contribution plans. A deﬁned contribution plan is a pension plan 
under which the group pays ﬁxed contributions into a separate 
entity. The group has no legal or constructive obligations to pay 
further contributions if the fund does not hold sufﬁcient assets to 
pay all employees the beneﬁts relating to employee service in the 
current and prior periods. A deﬁned beneﬁt plan is a pension plan 
that is not a deﬁned contribution plan. Typically deﬁned beneﬁt
plans deﬁne an amount of pension beneﬁt that an employee will 
receive on retirement, usually dependent on one or more factors 
such as age, years of service and compensation.
The liability recognised in the balance sheet in respect of deﬁned 
beneﬁt pension plans is the present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt 
obligation at the end of the reporting period less the fair value of 
plan assets, together with adjustments for unrecognised past-
service costs. The deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is calculated annually 
by independent actuaries using the projected unit credit method. 
The present value of the deﬁned beneﬁt obligation is determined 
by discounting the estimated future cash outﬂows using interest 
rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the 
currency in which the beneﬁts will be paid, and that have terms to 
maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and 
changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity 
in other comprehensive income in the period in which they arise.
Past-service costs are recognised immediately in income, unless 
the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees 
remaining in service for a speciﬁed period of time (the vesting 
period). In this case, the past-service costs are amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the vesting period.
For deﬁned contribution plans, the group pays contributions to 
publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a 
mandatory, contractual or voluntary basis. The group has no further 
payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The 
contributions are recognised as employee beneﬁt expense when 
they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to 
the extent that a cash refund or a reduction in the future payments 
is available.
Share-based payments
The group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans, under which the entity receives services from 
employees as consideration for equity instruments (options) of the 
group. The fair value of the employee services received in exchange 
for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total 
amount to be expensed is determined by reference to the fair value 
of the options granted:
•  including any market performance conditions (for example, 
an entity’s share price);
•  excluding the impact of any service and non-market performance 
vesting conditions (for example, proﬁtability, sales growth targets 
and remaining an employee of the entity over a speciﬁed time 
period); and
•  including the impact of any non-vesting conditions (for example, 
the requirement for employees to save).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about 
the number of options that are expected to vest. The total expense 
is recognised over the vesting period, which is the period over which 
all of the speciﬁed vesting conditions are to be satisﬁed. At the 
end of each reporting period, the entity revises its estimates of the 
number of options that are expected to vest based on the  
non-market vesting conditions. It recognises the impact of the 
revision to original estimates, if any, in the income statement, 
with a corresponding adjustment to equity.
When the options are exercised, the Company may issue new 
shares. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs are credited to share capital (nominal value) 
and share premium when the options are exercised.
The grant by the Company of options over its equity instruments to 
the employees of subsidiary undertakings in the group is treated as 
a capital contribution. The fair value of employee services received, 
measured by reference to the grant date fair value, is recognised 
over the vesting period as an increase to investment in subsidiary 
undertakings, with a corresponding credit to equity. Financial statements

1. Presentation of the ﬁnancial statements and  
accounting policies continued
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost including any 
incidental costs of acquisition less accumulated depreciation. 
Cost includes the original purchase price of the asset and the 
costs attributable to bringing the asset to its working condition for 
its intended use. Depreciation is recognised so as to write-off the 
cost of property, plant and equipment (less the current expected 
residual value) on a straight-line basis over their expected useful lives 
as follows:
–  Freehold buildings and leasehold 
buildings over 50 years 50 years
– Leasehold buildings less than 50 years Remaining period 
  of lease
– Cleanrooms 20 years
– Building services 10 to 20 years
– Plant, equipment and vehicles 3 to 10 years
Cleanrooms and building services are categorised within plant 
and equipment. Land is not depreciated.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing 
the proceeds with the carrying amount and are recognised 
in the income statement.
Assets under construction
The costs of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as 
incurred and are not depreciated until such time as the assets 
are commissioned, when the total costs are transferred to the 
appropriate asset category.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset 
at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is 
measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, 
the amount of any non-controlling interest in the acquiree and the 
fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest (if any) in the 
entity over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identiﬁable 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least 
annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated 
to each of the Group’s cash-generating units expected to beneﬁt 
from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units 
to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit 
may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-generating 
unit is less than the carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated 
ﬁrst to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to the 
unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis 
of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment loss 
recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
Internally-generated intangible assets – research and 
development expenditure
Expenditure on research activities is recognised as an expense in 
the period in which it is incurred. 
An internally-generated intangible asset arising from the Group’s 
product development is recognised only if all of the following 
conditions are met:
– An asset is created that can be identiﬁed;
–  It is probable that the asset created will generate future economic 
beneﬁts; 
–  It is technically feasible that the intangible asset can be completed 
so that it will be available for use or sale and there are sufﬁcient 
available resources to complete it; and
– The development cost of the asset can be measured reliably.
Where a product requires regulatory approval prior to launch, it is presumed 
that there is insufﬁcient certainty over the product’s technical feasibility 
to recognise an intangible asset prior to that approval being obtained.
Internally-generated intangible assets are amortised on a straight-line 
basis over their useful lives. The estimated useful economic life of 
capitalised development costs is 5 to 10 years. Where no internally-
generated intangible asset can be recognised, development 
expenditure is recognised as an expense in the period in which it is 
incurred.
Other intangible ﬁxed assets
Other intangible ﬁxed assets, including purchased patents,  
know-how, trademarks, software licences, customer contracts 
and relationships and distribution rights are capitalised at cost 
and amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful 
economic lives. The estimated useful life of other intangible 
assets are as follows: Computer software: 4 years
Patented and unpatented technology and know-how: 10 years
Trademarks and trade names: 10 years
Customer contracts and relationships: 5 years
Licences and distribution agreements: 2 – 11 years
Impairment of property, plant and equipment and intangible 
assets excluding goodwill
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment, and intangible 
assets excluding goodwill are reviewed for impairment when events 
or changes in circumstance indicate that the carrying value may 
not be recoverable. If any such indication exists, the recoverable 
amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine the extent of 
impairment loss. Where it is not possible to identify separate cash 
ﬂows relating to individual assets, Consort Medical plc estimates the 
recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which it belongs.
Leasing commitments
Leases in which a signiﬁcant portion of the risks and rewards 
of ownership are retained by the lessor are classiﬁed as operating 
leases. Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to 
income on a straight-line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
Leasing agreements which transfer to the Group substantially all 
the beneﬁts and risks of ownership of an asset are treated as ﬁnance 
leases, as if the asset had been purchased outright. Assets held under 
ﬁnance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair 
value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease payments, 
each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding 
liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁnance 
lease obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁnance 
expenses and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a 
constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.  Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 53
1. Presentation of the ﬁnancial statements  
and accounting policies continued
Inventories
Inventories and work in progress are stated at the lower of 
cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises the direct cost of 
production and the attributable portion of overheads based on 
normal operating capacity appropriate to location and condition. 
Cost is determined on a ﬁrst in, ﬁrst out basis. Net realisable value 
represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of 
completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and 
distribution. Provision is made if necessary for any slow moving, 
obsolete or defective stock. 
Cash and cash equivalents 
In the consolidated and company cash ﬂow statements, cash 
and cash equivalents includes cash in hand, deposits held at call 
with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original 
maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts. In the 
consolidated and company balance sheets, bank overdrafts are 
shown within borrowings in current liabilities.
Finance income and costs
Interest receivable and payable on bank deposits and borrowings is 
credited or charged to ﬁnance income and expenses as it falls due. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation 
(legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable 
that an outﬂow of resources embodying economic beneﬁts will be 
required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made 
of the amount of the obligation. Where the Group expects some or 
all of a provision to be reimbursed, for example under an insurance 
contract, the reimbursement is recognised as a separate asset, 
but only when the reimbursement is virtually certain. The expense 
relating to any provision is presented in the income statement net 
of any reimbursement. If the effect of the time value of money is 
material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected 
future cash ﬂows at a pre-tax rate that reﬂects current market 
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the 
risks speciﬁc to the liability. Where discounting is used, the increase 
in the provision due to the passage of time is recognised as other 
ﬁnance expenses.
A contingent liability is disclosed where the existence of an obligation 
will only be conﬁrmed by future events or where the amount of the 
obligation cannot be measured with reasonable reliability. Contingent 
assets are not recognised, but are disclosed where an inﬂow of 
economic beneﬁts is probable.
Trade receivables
Trade receivables are recognised initially at fair value and 
subsequently held at amortised cost. A provision for impairment of 
trade receivables is established when there is objective evidence that 
the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to 
the original terms of the receivables. 
Trade payables
Trade payables are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently 
held at amortised cost.
Borrowings and borrowing costs
Interest-bearing bank loans and overdrafts are recorded at fair value, 
net of direct issue costs. Finance charges, including premiums 
payable on settlement or redemption and direct issue costs, are 
accounted for on an accruals basis to the proﬁt and loss account 
and are added to the carrying amount of the instrument to the extent 
that they are not settled in the period in which they arise. 
Fees paid on the establishment of loan facilities are recognised as 
transaction costs of the loan to the extent that it is probable that 
some or all of the facility will be drawn down. In this case, the fee is 
deferred until draw-down occurs. To the extent there is no evidence 
that it is probable that some or all of the facility will be drawn down, 
the fee is capitalised as a prepayment for liquidity services and 
amortised over the period of the facility to which it relates.
Dividends
Dividends are recorded in the ﬁnancial statements in the period in which 
they are approved by the Company’ s shareholders. Interim dividends 
are recorded in the period in which they are approved and paid.
Taxation
The charge for current taxation is based on the results for the year 
as adjusted for items that are non-assessable or disallowed. It is 
calculated using rates that have been enacted, or substantially 
enacted, by the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation is accounted for in full using the balance sheet 
liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from 
differences between the carrying amount of assets and liabilities in 
the ﬁnancial statements and the corresponding tax bases used in 
the computation of taxable proﬁt.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences except in respect of investments in subsidiaries where 
Consort Medical plc is able to control the reversal of the temporary 
difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will not 
reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable proﬁt will be available against which the temporary 
difference can be utilised. Their carrying amount is reviewed at each 
balance sheet date on the same basis.
Deferred tax is measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply 
in the periods in which the asset or liability is settled. It is recognised 
in the consolidated income statement except when it relates to items 
credited or charged directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax 
is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred income tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a 
legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current 
tax liabilities and when the deferred income taxes assets and 
liabilities relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority 
on either the taxable entity or different taxable entities where there is 
an intention to settle the balances on a net basis. Financial statements

and accounting policies continued
Share capital, share premium and share issue costs
Share issue costs are incremental costs directly attributable to the 
issue of new shares or options or the acquisition of a business 
and are shown as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds. Any 
excess of the net proceeds over the nominal value of any shares 
issued is credited to the share premium account.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments and hedging
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are used to manage exposure to 
market risks from treasury operations. The principal derivative 
instruments used by the Group are interest rate swaps and forward 
foreign exchange contracts. The Group does not hold or issue 
derivative ﬁnancial instruments for trading or speculative purposes.
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments are initially recognised in the balance 
sheet at cost and then re-measured at subsequent reporting dates 
to fair value. Hedging derivatives are classiﬁed on inception as fair 
value hedges, cash ﬂow hedges or net investment hedges. 
Changes in the fair value of derivatives designated as cash ﬂow 
hedges are recognised in equity. Amounts deferred in equity are 
transferred to the income statement in line with the hedged forecast 
transaction.
Amounts accumulated in equity are reclassiﬁed to the income 
statement in the periods when the hedged item affects proﬁt or 
loss (for example, when the forecast sale that is hedged takes 
place). The gain or loss relating to the effective portion of interest 
rate swaps hedging variable rate borrowings is recognised in the 
income statement within ‘revenue’. However, when the forecast 
transaction that is hedged results in the recognition of a non-ﬁnancial 
asset (for example, inventory or ﬁxed assets), the gains and losses 
previously deferred in equity are transferred from equity and included 
in the initial measurement of the cost of the asset. The deferred 
amounts are ultimately recognised in cost of goods sold in the case 
of inventory or in depreciation in the case of ﬁxed assets. When a 
hedging instrument expires or is sold, or when a hedge no longer 
meets the criteria for hedge accounting, any cumulative gain or loss 
existing in equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised 
when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income 
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected to 
occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity is 
immediately transferred to the income statement.
Hedges of net investments in foreign entities are accounted for as 
cash ﬂow hedges.
Changes in the fair value of any derivative instruments that do not 
qualify for hedge accounting are recognised immediately in the 
income statement.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
In the application of the Group’s accounting policies, which 
are described in this note, the directors are required to make 
judgements, estimates and assumptions about the carrying amounts 
of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent from other 
sources. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on 
historical experience and other factors that are considered to be 
relevant. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an 
ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in 
the period in which the estimate is revised if the revision affects only 
that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the 
revision affects both current and future periods.
Judgements
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving 
estimations (which are dealt with separately below), that the directors 
have made in the process of applying the Group’s accounting 
policies and that have the most signiﬁcant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the ﬁnancial statements.
A Going concern
The directors have, at the time of approving the ﬁnancial statements, 
a reasonable expectation that the Company and the Group have 
adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the 
foreseeable future. Thus they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis of accounting in preparing the ﬁnancial statements.
B Development costs
In assessing whether development costs meet the recognition 
criteria for internally-generated intangible assets, which are 
described elsewhere in this note, the directors make certain critical 
judgements as to the technical feasibility and commercial viability 
of the related product, and around the likelihood of obtaining 
regulatory approval. 
C Income taxes
The Group is subject to income taxes in various jurisdictions. 
Signiﬁcant judgement is required in determining the Group provision 
for income taxes. There are many transactions and calculations for 
which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain during the ordinary 
course of business. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated 
tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will 
be due. Where the ﬁnal tax outcome of these matters is different 
from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will 
impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in 
which such determination is made.
D Provisions and related assets
In determining whether to recognise a provision in respect of a 
potential liability, management assesses the likelihood of the liability 
being payable. This assessment includes a review of the speciﬁc 
facts by suitably qualiﬁed and experienced Group personnel, 
experience of similar matters and communications with potential 
counterparties and the Group’s legal advisers. Where the matter 
leading to a provision may be covered by the Group’s insurance 
policies, management consults with the Group’s insurers, loss 
adjustors and legal advisers to determine whether the success 
of any insurance claim is “virtually certain”, which is the threshold 
used by the Group in the recognition of any insurance asset.
Estimates
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources 
of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date, that have a 
signiﬁcant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying 
amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁnancial year are 
discussed below.
Notes to the Accounts
continued Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 55
1. Presentation of the ﬁnancial statements  
and accounting policies continued
A Impairment of goodwill
The Group tests, at least annually, whether goodwill has suffered 
any impairment in accordance with the accounting policy above. 
The recoverable amount is determined based on value in use 
calculations. The use of this method requires the estimation of future 
cash ﬂows and the choice of a suitable discount rate in order to 
calculate the present value of these cash ﬂows. Actual outcomes 
could vary. The value in use of The Medical House cash generating 
unit, which is part of the Bespak segment, is dependent upon the 
successful launch of injectable products by the Group’s customers. 
Whilst management’s view, based on the facts at the date of signing 
these ﬁnancial statements, is that these products will be launched 
successfully within a reasonable timescale, the product launches 
are largely outside of the Group’s control and subject to approval 
by regulatory bodies, and so there remains a risk that future cash 
inﬂows will be less than forecast in the value in use calculations.
B Post-employment beneﬁts 
The determination of the pension cost and deﬁned beneﬁt obligation 
of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt pension schemes depends on the 
selection of certain assumptions which include the discount rate, 
inﬂation rate, salary growth, mortality and expected return on 
scheme assets. Differences arising from actual experiences or future 
changes in assumptions will be reﬂected in subsequent periods. See 
note 21 for further details.
C Impairment of property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment are reviewed for impairment if events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may 
not be recoverable. When a review for impairment is conducted, the 
recoverable amount is determined based on value in use calculations 
prepared on the basis of management’s assumptions and estimates.
D Provisions and related assets
In determining the amount to recognise for any provision or related 
asset, management consults with suitably qualiﬁed and experienced 
Group personnel, considers the Group’s experience of similar 
matters and communications with potential counterparties and the 
Group’s legal advisers. 
Special items and other non-GAAP performance measures
The directors believe that the ‘adjusted’ proﬁt and earnings per share 
measures provide additional useful information for shareholders on 
the underlying performance of the business. These measures are 
consistent with how business performance is measured internally. 
The adjusted proﬁt before tax measure is not a recognised proﬁt 
measure under IFRS and may not be directly comparable with 
‘adjusted’ proﬁt measures used by other companies. 
The adjustments made to reported proﬁt before tax are to exclude 
the following special items:
• Employee severance costs;
•  Plant restructuring and recall costs;
• Acquisition-related expenses;
• Accelerated amortisation of upfront loan arrangement fees; and
• Amortisation of acquisition-related intangible assets.
Further detail on the special items in the period can be found in note 6.
The directors also refer to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation) as a performance indicator. EBITDA 
also adds the back any proﬁt or loss on disposal of property, plant 
and equipment, and impairments. 
Adoption of new and revised standards
The following amendment to a standard is mandatory for the ﬁrst 
time for the ﬁnancial year beginning 1 May 2011.
IAS 24 Revised Related party disclosures
The revised Standard has a new, clearer deﬁnition of a related party, 
with inconsistencies under the previous deﬁnition having been 
removed. No other new standards or amendments to standards 
have had a material impact on the Group in the current ﬁnancial year.
At the date of authorization of these ﬁnancial statements, the 
following Standards and Interpretations which have not been applied 
in these ﬁnancial statements were in issue but not yet effective 
(and in some cases have not yet been adopted by the EU):
IFRS 1 (amended) Severe Hyperinﬂation and Removal of Fixed 
Dates for First-time Adopters
IFRS 7 (amended) Disclosures – Transfers of Financial Assets
IFRS 9 Financial Instruments
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements
IFRS 12 Disclosure of Interests in other Entities
IFRS 13 Fair Value Measurement
IAS 1 (amended) Presentation of Items of Other Comprehensive 
Income
IAS 12 (amended) Deferred Tax: Recovery of Underlying Assets
IAS 19 (revised) Employee Beneﬁts
IAS 27 (revised) Separate Financial Statements
IAS 28 (revised) Investments in Associates and Joint Ventures
IAS 32 (amended) Financial Instruments Presentation
IFRIC 20 Stripping Costs in the Production Phase of a 
Surface Mine
The adoption of IFRS 9, which the Group plans to adopt for the year 
beginning on 1 May 2015, will affect both the measurement and 
disclosures of Financial Instruments. The directors do not expect that 
the adoption of the other standards listed above will have a material 
impact on the ﬁnancial statements of the Group in future periods.
Parent company ﬁnancial statements
The ﬁnancial statements of the parent company, Consort Medical 
plc, have been prepared in accordance with IFRS as adopted for 
use in the European Union in all cases. On publishing the parent 
company ﬁnancial statements together with the Group ﬁnancial 
statements, the Company is taking advantage of the exemption in 
s408 of the Companies Act 2006 not to present its individual income 
statement or statement of comprehensive income and related notes 
that form a part of these approved ﬁnancial statements. Financial statements

2. Segmental information
The Group’s chief operating decision maker is considered to be the Executive Committee.  This committee is responsible for the executive 
management of the Group and comprises the Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Corporate Development Director, the Group 
Director of Operations, the Company Secretary/General Counsel, the general managers of the Group’s businesses and the Director of Group 
Human Resources. This committee meets monthly to make decisions on operational and strategic matters other than those reserved for the 
Board. The committee is responsible for allocating resources and assessing performance of the operating segments.
 
The Group’s operating segments are determined with reference to the information that is supplied to the Executive Committee in order 
for it to allocate the Group’s resources and to monitor the performance of the Group.  That information analyses the Group between its 
two divisions, Bespak and King Systems. Bespak is the drug delivery device division, a market leader in the supply of valves and other 
devices for respiratory applications and a supplier of autoinjectors to global pharmaceutical companies.  King Systems is a leading supplier 
of life-saving patient care solutions to the US anaesthesia market including breathing circuits, face masks and other disposable airway 
management and airway visualisation products.
 
The Executive Committee assesses the performance of the operating segments based on a measure of adjusted operating proﬁt. This 
measurement basis excludes the effects of special items from the operating segments. Special items are analysed in note 6.
Net assets exclude taxation, net debt and investments, which are managed on a central basis. These are part of the reconciliation to total 
net assets.
Transactions between operating segments are at arm’s length and are eliminated as part of the reconciliation to the Group’s results and 
ﬁnancial position.   
The segment information provided to the Executive Committee for the reportable segments for the year ended 30 April 2012 is as follows:

Special items before taxation (1,560) (4,674)
Tax on special items 776  1,917 
Special items after taxation (784) (2,757)
Employee severance costs are in respect of the restructuring of UK operations and the transformation of manufacturing at the King 
Systems Division in the USA. 
Plant restructuring and recall costs include a credit for an onerous property lease and reversal of a plant, property and equipment 
impairment, certain costs associated with the restructuring at King Systems and the cost of a supplier-initiated product recall at King. 
Acquisition-related expenses are the incremental costs to the Group of completing business combinations or equity investments and any 
diligence costs incurred in investigating potential investment opportunities.  
The acquisition-related intangibles arose on the Group’s acquisitions of King Systems Corporation in 2005 and of The Medical House in 
2009.
The amortisation of upfront loan arrangement fees incurred during the Group’s reﬁnancing in 2010 has been accelerated following the 
reﬁnancing of the loans in June 2012.

Factors affecting future tax charge
In March 2012, the UK government enacted the reduction in the main rate of UK corporation tax from 26% to 24% from 1 April 2012 as 
well as announcing further rate reductions to 23% from 1 April 2013 and 22% from 1 April 2014. Therefore, the UK deferred tax assets 
and liabilities included within these ﬁnancial statements have been provided at a rate of 24%. The forecast effect of the further proposed 
reductions in rate by 2014 would be to decrease the net deferred tax liability by approximately £0.4 million.
Unrecognised tax losses
The Group has capital losses which arose in the UK of £28,713,000 (2011: £26,026,000) and in the US of £1,788,000 (2011: £1,927,000) 
that are available for offset against future chargeable gains in the UK and US groups respectively. Deferred tax assets have not been 
recognised in respect of these losses as it is not reasonably foreseeable that these will be utilised.
Deferred tax assets of £1,975,000 (2011: £1,752,000) in respect of tax losses carried forward have not been recognised due to insufﬁcient 
certainty over their recoverability. Of the £115,000 of US tax losses, £55,000 are due to expire in 2017 and the balance by 2020. Deferred 
tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to offset current tax assets against current tax liabilities and when 
the deferred income taxes relate to the same ﬁscal authority.

11. Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of 
ordinary shares in issue during the year, excluding those held in the employee share ownership trust, which are treated as cancelled.
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue to assume conversion 
of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. The Group has two classes of dilutive potential ordinary shares; those share options granted 
to employees where the exercise price is less than the average market price of the Company’s ordinary shares during the year and 
contingently issuable shares under the Long-Term Incentive Plan.

The carrying value of goodwill, translated at year-end exchange rates, is made up of balances arising on acquisition of the following
businesses, which comprise individual cash generating units.
2012

The Medical House plc (allocated to the Bespak segment) 15,800  15,800 
 59,593  58,470 
Goodwill arose on the acquisition of King Systems Corporation in 2005 and The Medical House plc, a cash generating unit within the 
Bespak segment, in 2009. Goodwill on the acquisition of The Medical House plc has been allocated to the Bespak Division in the 
segmental analysis (note 2).
Goodwill is not amortised but is tested for impairment annually. Value in use calculations are generally utilised to calculate recoverable 
amount. Value in use is calculated as the net present value of the projected risk-adjusted, post-tax cash ﬂows of the cash generating unit in 
which the goodwill is contained, applying a discount rate of the Group post-tax weighted average cost of capital, calculated to be between 
9% and 11% (2011: 8%), adjusted where necessary for country-speciﬁc risks. This approximates to applying a pre-tax discount to pre-tax 
cash ﬂows.
During the year, the carrying value of goodwill was tested for impairment. A value in use calculation was prepared and approved by the 
Board based upon the ﬁrst ﬁve years of the Group’s strategic plan, which takes into account both past performance and expectations for 
future market development. Cash ﬂows beyond this period are extrapolated using an annual growth rate of 2%, which does not exceed 
the long-term average growth rates for the sectors in which the CGUs operate. The conclusion of this exercise was that there had been no 
impairment. Critical judgements around goodwill impairment are disclosed in note 1.
The value in use calculations for King Systems assume a 15% compound annual growth in operating proﬁt for the ﬁrst 5 years, followed by 
a 2% terminal growth rate. No reasonably foreseeable changes to these assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill.
The directors are conﬁdent that the amount of goodwill allocated to The Medical House and the assumptions used in estimating its fair 
value are appropriate. These assumptions include successful product launches for existing customers in 2013 and revenue from as yet 
unidentiﬁed customers at a certain margin from 2015. A reduction in forecast operating proﬁt of 10% would lead to an impairment. Whilst 
it is conceivable that other key assumptions in the calculation could change, the directors believe that no reasonably foreseeable changes 
to other key assumptions would result in an impairment of goodwill with the exception of the failure of a customer to launch an injectable 
product within a reasonable timescale, as discussed in note 1. Financial statements

The Group operates pension schemes in the UK and a smaller deﬁned contribution scheme in the USA to provide pensions to retired 
employees. UK pension beneﬁts are provided by a deﬁned beneﬁt scheme, whereby retirement beneﬁts are based on employee 
pensionable remuneration and length of service, and by deﬁned contribution schemes, whereby retirement beneﬁts are determined by the 
value of funds arising from contributions paid in respect of each employee. The deﬁned beneﬁt scheme was closed to new entrants with 
effect from 30 June 2002.
Changes were made to the beneﬁts provided by the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme for future service with effect from 1 May 2009. These changes 
did not impact the Scheme’s deﬁcit in respect of past service, but did reduce the future service cost of the Scheme. The rate at which 
pension is accrued in future was reduced and the increases to pensions in payment and in deferment in respect of future service were 
capped at 2.5% pa. In addition the members’ share of the cost of the Scheme was increased to 8% of pensionable salaries, but this will 
be paid via a “salary sacriﬁce” arrangement. Under this arrangement members will no longer contribute to the Scheme and so the Group 
meets the full cost of accrual, but members will receive a reduction in their salary equal to their share of the cost of the Scheme. Members 
have the right to opt out of this arrangement if they wish to receive their full salary and contribute to the Scheme, in which case the Group’s 
contributions to the Scheme will reduce. Financial statements

Contributions to deﬁned beneﬁt schemes are determined in accordance with the advice of an independent, professionally qualiﬁed actuary. 
Pension costs of deﬁned beneﬁt schemes for accounting purposes have been assessed in accordance with independent actuarial advice, 
using the projected unit method. Liabilities are assessed annually in accordance with the advice of an independent actuary. Formal, 
independent, actuarial valuations of the Group’s deﬁned beneﬁt scheme are undertaken, normally every three years.
The following information relates to the Group’s UK deﬁned beneﬁt pension scheme, the Bespak plc Staff Retirement Beneﬁts Scheme

Contributions
Under the Schedule of Contributions agreed with the Scheme’s trustees in place at the time this disclosure was prepared, the Group 
expects to contribute approximately £1.0m to the deﬁned beneﬁt scheme in the 2013 ﬁnancial year.
Explanation of the relationship between Consort Medical plc and the trustees of the Scheme
The Scheme assets are held in a separate trustee-administered fund to meet long-term pension liabilities to past and present employees. 
The trustees of the Scheme are required to act in the best interests of the Scheme’s beneﬁciaries. The appointment of trustees to the 
Scheme is set out under Rule A16 of the Scheme’s trust deed and rules dated 14 March 1997. The Scheme has a policy that one-third  
of all trustees should be nominated by members of the Scheme.
Disclosure of principal assumptions
The principal actuarial assumptions adopted at the balance sheet date were:
30 April 2012 30 April 2011
Discount rate 5.0% pa 5.5% pa
Future RPI inﬂation 3.2% pa 3.6% pa
Future CPI inﬂation 2.2% pa 2.85% pa
Future salary increases 3.7% pa 4.0% pa
Rate of pension increases
RPI inﬂation capped at 5% p.a. 3.1% pa 3.5% pa
RPI inﬂation capped at 5% p.a. with a minimum of 3% p.a. 3.5% pa 3.7% pa
RPI inﬂation capped at 2.5% p.a. 2.2% pa 2.4% pa
CPI inﬂation capped at 3.0% p.a. 2.1% pa 2.7% pa
Expected return on plan assets 5.4% pa 6.0% pa
The IAS 19 accounting standard “Employee beneﬁts” requires that the discount rate used be determined by reference to market yields at 
the balance sheet date on high quality ﬁxed income investments. The currency and term of these should be consistent with the currency 
and estimated term of the post-employment obligations. 
The discount rate has been developed from a spot yield curve based on UK Government bonds, adjusted to reﬂect the credit spread 
between AA-rated corporate bonds and Government bonds.
The expected rate of inﬂation is an important building block for the salary growth and pension increase assumption. A rate of inﬂation is 
“implied” by the difference between the yields on ﬁxed-interest and index-linked Government bonds. Financial statements
76 Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012
21. Pensions and other post-employment beneﬁts continued
For the majority of members, pension accrued before 6 April 1997 does not receive any guaranteed increases and it is assumed that no 
discretionary increases will be awarded. Pension accrued between 6 April 1997 and 30 April 2009 receives increases in line with inﬂation 
subject to a maximum of 5% per annum (for which the Company has assumed future increases will be 3.1% per annum). Some members 
receive ﬁxed increases of 3% per annum on pension accrued before 6 April 1997 and increases in line with inﬂation subject to a minimum 
of 3% per annum and a maximum of 5% per annum on pension accrued between 6 April 1997 and 30 April 2009 (for which the Company 
has assumed future increases will be 3.5% per annum).  For all members, pension accrued after 1 May 2009 receives increases in line with 
inﬂation subject to a maximum of 2.5% per annum (for which the Company has assumed future increases will be 2.2% per annum).
One of the key assumptions made in valuing the pension scheme’s liabilities are the mortality rates used to assess how long pensions will 
be paid for. The mortality rates used to calculate the Scheme’s liabilities were updated as part of the Scheme’s actuarial valuation in 2008 
to reﬂect the results of surveys that have highlighted that people are living longer. The mortality rates now used in calculating the Scheme’s 
liabilities are based on data collected between 1991 and 1994, but allow for the accelerated improvements in longevity witnessed since 
that time and also allow for these accelerated improvements to continue in the future with a minimum annual rate of improvement of 1% 
per annum. These mortality tables are referred to as 110% of the PA92 long cohort tables with a 1% per annum underpin.
The current life expectancies (in years) underlying the value of the accrued liabilities for the Scheme are:
30 April 2012 30 April 2011
Life expectancy at age 65 Male Female Male Female
Member currently aged 65 23.5  25.7  23.4  26.7 
Member currently aged 45 25.7  28.1  25.4  28.7 
The overall expected return on assets has been calculated as the weighted average of the expected return for the principal asset 
categories, net of investment expenses, held by the plan as follows:
30 April 2012 30 April 2011
Asset category Weighting
Expected 
return Weighting Expected return
Gilts 16% 3.4% 15% 4.1%
Corporate bonds 27% 4.7% 25% 5.2%
Equities 47% 6.4% 52% 7.1%
Hedge funds 10% 5.4% 8% 6.1%
Cash 0% 0.0% 0% 0.0%
Overall 100% 5.4% 100% 6.0%
Sensitivity analysis of the principal assumptions used to measure Scheme liabilities
The sensitivity of the Scheme’s liabilities to changes in the principal assumptions used to measure these liabilities is illustrated below. 
The illustrations consider the single change shown with the other assumptions assumed to be unchanged. In practice, changes in one 
assumption may be accompanied by offsetting changes in another assumption (this is not always the case).
The Group liability is the difference between the Scheme liabilities and the Scheme assets. Certain changes in the assumptions will be as 
a result of changes in market yields. Where this is the case, the market value of Scheme assets may change simultaneously, which may 
or may not offset the change in assumptions. For example, a fall in interest rates will increase the Scheme liability, but may also trigger an 
offsetting increase in the market value of assets so that the net effect on the Group liability is reduced.

Rate of inﬂation and salary increase Increase by 0.25% pa Increase by 5.7%

How the liabilities arising from the Scheme are measured
The Group provides retirement beneﬁts via the Scheme to some of its former employees and approximately 30% of current UK employees. 
The level of retirement beneﬁt is principally based on salary earned in the ﬁnal three years of employment and period of service as a 
Scheme member.
The projected liabilities of the Scheme are apportioned between members’ past and future service using the projected unit actuarial 
cost method. The deﬁcit in the consolidated balance sheet is the difference between the projected liability allocated to past service (the 
deﬁned beneﬁt obligation) and the market value of the assets of the Scheme. The deﬁned beneﬁt obligation makes allowance for future 
earnings growth. If all active members were assumed to leave the Group and the allowance for future earnings growth was replaced by an 
allowance for statutory revaluation, the liabilities would reduce by approximately £5.2m.
An alternative measure of liability is the cost of buying out beneﬁts at the balance sheet date with a suitable insurer. This amount represents 
the amount that would be required to settle the Scheme liabilities at the balance sheet date rather than the Group continuing to fund the 
ongoing liabilities of the Scheme. The latest estimate of the amount required to settle the Scheme’s liabilities was calculated at 30 April 
2011. This indicated that the amount required was £43.9m in excess of the assets held by the Scheme. 
Future funding obligations in relation to the Scheme
The trustees have selected a funding target based on the Scheme being closed to new members but with active members continuing 
to accrue beneﬁts. The agreed funding objective is to reach, and then maintain, assets equal to 100% of the value of the projected past 
service liabilities, assessed on an ongoing basis, allowing for future salary increases for active members.
The most recently completed triennial actuarial valuation of the Scheme was performed by an independent actuary for the trustees 
of the Scheme and was carried out as at 30 April 2011. This valuation disclosed a surplus of assets compared with projected past service 
liabilities on an ongoing basis, and it was agreed with the trustees that the Group could cease paying deﬁcit reduction contributions.
Nature and extent of the risks arising from ﬁnancial instruments held by the Scheme
The expected return on the Scheme’s assets is based on market expectations at the beginning of the ﬁnancial period for returns over the 
life of the related obligation. The expected yield on bond investments with ﬁxed interest rates can be derived exactly from their market 
value. Some of these bond investments are issued by the UK Government and the risk of default on these is very small. The trustees 
also hold bond investments issued by public companies. There is a more signiﬁcant risk of default on these which is assessed by various 
rating agencies. The trustees also have a substantial holding of equity and hedge fund investments, with a target of 55% of the Scheme’s 
assets being invested in these funds. The investment return related to these is variable, and they are generally considered much “riskier” 
investments. It is generally accepted that the yield on these investments will contain a premium (“the equity risk premium”) to compensate 
investors for the additional risk of holding this type of investment. There is signiﬁcant uncertainty about the likely size of this risk premium. 
The majority of the equities held by the Scheme are in international blue chip entities. The aim is to hold a globally diversiﬁed portfolio of 
equities, with a target of 22% of equities being held in the UK, 27% in the rest of Europe, 20% in North American equities, 10% in each of 
Japanese and Paciﬁc Basin equities and 11% in emerging markets.
At the same time as the triennial actuarial valuation, the trustees, in conjunction with the Group, have carried out an investment strategy 
review. This included an asset-liability review for the Scheme, which is used to assist the trustees and the Group in determining the optimal 
long-term asset allocation with regard to the structure of liabilities within the Scheme. The results of the study are used to assist the 
trustees in managing the volatility in the underlying investment performance and the risk of a signiﬁcant increase in the Scheme’s deﬁcit by 
providing information used to determine the pension scheme’s investment strategy. Financial statements

All borrowings and loans are unsecured. The bank loans and overdrafts are subject to cross-guarantees between Group undertakings. 
The term loan and revolving credit facilities expire in October 2013. 
Interest on the GBP term loan and revolving credit facility is charged at LIBOR plus a margin of between 2.00% and 3.00%, depending 
upon the ratio of net debt to EBITDA (earnings before interest, tax, depreciation and amortisation), and on UK overdrafts at 1.75% above 
UK base rate. 
In July 2010 the Company entered into two three year interest rate swaps for a total notional amount of $40m commencing in 
January 2011. Under the terms of the swaps the Company receives interest on a variable rate basis and pays interest ﬁxed at 1.483%, 
plus bank margin. 
In April 2011 the Company took out a further interest rate swap on $7.5m commencing on 28 April 2011 and expiring on 31 January 2014. 
Under the terms of the swap the Company receives interest on a variable rate basis and pays interest ﬁxed at 1.5275%, plus bank margin.
In April 2011 the Company entered into an amortising interest rate swap for £10m commencing on 28 April 2011 and expiring on 
31 October 2013, matching its GBP term loan. Under the terms of the swap the Company receives interest on a variable rate basis and 
pays interest ﬁxed at 1.775%, plus bank margin.
On 1 June 2012, the Group cancelled its term loan and revolving credit facilities as part of a reﬁnancing.  On the same day, the Group 
signed a new $56m multicurrency revolving facility and a £40m multicurrency revolving facility.  The new facilities expire in November 2016 
and have interest and covenant terms similar to the cancelled facilities. Financial statements

Group Finance maintains treasury control systems and procedures 
to monitor interest rate, foreign exchange, credit and liquidity risks.
Consort Medical plc uses a variety of ﬁnancial instruments, including 
derivatives, to ﬁnance its operations and to manage market risks 
from these operations. Financial instruments include cash and liquid 
resources, borrowings, forward foreign exchange contracts and 
interest rate swaps.
Liquid assets surplus to the immediate operating requirements of 
Group undertakings are generally invested and managed centrally 
by Group Finance. 
External borrowings, mainly managed centrally by Group Finance, 
comprise a combination of long and short-term ﬁnance.
Consort Medical plc does not hold or issue derivative ﬁnancial 
instruments for trading purposes and the Group’s Treasury policies 
speciﬁcally prohibit such activity. All transactions in ﬁnancial 
instruments are undertaken to manage the risks arising from 
underlying business activities, not for speculation.
Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the 
Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide 
returns for shareholders and beneﬁts for other stakeholders and to 
maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may 
adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
Selling margins are sufﬁcient to cover normal operating costs and 
the Group’s operating subsidiaries are cash-generative. None of 
the entities in the Group are subject to externally imposed capital 
requirements.
Operating cash ﬂow is used to fund investment in new product 
development as well as to make the routine outﬂows of capital 
expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt.
The Group’s policy is to borrow centrally to meet anticipated 
funding requirements.
The Group monitors capital on the basis of the gearing ratio. This 
ratio is calculated as net debt divided by total capital. Net debt is 
calculated as borrowings less cash and cash equivalents. Total 
capital is calculated as ‘equity’ as shown in the consolidated balance 
sheet plus net debt.
The gearing ratios at 30 April 2012 and 30 April 2011 were as follows:
 2012  
£000
 2011  
£000
Total borrowings 52,338  40,966 
Less: cash and cash equivalents (14,685) (7,211)
Net debt 37,653  33,755 
Total equity 90,283  79,618 
Total capital 127,936  113,373 
Gearing ratio 29% 30%
The Group also monitors two widely used ratios to measure the 
ability to service debt. Both net debt/EBITDA and EBITDA interest 
cover were ahead of target in 2012.
Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
The table entitled ‘Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities’ 
presents the carrying amount and the fair values of the Group’s 
ﬁnancial assets and liabilities under IFRS. Where available, market 
values have been used to determine fair values. Where market 
values are not available, fair values are determined using the 
prevailing interest and exchange rates. 
The methods and assumptions used to estimate the fair values 
of ﬁnancial instruments are as follows:
Forward exchange contracts – the fair value of the Group’s forward 
exchange contracts is based on market prices and exchange rates 
at the balance sheet date.
Interest rate swaps – the fair value of the Group’s interest rate swaps 
is based on the market values at the balance sheet date.
Other – the fair value of other assets and liabilities approximates 
to the carrying amount reported in the balance sheet.
Fair value and cash ﬂow hedging activities
Under IFRS, all derivative ﬁnancial instruments are recognised as 
assets or liabilities in the consolidated balance sheet at fair value. 
Gains and losses are recognised in the consolidated income 
statement unless they are designated as hedging instruments 
and tested to be effective under IAS 39 ‘Financial instruments – 
Recognition and measurement’, in which case the element of gains 
and losses that fulﬁl the hedge effectiveness criteria are taken directly 
to equity.
Consort Medical plc’s hedging strategy is unchanged in respect 
of covering the transactional risk of foreign currency sales and 
purchases and hedging the net investment position of foreign 
subsidiaries.
Interest rate risk management
The Group’s policy is to convert a portion of its ﬂoating rate debt 
into ﬁxed rate debt using interest rate swaps. The Group designates 
these as cash ﬂow hedges of interest rate risk. 81% (2011: 100%) 
or $47.5m of the Group’s USD denominated debt at 30 April 2012 
is at ﬁxed rates through the use of interest swaps. The Group’s GBP 
term loan is also matched by an interest rate swap. The fair value of 
the interest rate swaps at 30 April 2012 was a liability of £539,000 
(2011: liability £348,000). The movement in the year has been 
included in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income.  Financial statements

Based on the US dollar (USD) denominated ﬂoating rate debt at the 
year end, a 100 basis point movement in US interest rates (which 
is considered reasonably possible) would have a £0.1m impact on 
the Company’s interest expense and equity (2011: £nil). A 100 basis 
point movement in UK interest rates (which is considered reasonably 
possible) would have a £0.1m impact on the Company’s interest 
income and equity based on the cash balances at 30 April 2012 
(2011: £nil) and a £0.1m impact on the Company’s interest expense 
and equity (2011: £nil).
The Group manages centrally the short-term cash surpluses 
or borrowing requirements of subsidiary undertakings. 
Foreign exchange risk management
The Group’s principal currency exposure is movement between 
sterling and USD.
Transactional exposure
The Group uses forward contracts to hedge transactional currency 
exposures. As a result there were no material net monetary assets 
or liabilities in foreign currencies, having taken into account the 
effect of forward exchange currency contracts that have been used 
to match foreign currency exposures. The Company does not 
undertake currency hedging.
The Group hedges a proportion of forecast foreign currency 
transaction exposure generally extending up to 12 months. At 30 
April 2012, the Group held forward contracts to hedge the equivalent 
of £3.2m of forecast foreign currency transaction exposures (2011: 
£2.5m). The fair value of the forward exchange contracts was an 
asset of £95,000 at 30 April 2012 (2011: asset £70,000). The 
Group currently does not designate these forward contracts as cash 
ﬂow hedges and gains and losses are recognised in the income 
statement.
The primary exposures in the UK business are transactions 
denominated in the USD and the euro. Based on the net exposures 
in these currencies at the year end, a 10% decline in sterling against 
USD and the euro (which is considered reasonably possible) would 
increase operating proﬁt and equity by £0.3m (2011: £0.2m). A 10% 
increase in the value of sterling (which is considered reasonably 
possible) would have a similar but opposite effect.
Translational exposure
The income statement of the Group’s US business is converted into 
sterling each month for reporting purposes at the average exchange 
rate throughout the year. Consequently, there is a translational 
exposure arising from movements in the sterling/USD exchange rate. 
The Group does not hedge this translation exposure.
Included in loans at 30 April 2012 was a borrowing of $59m/£36.3m 
(2011: $47.5m/£28.5m) which has been designated as a hedge 
of the Group’s net investments in the United States and is being 
used to hedge the exposure to foreign exchange risks on these 
investments. Gains or losses on the retranslation of this borrowing 
are transferred to equity to offset any gains or losses on translation 
of the net investments in the subsidiaries. In the year ended 30 April 
2012 there was a gain of £1.0m taken to equity on retranslation of 
the Group’s net investment in its US business (2011: loss of £3.1m).
A decline of 10% in the value of sterling at the year end would 
increase the value of the Group’s net assets and equity by £4.6m 
(2011: increase of £3.8m). A 10% increase in the value of sterling 
would have a similar but opposite effect.
Committed facilities
As explained in note 23, at the balance sheet date the Group 
had committed facilities available at ﬂoating rates that expired in 
October 2013 and an overdraft facility that expires within one year.  
On 1 June 2012, the Group reﬁnanced and its committed facilities 
available at ﬂoating rates expire in November 2016.
Market risk of ﬁnancial assets
The Group invests centrally managed liquid assets in short-term 
investments with banks at ﬂoating rates measured against LIBID. 
These investments are classiﬁed as cash and cash equivalents.
Credit risk
The Group is exposed to a concentration of credit risk in respect 
of its major customers such that, if one or more of them is affected 
by ﬁnancial difﬁculty, it could materially and adversely affect the 
Group’s ﬁnancial results. However, the Group generally does not 
expect its customers to fail to meet their obligations.
The Group does not believe that it is exposed to major 
concentrations of credit risk on other classes of ﬁnancial instruments. 
The Group is exposed to credit-related losses in the event of non-
performance by counterparties to ﬁnancial instruments, but does not 
expect any counterparties to fail to meet their obligations.
The Group applies Board-approved limits to the amount of credit 
exposure to any one counterparty and employs strict minimum 
creditworthiness criteria as to the choice of counterparty. 
Additionally, the Group takes out credit insurance cover against the 
majority of export sales.
Liquidity risk
The Group operates internationally, primarily through subsidiary 
companies established in the markets in which the Group trades. 
Selling margins are sufﬁcient to exceed normal operating costs and 
the Group’s main operating subsidiaries are cash-generative.
Operating cash ﬂow is used to fund investment in the research and 
development of new products as well as routine outﬂows of capital 
expenditure, tax, dividends and repayment of maturing debt. The 
Group may, from time to time, have additional demands for ﬁnance, 
such as acquisitions.  Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 83

Fair value of ﬁnancial assets and liabilities
The following table sets out the classiﬁcation of the Group’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities. Receivables and payables have been included to 
the extent that they are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial assets and liabilities in accordance with IAS 32. Provisions have been included where there is a 
contractual obligation to settle in cash. Where appropriate, currency and interest rate swaps have been presented alongside the underlying 
principal instrument. The carrying amounts of these instruments have been adjusted for the effect of the currency and interest rate swaps 
acting as hedges.

The following tables categorise the Group’s and Company’s ﬁnancial assets and liabilities held at fair value by the valuation methodology 
applied in determining fair value. Where possible, quoted prices in active markets are used (Level 1). Where such prices are not available, 
the asset or liability is classiﬁed as Level 2, provided all signiﬁcant inputs to the valuation model are based on observable market data. In 
other cases the instrument is classiﬁed as Level 3.  The Company has no ﬁnancial assets held at fair value through proﬁt or loss.

on consolidation of the Group’s net investments in the United States. The fair value of the USD borrowings at 30 April 2012 was £36.3m 
(2011: £28.5m). The foreign exchange loss of £0.8m (2011: gain £2.5m) on translation of the borrowing into sterling has been recognised 
directly in equity. Financial statements

27. Employee share schemes
Share options
The Group operates share award schemes whereby awards are granted to employees to acquire shares in Consort Medical plc at no cost, 
subject to the achievement by the Group of certain speciﬁed performance targets. It also offers savings-related share option schemes. Since 
the introduction of the 2005 LTIP scheme no further awards have been made under any Executive Share Option Scheme. In August 2011 
and October 2011 awards were made under a new Company Share Option Scheme.
Grants of share options are normally exercisable at the end of the three-year vesting/performance period. Grants under savings-related share 
option schemes are normally exercisable after three years’ saving. Grants under share option schemes are normally exercisable between 
three and ten years from the date of grant. Options under the share option schemes are normally granted at the market price ruling at the 
date of grant. The majority of options under the savings-related share option schemes are now granted at the market price ruling at the date 
of grant.
In August 2011 and October 2011, share options were granted under the new Company Share Option Scheme in tandem with grants under 
the LTIP . Further details are provided below.

Option pricing
For the purposes of valuing options to arrive at the stock-based compensation charge, the Black-Scholes option pricing model has been 
used. The assumptions used in the model are as follows:
SAYE 
scheme 
2012
Risk-free interest rate 0.9%
Dividend yield 3.4%
Volatility 33.0%
Expected lives of options granted under:
Savings-related share option schemes 3 years
Weighted average share price for grants in the year:
Savings-related share option schemes – market and option price 520p
The expected volatility is based on historical volatility over the last three years. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. 
The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK Government bonds of a term consistent with the assumed option life.

Performance Share Plan and Share Appreciation Rights (LTIP)
The Group operates a Performance Share Plan and Share Appreciation Rights Scheme whereby awards are granted to directors and 
senior management at no cost. The percentage of each award that vests is based upon the performance of the Group over a three-year 
measurement period.

Awards forfeited (397,134) (181,328)
At 30 April 1,138,184 1,128,409 
Performance shares are issued at nil cost to the employee. There were no performance shares exercisable at the end of the year (2011: nil).  
The weighted average remaining contractual life of the performance shares in issue was 17 months (2011: 18 months).   
      
Awards granted in the year were made in the form of performance shares (i.e. rights to receive shares in the future at nil cost) subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions and a linked CSOS option. The cumulative economic effect of these awards for both participants and 
the Company is identical to that for performance shares, and as such the fair value of these awards has been calculated on this aggregate 
basis.
During the year awards under the LTIP were granted to a number of employees. The fair value per share under award at grant has been 
calculated using a Monte Carlo share pricing model. The assumptions used in the calculation are as follows:
Share price at grant date 553p
Shares under option 406,909 
Vesting period 3 years
Volatility 33.4%
Risk-free rate 0.88%
Fair value per performance share 407p

We have audited the ﬁnancial statements of Consort Medical plc 
for the year ended 30 April 2012 which comprise the Consolidated 
Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive
Income, the Consolidated and Company Balance Sheets, 
the Consolidated and Company Cash Flow Statements, 
the Consolidated and Company Statements of Changes in 
Shareholders’ Equity and the related notes. The ﬁnancial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent 
company ﬁnancial statements, as applied in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
Responsibilities set out on page 29, the directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements and for being satisﬁed 
that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 
3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose.  
We do not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility 
for any other purpose or to any other person to whom this report 
is shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements sufﬁcient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁnancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate 
to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the 
directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in 
the Consort Medical plc Annual Report & Accounts 2012 to identify 
material inconsistencies with the audited ﬁnancial statements. 
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements 
In our opinion: 
•  the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 April 2012 
and of the Group’s proﬁt and Group’s and parent company’s cash 
ﬂows for the year then ended;
•  the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
•  the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
•  the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
group ﬁnancial statements, Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
•  the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
•  the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year 
for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
•  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been 
received from branches not visited by us; or 
•  the parent company ﬁnancial statements and the part of 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
•  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are 
not made; or 
•  we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
•  the directors’ statement, set out on page 41, in relation to going 
concern;
•  the parts of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to 
the company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code speciﬁed for our review; and
•  certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration.

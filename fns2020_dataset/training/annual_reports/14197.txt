02 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
At Shire we focus on people. 
Those that work for us, partner 
with us, invest in our strategy 
and, above all, those who 
depend on the medicines we 
make every day. Our purpose is 
to help people with life-altering 
conditions lead better lives. We 
ask the questions that are raised 
by rare and specialty diseases and 
pursue new possibilities through 
thoughtful and innovative science.
Creating exceptional value
When we do what is good, we believe good follows. Value 
is created not just for the patients, but for physicians, 
caregivers, employees, communities, payers, policymakers, 
and shareholders—for anyone or any institution that our 
global company can touch. And value, we were reminded 
this year, can be created—and recognized—in so many ways.  ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 03

Extraordinary results
We had an eventful year in 2014. We had unprecedented 
fi nancial results as you’ll see in the pages to come. We 
completed our acquisition of ViroPharma and successfully 
integrated this organization, serving new patients with the 
product CINRYZE
®
, a medicine for the infl ammatory condition 
known as Hereditary Angioedema. At the same time, we 
acquired two rare diseases entities—Lumena and Fibrotech. 
We fortifi ed our presence in established therapies and opened 
doors to new ones, including Ophthalmics. We moved into 
our new International Operational Headquarters in Zug, 
Switzerland and reinvigorated our presence in Europe, Asia 
and Latin America. We continued to streamline operations 
and to put the right people into the right jobs to complement 
the immediate impact of mergers and acquisitions with our 
focus on continuing organic growth. On behalf of adults with 
Binge Eating Disorder, we fi led in the US for a supplemental 
new drug application for VYVANSE
®
 which the Food and Drug 
Administration (“FDA”) approved on January 30, 2015 as the 
fi rst and only medication for the treatment for this disorder. 
And, most recently, we acquired NPS Pharma bringing two 
exciting rare disease therapies into our product portfolio.
We were again recognized as a constituent of the FTSE4Good 
Index Series, a leading responsibility investment index, and 
also earned the distinction from Corporate Knights in their 
ranking of the 2015 Global 100 Most Sustainable 
Corporations in the World. 
We accomplished all this while responding to AbbVie as 
it considered the role that Shire might play within its own 
strategic framework. We never lost sight of the company 
that Shire is throughout the process. 
We have a strong, independent future. And we’re passionate 
about building it.
Executing our strategy
Our plan moving forward is to emerge as a leading global 
biotech focused on rare diseases and other speciality 
conditions. To get there, we’ll continue our investment in 
our four key strategic drivers: growth, innovation, effi ciency, 
and people. Under the leadership of our Chief Executive 
Offi cer, Dr. Flemming Ornskov, we’ll strengthen—and 
sustain—our platform through our focused approach to 
mergers and acquisitions, pipeline advancement, and cash 
management. We’ll rely on the people who make Shire what 
it is—a diversifi ed team representing many skills and broad 
experiences.
Outstanding contributions
Our Board of Directors made signifi cant contributions to Shire 
throughout 2014—going far above and beyond expectations 
to render opinions and weigh choices. I have the distinct 
pleasure of working with Board members who bring the full 
complement of scientifi c, medical, fi nancial, organizational 
and commercial insights to bear on complex opportunities. 
In closing, I would like to extend my gratitude to the people 
of Shire who remained focused on what mattered most 
throughout the year—our patients. The world is a healthier 
place, thanks to Shire. Our people are the reason.

Heading
Sub heading
In 2014 we delivered record sales 
and proﬁ tability, and continued 
to strengthen our pipeline of 
important medicines to enable 
people with life altering conditions 
to lead better lives.
At the same time we embarked on our course with the aim of 
becoming a leading global biotech building on the foundation 
laid by our One Shire reorganization. For us, it was a year 
of delivering outstanding results and superior shareholder 
returns, setting a clear direction and gaining momentum.
Moving forward
One of the highlights of 2014 for me was the ongoing journey 
to transform Shire into a high-growth, more effi cient, more 
innovative organization with a streamlined structure.
We made great progress in this regard and our success was 
the result of a tremendous team effort to achieve a step 
change in growth, profi tability, cash generation and to 
increase the value of our pipeline.
We were also focused. A prime example was our rapid and 
effective integration of ViroPharma following completion of 
the $4 billion acquisition early in the year. We successfully 
accelerated the growth of CINRYZE which came to us 
through the ViroPharma acquisition while obtaining 
operational synergies and advancing the acquired pipeline.

A clear direction
Our aspiration is to become a leading global biotech 
delivering innovative medicines to patients with rare diseases 
and other specialty conditions. We are prioritizing those areas 
that enable us to realize our purpose and maintain leading 
positions in the therapeutic areas in which we compete. 
Our commercial excellence is driving superior top-line results 
and our operational effi ciency is enabling us to reinvest for 
the future. We have highly effective business development 
capabilities and a robust and innovative pipeline. Simply put, 
we are a high-growth, highly innovative company making a 
real difference in people’s lives. 
The best of two worlds
We are uniquely placed to make a difference in people’s lives 
due to our distinctive mix of complementary business units 
and capabilities. I like to think of it as a triangle with our 
Rare Diseases business unit at the center, where we are 
increasingly focusing our R&D dollars, supported by the 
strength of the products in our specialty business units – 
Neuroscience, Gastrointestinal (GI) and Internal Medicine, 
and our recently added Ophthalmics business unit. Through 
this combination we get the best of two worlds – the future 
long-term growth and opportunities of Rare Diseases, which 
was our fastest growing business (+46%
1
) in 2014, and the 
continued foundation and growth of our cash-generating 
specialty products, which contribute signifi cantly to our 
Rare Disease R&D dollars. 
Moreover, there is an interplay between our business units 
that aids our current and future innovation and growth as we 
adapt our existing therapeutic area expertise to a rare disease 
focus. We are leveraging our domain expertise in rare 
diseases in the development of an intrathecal delivery device 
for enzyme replacement therapies and this year we partnered 
with ArmaGen to conduct research into therapies that can 
cross the blood-brain barrier for Hunter syndrome. We have 
added to our Ophthalmics pipeline with the acquisition of the 
specialist biotech company BIKAM Pharmaceuticals with its 
preclinical asset, SHP630, in development for the potential 
treatment of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa. In 
addition, through our acquisition of Lumena we have added 
late stage pipeline assets for rare GI/hepatic conditions, and 
through our acquisition of Fibrotech we added an antifi brotic 
agent for focal segmental glomerulosclerosis. Our most 
recent acquisition of NPS Pharma further builds upon our rare 
disease expertise with therapies for Short Bowel Syndrome 
(“SBS”) and Hyperparathyroidism (“HPT”).
Our distinctive mix of complementary 
business units and capabilities
Rare
Diseases
Ophthalmics
Neuroscience
GI & Internal 
Medicine
Our domain expertise in rare diseases is a key differentiator 
for Shire. It enables us to make the most of our belief that 
those living with rare conditions are just as deserving of 
treatment as those living with more common conditions.
To build on our distinctive focus and strengths, we have four 
strategic drivers: growth, innovation, effi ciency and people. 
In 2014 we hit signifi cant milestones across all four.
Driving strong growth across all our businesses
Shire delivered growth through commercial excellence across 
all of our business units. 
In Rare Diseases, through our acquisition of ViroPharma, 
we added and accelerated the sales growth of CINRYZE 
(+30%) on a pro forma basis
2
, an innovative product for 
the prophylactic treatment of Hereditary Angiodema (HAE) 
attacks. FIRAZYR
®
, our treatment for acute HAE attacks, 
also grew strongly (+55%). In our GI business, LIALDA
®
 
has become the number one prescribed 5-ASA in the US
3
 in 
2014 and gained an additional 5% of market share in 2014. 
In Neuroscience, VYVANSE sales grew 18% as more patients 
continued to use VYVANSE to treat their Attention Defi cit 
Hyperactivity Disorder (“ADHD”).

We grew around the world too – continuing to expand our 
footprint with products available in 68 countries including 
the launch of two products, VPRIV
®
 and AGRYLIN
®
, in Japan. 
Sales outside of the US were $1.75 billion, an increase of 
11% versus 2013. 
Much of our growth outside of the US was driven by our Rare 
Diseases business unit, particularly in Europe and the Middle 
East and Africa, with these regions accounting for more than 
50% of our revenues outside the US. Despite the clinical, 
regulatory, and commercial challenges with bringing a rare 
disease treatment to market, we reached eight new 
international markets in 2014. In addition, the launch of 
ELVANSE
®
 (marketed as VYVANSE in the US) has been 
a success launching in four countries this year, making 
the product available in 12 markets outside of the US. Our 
international GI business unit has also shown strong growth 
this year, with MEZAVANT
®
 (marketed as LIALDA in the US) 
net sales growing by 12% and RESOLOR
®
 net sales 
increasing by 26%. 
Enhancing our innovation
Through 2014 we continued to concentrate our R&D on rare 
diseases – the majority of our research dollars now goes into 
this area. Overall, we invested $840 million on a Non GAAP 
basis in R&D
2
 and we hosted our fi rst R&D Day showcasing 
the innovation in our pipeline. In 2014, we have 27 programs 
in clinical development, 22 of them distinct, the balance 
relating to new markets or new indications – the most in 
Shire’s history. 
Mixing internal and external innovation, we have built a strong 
rare diseases platform in several areas, including enzyme 
replacement, plasma-derived products, kidney and fi brotic 
related conditions, and now in rare gastrointestinal/hepatic 
diseases, with the acquisition of Lumena. This enables us 
to develop products that can be brought to market in new 
areas where there is a high medical need.
Alongside our strong research capability in rare diseases, we 
made excellent progress in enhancing our specialty pipeline. 
In Neuroscience for example, we explored product 
candidates such as SHP465, a potential treatment for ADHD 
in adults. We are also entering new markets with VYVANSE, 
having received FDA approval on January 30, 2015 for the 
treatment of Binge Eating Disorder (“BED”) in adults. BED 
affects an estimated 2.8 million
1
 US patients and VYVANSE 
is the only FDA approved treatment for this condition.
Increasing efﬁ ciency throughout our organization
Our ongoing drive to increase effi ciency gained momentum 
through the year as we took advantage of the signifi cant 
reorganization undertaken in 2013 to streamline and simplify 
Shire. This was a contributor to our achievements in the year, 
notably our profi tability, which is at an all-time high with a Non 
GAAP EBITDA margin of 44%
2
 ; our ability to generate cash, 
with cash generation of $2.4 billion
2
 in 2014; and our sales 
per employee, $1.2 million. We also simplifi ed our global 
footprint by establishing our US Operational Headquarters in 
Lexington, Massachusetts and our International Operational 
 Headquarters in Zug, Switzerland.
Attracting, rewarding and retaining great people 
Throughout 2014 we continued to hire and retain excellent 
talent at all levels. Our performance in a year which included 
the uncertainty and distraction resulting from the offer from 
AbbVie, is a testament to the great commitment, skills and 
resilience of our people, who continued to focus on their work 
and delivered record revenue and Non GAAP earnings. This 
refl ects not only the dedication of our people but also the 
strength of our patient-focused culture. I’m proud that we are 
increasingly recognized as a company where great people do 
great work to help transform lives around the world.

I am thankful for the leadership of our employees and their 
outstanding contributions through such a successful and 
eventful year. Shire has become a place that attracts people 
because it has the things they are looking for – low hierarchy, 
quick decision making, interesting products, and collaborative 
colleagues. As we continue to grow and pursue our goal to be 
a leader in biotech, Shire is a place which offers increasing 
opportunities and rewards for everyone involved.
I would also like to thank our investors for their continued 
loyalty. I am very pleased and proud of the fact that we attract 
investors who continue to support us on our journey. 
Aiming to lead in biotech
Our four strategic drivers – growth, effi ciency, innovation and 
people – are the engines propelling us forward on our journey 
to become a leading global biotech with a focus on rare 
diseases and specialty conditions. We have made signifi cant 
progress this year but we also recognize that we are still in the 
early stages of our journey. We remain committed to being 
a lean, streamlined, innovation-driven and growth-focused 
company. A company that is big on ideas and value, rather 
than simply big. This is as much a mentality shift as an 
operational shift – it’s about thinking differently and acting 
differently to get where we want to go.
10 x 20: a journey and a goal 
T o guide and encourage us, we have set the target of achieving 
$10 billion in product sales by 2020. Our 10 x 20 goal acts as 
our compass as we navigate excellent commercial execution 
across our business units, and strong innovation in our 
pipeline. This is the direction we have set for ourselves. 
10 x 20 is a new and galvanizing target for us, but in many 
ways it is very much in character – we are a high performance 
company setting another high bar to meet and exceed. It is 
also as much about the journey as the goal. I like both the 
ambition of 10 x 20 and the adventure of getting there.
Transforming lives 
Looking ahead, we will continue to build on our strong 
foundation and achievements. We have a clear growth 
strategy and a streamlined organization. We know where we 
are heading and, in great measure, how we are going to get 
there. But we also know that the year ahead will feature new 
opportunities and challenges that we are ready to make the 
most of so we continue to strive to strengthen and improve. 
Through all of our change and progress one thing above all 
remains constant – our patients. We’re on this journey for 
them and we are inspired to make a difference because we 
want to deliver innovative medicines that have the potential 
to transform their lives.

To drive our growth, we have a unifi ed, global business model 
focused on our strategic drivers. We lead our business 
through our Executive Committee which, supported by 
our In-line and Pipeline Committees, ensures we allocate 
resources and make decisions across the enterprise in the 
best interests of all our stakeholders – patients, employees, 
physicians, payers, policy makers and investors.
This streamlined way of working means we can quickly adapt 
and change our business around the world as we pursue 
and make the most of opportunities to develop and market 
innovative treatments that have the potential to transform 
the lives of people around the world. 
One culture
We have a clear and strong patient-focused, performance-
based culture which is grounded in our purpose of enabling 
people with life altering conditions to lead better lives:
 > We have the courage to lead the way
 > We are agile and adaptable to meet the changing needs 
of our stakeholders

capabilities and support to implement our strategy, achieve 
our vision and deliver value to all our stakeholders.
In-line – commercial excellence
Our In-line focus is on marketing 
products to meet the needs of 
patients today.
Our business units focus exclusively on the commercial 
execution of our marketed products in the areas of Rare 
Disease, Neuroscience, Gastrointestinal, and Internal 
Medicine. In addition, we have recently added an 
Ophthalmics business unit to support the development 
of our pipeline candidates. 
Pipeline – innovation excellence
Our Pipeline focus is on the products 
we are developing to meet the needs 
of patients tomorrow.
We have a single Research and Development (R&D) 
organization that focuses on enhancing our pipeline of 
innovative treatments to address unmet patient needs with an 
increasing emphasis on rare diseases. We are also adapting 
our expertise in existing therapeutic areas to that of a rare 
disease focus. This focus ensures we explore and develop 
opportunities built upon our core strengths and also enables 
us to explore related and emerging areas.
Our growth is also fueled by the acquisition of new 
companies, licensing agreements and new product 
development opportunities through partnerships. Our global 
Corporate Development team searches for new technologies, 
innovative products and strategic partnerships that have the 
potential to address unmet medical needs and provide new 
growth opportunities for Shire. The team is engaged in 
conversations with scientists and entrepreneurs around the 
world, while collaborating daily with commercial and R&D 
experts throughout the Company.

acquisition of ViroPharma, primarily $503 million from 
CINRYZE. Product sales excluding products acquired with 
ViroPharma were up 11% in 2014.
Product sales growth was achieved from across Shire’s 
portfolio with six products delivering double digit growth 
in 2014 at constant exchange rates (“CER”).
Sales outside the US grew 11% to $1.75 billion. 
Shire expanded its presence in the Japanese market with the 
approval of both VPRIV for the improvement of symptoms 
of Gaucher disease and AGRYLIN for essential thrombocythemia.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
VYVANSE
$1,449m
2013 $1,228m
ADHD
VYVANSE product sales grew strongly (up 18%) 
in 2014 primarily due to the benefi t of price 
increases and to a lesser extent higher US 
prescription demand and growth in ex-US 
product sales. This growth was partially 
offset by a lower level of stocking in 2014 
as compared to 2013.
LIALDA/MEZAVANT
$634m
2013 $529m
Ulcerative Colitis
The 20% growth in product sales for LIALDA/
MEZAVANT in 2014 was primarily driven by 
higher prescription demand (up 25%) and to 
a lesser extent a price increase taken at the 
beginning of 2014. The growth was partially 
offset by a lower level of stocking and higher 
sales deductions as a percentage of sales in 
2014 as compared to 2013.
ELAPRASE
$593m
2013 $546m
Hunter syndrome
ELAPRASE sales growth was up 9% (up 11% 
on a CER basis), driven by continued growth 
in the number of treated patients, especially 
in emerging markets. Sales growth was also 
negatively impacted by foreign exchange.
CINRYZE
$503m
2013 n/a
For the prophylactic treatment of Hereditary 
Angioedema
Shire acquired CINRYZE through its acquisition 
of ViroPharma on January 24, 2014. CINRYZE 
sales were $503 million in 2014, growing 30% 
on a pro-forma basis on 2013
1
 primarily driven 
by more patients on therapy and to a lesser 
extent the impact of a price increase in the US, 
and an increase in channel inventory.
REPLAGAL
$500m
2013 $468m
Fabry disease
REPLAGAL sales were up 7% compared to 
2013 (up 10% on a CER basis), driven primarily 
by higher unit sales as we continue to see an 
increase in the number of patients on therapy 
with good growth in emerging markets and to a 
lesser extent Europe. The benefi t of higher unit 
sales was partially offset by foreign exchange.
ADDERALL XR
$383m
2013 $375m
ADHD
ADDERALL XR product sales were up 2% 
in 2014, as a result of higher prescription 
demand, partially offset by lower stocking 
in 2014 compared to 2013.
VPRIV
$367m
2013 $343m
Gaucher disease
VPRIV sales were up 7% (up 8% on a CER 
basis), driven by a strong performance in the 
EU and US as we continue to add naïve 
patients and gain patients switching from other 
therapies. Sales growth was also negatively 
impacted by foreign exchange.
FIRAZYR
$364m
2013 $235m
For the treatment of acute HAE attacks
FIRAZYR sales growth was up 55% compared 
to 2013, driven by a higher number patients on 
therapy and the effect of a price increase in the 
US market.
INTUNIV
$327m
2013 $335m
ADHD
INTUNIV product sales were down 2% 
compared to 2013, refl ecting the impact of 
generic competition from December 2014, 
resulting in lower prescription demand, 
signifi cantly higher sales deductions as a 
percentage of product sales and destocking as 
compared to a slight level of stocking in 2013. 
This was partially offset by price increases taken 
in 2014. The impact of generic competition saw 
INTUNIV market share fall to 2.3% at the end of 
2014 from 4.6% at the beginning of the year.
PENTASA
$290m
2013 $281m
Ulcerative Colitis
PENTASA product sales were up 3% as the

world, we work together as a close-knit, resilient 
team dedicated to achieving high performance. 
Throughout Shire, we strive to create a great place

Responsibility
We are committed to
responsibility throughout Shire. 
Read more online at:
www.shire.com/shireplc/en/resp
At Shire, we ground everything we do in our values – 
to be bold, resilient, accountable, visionary, and ethical. 
This underpins our approach to Responsibility, and ultimately 
how we strive to develop innovative treatments to serve 
patients and to create enduring value for stakeholders. 
Responsibility at Shire has always been embedded in our 
business – we have never separated it from our daily business 
activities, decisions and relationships.
In 2014, Shire remained a constituent of the FTSE4Good 
Index Series, a leading responsibility investment index. We 
are also proud in 2015 of having the distinction of ranking 
among the 100 Most Sustainable Corporations in the World 
with our inclusion for the fi rst time in the Global 100. 
Shire has been included for the 
ﬁ rst time as one of the 100 Most 
Sustainable Corporations in the world 
according to Corporate Knights.
Shire remained a constituent of the 
FTSE4Good Index Series, as we have 
for many years.
In 2014, we improved our 
performance in the CDP results 
achieving 91%/B rating, our highest 
rating to date, and above the FTSE 
and pharmaceutical averages.
Our responsibility programs and activities include:
 > Improving access to our rare disease medicines where 
they aren’t currently available
 > Raising awareness among physicians and parents of the 
signs of many rare and specialist conditions and providing 
the extra support often required with this type of diagnosis
 > Educating policy makers on the serious social impact of 
untreated ADHD on families, education, the criminal justice 
system and society as a whole
 > Advocating to discourage the misuse, abuse and diversion 
of ADHD medications
 > Providing easy-to-understand information on our clinical trials 
– including current trials underway as well as information on 
ﬁ ndings from completed trials
 > Reducing our environmental impact through a series 
of locally-based initiatives and programs
 > Supporting and encouraging diversity within our company by 
fostering a culture which respects and values contributions 
from a wide spectrum of experiences and individuals
 > Helping support minority and small business through

Core areas of focus
While responsibility at Shire covers a wide range of topics and 
areas – including the environment, community involvement, 
and our people – our 2014 materiality assessment (see page 
31) points to three primary areas where we have the greatest 
responsibility: access to medicines, transparency and 
disease awareness.
Areas of 
the greatest 
responsibility
Access to
medicines
Transparency
Disease
awareness
Access to medicines
For those with rare or specialist conditions, obtaining access 
to treatment can be a big challenge, even in more developed 
parts of the world such as North America and Western 
Europe. According to Shire’s Rare Disease Index Report 
which was published in 2013, some 7,000 rare diseases have 
been identifi ed, and treatment exists for less than 5%. The 
report also revealed that it takes more than seven and a half 
years in the U.S. to receive a proper diagnosis of a rare 
disease – it isn’t diffi cult to see how much longer this might 
be in less developed parts of the world. 
For those with rare and specialist conditions, improving 
access is largely about continuing to focus on developing 
new treatments for unmet patient needs, where there may 
currently be little hope. As a result, we view the development 
of orphan drugs, and treatments for other specialist 
conditions with signifi cant unmet needs, as a core 
responsibility in itself.
Other ways to improve access involve reducing barriers, such 
as affordability and geographic access for our existing 
treatments. We have several programs to assist patients with 
affordability challenges in the US Outside the US, we have 
Named Patient programs and working with our NGO partner 
Direct Relief, provide humanitarian access to patients where 
they might not otherwise be available. 
We also have a long-standing relationship with AmeriCares, 
donating medicines and funding to help people in need in 
poorer countries around the world. These are just some of the 
ways we are working to provide hope to patients with few, 
if any, treatment options.
Disease awareness
Disease awareness is especially important for Shire because 
the conditions our products treat are often extremely rare or 
not well understood. Without the appropriate level of 
awareness, conditions often remain undiagnosed to the 
detriment of the patient, their family, the healthcare system 
and society. We believe that creating fact and evidence-based 
awareness of these conditions is key to enabling proper 
diagnosis and treatment.
We aim to share our expertise and provide balanced, 
reliable and scientifi cally sound information to help improve 
understanding and appreciation of diffi cult and life-altering 
conditions. We do this in a variety of ways, for example by 
sponsoring new research and conducting educational 
workshops with doctors, patients and policy makers. 
We also seek to ensure responsible use of our products, 
particularly among ADHD patients, through the convening 
of a coalition of medical, mental health, higher education, 
student and industry experts working together to help 
prevent misuse, abuse and diversion of ADHD prescription 
stimulant medication. 
Transparency
Transparency relates to many aspects of our business, and 
in 2014 we made good progress in improving transparency 
particularly in the area of clinical trials. In 2014 we launched 
shiretrials.com which provides patients, physicians and 
researchers a single portal to access information on Shire’s 
trials – current and past. 
We also publish details regularly about our educational 
grants as well as donations made to patient groups and 
charitable organizations.
In 2014, Shire ranked in the top 25 of 60 companies in the 
UK evaluated by Transparency International for transparency 
in corporate reporting which ranked companies based 
on their publication of anti-bribery and corruption efforts, 
disclosure of subsidiaries/operations and disclosure of 
fi nancial data on foreign operations.

Other areas of focus
Diversity
Our success continues to be driven by our diverse employee 
talent around the world. We value all genders, ages, cultures, 
experiences and backgrounds as we build and grow our 
global organization. Shire is an equal opportunity employer 
and strives to ensure that there is no discrimination against 
anyone applying for a job or in employment for reasons 
related to race, religion, national origin, gender, disability, 
sexual orientation or any other personal characteristic.
We do not have diversity targets or quotas and we do not 
focus exclusively on one group of employees over and above 
any other group of employees. However, we do focus very 
strongly on fostering a culture which aims to provide all our 
employees with a supportive work environment that values 
diverse opinions and experiences, and enables individual, 
group and organizational success.
Having a diverse workforce is only half the equation – the 
benefi t to our employees, our patients, our business, and 
society comes from the respect, consideration and inclusion 
of these different views into our work every day. Our growing 
global reach gives us the opportunity to bring to our 
business, and for the benefi t of our patients, greater depth 
of experiences and capabilities. Beyond our immediate 
workforce, we also have a Supplier Diversity Program in 
place in the US which provides opportunities for minority 
or disabled and veteran-owned businesses. More than 
11.2% of Shire’s total 2014 US spend was in support of 
these businesses.
In all our hiring and employment practices, we are committed 
to ensuring we do not discriminate against individuals who 
have a disability. We further assert our commitment to fair 
treatment and reasonable accommodation of applicants’ or 
employees’ disabilities in accordance with all applicable laws 
in the respective locations of all Shire facilities.

Our people
As of December 31, 2014, Shire employed more than 5,000 
talented people with offi ces in 34 countries. We promote 
the best use of our people on the basis of individual skills 
and experience matched against those required for the work 
to be performed, and actively seek out a diversity of views 
and experiences.
We believe we are better able to achieve our goals and 
continuously improve by supporting a strong performance 
culture. While many factors contribute to this, research has 
shown that the most important factor in performance is an 
employee’s relationship with his or her manager. That’s why 
we have devoted considerable resources to help our 
managers be the best they can be. This includes a dedicated 
online resource center for managers, which provides critical 
support, tips and e-learning opportunities. This tool is 
supplemented by face-to-face and group opportunities to 
learn how to manage performance and develop people, for 
which all Shire people managers are accountable. Our pay for 
performance philosophy provides managers with a variety of 
programs to recognize and reward employee contributions, 
and our employee share purchase plans enable employees 
to have a “vested” interest in the success of the business.
Driving performance requires a clear understanding of where 
we are heading, and this happens at every level of the 
business – from the one-on-one performance discussions 
between managers and employees, to the all employee 
meetings held at any of our major sites. Shire communicates 
with all employees via periodic all-company meetings, the 
intranet, all-employee emails from the CEO and other 
executives, a social networking platform, and quarterly 
leadership briefi ngs and cascades.

Our success continues to
be driven by our diverse

inclusion of these different views
into our work every day.

While Shire is a global company, most environmental impacts 
from our facilities are local, so we believe the impacts are 
most effectively addressed locally. We therefore focus on 
local initiatives and setting local goals rather than global goals 
to reduce our impact. These are supported at our major sites 
through our SAVE committees who undertake site-specifi c 
recycling and energy reduction programs. We continuously 
strive to do the right thing and at each of our facilities our 
staff works to identify and implement projects to reduce our 
environmental impacts.
This local approach has proven successful, illustrated by 
Shire’s improved performance in the Carbon Disclosure 
Project’s (CDP) 2014 Climate Change disclosure and 
performance results where Shire achieved its highest 
results to date of 91% and a “B” rating, both above the 
pharmaceutical industry and FTSE averages. The CDP is 
an international, not-for-profi t organization which evaluates 
companies’ environmental performance.
Shire’s reporting of its Greenhouse Gas Emissions (GHG) 
is outlined in the table below.
Responsibility
(continued)
Our planet
Shire is committed to operating a sustainable organization 
that protects our employees, the environment and the 
communities where we conduct our activities. We fi rmly 
believe that effective environmental management is a key 
component in achieving excellent company performance 
and making Shire a world-class organization and responsible 
corporate citizen.
We strive to conserve resources and minimize adverse 
environmental impacts and risks that may be associated 
with our products, facilities and operations. We are committed 
to promoting the sustainable and effi cient use of natural 
resources, waste minimization, recycling, energy effi ciency, 
and responsible product stewardship in our business 
activities. We have implemented key components of a 
health, safety and environmental management system for 
our operations. Our health, safety and environmental team 
continually work to improve this system.

Boundary summary All facilities with emissions greater than 1% of the overall footprint were included in the Scope 1 and 2 
reporting of emissions from natural gas and electricity. All global fleet fuel usage is included. Emissions from 
diesel/fuel oil generators are less than 1% of total footprint and are excluded. Scope 3 includes business 
air travel and business vehicle travel which are significant enough to warrant inclusion in our annual report 
though not required by law. The baseline year emissions were updated to 2014, due to a change in 
operational control of several locations, which resulted in a material impact.

Human Rights
We support the UN Universal Declaration of Human Rights 
(www.un.org/en/documents/udhr/) and recognize the 
obligation to promote universal respect for and observance 
of human rights and fundamental freedoms for all, without 
distinction to sex, age, race, religion, or any other 
characteristic protected by law.
Of paramount importance, we safeguard the human rights 
of those taking part in our clinical trials, which is primarily 
achieved through the process of informed consent. Shire 
adheres to the International Conference on Harmonization 
(ICH) Good Clinical Practice (GCP) Guidelines.
We are committed to the protection of the human rights of our 
employees in our offi ces and manufacturing facilities around 
the world. We recognize that commercial success depends 
on the full commitment of all our employees and commit to 
respecting their human rights, to provide them with safe and 
favorable working conditions that are free from unnecessary 
risk and to maintain fair and competitive terms and conditions 
of service at all times.
We seek to comply fully with all relevant laws, rules and 
regulations governing labor, employment and the employment 
relationship in all of the countries where Shire does business.
We commit to the principles articulated in the International 
Labor Organization’s (ILO) “Declaration on Fundamental 
Principles and Rights at Work” which includes the following 
four major principles: (1) Freedom of association and the 
effective recognition of the right to collective bargaining; (2) 
Elimination of all forms of forced or compulsory labor; (3) 
Abolition of child labor and; (4) Elimination of employment 
discrimination. We also commit to the protection of human 
rights of our partners and suppliers, and in turn, expect them 
to do the same in their operations and to their employees 
around the world. We do this through a regular and 
systematic audit of our suppliers, and our Responsible Supply 
Chain policy explicitly states our expectations of suppliers to 
uphold the ILO principles. This policy can be found on our 
website, www.shire.com.
Organizing for greatest effect
We have more than a dozen internal responsibility leaders 
who serve as “sponsors” for focus areas such as the 
environment, our people and the community. The sponsors 
are responsible for setting goals which support our overall 
strategy, ensuring progress and maintaining high standards. 
They include senior representatives from Legal, Research 
& Development, Human Resources, Technical Operations, 
Environment, Health & Safety, Compliance and Risk 
Management, Facilities, Corporate Communications, Patient 
Advocacy and Public Affairs. Our Responsibility team 
facilitates the activities of Responsibility working groups, 
oversees communications and works with sponsors to 
identify risks and opportunities. Our approach to responsibility 
is championed by our CEO, supported by the Executive, 
In-line and Pipeline Committees and endorsed by our Board.
Staying close to our stakeholders
We recognize the importance of seeking external input from 
key stakeholders such as patients, physicians and others to 
understand what is most important to them, and regularly 
consult and engage with them on these important areas. 
During the year we engaged with investors, patient groups 
and policy makers on a range of issues including our 
environmental approaches and disclosure, our approach 
to clinical trials, our role in ensuring the appropriate use of 
our ADHD products, philanthropy and access to medicines. 
In 2014 we concluded a materiality assessment of Shire’s 
Responsibility areas.
Sharing and improving
We communicate widely and regularly on responsibility 
with all our stakeholders through our bi-annual publication 
Responsibility Matters, our intranet and on our website, 
shire.com. We’re always interested to hear feedback 
and suggestions on how we can be an even more 
responsible organization.

Risk management framework 
As a highly regulated biopharmaceutical company with a keen 
patient focus, Shire has implemented policies and procedures 
intended to reduce risk and to ensure appropriate and lawful 
conduct, including with respect to product development, 
manufacturing, marketing and distribution operations within 
the increasing number of countries in which the Company 
operates. Success in these areas is of benefi t to shareholders 
and other stakeholders alike. Shire’s risk management 
strategy is to identify, assess and mitigate any signifi cant 
risks that it faces. Despite this, it should be noted that no 
risk management strategy can provide absolute assurance 
against loss.
Board of Directors: The Board is responsible for determining 
the Group’s risk tolerance and for ensuring the maintenance 
of a sound system of internal control and risk management. 
In fulfi lling this responsibility, the Board sets Shire’s corporate 
risk culture; ensuring its dissemination throughout the 
organisation. This is achieved through interaction with key 
stakeholders which, in turn, enables the Board to monitor 
the Group’s risks as well as its risk management and internal 
control systems; contributing to its annual review of their 
effectiveness. Stakeholders to the risk framework, which is 
overseen by the Board and designed to manage and mitigate 
the Group’s risks, include:
 > Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee: The Committee 
supports the Board by, on a biannual basis, reviewing and 
reporting on the principal risks faced by the Company. These 
risks are assessed on their likelihood of materialisation and 
potential impact and include those that would threaten the 
Company’s business model, future performance, solvency 
or liquidity. Moreover, alongside the Board the Committee 
monitors and reviews the risk management and internal 
control systems; ensuring oversight through its interaction 
with functional stakeholders, through its review and challenge 
of key risk and control processes and through its evaluation 
of key strategy updates from management.
 > Executive Committee: The Committee is responsible for 
ensuring the implementation of the risk management and 
internal control infrastructure; overseeing its operation and 
ensuring it remains effective. Committee members receive 
regular updates from functional stakeholders and, along 
with the Chief Compliance and Risk Ofﬁ cer and the Head 
of Internal Audit, are responsible for elevating matters to the 
Board and Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee as required. 
In addition, on a biannual basis the Committee validates any 
signiﬁ cant risks put forward by the Risk Council; identifying 
and putting forward for review by the Audit, Compliance & 
Risk Committee those that have the capacity to materially 
impact the Group’s strategy.
 > Risk Council: The Risk Council comprises senior members 
of the Company’s business units and corporate functions, 
including the Head of Internal Audit, and is chaired by the 
Chief Compliance and Risk Ofﬁ cer. The Council is charged 
with overseeing risk management at an operational level; 
ensuring that each identiﬁ ed risk is allocated an “owner” 
within the business who is responsible for related 
management and mitigation activities. As part of the biannual 
risk review process the Council appraises risk schedules 
produced by individual business units and corporate

functions; validating and revising assessments made and 
evaluating mitigation practices. A report is prepared for review 
by the Executive Committee detailing all risks meeting 
a prescribed threshold along with recommendations on 
their mitigation. The Chief Compliance and Risk Ofﬁ cer then 
presents these matters to the Audit, Compliance & Risk 
Committee; highlighting those risks of strategic importance 
to the Company.
 > Global Compliance and Risk Management Department: 
The Department, led by the Chief Compliance and Risk 
Ofﬁ cer, is made up of compliance, privacy, corporate security 
and risk management, and Health, Safety & Environment 
sub-teams. It is responsible for supporting the development, 
implementation and maintenance of effective compliance and 
risk management systems. This is achieved through policy 
development, the delivery of training programs and 
communications, and through ongoing monitoring of 
compliance and risk-assessed activity, with follow-up 
investigation undertaken where necessary. Such activity 
provides for the timely undertaking of mitigation and/or 
remediation actions, as well for the escalation of matters to 
the Audit, Compliance & Risk (“ACR”) Committee and to the 
Board as appropriate. In addition, the Chief Compliance and 
Risk Ofﬁ cer provides regular updates to the ACR Committee 
on all matters falling with the Department’s remit.
 > Chief Compliance and Risk Ofﬁ cer: The Chief 
Compliance and Risk Ofﬁ cer is responsible for the global 
compliance program and for coordinating oversight of risk 
mitigation activity through the Enterprise Risk Management 
process. In addition to maintaining relationships with 
assurance functions outside of the Global Compliance and 
Risk Management Department, the Chief Compliance and 
Risk Ofﬁ cer has direct access to the Board and the Audit, 
Compliance & Risk (“ACR”) Committee; providing an 
independent mechanism of escalation, should the need arise. 
The Chief Compliance and Risk Ofﬁ cer provides twice-yearly 
updates to the ACR Committee in respect of risk and risk 
mitigation review, as well as ongoing compliance monitoring 
and investigation.
 > Internal Audit: The Internal Audit function provides 
independent assurance to the Audit, Compliance & Risk 
Committee with respect to the operation of the internal 
control and risk management systems.
 > Business units and corporate functions: Business units 
and corporate functions are responsible for implementing risk 
management processes and establishing internal controls 
within their respective organizations in accordance with a 
centrally approved framework. In addition, each produces 
a schedule of material risks and associated mitigation plans 
as part of the Group’s biannual review process for submission 
to the Risk Council.
Risk factors
Set out below are the key risk factors associated with the 
business that have been identifi ed through the Company’s 
approach to risk management. Some of these risk factors are 
specifi c to the Company and others are more generally 
applicable to the pharmaceutical industry or specifi c markets 
in which the Company operates. The Company believes that 
these risk factors apply equally and therefore all should be 
carefully considered before any investment is made in Shire.
Risk factors related to the Company’s business
The Company’s products may not be 
a commercial success
The commercial success of the Company’s marketed 
products and other new products that the Company may 
launch in the future, will depend on their approval and 
acceptance by physicians, patients and other key decision-
makers, as well as the receipt of marketing approvals in 
different countries, the time taken to obtain such approvals, 
the scope of marketing approvals as refl ected in the product 
labels, approval of reimbursement at commercially 
sustainable prices in those countries where price and 
reimbursement is negotiated, and safety, effi cacy, 
convenience and cost-effectiveness of the product 
as compared to competitive products.
The Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition or results of 
operations may be adversely affected if any or all of the 
following occur:
 > if the Company’s products, or competitive products, 
are genericized;
 > if the prices of the Company’s products suffer forced 
reductions or if prices of competitor products are reduced 
signiﬁ cantly;
 > if there are unanticipated adverse events experienced with 
the Company’s products or those of a competitor’s product 
not seen in clinical trials that impact physicians’ willingness 
to prescribe the Company’s products;
 > if issues arise from clinical trials being conducted for post-
marketing purposes or for registration in another country 
which raise questions or concerns about a product;
 > if the regulatory agencies in one country act in a way that 
raises concerns for regulatory agencies or for prescribers 
or patients in another country;
 > if patients, payers or physicians favor other treatments over 
the Company’s products;
 > if the Company’s products are subject to more stringent 
government regulation than competitor products;
 > if patent protection or other forms of exclusivity are lost 
or curtailed, or if competitors are able to successfully 
challenge or circumvent the Company’s patents or other 
forms of exclusivity (see Note 19, “Commitments and 
Contingencies, Legal and other proceedings” to the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements);

Factors which could cause further or more rapid decline in 
ADDERALL XR and INTUNIV product sales include:
 > generic or authorized generic versions of these products 
capture more of Shire’s branded market share than expected;
 > the FDA approves additional ANDAs for generic versions of 
these products which, if launched, further reduce branded 
market share or impact the amount of Shire’s authorized 
generic product sales;
 > the production of branded ADDERALL XR is disrupted by 
difﬁ culties in obtaining a sufﬁ cient supply of amphetamine 
salts including, but not limited to, an inability to obtain 
sufﬁ cient quota from the DEA;
 > there are changes in reimbursement policies of third-party 
payers; or
 > there are changes to the level of sales deductions for 
branded ADDERALL XR or branded INTUNIV for private 
or public payers.
The failure to obtain and maintain reimbursement, or an 
adequate level of reimbursement, by third-party payers 
in a timely manner for the Company’s products may 
affect future revenues, financial condition and results 
of operations.
The Company’s revenues are partly dependent on the level 
of reimbursement provided to the Company by governmental 
reimbursement schemes for its products. Changes to 
governmental policy or practices could adversely affect 
the Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition and results 
of operations. In addition, the reimbursement of treatments 
by health care providers, private health insurers and other 
organizations, such as health maintenance organizations 
and managed care organizations is under downward pressure 
and this, in turn, could adversely impact the prices at which 
the Company can sell its products. Factors affecting the 
Company’s ability to obtain and maintain adequate 
reimbursement for its products include:
 > higher levels of controls on the use of the Company’s 
products and/or requirements for additional price 
concessions mandated or negotiated by managed health 
care organizations or government authorities;
 > legislative proposals to reform health care and government 
insurance programs in many of the Company’s markets; and
 > price controls, unsuccessful government tenders, or 
non-reimbursement of new medicines or new indications.
The cost of treatment for some of the Company’s products 
is high, particularly those which are used for the treatment 
of rare diseases. The Company may encounter diffi culty 
in obtaining or maintaining satisfactory pricing and 
reimbursement for such products. The failure to obtain and 
maintain pricing and reimbursement at satisfactory levels for 
its products may adversely affect the Company’s revenues, 
fi nancial condition or results of operations.
Principal risks and uncertainties
(continued)
 > if launches of the Company’s products in new markets are 
not successful;
 > if the sizes of the patient populations for the Company’s 
products are less than expected;
 > if there are lawsuits ﬁ led against Shire, including but not 
limited to, product liability claims, consumer law claims, 
and payer or reimbursement litigation; or
 > if the Company is unable to commercialize its products 
successfully, there may be a material adverse effect on 
the Company’s revenues, ﬁ nancial condition or results 
of operations.
Product sales from ADDERALL XR and INTUNIV are 
subject to generic competition.
During 2012 the FDA clarifi ed the regulatory pathway 
required for approval of generic versions of ADDERALL XR. 
Consequently in June 2012 and February 2013, Actavis and 
Teva, respectively, received approval to launch their own 
generic versions of ADDERALL XR. Shire currently sells 
authorized generic versions of ADDERALL XR to Teva and 
also continues to sell the branded version of ADDERALL XR. 
Actavis makes and markets its own generic versions of 
ADDERALL XR.
In 2013, Shire settled a number of patent lawsuits in the 
United States against certain companies that had fi led for 
approval of their generic versions of INTUNIV . Under the 
terms of the settlements, Actavis was granted a license to 
make and market Actavis’ generic versions of INTUNIV in the 
United States on December 1, 2014. All other parties with 
whom Shire has settled will be able to enter the market with 
their respective ANDA-approved products after Actavis’ 180 
day exclusivity period has expired.
Product sales from INTUNIV have declined as a result of the 
December 2014 launch of Actavis’ generic versions of 
INTUNIV and are expected to decline further following the 
anticipated launches of generic versions of INTUNIV by other 
companies after Actavis’ 180 day exclusivity period expires. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 35
The Company conducts its own manufacturing 
operations for certain of its products and is reliant on 
third party contract manufacturers to manufacture other 
products and to provide goods and services. Some of the 
Company’s products or ingredients are only available 
from a single approved source for manufacture. Any 
disruption to the supply chain for any of the Company’s 
products may result in the Company being unable to 
continue marketing or developing a product or may result 
in the Company being unable to do so on a commercially 
viable basis for some period of time.
Although the Company dual-sources certain key products and/
or active ingredients, the Company currently relies on a single 
source for production of the fi nal drug product for each of 
ADDERALL XR, CINRYZE, FIRAZYR, FOSRENOL
®
, INTUNIV , 
LIALDA and PENTASA, the Company currently relies on 
a single active ingredient source for each of ELAPRASE, 
FIRAZYR, FOSRENOL, INTUNIV and REPLAGAL and also 
relies on limited third party sources to provide the donated 
human plasma necessary for the manufacture of CINRYZE. 
Following the completion of the acquisition of NPS Pharma 
in the fi rst quarter of 2015, Shire has acquired GATTEX
®
/
REVESTIVE
®
, which currently relies on a single active ingredient 
source and NATPARA
®
/NATPAR
®
, which currently relies on 
a single source for both production of the fi nal drug product 
and supply of the active ingredient.
The Company may experience supply failures or delays 
beyond its control if it does not, or if any of its third party 
manufacturers do not, supply the Company on time with the 
required volumes, or supply products that do not meet 
regulatory requirements. Any such supply failures could lead 
to signifi cant delays, increase in operating costs, lost product 
sales, an interruption of research activities, or the delay of new 
product launches, all of which could have a material adverse 
effect on the Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition or results 
of operations.
The Company has also entered into many agreements with 
third parties for the provision of goods and services to enable 
it to manufacture its products. If these third parties are unable 
to manufacture products, or provide these goods and services, 
in each case in accordance with its respective contractual 
obligations, the Company’s ability to manage its manufacturing 
processes or to operate its business, including to continue the 
development or commercialization of its products as planned 
or on a commercial basis, may be adversely impacted.
The manufacture of the Company’s products is subject 
to extensive oversight by various regulatory agencies. 
Regulatory approvals or interventions associated with 
changes to manufacturing sites, ingredients or 
manufacturing processes could lead to significant 
delays, an increase in operating costs, lost product 
sales, an interruption of research activities or the delay 
of new product launches.
Pharmaceutical and device manufacturing sites must be 
inspected and approved by regulatory agencies such as 
the FDA, and similar agencies in other countries. Active 
ingredients, excipients and packaging materials used in 
the manufacturing process must be obtained from sources 
approved by regulatory agencies.
The development, approval and manufacturing of the 
Company’s products depend on the ability to procure 
ingredients and packaging materials from approved sources 
and for the manufacturing process to be conducted at 
approved sites. Changes of manufacturer or changes of 
source of ingredients or packaging materials must generally 
be approved by the regulatory agencies, which will involve 
testing and additional inspections to ensure compliance with 
the applicable regulatory agency’s regulations and standards. 
The need to qualify a new manufacturer or source of 
ingredients or packaging materials can take a signifi cant 
amount of time. Should it become necessary to change 
a manufacturer or supplier of ingredients or packaging 
materials, or to qualify an additional supplier, the Company 
may not be able do so quickly, or at all, which could delay 
or disrupt the manufacturing process.
US-based manufacturers must be registered with the DEA 
and similar regulatory authorities in other countries if they 
handle controlled substances. Certain of the Company’s 
products, including ADDERALL XR and VYVANSE, contain 
ingredients which are controlled substances subject to 
quotas managed by the DEA. As a result, the Company’s 
procurement and production quotas may not be suffi cient 
to meet commercial demand.
CINRYZE, ELAPRASE, REPLAGAL and VPRIV are 
manufactured using highly complex biological processes. 
The complexity of the manufacturing results in a number 
of risks, including the risk of microbial contamination. 
Additionally, CINRYZE is derived from human plasma, and 
is therefore subject to the risk of biological contamination 
inherent in plasma-derived products. The sole manufacturer 
of CINRYZE has received observations on Form 483 and a 
warning letter from the FDA identifying issues with respect 
to the manufacturing process for CINRYZE which must be 
addressed to the satisfaction of the FDA. Any regulatory 
interventions, in relation to these, or any other issues, if 
they occur, may delay or disrupt the manufacture of the 
Company’s products.
The failure to obtain regulatory approvals promptly or at 
all and/or regulatory interventions associated with changes to 
manufacturing sites, ingredients or manufacturing processes 
could lead to signifi cant delays, an increase in operating 
costs, lost product sales, an interruption of research activities, 
the delay of new product launches or constraints on 
manufacturing output, all of which could have a material 
adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition 
and results of operations.

The actions of certain customers could affect the 
Company’s ability to sell or market products profitably. 
Fluctuations in buying or distribution patterns by such 
customers can adversely affect the Company’s 
revenues, financial conditions or results of operations
A considerable portion of the Company’s product sales are 
made to major pharmaceutical wholesale distributors, as well 
as to large pharmacies, in both the US and Europe. In 2014, 
for example, 47% of the Company’s product sales were 
attributable to three customers in the US: McKesson Corp., 
Cardinal Health, Inc and AmerisourceBergen Drug Corp. In 
the event of fi nancial failure of any of these customers there 
could be a material adverse effect on the Company’s 
revenues, fi nancial condition or results of operations. The 
Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition or results of 
operations may also be affected by fl uctuations in customer 
buying or distribution patterns. These fl uctuations may result 
from seasonality, pricing, wholesaler inventory objectives, or 
other factors. A signifi cant portion of the Company’s revenues 
for certain products for treatment of rare diseases are 
concentrated within a small number of customers. Changes 
in the buying patterns of those customers may have an 
adverse effect on the Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition 
or results of operations.
Investigations or enforcement action by regulatory 
authorities or law enforcement agencies relating to the 
Company’s activities in the highly regulated markets in 
which it operates may result in significant legal costs 
and the payment of substantial compensation or fines.
The Company engages in various marketing, promotional 
and educational activities pertaining to, as well as the sale of, 
pharmaceutical products and medical devices in a number of 
jurisdictions around the world. The promotion, marketing and 
sale of pharmaceutical products and medical devices is highly 
regulated and the operations of market participants, such as 
the Company, are closely supervised by regulatory authorities 
and law enforcement agencies, including the US Department 
of HHS, the FDA, the US Department of Justice, the SEC 
and the DEA. These authorities and agencies and their 
equivalents in countries outside the US have broad authority 
to investigate market participants for potential violations 
of laws relating to the sale, marketing and promotion of 
pharmaceutical products and medical devices, including the 
False Claims Act, the Anti-Kickback Statute and the Foreign 
Corrupt Practices Act, among others, for alleged improper 
conduct, including corrupt payments to government offi cials, 
improper payments to medical professionals, off-label 
marketing of pharmaceutical products and medical devices, 
and the submission of false claims for reimbursement by 
the federal government. Healthcare companies may also 
be subject to enforcement actions or prosecution for such 
improper conduct. Any inquiries or investigations into the 
operations of, or enforcement or other regulatory action 
against, the Company by such authorities could result in 
signifi cant defense costs, fi nes, penalties and injunctive 
or administrative remedies, distract management to the 
detriment of the business, result in the exclusion of certain 
products, or the Company, from government reimbursement 
programs or subject the Company to regulatory controls or 
government monitoring of its activities in the future. The
Principal risks and uncertainties
(continued)
The Company has a portfolio of products in various 
stages of research and development. The successful 
development of these products is highly uncertain and 
requires significant expenditures and time, and there 
is no guarantee that these products will receive 
regulatory approval.
Products that initially appear promising in research or 
development may be delayed or fail to reach later stages 
of development as:
 > preclinical or clinical tests may show the product to lack 
safety or efﬁ cacy;
 > delays may be caused by slow enrollment in clinical studies; 
regulatory requirements for clinical trial drug supplies; 
extended length of time to achieve study endpoints; 
additional time requirements for data analysis or dossier 
preparation; time required for discussions with regulatory 
agencies, including regulatory agency requests for additional 
preclinical or clinical data; delays at regulatory agencies due 
to stafﬁ ng or resource limitations; analysis of or changes to 
study design; unexpected safety, efﬁ cacy, or manufacturing 
issues; delays may arise from shared control with 
collaborative partners in the planning and execution of the 
product development, scaling of the manufacturing process, 
or getting approval for manufacturing;
 > manufacturing issues, pricing or reimbursement issues, or 
other factors may render the product economically unviable;
 > the proprietary rights of others and their competing products 
and technologies may prevent the product from being 
developed or commercialized; or
 > submission of an application for regulatory approval of any 
of the Company’s product candidates may be subjected 
to lengthy review and ultimately rejected.
Success in preclinical and early clinical trials does not ensure 
that late stage clinical trials will be successful. Clinical results 
are frequently susceptible to varying interpretations that may 
delay, limit, or prevent regulatory approvals. The length of 
time necessary to complete clinical trials and to submit an 
application for marketing approval for a fi nal decision by a 
regulatory authority varies signifi cantly and may be diffi cult 
to predict. Moreover, once an application is submitted, 
additional data may be sought by regulators or an application 
may be rejected. If the Company’s large-scale or late-stage 
clinical trials for a product are not successful, the Company 
will not recover its substantial investments in that product. 
The Company has a range of programs in late stage clinical 
development. For example, in Phase 3, SHP606 is being 
developed for the treatment of DED and SHP465 is being 
developed for the treatment of ADHD in adults. 
In addition, even if the products receive regulatory approval, 
they remain subject to ongoing regulatory requirements, 
including, for example, obligations to conduct additional 
clinical trials or other non-clinical testing, changes to the 
product label (which could impact its marketability and 
prospects for commercial success), new or revised 
requirements for manufacturing, written notifi cations 
to physicians, or product recalls or withdrawals. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 37
Company is subject to certain ongoing investigations by 
governmental agencies. For further information, see Note 19, 
“Commitments and Contingencies, Legal and other 
proceedings” to the consolidated fi nancial statements.
Adverse outcomes in legal matters and other disputes, 
including Shire’s ability to enforce and defend patents 
and other intellectual property rights required for its 
business, could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, financial condition or results 
of operations.
During the ordinary course of its business the Company may 
be involved in claims, disputes and litigation with third parties, 
employees, regulatory agencies, governmental authorities 
and other parties. The range of matters of a legal nature that 
might arise is extremely broad but could include, without 
limitation, intellectual property claims and disputes, product 
liability claims and disputes, regulatory litigation, contract 
claims and disputes, employment claims and disputes, 
and tax or other governmental agency audits and disputes.
Any unfavorable outcome in such matters could adversely 
impact the Company’s ability to develop or commercialize 
its products, adversely affect the profi tability of existing 
products, subject the Company to signifi cant defense costs, 
fi nes, penalties, audit fi ndings and injunctive or administrative 
remedies, distract management to the detriment of the 
business, result in the exclusion of certain products, or the 
Company, from government reimbursement programs or 
subject the Company to regulatory controls or government 
monitoring of its activities in the future. Any such outcomes 
could have a material adverse effect on the Company’s 
revenue, fi nancial condition or results of operations. For 
further information see Note 19, “Commitments and 
Contingencies, Legal and other proceedings” to the 
consolidated fi nancial statements.
The Company faces intense competition for highly 
qualified personnel from other companies and 
organizations. The Company is undergoing a corporate 
reorganization and was the subject of an unsuccessful 
acquisition proposal and the consequent uncertainty 
could adversely affect the Company’s ability to attract 
and/or retain the highly skilled personnel needed for 
the Company to meet its strategic objectives.
The Company relies on recruiting and retaining highly skilled 
employees to meet its strategic objectives. The Company 
faces intense competition for highly qualifi ed personnel and 
the supply of people with the requisite skills may be limited, 
generally or geographically. The range of skills required and 
the geographies in which they are required by the Company 
may also change over time as Shire’s business evolves. 
The Company’s ongoing One Shire reorganization, which 
aims to simplify the Company’s organizational structure 
and streamline operations through two principal locations, 
Massachusetts and Switzerland, involves changes to, 
and geographic relocation of, certain skilled roles. The 
unsuccessful proposed acquisition of the Company by 
AbbVie in 2014 created uncertainty in the employee 
population which could lead to further loss of certain skilled 
employees. If the Company is unable to retain key personnel 
or attract new personnel with the requisite skills and
experience, it could adversely affect the implementation of 
the Company’s strategic objectives and ultimately adversely 
impact the Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition or results 
of operations.
Failure to achieve the Company’s strategic objectives 
with respect to the acquisition of NPS Pharma may 
adversely affect the Company’s financial condition 
and results of operations.
On February 21, 2015, Shire completed the acquisition of 
NPS Pharma for a total cash consideration of approximately 
$5.2 billion. 
The acquisition entails various risks, which, if they materialize, 
may adversely impact Shire’s revenues, fi nancial condition or 
results of operations.
These risks include but are not limited to:
 > failure to achieve the targeted growth and expected beneﬁ ts 
of the acquisition if sales of NPS Pharma products, including 
GATTEX/REVESTIVE, are lower than anticipated;
 > failure to successfully commercialize NPS Pharma’s 
compound NATPARA/NATPAR in the US or to obtain 
regulatory approval in the EU;
 > difﬁ culties in integrating NPS Pharma into Shire may lead to 
the combined company not being able to realize the 
expected operating efﬁ ciencies, cost savings, revenue 
enhancements, synergies or other beneﬁ ts in the timeframe 
anticipated, or at all;
 > undiscovered or unanticipated risks and liabilities, including 
legal and compliance related liabilities, may emerge after 
closing the acquisition or may be higher than anticipated;
 > the Company may be unable to retain key NPS Pharma 
personnel;
 > the Company may not be able to retain the existing 
customers, suppliers and other business partners of NPS 
Pharma or attract new customers; and
 > the business of NPS Pharma may be otherwise disrupted 
by the acquisition, including increased costs and diversion 
of management time and resources.
Any failure to achieve the Company’s strategic objectives with 
respect to the NPS Pharma acquisition could result in slower 
growth, higher than expected costs, the recording of asset 
impairment charges and other actions which could adversely 
affect the Company’s business, fi nancial condition and results 
of operations.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 38 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
The failure of a strategic partner to develop and 
commercialize products could result in delays in 
development, approval or loss of revenue.
The Company enters into strategic partnerships with 
other companies in areas such as product development, 
manufacturing, sales and marketing. In these partnerships, 
the Company is sometimes dependent on its partner to 
deliver results. While these partnerships are governed by 
contracts, the Company may not exercise direct control. 
If a partner fails to perform or experiences fi nancial 
diffi culties, the Company may suffer a delay in the 
development, a delay in the approval or a reduction 
in sales, or royalties of a product.
The failure to secure new products or compounds for 
development either through in-licensing, acquisition 
or internal research and development efforts, or the 
failure to realize expected benefits from acquisitions 
of businesses or products, may have an adverse impact 
on the Company’s future results.
The Company’s future results will depend, to a signifi cant 
extent, upon its ability to develop, in-license or acquire new 
products or compounds, or to acquire other businesses. The 
expected benefi ts from acquired products, compounds or 
businesses may not be realized or may require signifi cantly 
greater resources and expenditure than originally anticipated. 
The failure to realize expected benefi ts from acquisitions of 
businesses or products including those resulting from 
integration into the Company, or the failure to develop, 
in-license or acquire new products or compounds on a 
commercially viable basis, could have a material adverse 
effect on the Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition or 
results of operations.
The Company may fail to obtain, maintain, enforce or 
defend the intellectual property rights required to 
conduct its business.
The Company’s success depends upon its ability and the 
ability of its partners and licensors to protect their intellectual 
property rights. Where possible, the Company’s strategy is 
to register intellectual property rights, such as patents and 
trademarks. The Company also relies on various trade 
secrets, unpatented know-how and technological innovations 
and contractual arrangements with third parties to maintain 
its competitive position. The failure to obtain, maintain, 
enforce or defend such intellectual property rights, for any 
reason, could allow third parties to make competing products 
or impact the Company’s ability to develop, manufacture 
and market its own products on a commercially viable 
basis, or at all, which could have a material adverse effect 
on the Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition or results 
of operations.
Principal risks and uncertainties
(continued)
General risk factors related to the Company and to the 
healthcare industry
The actions of governments, industry regulators and the 
economic environments in which the Company operates 
may adversely affect its ability to develop and profitably 
market its products.
The healthcare industry is heavily regulated. Changes to laws 
or regulations impacting the healthcare industry, in any 
country in which the Company conducts its business, may 
adversely impact the Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition 
or results of operations. For example, changes to the 
regulations relating to the exclusivity periods available for the 
Company’s products may allow for the earlier entry of generic 
or biosimilar competitor products.
A slowdown of global economic growth, or economic 
instability of countries in which the Company does 
business, could have negative consequences for the 
Company’s business and increase the risk of non-
payment by the Company’s customers.
Growth of the global pharmaceutical market has become 
increasingly tied to global economic growth. Accordingly 
a substantial and lasting slowdown of the global economy, 
or major national economies, could negatively affect growth 
in the markets in which the Company operates. Such a 
slowdown, or any resultant austerity measures adopted by 
governments in response to a slowdown, could result in 
national governments making signifi cant cuts to their public 
spending, including national healthcare budgets, or reducing 
the level of reimbursement they are willing and able to provide 
to the Company for its products and, as a result, adversely 
affect the Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition or results 
of operations.
A slowdown of a nation’s economy could also lead to 
fi nancial diffi culties for some of the Company’s signifi cant 
customers, including national governments, and result in 
a greater risk of delayed payments, defaults or non-payments 
of outstanding payment obligations by the Company’s 
customers in that country, which could adversely affect 
the Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition or results 
of operations.
The Company is subject to evolving and complex tax 
laws, which may result in additional liabilities that may 
adversely affect the Company’s financial condition or 
results of operations.
The Company is subject to evolving and complex tax laws in 
the jurisdictions in which it operates, and routinely obtains 
advice on matters, including the tax treatment of the break 
fee received in connection with AbbVie’s terminated offer for 
Shire in the current accounting period. Signifi cant judgment is 
required in determining the Company’s tax liabilities, and the 
Company’s tax returns are periodically examined by various 
tax authorities. The Company regularly assesses the 
likelihood of outcomes resulting from these examinations to 
determine the adequacy of its accrual for tax contingencies; 
however, due to the complexity of tax contingencies, the 
ultimate resolution of any tax matters may result in payments 
greater or less than amounts accrued. In addition, the 
Company may be affected by changes in tax laws, including 
tax rate changes, new tax laws, and revised tax law 
interpretations in domestic and foreign jurisdictions. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 39
The Company intends to enforce its patent rights vigorously 
and believes that its commercial partners, licensors and third 
party manufacturers intend to enforce vigorously those patent 
rights they have licensed to the Company. However, the 
Company’s patent rights, and patent rights that the Company 
has licensed, may not provide valid patent protection 
suffi ciently broad to prevent any third party from developing, 
using or commercializing products that are similar or 
functionally equivalent to the Company’s products or 
technologies. These patent rights may be challenged, 
revoked, invalidated, infringed or circumvented by third 
parties. Laws relating to such rights may in future also be 
changed or withdrawn.
Additionally, the Company’s products, or the technologies or 
processes used to formulate or manufacture those products 
may now, or in the future, infringe the patent rights of third 
parties. It is also possible that third parties will obtain patent 
or other proprietary rights that might be necessary or useful 
for the development, manufacture or sale of the Company’s 
products. The Company may need to obtain licenses for 
intellectual property rights from others and may not be able 
to obtain these licenses on commercially reasonable terms, 
if at all.
The Company also relies on trade secrets and other un-
patented proprietary information, which it generally seeks to 
protect by confi dentiality and nondisclosure agreements with 
its employees, consultants, advisors and partners. These 
agreements may not effectively prevent disclosure of 
confi dential information and may not provide the Company 
with an adequate remedy in the event of unauthorized 
disclosure. In addition, if the Company’s employees, scientifi c 
consultants or partners develop inventions or processes that 
may be applicable to the Company’s products under 
development, such inventions and processes will not 
necessarily become the Company’s property, but may 
remain the property of those persons or their employers.
The Company has fi led applications to register various 
trademarks for use in connection with its products in various 
countries and also, with respect to certain products, relies on 
the trademarks of third parties. These trademarks may not 
afford adequate protection or the Company or the third 
parties may not have the fi nancial resources to enforce their 
rights under these trademarks which may enable others to 
use the trademarks and dilute their value.
In the regular course of business, the Company is party to 
litigation or other proceedings relating to intellectual property 
rights. For details of current intellectual property litigation, see 
Note 19, “Commitments and Contingencies, Legal and other 
proceedings” to the consolidated fi nancial statements.
The introduction of new products by competitors may 
impact future revenues.
The pharmaceutical, biotechnology and device industries are 
highly competitive and are characterized by substantial 
investment in continuous product development and 
technological change. The Company faces signifi cant 
competition from large pharmaceutical and biotechnology 
companies, many of whom have substantially greater 
resources than the Company. In addition, many of the 
Company’s competitors have more products and have 
operated longer in the fi elds in which the Company 
competes. A number of companies are pursuing the 
development of technologies which compete with the 
Company’s existing products or research programs. These 
competitors include specialized pharmaceutical fi rms and 
large pharmaceutical companies acting either independently 
or together with other pharmaceutical companies. 
Furthermore, academic institutions, government agencies and 
other public and private organizations conducting research 
may seek patent protection and may establish collaborative 
arrangements for competitive products or programs. As a 
result of this competition the Company’s products could 
be rendered obsolete or uneconomic or lose market share 
following the development of new products, new methods 
of treatment, or technological advances in manufacturing 
or production by competitors which could adversely affect 
the Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition, and results 
of operations. 
If a marketed product fails to work effectively or causes 
adverse side effects, this could result in damage to the 
Company’s reputation, the withdrawal of the product 
and legal action against the Company.
Unanticipated side effects or unfavorable publicity from 
complaints concerning any of the Company’s products, or 
those of its competitors, could have an adverse effect on the 
Company’s ability to obtain or maintain regulatory approvals 
or successfully market its products. The testing, 
manufacturing, marketing and sales of pharmaceutical 
products and medical devices entails a risk of product liability 
claims, product recalls, litigation and associated adverse 
publicity. The cost of defending against such claims is 
expensive even when the claims are not merited. A successful 
product liability claim against the Company could require 
the Company to pay a substantial monetary award. If, in 
the absence of adequate insurance coverage, the Company 
does not have suffi cient fi nancial resources to satisfy a liability 
resulting from such a claim or to fund the legal defense of 
such a claim, it could become insolvent. Product liability 
insurance coverage is expensive, diffi cult to obtain and 
may not be available in the future on acceptable terms. 
Although the Company carries product liability insurance 
when available, this coverage may not be adequate. In 
addition, it cannot be certain that insurance coverage for 
present or future products will be available. Moreover, an 
adverse judgment in a product liability suit, even if insured 
or eventually overturned on appeal, could generate 
substantial negative publicity about the Company’s 
products and business and inhibit or prevent 
commercialization of other products.

Overview
The Company has grown both organically and through 
acquisition, completing a series of major transactions that 
have brought therapeutic, geographic and pipeline growth 
and diversifi cation. The Company will continue to conduct 
its own research and development, focused on rare diseases, 
as well as evaluate companies, products and pipeline 
opportunities that offer a strategic fi t and have the potential 
to deliver value to all of the Company’s stakeholders: patients, 
physicians, policy makers, payers, investors and employees.
The Company’s purpose is to enable people with life altering 
conditions to lead better lives. The Company will execute on 
its purpose through its strategy and business model. For 
further details of Shire’s strategy and business model, refer 
to pages 10 and 11.
Through deep understanding of patients’ needs, the 
Company is able to:
 > serve patients with high unmet needs in select, commercially 
attractive specialty therapeutic areas;
 > drive optimum performance of its marketed products – to 
serve patients today;
 > build its pipeline of innovative specialist treatments through 
both R&D and Corporate Development activities – to enable 
the Company to serve patients in the future.
Shire’s in-licensing and acquisition efforts are focused on 
products in specialist markets with strong intellectual property 
protection or other forms of market exclusivity and global 
rights. Shire believes that a carefully selected and balanced 
portfolio of products with strategically aligned and relatively 
small-scale sales forces will deliver strong results.
Substantially all of the Company’s revenues, expenditures 
and net assets are attributable to the R&D, manufacture, 
sale and distribution of pharmaceutical products within 
one reportable segment. The Company also earns royalties 
(where Shire has out-licensed products to third parties) 
which are recorded as royalty revenues. 
Jeff Poulton 
Interim Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 43
Revenues are derived primarily from two sources – sales of 
the Company’s own products and royalties: 
 > 97% (2013: 96%) of total revenues are derived from product 
sales; and
 > 3% of total revenues are derived from royalties (2013: 3%). 
The markets in which the Company conducts its business are 
intensely competitive and highly regulated.
The healthcare industry is also experiencing:
 > pressure from governments and healthcare providers to keep 
prices low while increasing access to drugs;
 > increased discount liability due to the population of “baby 
boomers” covered under Medicare, speciﬁ cally those 
beneﬁ ciaries receiving drug cost offset through the Medicare 
Part D Coverage Gap (the “Donut Hole”);
 > increasing challenges from third party payers for products 
to have demonstrable clinical beneﬁ t, with pricing and 
reimbursement approval becoming increasingly linked to 
a product’s clinical effectiveness and impact on overall 
costs of patient care; 
 > increased R&D costs, because development programs 
are typically larger and take longer to get approval from 
regulators; 
 > challenges to existing patents from generic manufacturers;
 > governments and healthcare systems favoring earlier entry 
of low cost generic drugs; and
 > higher marketing costs, due to increased competition 
for market share.
Shire’s strategy has been developed to address these 
industry-wide competitive pressures. This strategy has 
resulted in a series of initiatives in the following areas:
Markets
Shire’s current portfolio of approved products focuses on the 
following markets: Rare Diseases, Neuroscience, and GI and 
Internal Medicine. Shire also has a number of marketed 
products for other therapeutic areas from which it generates 
product revenues or royalties from third parties. In 2014 Shire 
derived 40% of product sales from Rare Diseases products, 
31% from Neuroscience products and 29% from GI and 
Internal Medicine products. Shire’s early stage research is 
primarily focused on rare diseases.
Shire has grown in part through acquisition which has brought 
therapeutic, geographic and pipeline growth and 
diversifi cation. For example, the recent acquisitions of 
Lumena and Fibrotech in 2014, and Lotus Tissue Repair, 
Premacure and SARcode in 2013 provide potential access to 
new markets such as ophthalmology and neonatology. The 
acquisition of ViroPharma, which closed in January 2014, 
expanded Shire’s Rare Diseases portfolio including adding 
CINRYZE, a leading currently marketed product for the 
prophylactic treatment of HAE.
In February 2015 Shire also completed the acquisition of NPS 
Pharma. This acquisition adds global rights to an innovative 
product portfolio with multiple growth catalysts, including, 
GATTEX/REVESTIVE with growing sales for the treatment of 
adults with SBS, a rare GI condition; and NATPARA/NATPAR, 
the only bioengineered hormone replacement therapy for use 
in the treatment of HPT, a rare endocrine disease, which 
received FDA approval in January 2015.
In 2014 Shire derived 30% (2013: 30%) of product sales from 
outside of the US. Shire has ongoing commercialization and 
late-stage development activities, which are expected to 
further supplement the diversifi cation of revenues in the 
future, including the following:
 > submission of an MAA to the EMA for once-daily, non-
stimulant guanfacine extended release of INTUNIV in the EU; 
 > the approval of a marketing authorization by the MHLW in 
Japan for AGRYLIN (marketed as XAGRID in the EU) in adult 
essential thrombocythaemia patients; and
 > the launch of VPRIV in Japan, for the improvement of 
symptoms of Gaucher disease, following approval of 
a marketing authorization on July 4, 2014 by the MHLW 
in Japan.
R&D
In 2013 Shire combined the R&D organizations of its former 
divisions into a single One Shire R&D organization, focused 
around a prioritized portfolio of clinical development and 
research programs. Shire has focused its R&D efforts on fi ve 
therapeutic areas; Neuroscience, GI/Metabolic Diseases, 
Renal/Fibrotic Diseases, Ophthalmic Diseases, and Diseases 
of the Complement Cascade. Shire concentrates its 
resources on obtaining regulatory approval for later-stage 
pipeline products within these therapeutic areas and focuses 
its early stage research activities in rare diseases.
Evidence of the successful progression of the late stage 
pipeline can be seen in the granting of approval and 
associated launches of the Company’s products over the last 
fi ve years. In this time several products have received 
regulatory approval including: in the US, VPRIV in 2010, 
FIRAZYR in 2011, and VYVANSE for BED in 2015; in the EU, 
VPRIV in 2010 and ELVANSE/TYVENSE
®
 in 2012; in Canada, 
VYVANSE in 2010.
Prior to the One Shire R&D reorganization, the Company’s 
management reviewed R&D expenditure by operating 
segment. Following the One Shire R&D reorganization, Shire’s 
management reviews direct costs for all R&D projects by 
development phase. 
Shire’s R&D costs in 2014 included expenditure on programs 
in all stages of development. The following table provides an 
analysis of the Company’s direct R&D spend categorized by 
development stage, based upon the development stage of 
each program as at December 31, 2014:

In addition to the above, the Company recorded R&D 
employee costs of $270 million in 2014 (2013: $282 million) 
and other indirect R&D costs of $232 million (2013: $43 
million), comprising depreciation and impairment charges.
Patents and market exclusivity
The loss or expiration of patent protection or regulatory 
exclusivity with respect to any of the Company’s major 
products could have a material adverse effect on the 
Company’s revenues, fi nancial condition and results of 
operations, as generic or biosimilar products may enter 
the market. Companies selling generic products often do 
not need to complete extensive clinical studies when they 
seek registration of a generic or biosimilar product and 
accordingly, and are generally able to sell a generic version 
of the Company’s products at a much lower price.
As expected, in 2009 Teva and Impax commenced 
commercial shipments of their authorized generic versions 
of ADDERALL XR, which led to lower sales of branded 
ADDERALL XR compared to the periods prior to the 
authorized generic launches. 
In 2011 authorized generic and generic versions of the 
Company’s CARBATROL
®
 and REMINYL
®
 products 
respectively were launched, which led to lower sales of 
these branded products compared to the period before 
loss of exclusivity.
In 2014 an authorized generic version of the Company’s 
INTUNIV product was launched, which led to lower sales 
of Shire’s INTUNIV product compared to the period before 
loss of exclusivity.
Shire is engaged in various legal proceedings with generic 
manufacturers with respect to its VYVANSE and LIALDA 
patents. For more detail of current patent litigation, see 
Note 19, “Commitments and Contingencies, Legal and 
other proceedings” to the consolidated fi nancial statements 
set forth in this Annual Report.
Corporate development
Shire focuses its corporate development activity on the 
acquisition and in-licensing of businesses, products or 
compounds which offer a strategic fi t and have the 
potential to deliver demonstrable value to all of the 
Company’s stakeholders. 
Recent mergers or acquisitions
In February 2015 Shire completed the acquisition of NPS 
Pharma. This acquisition adds global rights to an innovative 
product portfolio with multiple growth catalysts, including, 
GATTEX/REVESTIVE with growing sales for the treatment of 
adults with SBS, a rare GI condition; and NATPARA/NATPAR, 
following its US approval on January 23, 2015, the only 
bioengineered hormone replacement therapy for use in 
the treatment of HPT, a rare endocrine disease.
In February 2015 Shire also acquired Meritage Pharma, Inc 
(“Meritage”). This acquisition provides Shire with worldwide 
rights to Meritage’s Phase 3-ready compound Oral 
Budesonide Suspension (“OBS”) for the potential treatment of 
adolescents and adults with eosinophilic esophagitis (“EoE”), 
a rare, chronic infl ammatory GI disease.
In 2014, Shire acquired:
 > ViroPharma which added a leading marketed product for the 
prophylactic treatment of HAE, CINRYZE, as well as a 
number of other marketed products and a pipeline of product 
candidates in the rare disease area;
 > Lumena which added global rights to two late stage pipeline 
assets, SHP625 (formerly LUM001), in Phase 2 clinical 
development with four potential orphan indications; and 
SHP626 (formerly LUM002), ready to enter a Phase 1b 
multiple dose trial in the ﬁ rst half of 2015;
 > Fibrotech which added global rights to SHP627 (formerly 
FT011) in Phase 1b, a new class of oral drug with a novel 
mechanism of action which has the potential to address both 
the inﬂ ammatory and ﬁ brotic components of disease 
processes. In addition Shire has acquired Fibrotech’s library 
of novel molecules including SHP628 (formerly FT061), which 
is in preclinical development; and
 > BIKAM which added global rights to SHP630 (formerly 
BIK-406) in preclinical development, for the potential 
treatment of autosomal dominant retinitis pigmentosa (adRP).
In 2013, Shire acquired:
 > SARcode which added SHP606 to the Shire portfolio 
(SHP606 is currently in Phase 3 development for the 
treatment of DED).
 > Premacure which added SHP607 to the Shire portfolio 
(SHP607 is currently in Phase 3 for the prevention of ROP).
 > Lotus Tissue Repair which added global rights to a protein 
replacement therapy in preclinical development, for the 
treatment of Dystrophic Epidermolysis Bullosa (“DEB”).
Collaboration and licensing activity
Shire has also entered into a number of collaboration and 
license agreements in recent years, including:
 > A worldwide licensing and collaboration agreement with 
ArmaGen in 2014 to develop and commercialize AGT -182, 
an investigational enzyme replacement therapy for the 
potential treatment of both the central nervous system and 
somatic manifestations in patients with Hunter syndrome;
 > A collaboration and license agreement with Sangamo to 
develop therapeutics for hemophilia and other monogenic 
diseases based on Sangamo’s ZFP technology in 2012; and
 > An agreement with Shionogi in 2012 to co-develop and 
co-commercialize VYVANSE and INTUNIV in Japan. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 45
Organization and structure 
In 2013 the Company integrated its operations into a 
simplifi ed One Shire organization in order to drive future 
growth and innovation. Shire now comprises a single 
operating and reportable segment. For further details see 
Note 25 “Segment reporting” to the consolidated fi nancial 
statements set forth in this Annual Report. As part of the One 
Shire reorganization, the Company undertook a review of all 
of its pipeline programs and identifi ed those projects that fi t 
with the Company’s new strategic direction and have an 
acceptable likelihood of success. Following that review and 
overall streamlining of the R&D organization, several clinical 
and preclinical projects were discontinued which resulted in 
the elimination of a signifi cant number of R&D roles and 
functional roles that support R&D in Basingstoke, and some 
positions were re-located. 
In addition the Company also relocated its international 
commercial hub from Nyon, Switzerland to Zug, Switzerland 
in 2013. All Nyon-based employees were affected by the 
move to Zug. Shire is now operating from its new Zug offi ce 
and is providing employees with a reasonable period of time 
to manage their relocations.
Certain aspects of the One Shire program were temporarily 
put on hold due to AbbVie’s offer for Shire, which was 
terminated in October 2014. Subsequent to the termination 
of AbbVie’s offer, Shire announced its plans to relocate over 
500 positions to Massachusetts from its Chesterbrook, 
Pennsylvania, site and establish Lexington, Massachusetts, 
as the Company’s US Operational Headquarters in 
continuation of the One Shire effi ciency program. This 
relocation will streamline business globally through two 
principal locations, Massachusetts and Switzerland, with 
support from regional and country-based offi ces around 
the world.
For further details see Note 6 “Reorganization costs” to 
the consolidated fi nancial statements set forth in this 
Annual Report.
On October 22, 2013 Shire discontinued the construction of 
its new manufacturing facility in San Diego. Subsequently on 
January 16, 2014, the Company sold and transferred certain 
of the assets relating to the manufacturing, marketing, sale 
and distribution of DERMAGRAFT to Organogenesis Inc. For 
further information, see Note 10, “Results of discontinued 
operations and assets held for sale” to the consolidated 
fi nancial statements set forth in this Annual Report.
Results of operations for the years to December 31, 2014 
and 2013
Financial highlights for the year to December 31, 2014 are 
as follows:
 > Product sales grew strongly in 2014, up 23% to $5,830 
million (2013: $4,757 million). Product sales in 2014 included 
$538 million for products acquired with ViroPharma, primarily 
$503 million from CINRYZE. The inclusion of ViroPharma 
contributed 12 percentage points to reported product sales 
growth in the year. Excluding products acquired with 
ViroPharma, product sales were up 11%. This growth was 
driven by VYVANSE (up 18% to $1,449 million), LIALDA/
MEZAVANT (up 20% to $634 million), ELAPRASE (up 9% to 
$593 million), REPLAGAL (up 7% to $500 million), VPRIV (up 
7% to $367 million), and FIRAZYR (up 55% to $364 million). 
The strengthening of the US dollar during the fourth quarter 
of 2014 negatively affected the growth in product sales for 
a number of the Company’s products, notably ELAPRASE, 
REPLAGAL and VPRIV . The US dollar has remained strong 
during the early part of 2015 and exchange rates as at 
January 31, 2015 were $1.13:€1.00 and $1.51:£1.00 
(average exchange rates for the year to December 31, 2014 
were $1.33:€1.00 and $1.65:£1.00). If exchange rates 
remain at these levels throughout 2015, or if the US dollar 
strengthens further against the Euro and the Pound Sterling, 
the Company’s product sales growth in 2015 will be 
adversely impacted, particularly for ELAPRASE, REPLAGAL 
and VPRIV .
 > Total revenues were up 22% to $6,022 million (2013: $4,934 
million), due to the Company’s strong product sales growth 
and higher royalties and other revenues (up 8%). The higher 
royalty income included $22 million of INTUNIV royalties 
following generic entry in December and other revenues 
included the receipt of a $13 million milestone relating 
to FOSRENOL.
 > Operating income from continuing operations in 2014 was 
down 2% to $1,698 million (2013: $1,734 million). Operating 
income from continuing operations includes $190 million 
of intangible asset impairment charges (2013: $20 million), 
integration and acquisition costs of $159 million (2013: a net 
credit of $134 million), One Shire reorganization costs of 
$181 million (2013: $88 million), and costs associated with 
AbbVie’s terminated offer for Shire of $96 million (2013: $nil). 
Excluding these items, operating income grew strongly in 
2014, up 36%, due to higher total revenues (up 22%) 
and only a 9% increase in combined R&D and SG&A, 
demonstrating the Company’s focus on delivering 
efﬁ cient growth.
 > Diluted earnings per Ordinary Share from continuing 
operations increased 125% to $5.52 (2013: $2.45) primarily 
due to the receipt of a $1,635 million break fee in relation to 
AbbVie’s terminated offer for Shire and a lower effective tax 
rate of 2% (2013: 16%), which was partially offset by the 
lower operating income.

  The Company’s management analyzes product sales and revenue growth for certain products sold in markets outside of the US on a constant exchange 
rate (“CER”) basis, so that product sales and revenue growth can be considered excluding movements in foreign exchange rates. Product sales and revenue 
growth on a CER basis is a Non-GAAP ﬁ nancial measure (“Non-GAAP CER”), computed by comparing 2014 product sales and revenues restated using 
2013 average foreign exchange rates to 2013 actual product sales and revenues. This Non-GAAP ﬁ nancial measure is used by Shire’s management, and is 
considered to provide useful information to investors about the Company’s results of operations, because it facilitates an evaluation of the Company’s year on year 
performance on a comparable basis. Average exchange rates for the year to December 31, 2014 were $1.65:£1.00 and $1.33:€1.00 (2013: $1.56:£1.00 and 
$1.33:€1.00). ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 47
VYVANSE – ADHD
VYVANSE product sales grew strongly (up 18%) in 2014 
primarily due to the benefi t of price increases
1
 and to a lesser 
extent higher US prescription demand and growth in ex-US 
product sales. This growth was partially offset by a lower level 
of stocking in 2014 as compared to 2013.
Litigation proceedings regarding VYVANSE are ongoing. 
Further information about this litigation can be found in 
Note 19, “Commitments and Contingencies, Legal and other 
proceedings” to the consolidated fi nancial statements set 
forth in this Annual Report.
LIALDA/MEZAVANT – Ulcerative colitis
The 20% growth in product sales for LIALDA/MEZAVANT in 
2014 was primarily driven by higher prescription demand 
(up 25%) and to a lesser extent a price increase
1
 taken at the 
beginning of 2014. The growth was partially offset by a lower 
level of stocking and higher sales deductions as a percentage 
of sales in 2014 as compared to 2013.
Litigation proceedings regarding LIALDA are ongoing. Further 
information about this litigation can be found in Note 19, 
“Commitments and Contingencies, Legal and other 
proceedings” to the consolidated fi nancial statements set 
forth in this Annual Report.
ELAPRASE – Hunter syndrome
ELAPRASE sales growth was up 9% (up 11% on a Non 
GAAP CER basis), driven by continued growth in the number 
of treated patients, especially in emerging markets. Sales 
growth was negatively affected by foreign exchange. 
CINRYZE – for the prophylactic treatment of HAE
Shire acquired CINRYZE through its acquisition of ViroPharma 
on January 24, 2014. CINRYZE sales were $503 million in 
2014, growing 30% on a pro forma basis on 2013
2
 primarily 
driven by more patients on therapy and to a lesser extent the 
impact of a price increase
1
 in the US and an increase in 
channel inventory. 
REPLAGAL – Fabry disease
REPLAGAL sales were up 7% compared to 2013 (up 10% on 
a Non GAAP CER basis), driven primarily by higher unit sales 
as the Company continues to see an increase in the number 
of patients on therapy, with good growth in emerging markets 
and to a lesser extent in Europe. The benefi t of the higher unit 
sales was partially offset by foreign exchange. 
ADDERALL XR – ADHD
ADDERALL XR product sales were up 2% in 2014, as 
a result of higher prescription demand, partially offset by 
lower stocking in 2014 compared to 2013.
Litigation proceedings regarding ADDERALL XR are 
ongoing. Further information about this litigation and 
the Impax settlement, can be found in Note 19, 
“Commitments and Contingencies, Legal and other 
proceedings” to the consolidated fi nancial statements 
set forth in this Annual Report.
VPRIV – Gaucher disease
VPRIV sales were up 7% (up 8% on a Non GAAP CER basis), 
driven by a strong performance in the EU and US as we 
continue to add naïve patients and gain patients switching 
from other therapies. Sales growth was also negatively 
impacted by foreign exchange.
FIRAZYR – Hereditary Angioedema
FIRAZYR sales growth was up 55% compared to 2013, 
driven by a higher number of patients on therapy and the 
effect of a price increase
1
 in the US market.
INTUNIV – ADHD
INTUNIV product sales were down 2% compared to 2013, 
refl ecting the impact of generic competition from December 
2014, which resulted in lower prescription demand, 
signifi cantly higher sales deductions as a percentage of 
product sales and destocking as compared to a slight level 
of stocking in 2013. This was partially offset by price 
increases
1
 taken in 2014. The impact of generic competition 
saw INTUNIV market share fall to 2.3% at the end of 2014 
from 4.6% at the beginning of the year.
Further information about litigation proceedings regarding 
INTUNIV can be found in Note 19, “Commitments and 
Contingencies, Legal and other proceedings” to the 
consolidated fi nancial statements set forth in this 
Annual Report.
PENTASA – Ulcerative Colitis
PENTASA product sales were up 3% as the benefi t of price 
increases
1
 was partially offset by higher sales deductions and 
a lower prescription demand in 2014 compared to 2013.
1
 The actual net effect of price increases on current period net sales 
compared to the comparative period is difﬁ cult to quantify due to the 
various managed care rebates, Medicaid discounts, other discount 
programs in which the Company participates and fee for service agreements 
with wholesalers customers.

Shire has received royalty income from Actavis following

income is based on 25% of Actavis’ gross profi ts from 
INTUNIV sales.
Cost of product sales from continuing operations
Cost of product sales increased to $979.3 million for the 
year to December 31, 2014 (17% of product sales), up from 
$670.8 million in the corresponding period in 2013 (14% 
of product sales). Cost of product sales as a percentage 
of product sales was three percentage points higher 
compared to the same period in 2013. In the year to 
December 31, 2014 Cost of product sales was impacted 
by loss and expiry provisions, the inclusion of lower 
margin CINRYZE acquired with ViroPharma and charges 
of $91.9 million on the unwind of the fair value adjustment 
on acquired ViroPharma inventories. 
For the year to December 31, 2014 cost of product sales 
included depreciation of $57.1 million (2013: $37.5 million). 
R&D from continuing operations
R&D expenditure increased to $1,067.5 million for the year 
to December 31, 2014 (18% of product sales), compared to 
$933.4 million in the corresponding period in 2013 (20% of 
product sales). R&D expenditure in 2014 includes impairment 
charges of $190.3 million, primarily relating to the SHP602 
IPR&D intangible asset of $166.0 million, following the current 
Phase 2 trial being placed on clinical hold and $22.0 million 
relating to the SHP613 IPR&D intangible asset, following the 
decision to discontinue further development based on 
portfolio prioritization as well as unexpected challenges and 
complexities with the development program. Also included in 
2014 R&D expenditure is a payment of $12.5 million in 
respect of in-licensed and acquired products. In 2013 R&D 
expenditure included impairment charges of $19.9 million 
related to IPR&D intangible assets acquired with Movetis N.V . 
Excluding these costs , R&D expenditure in the year to 
December 31, 2014 decreased by 5% or by $49 million, 
due to the completion/termination of several large Phase 3 
programs which were ongoing during 2013, including new 
uses for LDX, the effect of portfolio prioritization decisions 
taken during 2013 and lower overheads due to the One Shire 
reorganization, partially offset by the inclusion of programs 
acquired with ViroPharma and Lumena, and increased spend 
on the SHP607 (prevention of ROP), SHP608 (DEB) and 
SHP606 (DED) programs. 
R&D in the year to December 31, 2014 included depreciation 
of $24.5 million (2013: $23.3 million). 
SG&A from continuing operations
SG&A expenditure increased to $2,025.8 million for the year 
to December 31, 2014 from $1,651.3 million, due to the 
inclusion of ViroPharma SG&A costs from January 24, 2014, 
higher intangible asset amortization, costs incurred in 
connection with AbbVie’s terminated offer for Shire and 
commercial spending in advance of anticipated product 
launches for certain products, which offset lower overheads 
following the One Shire reorganization. SG&A as a proportion 
of product sales remained constant at 35% of product sales 
for the year to December 31, 2014 compared with 35% of 
product sales in the corresponding period in 2013, as the 
Company continues to see benefi ts from the One Shire 
reorganization and the focus on operational discipline in 
the year to December 31, 2014.
For the year to December 31, 2014 SG&A included 
depreciation of $81.9 million (2013: $66.8 million) and 
amortization of $243.8 million (2013: $152.0 million).
Gain on sale of product rights from continuing operations
For the year to December 31, 2014 Shire recorded a net gain 
on sale of product rights of $88.2 million (2013: $15.9 million) 
following the divestment of CALCICHEW
®
, VANCOCIN
®
, 
ESTRACE
®
 and EXPUTEX
®
. The net gain on sale of product 
rights also included the loss on re-measurement of the 
contingent consideration receivable relating to the divestment 
of DAYTRANA
®
.
Reorganization costs from continuing operations
For the year to December 31, 2014 Shire recorded 
reorganization costs of $180.9 million (2013: $88.2 million) 
comprising costs relating to the One Shire reorganization, 
which included involuntary termination benefi ts and other 
termination costs. Amounts recorded in 2014 also include 
certain costs associated with moving more than 500 positions 
from Chesterbrook to Lexington, which will be effected over 
2015 and 2016.
Integration and acquisition costs from continuing 
operations
For the year to December 31, 2014 Shire recorded integration 
and acquisition costs of $158.8 million, comprising 
acquisition and integration costs of $144.1 million, primarily 
related to ViroPharma, and a $14.7 million charge relating to 
the change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities.
In 2013 Shire recorded a net credit of $134.1 million in 
integration and acquisition costs primarily related to the 
change in fair values of contingent consideration liabilities 
offset by the costs of integrating SARcode, and Lotus Tissue 
Repair Inc..
Interest expense from continuing operations
For the year to December 31, 2014 Shire incurred interest 
expense of $30.8 million (2013: $38.1 million). Interest 
expense in 2014 principally relates to interest and fi nancing 
costs incurred on facilities drawn down in respect of the 
acquisition of ViroPharma. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 49
Receipt of break fee
On July 18, 2014, the Boards of AbbVie and Shire announced 
that they had agreed the terms of a recommended 
combination of Shire with AbbVie, subject to a number of 
conditions including approval by shareholders and regulators. 
On the same date Shire and AbbVie entered into a co-
operation agreement in connection with the recommended 
combination. On October 16, 2014, the Board of AbbVie 
confi rmed that it had withdrawn its recommendation of its 
offer for Shire as a result of the anticipated impact of a US 
Treasury Notice on the benefi ts that AbbVie expected from its 
offer. As AbbVie’s offer was conditional on the approval of its 
stockholders, and given their Board’s decision to change its 
recommendation and to advise AbbVie’s stockholders to vote 
against the offer, there was no realistic prospect of satisfying 
this condition. Accordingly, Shire’s Board agreed with AbbVie 
to terminate the cooperation agreement on October 20, 2014. 
The Company entered into a termination agreement with 
AbbVie, pursuant to which AbbVie paid the break fee 
due under the cooperation agreement of approximately 
$1,635.4 million. The Company has obtained advice that 
the break fee should not be taxable in Ireland. The Company 
has therefore concluded that no tax liability should arise and 
has not recognized a tax charge in the income statement in 
the current accounting period. However, this has not been 
agreed with the tax authorities. 
Taxation from continuing operations
The effective tax rate on income from continuing operations 
was 2% (2013: 16%). The effective rate of tax on income from 
continuing operations is lower than 2013 primarily due to the 
receipt of the break fee from AbbVie and recognition of a net 
credit to income taxes of $235 million, following the 
settlement of certain tax positions with the Canadian revenue 
authorities in 2014. The accounting treatment for tax 
purposes of the Break Fee is outlined in the immediately 
preceding paragraph. 
Excluding the effect of these two items the effective tax rate 
in 2014 would have been 17%.
Discontinued operations
The gain from discontinued operations for the year to 
December 31, 2014 was $122.7 million net of tax (2013: loss 
of $754.5 million). The gain from discontinued operations 
includes a tax credit of $211.3 million primarily driven by a tax 
benefi t arising following a reorganization of the former RM 
business undertaken in the fourth quarter of 2014, associated 
with the divestment of the DERMAGRAFT business in the fi rst 
quarter of 2014. This gain was partially offset by costs 
associated with the divestment of the DERMAGRAFT 
business, including a loss on re-measurement of contingent 
consideration receivable from Organogenesis to its fair value.
Results of operations for the years to December 31, 2013 
and 2012
Financial highlights for the year to December 31, 2013 are 
as follows:
 > Product sales from continuing operations in 2013 were up 
12% to $4,757 million (2012: $4,253 million). The strong 
growth in product sales from continuing operations was 
driven by VYVANSE (up 19% to $1,228 million), LIALDA/
MEZAVANT (up 32% to $529 million), VPRIV (up 12% to 
$343 million), INTUNIV (up 16% to $335 million) and 
FIRAZYR (up 102% to $235 million).
 > Total revenues from continuing operations were up 9% to 
$4,934 million (2012: $4,527 million) as the growth in product 
sales was partially offset, as expected, by lower royalties and 
other revenues (down 36%).
 > Operating income from continuing operations in 2013 was up 
66% to $1,734 million (2012: $1,045 million), primarily due to 
the strong growth in product sales and an overall reduction in 
total operating expenses in 2013 compared to 2012 as the 
Company focused on delivering efﬁ cient growth. Operating 
expenses in 2013 included a net credit of $159 million due to 
changes in the fair value of contingent consideration liabilities, 
in particular related to the acquisition of SARcode following 
the release of top-line Opus-2 data. Operating expenses in 
2012 included impairment charges of $197.9 million related 
to RESOLOR intangible assets. R&D expenditure decreased 
by 2%. SG&A expenditure decreased by 15%.
 > Diluted earnings per Ordinary Share from continuing 
operations increased 74% to $2.45 (2012: $1.41) due to 
the higher operating income from continuing operations 
and a lower effective tax rate of 16% (2012: 20%).

Review of our business
(continued)
VYVANSE – ADHD
VYVANSE product sales grew strongly (+19%) in 2013 
primarily as a result of price increases
1
 as well as higher 
prescription demand, primarily due to growth in the US 
ADHD market (+6%).
Litigation proceedings regarding VYVANSE are ongoing. 
Further information about this litigation can be found in Note 
19, “Commitments and Contingencies, Legal and other 
proceedings” to the consolidated fi nancial statements set 
forth in this Annual Report.
ELAPRASE – Hunter syndrome
Reported ELAPRASE sales growth (+10%) was driven by 
an increase in the number of patients on therapy.
LIALDA/MEZAVANT – Ulcerative Colitis
The growth in product sales for LIALDA/MEZAVANT (+32%) 
in 2013 was primarily driven by higher market share in the US, 
the effects of which were partially offset by higher sales 
deductions in 2013 as compared to 2012. 
Litigation proceedings regarding LIALDA are ongoing. Further 
information about this litigation can be found in Note 19, 
“Commitments and Contingencies, Legal and other 
proceedings” to the consolidated fi nancial statements set 
forth in this Annual Report.
REPLAGAL – Fabry disease
REPLAGAL sales were down 6% compared to 2012 (down 
4% on a Non GAAP CER basis) as sales in 2013 were 
impacted by foreign exchange, pricing pressure (primarily 
in Europe) and slightly lower volumes due to the return of 
competition to the Fabry market. 
ADDERALL XR – ADHD
ADDERALL XR product sales decreased 12% in 2013 as 
a result of higher sales deductions, partially offset by the 
effect of higher stocking in 2013 compared to 2012. 
VPRIV – Gaucher disease
Reported VPRIV sales growth of 12% was driven by 
an increase in the number of patients on therapy.
INTUNIV – ADHD
INTUNIV product sales were up 16% compared to 2012, 
driven by growth in US prescription demand (up 9% 
compared to 2012), together with price increases
1
. 
These positive factors were partially offset by higher 
sales deductions in 2013 compared to 2012.
PENTASA – Ulcerative Colitis
PENTASA product sales were up 6% as the benefi t of price 
increases
1
 was partially offset by higher sales deductions 
in 2013 as compared to 2012.
FIRAZYR – HAE
FIRAZYR sales growth (+102% compared to 2012) was 
primarily driven by the US market, where we continue 
to see both good growth in new patients and increased 
levels of repeat usage by existing patients.
1
  The actual net effect of price increases on current period net sales 
compared to the comparative period is difﬁ cult to quantify due to the 
various managed care rebates, Medicaid discounts, other discount 
programs in which the Company participates and fee for service 
agreements with wholesalers customers.

Royalties from ADDERALL XR in 2013 were signifi cantly 
impacted by the lower royalty rate payable on sales of 
authorized generic ADDERALL XR by Impax, following the 
launch of a new generic version of ADDERALL XR late in the 
second quarter of 2012 as well as by Impax’s lower market 
share in 2013 versus 2012.
Royalties from 3TC and ZEFFIX in 2013 were lower, as 2012 
included one-time royalty income of $38 million in respect 
of prior periods due to resolution of a disagreement with 
GlaxoSmithKline and ViiV Healthcare.
Cost of product sales from continuing operations
Cost of product sales increased to $670.8 million for the year 
to December 31, 2013 (14% of product sales), up from 
$585.8 million in the corresponding period in 2012 (14% of 
product sales). The costs of product sales as a percentage 
of product sales remained broadly constant in 2013 as 
compared to 2012. 
For the year to December 31, 2013 cost of product sales 
included depreciation of $37.5 million (2012: $29.0 million). 
R&D from continuing operations
R&D expenditure decreased to $933.4 million for the year 
to December 31, 2013 (20% of product sales), compared 
to $953.0 million in the corresponding period in 2012 (22% 
of product sales). In the year to December 31, 2012 R&D 
included up-front payments of $13.0 million to Sangamo 
and $10.0 million to acquire the US rights for prucalopride 
(marketed in certain countries in Europe as RESOLOR) and 
IPR&D impairment charges in respect of RESOLOR of 
$71.2 million (2013: $19.9 million). Excluding these costs R&D 
increased by $54.7 million or 6% in the year to December 31, 
2013 due to the Company’s continuing investment in a 
number of targeted R&D programs, particularly new uses for 
LDX and other recently acquired assets including SHP606 
(lifi tegrast), SHP607 (for the prevention of Retinopathy of 
Prematurity) and SHP608 (for the treatment of DEB). 
R&D in the year to December 31, 2013 included depreciation 
of $23.3 million (2012: $22.5 million). 
SG&A from continuing operations
SG&A expenditure decreased to $1,651.3 million (35% 
of product sales) for the year to December 31, 2013 from 
$1,948.0 million (46% of product sales) in the corresponding 
period in 2012. In the year to December 31, 2012 SG&A 
included impairment charges of $126.7 million related to 
RESOLOR intangible assets and higher legal and litigation 
costs, including a charge of $57.5 million in relation to the 
agreement in principle with the US Government to resolve 
a previously disclosed civil investigation. Excluding these 
costs SG&A decreased by $43.1 million or 3% due to the 
Company’s continuing focus on simplifying its business 
and delivering effi cient growth.
For the year to December 31, 2013 SG&A included 
depreciation of $66.8 million (2012: $57.5 million) and 
amortization of $152.0 million (2012: $153.6 million).
Goodwill impairment charges from continuing operations
In the fi rst quarter of 2013 Shire recorded a goodwill 
impairment charge of $198.9 million (2012: $nil) in relation 
to the former RM business unit. Following a review of future 
forecasts for the RM business unit, management determined 
in the fi rst quarter of 2013 that future sales were expected 
to be lower than anticipated at the time of acquisition and 
consequently in accordance with US GAAP , it was determined 
that the goodwill attributable to the RM business unit was 
impaired. Following the divestment of DERMAGRAFT on 
January 16, 2014 the Company has reclassifi ed $191.8 million 
of the impairment charge (being the portion of the RM 
reporting unit goodwill impairment charge that related to 
the DERMAGRAFT business) to discontinued operations. 
Reorganization costs from continuing operations
For the year to December 31, 2013 Shire recorded 
reorganization costs of $88.2 million (2012: $nil) comprising 
costs relating to the One Shire reorganization ($64.6 million), 
which included involuntary termination benefi ts and other 
reorganization costs (of which approximately $42 million 
was paid in cash during 2013) as Shire transitions to a new 
operating structure, and the cost of closing Shire’s facility 
at Turnhout, Belgium ($23.6 million).
Integration and acquisition costs from continuing 
operations
For the year to December 31, 2013 Shire recorded a net 
credit of $134.1 million in integration and acquisition 
costs (2012: $13.5 million charge). This comprised a credit 
of $159.1 million (2012: $9.2 million charge) relating to the 
change in fair values of contingent consideration liabilities, 
in particular relating to the acquisition of SARcode, partially 
offset by $25.0 million of acquisition and integration costs, 
primarily for the acquisition of ViroPharma and integration 
of SARcode and Lotus Tissue Repair. In 2012 integration 
and acquisition costs primarily related to the acquisition 
of FerroKin.
Interest expense from continuing operations
For the year to December 31, 2013 Shire incurred interest 
expense of $38.1 million (2012: $38.2 million). Interest 
expense principally related to the coupon and amortization 
of issue costs on Shire’s convertible bonds which were 
fully redeemed or converted in the year, and to a lesser 
extent costs incurred on facilities related to the purchase 
of ViroPharma.
Taxation from continuing operations
The effective tax rate was 16% (2012: 20%). 
The effective tax rate is lower than 2012 primarily due 
to the impact of changes in the fair values of contingent 
consideration liabilities which have no tax impact and 
impairment charges in 2012 which had no tax benefi t 
and were not repeated in 2013.

Review of our business
(continued)
Discontinued operations
The loss from discontinued operations for the year to 
December 31, 2013 was $754.5 million net of tax (2012: 
$60.3 million), which included impairment charges in 
respect of the assets held for sale ($636.9 million), goodwill 
impairment charges ($191.8 million), net losses on the 
discontinued DERMAGRAFT business ($252.2 million 
including reorganization costs) and related taxes (credit) 
of $326.4 million.
Financial condition at December 31, 2014 and 2013
Cash & cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents increased by $743.0 million to 
$2,982.4 million at December 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013: 
$2,239.4 million). Cash provided by operating activities was 
up by 189% to $4,229 million, due to the receipt of the 
$1,635 million break fee in relation to AbbVie’s terminated 
offer for Shire, the benefi t of the $417 million repayment 
received from the Canadian revenue authorities and the 
Company’s continued strong cash receipts from gross 
product sales. In addition cash provided by fi nancing 
activities in 2014 of $554.5 million primarily refl ected the net 
proceeds from Shire’s line of credit and other borrowings. 
These infl ows were offset by the cost of acquiring 
ViroPharma, Lumena and Fibrotech. 
Accounts receivable, net
Accounts receivable, net increased by $73.9 million to 
$1,035.1 million at December 31, 2014 (December 31, 
2013: $961.2 million), primarily due to the increase in revenue. 
Days sales outstanding decreased to 43 days (December 31, 
2013: 46 days).
Inventories
Inventories increased by $89.5 million to $544.8 million at 
December 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013: $455.3 million), 
primarily due to the inclusion of CINRYZE inventories 
following the acquisition of ViroPharma.
Goodwill
Goodwill increased by $1,850.3 million to $2,474.9 million at 
December 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013: $624.6 million), 
principally due to the acquisitions of ViroPharma, Fibrotech 
and Lumena.
Other intangible assets, net
Other intangible assets increased by $2,621.8 million to 
$4,934.4 million at December 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013: 
$2,312.6 million), principally due to the intangible assets 
acquired with ViroPharma, Lumena and Fibrotech, offset by 
the impairments of the SHP602 and SHP613 IPR&D assets, 
intangible asset amortization and the divestments of 
VANCOCIN, EXPUTEX and ESTRACE.
Short term borrowing
Short term borrowings increased from $nil at December 31, 
2013 to $850.0 million at December 31, 2014 refl ecting the 
utilization of a short term debt facility to part fund the 
acquisition of ViroPharma.
Other current liabilities
Other current liabilities increased by $143.0 million to 
$262.5 million at December 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013: 
$119.5 million) principally due to the recognition of contingent 
consideration liabilities in respect of the Lumena acquisition.
Non-current deferred tax liabilities
Non-current deferred tax liabilities increased by $650.0 million 
to $1,210.6 million at December 31, 2014 (December 31, 
2013: $560.6 million), primarily due to deferred tax liabilities 
arising on the intangible assets acquired with ViroPharma 
and Lumena.
Other non-current liabilities 
Other non-current liabilities increased by $148.2 million to 
$736.7 million at December 31, 2014 (December 31, 2013: 
$558.5 million) principally due to the recognition of contingent 
consideration payable in respect of the Lumena and Fibrotech 
acquisitions and changes in the fair value of contingent 
consideration payable in respect of prior acquisitions.
Liquidity and capital resources 
General 
The Company’s funding requirements depend on a number 
of factors, including the timing and extent of its development 
programs; corporate, business and product acquisitions; 
the level of resources required for the expansion of certain 
manufacturing and marketing capabilities as the product base 
expands; increases in accounts receivable and inventory 
which may arise with any increase in product sales; 
competitive and technological developments; the timing 
and cost of obtaining required regulatory approvals for new 
products; the timing and quantum of milestone payments 
on collaborative projects; the timing and quantum of tax and 
dividend payments; the timing and quantum of purchases 
by the Employee Benefi t Trust (“EBT”) of Shire shares in the 
market to satisfy awards granted under Shire’s employee 
share plans; and the amount of cash generated from sales 
of Shire’s products and royalty receipts.
An important part of Shire’s business strategy is to protect 
its products and technologies through the use of patents, 
proprietary technologies and trademarks, to the extent 
available. The Company intends to defend its intellectual 
property and as a result may need cash for funding the 
cost of litigation.
The Company fi nances its activities through cash generated 
from operating activities; credit facilities; private and public 
offerings of equity and debt securities; and the proceeds of 
asset or investment disposals. 
Shire’s balance sheet includes $2,982.4 million of cash and 
cash equivalents at December 31, 2014.
Shire also has a revolving credit facility of $2,100 million which 
matures in 2019, which was undrawn at December 31, 2014.  ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 53
In connection with its acquisition of ViroPharma, on 
November 11, 2013 the Company also entered into a $2,600 
million term loan facilities agreement with, among others, 
Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited (acting as lead 
arranger and agent) (the “2013 Facilities Agreement”). 
Amounts drawn under the 2013 Facilities Agreement were 
subsequently reduced to $850 million. At December 31, 2014 
the 2013 Facilities Agreement comprises an $850 million term 
loan facility which matures on November 11, 2015, which was 
fully utilized and recorded within short term borrowings.
On January 24, 2014 ViroPharma commenced a tender offer 
to repurchase, at the option of each holder, any and all of 
ViroPharma’s outstanding 2.00% Convertible Senior Notes 
Due 2017 (the “Convertible Notes”) and notifi ed the holders 
of their separate right to convert the Convertible Notes. As of 
December 31, 2014, Convertible Note holders had voluntarily 
converted approximately $205 million aggregate principal 
amount of the Convertible Notes for a total consideration of 
$551.5 million. The remaining outstanding Convertible Notes 
total an aggregate principal amount of $26,000.
Following the Company’s announcement to acquire NPS 
Pharma, on January 11, 2015 the Company entered into 
an $850 million term loan facilities agreement which matures 
on January 10, 2016.
Revolving Credit Facilities Agreement
On December 12, 2014, Shire entered into a $2,100 million 
revolving credit facilities agreement (the “RCF”) with a number 
of fi nancial institutions, for which Abbey National Treasury 
Services PLC (trading as Santander Global Banking and 
Markets), Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, 
Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds 
Bank PLC, The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and Sumitomo 
Mitsui Banking Corporation acted as mandated lead 
arrangers and bookrunners and DNB Bank ASA, The Bank 
of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Credit Suisse AG, London 
Branch, Deutsche Bank Luxembourg S.A., Goldman Sachs 
Bank USA, Mizuho Bank, Ltd. and Morgan Stanley Bank 
International Limited acted as arrangers. Shire is an original 
borrower under the RCF and has agreed to act as guarantor 
for its subsidiaries, which are also original borrowers and for 
any other of its subsidiaries that become additional borrowers 
thereunder. At December 31, 2014 the RCF was undrawn. On 
February 21, 2015 Shire requested the utilization of $1,300 
million under the RCF to partially fi nance the purchase price 
payable in respect of Shire’s acquisition of NPS Pharma 
(including certain related costs).
The RCF , which terminates on December 12, 2019, may be 
applied towards fi nancing the general corporate purposes 
of Shire. The RCF incorporates a $250 million US dollar and 
Euro swingline facility operating as a sub-limit thereof.
The RCF became immediately available for general corporate 
purposes as outlined above, on satisfaction of certain 
customary conditions precedent including the cancellation of 
Shire’s multicurrency term and revolving facilities agreement 
dated November 23, 2010 (the “2010 RCF”) with a number 
of fi nancial institutions, for which Abbey National Treasury 
Services PLC, Bank of America Merrill Lynch International 
Limited (formerly Banc of America Securities Limited), 
Barclays Bank PLC (formerly Barclays Capital), Citigroup 
Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC (formerly Lloyds 
TSB Bank PLC) and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC acted 
as lead arrangers (the facilities under which at such time 
were undrawn). 
Interest on any loans made under the RCF will be payable on 
the last day of each interest period, which may be one week 
or one, two, three or six months at the election of Shire, or as 
otherwise agreed with the lenders. The interest rate for the 
RCF will be: LIBOR (or, in relation to any revolving loan in 
Euro, EURIBOR); plus 0.30% per year until delivery of the fi rst 
compliance certifi cate required to be delivered after the date 
of the RCF , subject to change thereafter depending upon (i) 
the prevailing ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA (each as defi ned in 
the RCF) in respect of the most recently completed fi nancial 
year or fi nancial half year and (ii) the occurrence and 
continuation of an event of default in respect of the fi nancial 
covenants or the failure to provide a compliance certifi cate.
Shire shall also pay (i) a commitment fee equal to 35% per 
year of the applicable margin on available commitments 
under the RCF for the availability period applicable thereto 
and (ii) a utilization fee equal to (a) 0.10% per year of the 
aggregate of the amount requested by the borrower in a 
utilization request (the “Base Currency Amount”) of all 
outstanding loans up to an aggregate Base Currency 
Amount equal to $700 million, (b) 0.15% per year of the 
amount by which the aggregate Base Currency Amount of 
all outstanding loans exceeds $700 million but is equal to 
or less than $1,400 million and (c) 0.30% per year of the 
amount by which the aggregate Base Currency Amount 
of all outstanding loans exceeds $1,400 million.
The RCF includes customary representations and warranties, 
covenants and events of default, including requirements that 
Shire’s (i) ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA in respect of the most 
recently-ended 12-month Relevant Period (each as defi ned 
in the RCF) must not, at any time, exceed 3.5:1 (except that, 
following an acquisition fulfi lling certain criteria, Shire may 
on a once only basis elect to increase this ratio to 4.0:1 for 
the Relevant Period in which the acquisition was completed 
and for that immediately following) and (ii) ratio of EBITDA 
to Net Interest for the most recently-ended 12-month 
Relevant Period (each as defi ned in the RCF) must not be 
less than 4.0:1.
The RCF restricts (subject to certain exceptions) Shire’s ability 
to incur additional fi nancial indebtedness, grant security over 
its assets or provide loans/grant credit. Further, any lender 
may require mandatory prepayment of its participation if there 
is a change of control of Shire, subject to certain exceptions 
for schemes of arrangement and analogous schemes.

(continued)
Events of default under the facilities include, among others: 
(i) non-payment of any amounts due under the Finance 
Documents (as defi ned in the RCF), (ii) failure to satisfy any 
fi nancial covenants, (iii) material misrepresentation in any of 
the Finance Documents, (iv) failure to pay, or certain other 
defaults, under other fi nancial indebtedness, (v) certain 
insolvency events or proceedings, (vi) material adverse 
changes in the business, operations, assets or fi nancial 
condition of Shire as a whole, (vii) if it becomes unlawful 
for Shire (or any successor parent company) or any of 
their respective subsidiaries that are parties to the RCF to 
perform their obligations thereunder or (viii) if Shire (or any 
successor parent company) or any subsidiary thereof which 
is a party to the RCF repudiates such agreement or other 
Finance Document.
Term Loan Facilities Agreement
2015 Facilities Agreement
On January 11, 2015, Shire entered into an $850 million 
Facility Agreement with, among others, Citi Global 
Markets Limited (acting as mandated lead arranger and 
bookrunner) (the “2015 Facility Agreement”). The 2015 
Facility Agreement comprises a $850 million term loan 
facility. Shire has agreed to act as guarantor for any of its 
subsidiaries that are or become additional borrowers 
under the 2015 Facility Agreement.
The 2015 Facility agreement, which matures on January 10, 
2016, may be used only to fi nance the purchase price 
payable in respect of Shire’s acquisition of NPS Pharma 
(including certain related costs). The maturity date may be 
extended twice, at Shire’s option, by six months on each 
occasion. On February 23, 2015 Shire requested the 
utilization of $850 million under the 2015 Facilities Agreement 
to partially fi nance the purchase price payable in respect of 
Shire’s proposed acquisition of NPS Pharma (including 
certain related costs).
Interest on any loans made under the 2015 Facility Agreement 
will be payable on the last day of each interest period, which 
may be one week or one, two, three or six months at the 
election of Shire, or as otherwise agreed with the lenders. 
The interest rate applicable to the 2015 Facility Agreement 
is LIBOR plus 0.50% per annum and increases by 0.25% 
per annum on six months after the date of the agreement 
and on each subsequent date falling at three-month 
intervals thereafter.
Shire shall also pay a commitment fee on the available but 
unutilized commitments under the 2015 Facility Agreement 
for the availability period applicable to each facility. With 
effect from fi rst utilization, the commitment fee rate will be 
35% of the applicable margin. Before fi rst utilization, the 
commitment fee rate will increase in stages from 0% to 35% 
of the applicable margin over a period of three months.
The 2015 Facility Agreement includes customary 
representations and warranties, covenants and events of 
default, including requirements that the ratio of Net Debt to 
EBITDA of the Group (each as defi ned in the 2015 Facility 
Agreement) must not, at any time, exceed 3.5:1 for the 
Relevant Period (as defi ned in the 2015 Facility Agreement), 
except that following certain acquisitions, including the 
merger with NPS Pharma, Shire may elect to increase the 
ratio to 4.0:1 in the relevant period in which the acquisition 
was completed and the immediately following relevant period. 
In addition, for each 12-month period ending December 31 
or June 30, the ratio of EBITDA of the Group to Net Interest 
(each as defi ned in the 2015 Facility Agreement) must not 
be less than 4.0:1. 
The 2015 Facility Agreement restricts (subject to certain 
exceptions) Shire’s ability to incur additional fi nancial 
indebtedness, grant security over its assets or provide or 
guarantee loans. Further, any lender may require mandatory 
prepayment of its participation if there is a change of control 
of Shire. In addition, in certain circumstances, the net 
proceeds of certain shares, undertakings or business 
disposals by Shire must be applied towards the mandatory 
prepayment of the facility, subject to certain exceptions.
Events of default under the facility include: (i) non-payment 
of any amounts due under the facility, (ii) failure to satisfy 
any fi nancial covenants, (iii) material misrepresentation in 
any of the fi nance documents, (iv) failure to pay, or certain 
other defaults, under other fi nancial indebtedness, (v) certain 
insolvency events or proceedings, (vi) material adverse 
changes in the business, operations, assets or fi nancial 
condition of Shire and its subsidiaries, (vii) if it becomes 
unlawful for Shire or any of its subsidiaries that are parties 
to the 2015 Facility Agreement to perform their obligations 
or (viii) if Shire or any subsidiary of Shire which is a party to 
the 2015 Facility Agreement repudiates the 2015 Facility 
Agreement or any other fi nance document, among others. 
The 2015 Facility Agreement is governed by English law.
2013 Facilities Agreement
On November 11, 2013, Shire entered into a $2,600 million 
facilities agreement with, among others, Morgan Stanley Bank 
International Limited (acting as lead arranger and agent) (the 
“2013 Facilities Agreement”). The 2013 Facilities Agreement 
comprised two credit facilities: (i) a $1,750 million term loan 
facility and (ii) a $850 million term loan facility. 
On December 13, 2013 and at various points during the year 
to December 31, 2014, the Company cancelled part of the 
$2,600 million term loan facility. At December 31, 2014 
the 2013 Facilities Agreement comprised an $850 million 
term loan facility which matures on November 11, 2015 
and was fully utilized. All other terms and conditions 
remain unchanged. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 55
The $850 million term loan facility has been used to fi nance 
the purchase price payable in respect of Shire’s acquisition of 
ViroPharma (including certain related costs).
Interest on any loans made under the facilities will be payable 
on the last day of each interest period, which may be one 
week or one, two, three or six months at the election of Shire, 
or as otherwise agreed with the lenders. 
The interest rate applicable to the $850 million term loan 
facility commenced at LIBOR plus 1.15% per annum until 
delivery of the compliance certifi cate for the year ending 
December 31, 2013 and is subject to change depending upon 
the prevailing ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA of the Group (each 
as defi ned in the 2013 Facilities Agreement), in respect of the 
most recently completed fi nancial year or fi nancial half year.
The 2013 Facilities Agreement includes customary 
representations and warranties, covenants and events of 
default, including requirements that the ratio of Net Debt to 
EBITDA of Shire (each as defi ned in the 2013 Facilities 
Agreement) must not, at any time, exceed 3.5:1 for the 
Relevant Period (as defi ned in the 2013 Facilities Agreement), 
except that following certain acquisitions, including the 
ViroPharma acquisition, Shire may elect to increase the ratio 
to 4.0:1 in the relevant period in which the acquisition was 
completed and the immediately following relevant period. In 
addition, for each 12-month period ending December 31 or 
June 30, the ratio of EBITDA of the Group to Net Interest 
(each as defi ned in the 2013 Facilities Agreement) must not 
be less than 4.0:1.
The 2013 Facilities Agreement restricts (subject to certain 
covenants) Shire’s ability to incur additional fi nancial 
indebtedness, grant security over its assets or provide or 
guarantee loans. Further, any lender may require mandatory 
prepayment of its participation if there is a change of control 
of Shire. In addition, in certain circumstances, the net 
proceeds of certain shares, undertakings or business 
disposals by Shire must be applied towards the mandatory 
prepayment of the facilities, subject to certain exceptions.
Events of default under the facilities include: (i) non-payment 
of any amounts due under the facilities, (ii) failure to satisfy 
any fi nancial covenants, (iii) material misrepresentation in any 
of the fi nance documents, (iv) failure to pay, or certain other 
defaults, under other fi nancial indebtedness, (v) certain 
insolvency events or proceedings, (vi) material adverse 
changes in the business, operations, assets or fi nancial 
condition of Shire and its subsidiaries, (vii) if it becomes 
unlawful for Shire or any of its subsidiaries that are parties to 
the 2013 Facilities Agreement to perform their obligations or 
(viii) if Shire or any subsidiary of Shire which is a party to the 
2013 Facilities Agreement repudiates the 2013 Facilities 
Agreement or any other fi nance document, among others. 
The 2013 Facilities Agreement is governed by English law.
Financing
Shire anticipates that its operating cash fl ow together with 
available cash, cash equivalents and the RCF will be suffi cient 
to meet its anticipated future operating expenses, capital 
expenditures, tax and interest payments, lease obligations, 
repayment of the term loans and milestone payments as they 
become due over the next twelve months. 
Shire’s existing cash, the 2015 Facilities Agreement and the 
RCF are suffi cient to fi nance the acquisition of NPS Pharma.
If the Company decides to acquire other businesses, it 
expects to fund these acquisitions from cash resources, 
the RCF , term loan facilities and through new borrowings 
or the issuance of new equity if necessary.
Sources and uses of cash 
The following table provides an analysis of the Company’s 
gross and net cash (excluding restricted cash), as at

 Substantially all of the Company’s cash and cash equivalents are held by 
foreign subsidiaries (i.e, those subsidiaries incorporated outside of Jersey, 
Channel Islands, the jurisdiction of incorporation of Shire plc, Shire’s holding 
company). The amount of cash and cash equivalents held by foreign 
subsidiaries has not had, and is not expected to have, a material impact on the 
Company’s liquidity and capital resources.
2
 Net cash is a Non-GAAP measure. The Company believes that Net (debt)/cash 
is a useful measure as it indicates the level of net cash/borrowings after taking 
account the cash and cash equivalents that could be utilized to pay down the 
outstanding borrowings. 
Cash ﬂ ow activity
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year to 
December 31, 2014 increased by $2,765.4 million or 189% to 
$4,228.4 million (2013: $1,463.0 million) primarily due to the 
receipt of the $1,635.4 million break fee in relation to AbbVie’s 
terminated offer for Shire, the benefi t of the $417 million 
repayment received from the Canadian revenue authorities 
and higher cash receipts from gross product sales, offset by 
payments for sales deductions, payments of acquisition and 
integration costs in respect of the acquisitions of ViroPharma, 
Lumena and Fibrotech, costs in connection with AbbVie’s 
terminated offer for Shire and cash payments in respect of 
the One Shire reorganization. 
Net cash provided by operating activities for the year to 
December 31, 2013 increased by $80.1 million or 6% to 
$1,463.0 million (2012: $1,382.9 million) as higher cash 
receipts from gross product sales were more than offset by 
payments made in relation to the One Shire reorganization 
(approximately $42 million), costs incurred on the closure 
of Shire’s facility at Turnhout in Belgium (approximately 
$24 million) and the payment to settle the litigation with 
Impax ($48 million).

Review of our business
(continued)
Net cash used in investing activities was $4,030.6 million in 
the year to December 31, 2014, principally relating to the 
cash paid for the acquisition of ViroPharma of $3,997 million 
(excluding cash acquired with ViroPharma of $233 million) 
and for the acquisition of Lumena of $300 million (excluding 
cash acquired with Lumena of $46 million), offset by the 
proceeds received on the sale of non-core product rights.
Net cash used in investing activities was $360.9 million in 
the year to December 31, 2013, principally relating to the 
cash paid (net of cash acquired) for the acquisitions of 
SARcode, Premacure and Lotus Tissue Repair and for 
purchases of PP&E. 
Net cash provided by fi nancing activities was $554.5 million 
for the year to December 31, 2014, principally due to the 
drawings, net of subsequent repayments, made under the 
facilities to partially fund the ViroPharma acquisition. In 
addition the Company paid cash of $551.4 million to settle 
the convertible debt assumed with ViroPharma, received 
cash of $346.7 million upon settlement of a purchased call 
option acquired with ViroPharma and made dividend 
payments of $121.2 million.
Net cash used in fi nancing activities was $344.6 million 
for the year to December 31, 2013, principally due to the 
purchase of shares under the share buy-back program, 
purchase of shares by the EBT and the dividend payment.
Outstanding letters of credit
At December 31, 2014, the Company had irrevocable 
standby letters of credit and guarantees with various banks 
totaling $46 million, providing security for the Company’s 
performance of various obligations. These obligations are 
primarily in respect of the recoverability of insurance claims, 
lease obligations and supply commitments. 
Cash requirements 
At December 31, 2014 the Company’s cash requirements for 
short and long term liabilities refl ected on the Balance Sheet 
and other contractual obligations were as follows:

1
 The Company leases certain land, facilities, motor vehicles and certain 
equipment under operating leases expiring through 2021. 
2
 Purchase obligations include agreements to purchase goods, investments or 
services (including clinical trials, contract manufacturing and capital 
equipment), including open purchase orders, that are enforceable and legally 
binding and that specify all signiﬁ cant terms. Shire expects to fund these 
commitments with cash ﬂ ows from operating activities.
3
 Unrecognized tax beneﬁ ts and associated interest and penalties of 
$199.2 million are included within payments due in one to three years. 
In addition to the above contractual obligations, the Company 
is committed to make milestone payments (principally arising 
from the in-licensing or acquisition of products, assets and 
businesses), contingent upon the occurrence of future events 
(and therefore payment is not yet due). At December 31, 
2014, the Company is contingently committed to pay up to 
approximately $1.4 billion (aggregate contractual amount) 
in respect of potential future research and development 
milestone payments and up to approximately $1.2 billion 
(aggregate contractual amount) in respect of commercial 
milestones as a result of prior business combinations and 
in-licensing agreements. Payments under these agreements 
are generally due and payable only upon achievement of 
certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. 
From a business perspective, these payments signify that the 
product is successfully moving through development and is 
now generating or is more likely to generate cash fl ows from 
product sales. However, it is not possible to predict with 
reasonable certainty whether these milestones will be 
achieved or the timing of their achievement. As a result, 
these potential payments are not included in the table of 
contractual obligations.
On January 11, 2015 Shire also signed a defi nitive agreement 
to acquire all of the outstanding share capital of NPS Pharma 
for $46 per share in cash or approximately $5.2 billion. This 
acquisition was completed on February 21, 2015. This cash 
requirement did not exist as at December 31, 2014 and 
therefore is not refl ected in the table above. 
Off-balance sheet arrangements 
There are no off-balance sheet arrangements, aside from 
those outlined above, that have, or are reasonably likely to 
have, a current or future material effect on the Company’s 
fi nancial condition, revenues or expenses, results of 
operations, liquidity, capital expenditures or capital resources.
Foreign currency ﬂ uctuations 
A number of the Company’s subsidiaries have a functional 
currency other than the US Dollar. As such, the consolidated 
fi nancial results are subject to fl uctuations in exchange rates, 
particularly in the Euro, Swiss Franc and Pound Sterling 
against the US Dollar. 
The accumulated foreign currency translation differences at 
December 31, 2014 of $136.1 million are reported within 
accumulated other comprehensive (loss)/income in the 
consolidated balance sheet and foreign exchange losses for 
the year to December 31, 2014 of $15.6 million are reported 
in the consolidated statements of income.
At December 31, 2014, the Company had outstanding swap 
and forward foreign exchange contracts to manage the 
currency risk associated with intercompany transactions. 
At December 31, 2014 the fair value of these contracts was 
a net asset of $4.8 million.  ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 57
Inﬂ ation
Although at reduced levels in recent years, infl ation continues 
to apply upward pressure on the cost of goods and services 
which are used in the business. However, the Company 
believes that the net effect of infl ation on its revenues and 
operations has been minimal during the past three years.
Treasury policies and organization
The Company’s principal treasury operations are coordinated 
by its corporate treasury function. All treasury operations are 
conducted within a framework of policies and procedures 
approved annually by the Board of Directors. As a matter 
of policy, the Company does not undertake speculative 
transactions that would increase its credit, currency or 
interest rate exposure.
Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its $2,100 
million RCF , its $850 million 2013 Facilities Agreement and its 
$850 million 2015 Facilities Agreement, on which interest is at 
fl oating rates, to the extent any of these facilities are utilized. 
At December 31, 2014 the RCF was undrawn, and the 
Company had fully utilized $850 million of the 2013 Facilities 
Agreement. Shire’s exposure under its $850 million 2013 
Facilities Agreement is to US Dollar interest rates.
The Company has evaluated the interest rate risk on the 
RCF , the 2013 Facilities Agreement and the 2015 Facilities 
Agreement and considers the risks associated with 
fl oating interest rates on the instruments as appropriate. 
A hypothetical one percentage point increase or decrease 
in the interest rates applicable to drawings under the 2013 
Facilities Agreement at December 31, 2014 would increase 
or decrease interest expense by approximately $8.5 million 
per annum. 
The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk on its 
restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents and on foreign 
exchange contracts on which interest is at fl oating rates. This 
exposure is primarily to US Dollar, Pounds Sterling, Euro and 
Canadian Dollar interest rates. As the Company maintains all 
of its cash, liquid investments and foreign exchange contracts 
on a short term basis for liquidity purposes, this risk is not 
actively managed. In the year to December 31, 2014 the 
average interest rate received on cash and liquid investments 
was less than 1% per annum. The largest proportion of these 
cash and liquid investments was in US dollar money market 
and liquidity funds. 
No derivative instruments were entered into during the year 
to December 31, 2014 to manage interest rate exposure. 
The Company continues to review its interest rate risk and 
the policies in place to manage the risk. 
Foreign exchange risk
The Company trades in numerous countries and as a 
consequence has transactional and translational foreign 
exchange exposures.
Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in 
currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant 
subsidiary. The main trading currencies of the Company are 
the US Dollar, Pounds Sterling, Swiss Franc and the Euro. 
It is the Company’s policy that these exposures are minimized 
to the extent practicable by denominating transactions in the 
subsidiary’s functional currency. 
Where signifi cant exposures remain, the Company uses 
foreign exchange contracts (being spot, forward and swap 
contracts) to manage the exposure for balance sheet assets 
and liabilities that are denominated in currencies different to 
the functional currency of the relevant subsidiary. These 
assets and liabilities relate predominantly to intercompany 
fi nancing. The foreign exchange contracts have not been 
designated as hedging instruments. Cash fl ows from 
derivative instruments are presented within net cash provided 
by operating activities in the consolidated cash fl ow 
statement, unless the derivative instruments are economically 
hedging specifi c investing or fi nancing activities.
Translational foreign exchange exposure arises on the 
translation into US Dollars of the fi nancial statements of 
non-US Dollar functional subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2014 the Company had 56 swap and 
forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding to manage 
currency risk. The swap and forward contracts mature within 
90 days. The Company did not have credit risk related 
contingent features or collateral linked to the derivatives. The 
Company has master netting agreements with a number of 
counterparties to these foreign exchange contracts and on 
the occurrence of specifi ed events, the Company has the 
ability to terminate contracts and settle them with a net 
payment by one party to the other. The Company has elected 
to present derivative assets and derivative liabilities on 
a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet. As at 
December 31, 2014 the potential effect of rights of set 
off associated with the foreign exchange contracts would 
be an offset to both assets and liabilities of $4.2 million, 
resulting in net derivative assets and derivative liabilities 
of $8.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively. Further details 
are included below.
Foreign exchange risk sensitivity
The following exchange rate sensitivity analysis summarises 
the sensitivity of the Company’s reported revenues and 
net income to hypothetical changes in the average annual 
exchange rates of the Euro, Pound Sterling and Swiss

Concentration of credit risk
Financial instruments that potentially expose Shire to 
concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short-term 
cash investments, derivative contracts and trade accounts 
receivable (from product sales and from third parties from 
which the Company receives royalties). Cash is invested 
in short-term money market instruments, including money 
market and liquidity funds and bank term deposits. The 
money market and liquidity funds in which Shire invests 
are all triple A rated by both Standard & Poor’s and by 
Moody’s credit rating agencies.
The Company is exposed to the credit risk of the 
counterparties with which it enters into derivative instruments. 
The Company limits this exposure through a system of 
internal credit limits which vary according to ratings assigned 
to the counterparties by the major rating agencies. The 
internal credit limits are approved by the Board and exposure 
against these limits is monitored by the corporate treasury 
function. The counterparties to these derivatives contracts 
are major international fi nancial institutions. 
The Company’s revenues from product sales in the US are 
mainly governed by agreements with major pharmaceutical 
wholesalers and relationships with other pharmaceutical 
distributors and retail pharmacy chains. For the year to 
December 31, 2014 there were three customers in the US 
that accounted for 47% of the Company’s product sales. 
However, such customers typically have signifi cant cash 
resources and as such the risk from concentration of credit 
is considered acceptable. The Company has taken positive 
steps to manage any credit risk associated with these 
transactions and operates clearly defi ned credit evaluation 
procedures. However, an inability of one or more of these 
wholesalers to honor their debts to the Company could have 
an adverse effect on the Company’s fi nancial condition and 
results of operations.
A substantial portion of the Company’s accounts receivable 
in countries outside of the US is derived from product sales 
to government-owned or government-supported healthcare 
providers. The Company’s recovery of these accounts 
receivable is therefore dependent upon the fi nancial stability 
and creditworthiness of the relevant governments. In recent 
years global and national economic conditions have 
negatively affected the growth, creditworthiness and general 
economic condition of certain markets in which the Company 
operates. As a result, in some countries outside of the US, 
the Company is experiencing delays in the remittance of 
receivables due from government-owned or government-
supported healthcare providers. In the year to December 31, 
2014 the Company continued to receive remittances in 
relation to government-owned or government-supported 
healthcare providers, from all countries in which it operates, 
including receipts of $98 million and $143 million in respect 
of Spanish and Italian receivables, respectively.
The Company’s aggregate accounts receivable, net of the 
allowance for doubtful accounts, in total from government-
owned or government-supported healthcare providers 
in those territories in which the Company is experiencing 
the most signifi cant delays, being Argentina, Greece, Italy,

Approved by the Board and signed on its behalf by:
Tatjana May
Company Secretary
February 24, 2015
Accounts receivable due from government-owned or 
government-supported healthcare providers in the Relevant 
Countries of $77 million (2013: $128 million) are split by 
country as follows: Greece $4 million (2013: $4 million); Italy 
$30 million (2013: $59 million); Portugal $11 million (2013: 
$14 million), Spain $15 million (2013: $39 million) and 
Argentina $17 million (2013: $12 million).
The Company continues to receive remittances in relation 
to government-owned or government-supported healthcare 
providers in the Relevant Countries and in the year to 
December 31, 2014 received $311 million in settlement 
of accounts receivable in the Relevant Countries – $7 million 
was from Greece; $143 million from Italy; $14 million 
from Portugal, $98 million from Spain and $49 million 
from Argentina. 
To date the Company has not incurred signifi cant losses 
on the accounts receivable in the Relevant Countries, 
and continues to consider that such accounts receivable 
are recoverable. 
Other than the accounts receivable from government-owned 
or supported healthcare providers outlined above, the 
Company does not hold any other government debt from 
the Relevant Countries. Additionally the Company does 
not consider it is currently exposed to signifi cant credit risk 
outside of the Relevant Countries.
The Company continues to evaluate all its accounts 
receivable for potential collection risks and has made 
provision for amounts where collection is considered to 
be doubtful. If the fi nancial condition of the Relevant 
Countries or other countries suffer signifi cant deterioration, 
such that their ability to make payments becomes uncertain, 
additional allowances for doubtful accounts may be required, 
and losses may be incurred, in future periods. Any such loss 
could have an adverse effect on the Company’s fi nancial 
condition and results of operations.

R A 62 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Dear Shareholder
I am pleased to introduce Shire’s 2014 
Corporate Governance Report.
Effective governance is fundamental 
to the long term success of Shire. The 
Board and its committees play a central 
role in the Company’s governance by 
providing an external and independent 
perspective on matters material to 
Shire’s stakeholders, and by seeking to 
ensure that effective internal controls 
and risk management measures are in 
place. The Board also supports the 
promotion of a culture of good 
governance throughout the Company. 
As part of the Board’s annual 
performance evaluation it was 
concluded that the broad range of 
skills, knowledge and experience on 
the Board is appropriate to guide the 
Company effectively in fulfi lling its 
strategic objectives. More detail about 
the Board evaluation and on some of 
the major matters considered by the 
Board and its committees during the 
year can be found later in this report. In 
2015 the Board performance evaluation 
will be externally facilitated, being three 
years after the last external evaluation. 
Corporate governance report
Susan Kilsby
Chairman
Effective governance is 
fundamental to the long term 
success of Shire.
The Board and I recognize the 
importance of ensuring strong 
leadership for Shire. The progression 
of the appointment of a new Chief 
Financial Offi cer and the recruitment 
of a new non-executive Board member 
were postponed during the year due to 
the pendency of the proposed merger 
with AbbVie. As detailed more fully in 
the Nomination Committee Chairman’s 
report, these searches have been 
re-initiated alongside the search for 
a further new Non-Executive Director. 
The Board is committed to the 
promotion of diversity in all of the 
Company’s recruitment practises, as is 
refl ected in the Board Diversity Policy. 
As a more general matter, the Board has 
agreed that a greater emphasis will be 
placed on succession planning and 
talent management in 2015.
Looking forward to 2015, the Board 
and I will continue to focus on the 
effective oversight of the Company 
and on investment in our four strategic 
drivers of growth, innovation, effi ciency 
and people. 
Susan Kilsby
Chairman
UK Corporate Governance Code
This report seeks to demonstrate 
how the main principles of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code 2012 
(the “Governance Code”) were applied 
throughout the fi nancial year ended

opinion that, during this period, the 
Company complied with the provisions 
of the Governance Code. Published by 
the Financial Reporting Council, the 
Governance Code is publicly available 
at www.frc.org.uk.
Leadership
Role of the Board
The principal purpose of the Board is

for determining the Group’s strategy as 
well as overseeing its implementation 
by management. In addition, the Board 
has oversight of all material matters

operations including key policies,

Division of responsibilities
The Board comprises the Chairman, 
seven other Non-Executive Directors 
and the Chief Executive Offi cer. Upon 
appointment, the new Chief Financial 
Offi cer will also become a member of 
the Board. (The Company’s Interim 
Chief Financial Offi cer is not a member 
of the Board though attends Board and 
relevant Board committee meetings by 
invitation.) The Chief Executive Offi cer 
together with the Executive Committee 
is responsible for business operations. 
The Non-Executive Directors are 
charged with exercising independent 
judgment during Board deliberation and 
ensuring the effective performance by 
management of their duties.
The Chairman, Deputy Chairman, Senior 
Independent Director and Chief 
Executive Offi cer have distinctly different 
functions which are defi ned in writing 
and approved by the Board. These are 
summarised as follows:
Chairman
 > As Chairman it is Susan Kilsby’s 
primary responsibility to provide 
leadership to the Board; ensuring its 
effective operation. This is achieved in 
part through her promotion of an open 
and engaged culture that facilitates 
constructive dialogue both with 
management and in executive 
sessions of the Board. She is also 
responsible for ensuring effective 
communications between the Board 
and shareholders. Ms. Kilsby 
succeeded Matthew Emmens as 
Chairman at the conclusion of the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting 
held on April 29, 2014. 
Deputy Chairman
 > As Deputy Chairman David Kappler 
is responsible for supporting, 
and deputising for, the Chairman 
as required. 
Senior Independent Director
 > As Senior Independent Director it 
is David Kappler’s responsibility to 
provide a sounding board for the 
Chairman and to serve as a trusted 
intermediary for the other Directors. 
He is also responsible for leading 
meetings of the Non-Executive 
Directors in the absence of the 
Chairman, and for consulting with 
shareholders when communication 
with the Chairman or Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer would be inappropriate. 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer
 > Flemming Ornskov’s principal 
responsibility as Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer 
is to manage Shire’s day-to-day 
business. He is accountable to the 
Board for the development of the 
Company and its operations; having 
due regard for the strategy, risk proﬁ le, 
objectives and policies set forth by the 
Board and its committees. 
Full details of the aforementioned roles 
and responsibilities can be found on the 
Company’s website. 64 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014

Corporate governance report
(continued)
Only members of the Board are entitled 
to attend Board meetings, however, 
during the year additional individuals 
attended by invitation. The Interim Chief 
Financial Offi cer and the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary 
attended all scheduled and ad hoc 
meetings of the Board, with regular 
additional attendees at scheduled 
meetings including the Head of 
Corporate Development, the Chief 
Human Resources Offi cer, the Head of 
Research and Development and the 
Chief Compliance and Risk Offi cer. 
External professional advisors also 
attended meetings when necessary. 
At the conclusion of scheduled Board 
meetings it is customary for the 
Non-Executive Directors to meet 
without Executive Directors or 
management present, following which 
a meeting of the Non-Executive 
Directors led by the Senior Independent 
Director is held in the absence of the 
Chairman. Matters considered by the 
Board are those reserved for their 
judgment and decision, as defi ned in 
the Board Reserve Powers, although 
supplementary matters are considered 
by the Board as circumstances require. 
The Board Reserve Powers are available 
on the Company’s website.
Composition and diversity
The Board has reviewed the 
independence of the Non-Executive 
Directors, other than the Chairman, in 
accordance with the factors set forth for 
consideration in the Governance Code 
and determined that each continues to 
be independent. The Governance Code 
suggests that a length of service of 
more than nine years is relevant to the 
determination of a Non-Executive 
Director’s independence. Therefore, in 
considering the independence of Mr. 
Kappler, the Board gave particular 
regard to the fact that at the time of the 
Company’s Annual General Meeting in 
April 2015 he will have served as a 
member of the Board for 11 years. 
Despite his length of tenure, the Board 
concluded that Mr. Kappler remained 
independent in character and judgment; 
demonstrating continued effective 
performance and commitment to his 
role. Details of the Board performance 
evaluation, which included the 
consideration of Non-Executive Director 
independence, are available on page 
65. In addition, the Board regards each 
of its members as possessing the skills, 
knowledge and experience necessary 
for it to function effectively. Board 
members’ biographical information 
can be found on pages 60 and 61.
The Board recognizes the inherent value 
of diversity at all levels within the Group 
and is therefore committed to its 
furtherance. Shire’s Board Diversity 
Policy acknowledges that the Company, 
its shareholders and other stakeholders 
are best served by a Board diverse in 
skill, experience and background 
including gender. The principles of the 
policy are taken into account by both 
the Board and the Nomination 
Committee in their consideration of 
potential Board members, with its 
diversity-endorsing values refl ected in 
recruitment policies in effect throughout 
the Group. Additional disclosure relating 
to diversity within Shire is made on 
page 28.
Appointments
The Board may appoint any individual 
as a Director either to fi ll a vacancy or 
as an additional member of the Board. 
The process for new appointments is 
typically headed by the Nomination 
Committee (procedural details are 
available on page 72) which ultimately 
makes a recommendation to the Board. 
The agenda for Board meetings is 
determined by the Chairman in 
collaboration with the Chief Executive 
Offi cer and the Company Secretary. The 
Chairman also has the responsibility of 
ensuring that all necessary information 
is provided to the Board in a timely 
manner, in respect of which she is 
supported by the Company Secretary 
and other members of management, 
and that suffi cient time is made 
available at meetings for the 
consideration of individual agenda 
items. The Chairman encourages 
discussion with a view to achieving 
resolution by consensus. If this is 
unable to be achieved, decisions are 
to be taken by majority vote, with the 
Chairman having a casting vote in 
the case of an equality of votes.
Board effectiveness
Effective leadership is integral to the 
execution of the Company’s strategy 
and therefore to the fulfi lment of its 
objectives. The Board is committed 
to ensuring the Company operates 
in accordance with the highest 
standards of governance in order to 
promote its success for the benefi t 
of all stakeholders. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 65
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Appointments may be made by the 
Board at any time subject to subsequent 
election and annual re-election by the 
Company’s shareholders. With the 
exception of David Stout, all of the 
Directors are seeking re-election at the 
Annual General Meeting to be held on 
April 28, 2015, at which Non-Executive 
Directors’ terms of appointment and the 
Executive Director’s service contract 
will be made available for inspection 
by shareholders. As part of the Board 
performance evaluation the Chairman 
discussed personal performance 
with Board members and concluded 
that each of the Directors seeking 
re-election evidenced continued 
effective performance and commitment 
to their role.
Commitment
Prior to appointment, each Non-
Executive Director is required to 
disclose to the Board their other 
signifi cant commitments so as to enable 
an assessment of their capacity to 
effectively discharge their anticipated 
duties and responsibilities. The Board in 
turn is informed by each Non-Executive 
Director of any changes to their other 
signifi cant commitments. Each Non-
Executive Director has undertaken that 
they are able to meet the time 
commitment expected of them, which 
was duly communicated by the Board 
prior to appointment. As part of its 
performance evaluation the Board 
determined that each of its members 
had committed suffi cient time to 
perform their role effectively.
Conflicts of interest
Directors are required to seek consent 
from the Board prior to being appointed 
to, or acquiring any material fi nancial 
interest in, any enterprise which 
competes, is likely to compete or has a 
signifi cant business relationship with the 
Company. In addition, Directors are 
required to disclose the nature and 
extent of any interest they have, 
whether direct or indirect, in any 
transaction entered into, or proposed to 
be entered into, by the Group which 
confl icts, or may confl ict, with the 
Company’s interests. Such disclosures 
are made at the fi rst Board meeting at 
which the transaction is considered 
after the Director concerned becomes 
aware of the confl ict of interest, or 
potential confl ict, following which the 
Director abstains from all associated 
discussion and voting.
Induction and development
Upon appointment to the Board all 
Directors undergo a formal induction 
program tailored to their individual skills, 
knowledge and experience. The 
purpose of such a program is to 
facilitate each Director’s familiarisation 
with the Company’s business, strategy 
and governance structure, as well as 
their own duties and responsibilities. 
Induction activities undertaken during 
the year include: 
Dominic Blakemore
 > Mr. Blakemore met with management 
from across the business and 
corporate functions in order to more 
fully understand the Company and 
its operations. 
Susan Kilsby
 > Prior to assuming the position of 
Chairman Ms. Kilsby engaged in an 
extensive series of meetings with 
management and employees across 
the Group and with many of the 
Company’s major shareholders.
In addition to undergoing an initial 
induction, on an annual basis each 
Director discusses with the Chairman 
their individual development 
requirements with a view to ensuring 
that their skills, knowledge and 
experience are regularly refreshed, 
and that their familiarity with the 
Company’s business is maintained.
Information and support
The Chairman, in collaboration with 
the Company Secretary and senior 
management, is responsible for 
ensuring that Board members are 
provided at all times with the 
information necessary for them to 
effectively discharge their duties and 
responsibilities. Before decisions are 
made at Board meetings, consideration 
is had as to the adequacy of the 
information available to the Board; 
enabling the deferral of decision 
making if necessary. Directors are 
able to seek clarifi cation, additional 
information or professional advice 
necessary to the fulfi lment of their 
duties and responsibilities from across 
the business, from the Company 
Secretary or from independent sources 
at the Company’s expense. In addition, 
the Chairman, supported by the 
Company Secretary, ensures that 
effective channels of communication 
exist between the Board, its committees 
and the Company’s management.
Board performance evaluation
2013 progress
The 2013 internal evaluation highlighted 
the benefi t of having external speakers 
provide the Board with periodic updates 
on issues or trends that may impact 
the Company’s strategy or operations. 
As a result of the approaches made by 
AbbVie, during 2014 the Board received 
regular updates from the Company’s 
brokers regarding views held by 
shareholders, however, plans for 
briefi ngs by other external speakers 
were deferred. The Board recognizes 
the value of receiving external insight 
into, and analysis of, key issues and 
trends that have the capacity to impact 
the Group, and will therefore seek to 
take advantage of opportunities for 
such input going forwards. 
2014 procedure, conclusions and 
action points 
The 2014 Board performance evaluation 
was carried out internally, led by the 
Chairman with the support of the 
Company Secretary, and covered 
the performance of the Board and 
its members. All Directors completed 
a performance and effectiveness 
questionnaire with responses 
aggregated on a non-attributable basis 
and shared with the Board. In addition, 
the Chairman met with each Board 
member to discuss individual 
performance, training needs and overall 
Board effectiveness. The aggregated 
questionnaire responses together with 
individual Director feedback enabled 
the Chairman to lead the performance 
evaluation and effectiveness review with 
the Board. In addition, the Chairman 
of each Board committee conducted 
a similar performance evaluation 
and effectiveness review with their 
respective committee members. 
The Senior Independent Director also 
spoke with each Board member to 
obtain feedback on the Chairman’s 
performance which underpinned his 
discussion with her regarding the same.  66 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Corporate governance report
(continued)
The Board performance evaluation had 
regard to the information and time 
made available to the Board in its 
consideration of strategy, material risks, 
the integrity of the Company’s fi nancial 
statements and the robustness of its 
internal controls and risk management 
systems. There was also discussion 
concerning succession planning at 
Board and senior management level 
as well as refl ection on Board 
independence, culture and dynamics, 
and whether its collective skill-base 
and experience enabled it to effectively 
discharge its responsibilities.
The overall conclusion drawn from the 
2014 Board performance evaluation 
is that the individual members of 
the Board remain effective in their 
ability to discharge their duties and 
responsibilities. Each continues to 
make a valuable contribution whilst 
their respective committee meetings,

Board committees
So as to ensure effective oversight and 
control over the Group’s operations, 
the Board has constituted the Audit, 
Compliance & Risk Committee, the 
Remuneration Committee, the 
Nomination Committee, the Science 
& Technology Committee and the 
Executive Committee, each of which 
has been delegated specifi c authorities. 
The Board committees’ terms of 
reference, which are subject to 
annual review and approval by the 
Board, are available on the Company’s 
website, with further detail as to their 
operation and activities presented in 
the reports below.
Audit, Compliance & Risk Committee meetings at the invitation of the 
Committee Chairman. So as to facilitate 
open and unreserved discussion, it is 
the Committee’s practice to set aside 
time for its private deliberation, with 
time also reserved for private discussion 
with each of the Group’s external 
auditor, Head of Internal Audit and 
Chief Compliance and Risk Offi cer. 
Role of the Committee
The purpose of the Committee is to 
oversee Shire’s accounting and fi nancial 
reporting processes, the audits of its 
fi nancial statements and the 
effectiveness of the Company’s risk 
management and internal control 
framework. In doing so, the 
Committee’s principal duties are to:
 > monitor the integrity of the ﬁ nancial 
reports and statements of the Group 
and, where requested by the Board, 
advise on whether, taken as a whole, 
the Annual Report and Accounts is fair, 
balanced and understandable; 
 > make recommendations to the Board 
on matters relating to the appointment 
of the external auditor, to determine 
and agree the scope of the external 
audit engagement and to consider 
ﬁ ndings and recommendations arising 
from the external audit process; 
 > monitor and review the integrity and 
effectiveness of the Group’s internal 
ﬁ nancial controls and internal control 
and risk management systems; 
 > review the Group’s strategy for the 
management of key corporate and 
ﬁ nancial risks; and 
 > review the status of the Group’s 
compliance program to ensure 
adherence to applicable legal and 
regulatory standards and to the 
Group’s internal policies. 
In addition, the Committee is authorized 
to investigate any activity included 
within its terms of reference and is 
responsible for the resolution of any 
disagreement between management 
and the Group’s external auditor 
regarding fi nancial reporting matters. 
The Committee is also permitted to 
seek any information it requires from 
any employee of the Group, and any 
external professional advice at the 
Company’s expense, necessary to the 
fulfi lment of its duties.

Financial reporting 
Key considerations
The signifi cant issues considered by the 
Committee during the year in relation to 
the fi nancial statements were: 
 > purchase accounting related to the 
Group’s acquisition of ViroPharma, 
Lumena and Fibrotech. The 
Committee reviewed and critiqued 
the critical accounting estimates used 
in the purchase price allocations, 
speciﬁ cally the valuation of acquired 
intangible assets, and satisﬁ ed itself 
that these estimates were reasonable 
and appropriately applied. The 
Committee addressed these matters 
through the receipt of reports from 
management which discussed the 
assumptions used. In addition, as a 
principal area of audit focus Deloitte 
LLP provided detailed reporting to 
the Committee in respect of these 
matters. Further information is 
available in Note 4 to the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements;
 > accounting for sales deductions and 
rebates, and the key judgments and 
estimates applied by the Company in 
calculating the liability recorded in the 
balance sheet for such items. The 
Committee received reports from 
management outlining the process 
applied and the basis for the 
assumptions used. As an area of audit 
focus Deloitte LLP also provided 
regular reporting to the Committee 
in respect of these matters. Further 
information is available in Note 3 (ii) to 
the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements;
 > accounting for litigation provisions and 
costs. Further information is available 
in Notes 3 (iv) and 19 to the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements; 
Internal controls and risk management 
relating to ﬁ nancial reporting 
The Group’s internal control program 
concerning fi nancial reporting (“ICP”) 
is aligned with the Internal Control – 
Integrated Framework 2013 issued 
by the Committee of Sponsoring 
Organizations of the Treadway 
Commission (“COSO Framework”). It 
comprises a combination of manual, 
automated, preventative and detective 
controls, as well as underlying IT 
controls for key fi nancial systems, which 
are documented, tested and reported 
on throughout the year. The ICP takes 
into account key policies such as the 
Financial Controller’s Manual and the 
Delegation of Authority Matrix, as well 
as pervasive entity level controls 
including those relating to integrity and 
ethical values, adherence to codes of 
conduct and Board independence and 
oversight of internal control, 
organizational structure and individual 
competency. In addition, on an annual 
basis the Internal Audit function 
develops and executes a risk-based 
audit plan covering areas of fi nancial, 
compliance and operational risk across 
the various Group functions and 
geographic locations. Results of these 
audits together with results of ICP 
testing are regularly reviewed by 
the Committee, which, along with 
management, assesses the 
effectiveness of the ICP and the risk 
management framework. In addition, 
an established process of escalation 
enables the Committee and the Board 
to review matters material to the Group 
on a timely basis as they arise. 
 > accounting for various tax related 
matters, including the level of tax 
provisions. Accounting for income tax 
is underpinned by a range of 
judgments (further information is 
available in Notes 3 (iii), 26 and 28 to 
the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements). 
The most signiﬁ cant judgment in 2014 
related to the tax treatment of the 
break fee received from AbbVie, which 
the Company concluded, based on 
advice received, should not be taxable 
in Ireland. However, this has not been 
agreed with the tax authorities. The 
Committee addresses these issues, 
and the related accounting and 
disclosure, through a range of 
reporting from senior management 
and also receives verbal and written 
reporting from Deloitte LLP;
 > the carrying value of the Company’s 
intangible assets. The judgments in 
relation to potential asset impairments 
principally related to the assumptions 
underlying the determination of the fair 
value of the asset being tested, 
primarily the achievability of the long 
term business plan underlying the 
valuation process. The Committee 
discussed with management the 
judgments and sensitivities relevant to 
intangible asset impairment reviews 
and Deloitte LLP provided detailed 
reporting to the Committee. Further 
information is available in Note 3 (i) to 
the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements;
 > the review of questions posed by the 
SEC regarding Shire’s 2013 Form 
10-K ﬁ ling and the approval of Shire’s 
response; and
 > disclosure within the Group’s 2013 
full-year and 2014 quarterly results 
announcements and related 
ﬁ nancial reports. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 69
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Because of inherent limitations of 
internal controls over fi nancial reporting, 
material misstatements due to error 
may not be prevented or detected. 
Projections of any evaluation of 
effectiveness for future periods are 
subject to the risk that controls may 
become inadequate because of 
changes in conditions, or that the 
degree of compliance with the policies 
or procedures may deteriorate. To 
mitigate this risk, during the year the 
Group’s management assessed the 
effectiveness of the ICP against the 
COSO Framework. Based on this 
assessment, management believes that 
the ICP was effective as of December 
31, 2014. 
In addition, during the year the Board in 
conjunction with the Committee 
reviewed the effectiveness of the 
Group’s compliance program and wider 
internal control and risk management 
systems. This was performed through 
the review and challenge of related 
reports and presentations from 
management, and in the Board and 
Committee’s consideration of routine 
and exceptional items of business. 
Neither the Board nor the Committee 
identifi ed, nor were advised of, any 
defi ciencies within the Company’s 
compliance program or internal control 
and risk management systems that 
were considered to be material to the 
Group as a whole. Further details on 
Shire’s risk framework can be found 
on page 32.
In addition, the policy prescribes 
services from which the external auditor 
is explicitly prohibited from providing, 
and those the provision of which has 
been pre-approved by the Committee 
subject to individual and aggregate 
monetary limits. All proposed services 
falling outside of the scope of the policy, 
or the monetary limits contained therein, 
must receive pre-approval from the 
Committee or from its Chairman subject 
to Committee approval at its next 
scheduled meeting. Fees in respect of 
non-audit services provided by the 
external auditor to the Company in 2014 
totalled $4.6 million (2013: $0.6 million). 
The increase in fees in 2014 relative to 
2013 principally relates to reporting 
accountant services provided in relation 
to the proposed merger with AbbVie, 
which was subsequently terminated. 
Further details on the breakdown 
of non-audit fees paid or due to the 
external auditor as a result of services 
provided during 2014 can be found 
in Note 31 to the consolidated 
fi nancial statements.
Further factors identifi ed as contributing 
to external auditor objectivity and 
independence include the external 
auditor’s retention of an impartial and 
questioning approach, particularly 
with respect to issues of heightened 
sensitivity, the fi rm’s prudent attitude 
to the consideration and undertaking 
of non-audit services and Shire’s 
own principle of not recruiting staff 
directly from the external auditor 
engagement team.
During the year the Committee met with 
the external auditor to consider the 
external auditor’s independence and 
objectivity; ensuring that the relationship 
between the external auditor and 
members of fi nancial management had 
not resulted, or appeared to result, in a 
lack of independence or objectivity. The 
Committee considers that, during 2014, 
the external auditor was suffi ciently 
robust in dealings with members of 
fi nancial management and that, in their 
absence, the external auditor was 
transparent and decisive in dealings 
with the Committee.
Committee activities
The Committee’s activities during 
the year related to fi nancial reporting 
included:
 > the review of the Group’s treasury 
policies and ongoing treasury activities; 
 > the monitoring of the Group’s 
compliance with its stated Non GAAP 
accounting policy applied in quarterly 
earnings releases;
 > the monitoring of the Group’s accounts 
receivable exposure in certain 
Eurozone and Latin-American 
countries and the associated risk 
mitigation activities; and
 > an annual review of the Group’s tax 
strategy and assessment of ﬁ scal risk.
External audit
Independence and objectivity
The Committee recognizes both the 
need for an objective and independent 
external auditor and how such 
objectivity and independence might 
be, or appear, compromised through 
the provision of non-audit services. 
Accordingly, the Committee has 
overseen the implementation of a policy 
on the provision of non-audit services 
by the external auditor with a view to 
safeguarding these core attributes. 
The policy provides that, amongst 
other things, the auditor must not 
provide a service which:
 > creates a mutuality of interest; 
 > places the auditor in a position where 
they would audit their own work; 
 > results in the auditor acting as a 
manager or employee of the 
Company; or 
 > puts the auditor in role of advocate 
for the Company.  70 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Corporate governance report
(continued)
Effectiveness
The Committee recognizes the 
importance of having a high-caliber 
of audit and as such, undertakes an 
annual assessment of the effectiveness 
of the external audit process. As part 
of its evaluation, the Committee drew 
upon a survey of members of fi nancial 
management which measured the 
external auditor’s performance 
against predetermined “critical 
success factors”, designed to 
facilitate continuing and measurable 
improvement in the effectiveness of the 
external audit process. The Committee 
concluded that the “critical success 
factors” had been substantially met with 
there existing a constructive working 
relationship between the external 
auditor and members of fi nancial 
management. Moreover, the Committee 
determined that the audit process was 
suffi ciently robust, with the external 
auditor demonstrating continued 
commitment to the performance of 
high-quality audit work. Further areas 
of development were identifi ed and 
communicated to the external auditor 
which in turn has committed to working 
with management and the Committee 
to address these in 2015. 
Appointment and tendering
Deloitte LLP has served as Shire’s 
external auditor since 2002, with the 
current audit partner having served since 
his appointment in 2012. Following the 
review of Deloitte’s continued objectivity, 
independence and performance in 
respect of the 2014 fi nancial year, 
and having received an expression 
of willingness to continue in offi ce 
as external auditor, the Committee 
recommended to the Board the 
re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as 
the Company’s external auditor for 
the 2015 fi nancial year. There existed 
no contractual obligations that 
inhibited or infl uenced the 
Committee’s recommendation.
In accordance with developments in 
European and national regulation, and 
the UK corporate governance regime, it 
is the Company’s policy that the external 
audit contract be put to tender at least 
quarterly. In addition, periodically the 
Company’s internal audit procedures 
and capabilities undergo an 
independent external assessment 
against global standards, with the 
ensuing report reviewed by the 
Committee Chairman. 
Whistleblowing
Shire’s compliance effort is focused 
on the prevention and detection of 
misconduct through policy 
development, training, monitoring 
and audit. As part of this effort, Shire 
employees are encouraged to report 
suspected cases of misconduct, 
confi dentially and without fear of 
retaliation, through management or 
through Shire’s Global Compliance 
Helpline. The helpline, the operation 
of which is overseen by the Chief 
Compliance and Risk Offi cer, is 
managed by an independent third 
party so as to preserve anonymity as 
appropriate. Concerns and allegations 
are thoroughly investigated with 
disciplinary action taken where 
necessary. Periodically the Chief 
Compliance and Risk Offi cer provides 
the Committee with a summary of 
matters raised through management 
and the helpline as well as details of 
any resultant investigations.
Committee activities
During the year the Committee’s other 
areas of review included:
 > the Company’s 2014 proﬁ t forecast 
and related earnings guidance;
 > compliance and audit updates from 
the Chief Compliance and Risk Ofﬁ cer 
and the Head of Internal Audit; 
 > the renewal terms of the Group’s 
insurance program; 
 > the Group’s internal audit program; 
 > proposed arrangements to provide 
the Group with additional ﬁ nancial 
ﬂ exibility; and
 > the Group’s corporate risk schedule, 
including consideration of the principal 
risks faced by the Group and the 
associated mitigation strategy. 
once in every ten-year period, with the 
external audit partner rotating on a 
fi ve-yearly basis. Notwithstanding such 
policy, having regard to transitional 
arrangements regarding external audit 
tendering and rotation provided by the 
relevant regulatory authorities, it is the 
Committee’s intention, subject to 
then-prevailing circumstances, to put the 
external audit contract out to tender at a 
time that would see the appointment of 
the preferred external audit fi rm align 
with the end of the incoming audit 
partner’s tenure in 2021. The incumbent 
audit partner is scheduled to step down 
in 2016. It should be noted that, despite 
the Committee’s intention regarding the 
timing of tender, the external auditor 
is subject to ongoing effectiveness 
review and that the Committee may 
choose to put the external audit 
contract out to tender at any time it 
considers appropriate. 
Committee activities
The Committee’s activities related to 
external audit during the year included:
 > the review of quarterly updates 
provided by the external auditor 
encompassing key areas of 
judgment and risk, audit planning, 
governance updates and other 
business-related matters; 
 > the ﬁ nal review of the 2013 audit 
and the initial review of the external 
auditor’s performance and 
effectiveness during the 2014 
ﬁ nancial year, including a review of 
management’s assessment of the 
performance and effectiveness of the 
external auditor;
 > the review and approval of the 2014 
Audit Plan and audit fee; and 
 > an assessment of the objectivity and 
independence of the external auditor.

Chief Financial Offi cer on January 1, 
2015, following Mr. Bowling’s notifi cation 
to the Company of his decision to step 
down and assume the position of Chief 
Financial Offi cer of another FTSE 100 
company. Aside from assisting Shire 
with senior management searches, 
Spencer Stuart has no other connection 
with the Company.
New Non-Executive Directors
As a result of Matthew Emmens stepping 
down as Chairman in April 2014, the 
Committee recommended to the Board 
that a search be commenced for a new 
Non-Executive Director; specifi cally with 
biotechnology and/or pharmaceutical 
experience. Russell Reynolds Associates 
was retained to undertake the search, 
which was subsequently suspended as 
a result of, and resumed following, the 
discussions held with AbbVie. In addition, 
following a periodic review of the Board’s 
composition and tenure, the Committee 
recommended that a search be 
undertaken for a second new Non-
Executive Director who would enhance 
the Board’s breadth of skill and 
experience. Odgers Berndtson was 
retained to lead this search. Russell

Berndtson have been made aware of 
Shire’s Board Diversity Policy. Aside from 
assisting with senior management 
searches, neither search fi rm has any

Non-Executive Director extension of term
In anticipation of pending changes to the 
Shire Board in 2015, with the expected 
appointment of a new Chief Financial 
Offi cer and two new Non-Executive 
Directors, the Committee, with Mr. 
Kappler recusing himself, recommended 
to the Board that Mr. Kappler be asked to 
remain on the Board beyond the AGM in 
April 2015, being the date of the 
expiration of his current term of 
appointment. Following discussion, which 
included consideration of Mr. Kappler’s 
independence, the Board agreed that Mr. 
Kappler remains independent and that his 
term be extended for one year after the 
2015 AGM.
Role of the Committee
The Committee’s responsibilities include:
 > reviewing the size and composition 
of the Board and making 
recommendations to the Board with 
respect to any changes; 
 > identifying, and nominating for the 
approval of the Board, candidates for 
new Board appointments; 
 > reviewing succession planning for 
Executive and Non-Executive Directors 
with a view to ensuring the long term 
success of the Group; 
 > making recommendations to the Board 
regarding the re-election and re-
appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors; and
 > making recommendations to the 
Board with respect to the membership 
of Board committees. 
Key considerations and activities
During the year and up to the date of this 
report the Committee’s principal 
considerations and activities were:
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer succession
The Committee initiated a global search 
for a new Chief Financial Offi cer after 
Graham Hetherington informed the Board 
in February 2014 of his decision to step 
down. The Board agreed that Mr. 
Hetherington would leave the Company 
on March 1, 2014, and that James 
Bowling, then Shire’s Group Financial 
Controller, would be appointed as Interim 
Chief Financial Offi cer with effect from 
that date. The executive search fi rm 
Spencer Stuart was retained to undertake 
the search for a new Chief Financial 
Offi cer, which included the consideration 
of internal candidates. The search was 
suspended as a result of the approach 
made by AbbVie, though resumed in 
October 2014 following the termination 
of the merger. In identifying potential 
candidates, Spencer Stuart was informed 
of the experience, technical skills and 
other capabilities sought by the Company 
and was made aware of its Board 
Diversity Policy. Shire announced in 
November 2014 that Jeff Poulton, then 
Head of Investor Relations, would 
Nomination Committee 72 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Board Diversity Policy 
Following a review of the evolving 
environment regarding Board diversity, 
the Committee reviewed the Board 
Diversity Policy and agreed that it remains 
appropriate. In addition, the Committee 
reaffi rmed its commitment to the 
promotion of diversity both in executive 
and non-executive appointments and 
in recruitment practises throughout 
the Group. This view was shared with, 
and agreed by, the Board. Further 
details on diversity can be found 
on pages 28 and 64.
Board appointments procedure 
Board composition is central to the 
effective leadership of the Group and 
therefore, prior to commencing any 
search for prospective Board members, 
the Committee refl ects on the Board’s 
current balance of skills and experiences 
and those that would be conducive to 
the delivery of the Company’s strategy. 
A recommendation is then made to the 
Board as to the core attributes sought, 
following which an appropriately qualifi ed 
search fi rm is engaged and informed, 
amongst other things, of the time 
commitment required of any appointee 
and of Shire’s Board Diversity Policy.

Remuneration Committee
Directors’ remuneration report
 > We clariﬁ ed the Committee’s intention 
to make annual awards under the 
Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) with 
a maximum of 840% of salary to the 
CEO (this award level is subject to the 
CEO’s continued exceptional personal 
performance). Awards will vest based 
on stretching ﬁ nancial performance 
conditions over a three-year period.
 > We replaced our historic performance 
matrix on the LTIP with the 
independent measures of Non GAAP 
EBITDA and Product Sales and 
maintained a Non GAAP Adjusted 
ROIC underpin to ensure that earnings 
quality is achieved before any payout 
can occur.
 > We introduced a two-year post vest 
holding period onto the LTIP resulting 
in a total holding period of ﬁ ve years. 
 > We enhanced the malus and clawback 
provision for the incentive plans to 
ensure that we are aligned with market 
best practice.
This has been a challenging year for 
Shire and I would like to take this 
opportunity to provide you with an 
overview of the Committee’s major 
decisions taken during the year, the 
changes made to the Executive 
Directors’ remuneration arrangements, 
and the context in which these decisions 
were taken.
As communicated to shareholders in 
last year’s remuneration report, the 
Committee undertook a strategic review 
of remuneration during 2014. This gave 
the Committee an opportunity to ensure 
the remuneration policy for Executive 
Directors supports and drives the 
Company’s strategic direction and in 
particular the key goal of achieving 
$10 billion in product sales by 2020. 
As a result of this review, we are 
presenting a new remuneration policy for 
shareholder approval at the 2015 AGM. 
At Shire we are focused on becoming 
a leading global Biotech company and 
the Committee is confi dent that the 
proposed remuneration policy supports 
this ambition. The revised policy is 
designed to:
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, 
I am pleased to present the 
Remuneration Committee’s 
report for the ﬁ nancial year 
ending December 31, 2014. 
 > Ensure our remuneration 
arrangements are aligned with our 
strategy, in particular our plan to 
double Shire’s product sales to 
$10 billion by 2020. 
 > Simplify remuneration arrangements, 
increase transparency for our 
shareholders and improve line of sight 
for our Executive Directors.
 > Implement a remuneration package 
that is competitive and facilitates 
executive retention within the sectors 
and geographies in which the 
Company operates and competes 
for talent.
 > Incorporate key aspects of emerging 
remuneration best practice.
In line with our ongoing commitment 
to open and transparent dialog with 
shareholders, I have had discussions 
with many of our largest shareholders 
to discuss the proposed revisions to 
our remuneration policy. The policy 
presented therefore takes into 
consideration the views of key 
shareholders and we very much look 
forward to receiving your support for the 
policy at the 2015 AGM. Full details of 
the revised policy are set out in the body 
of the remuneration report. The key 
changes are summarised below:
Part 1 – Annual Statement ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 75
1
 This is a Non GAAP ﬁ nancial measure. For reconciliation to US GAAP please see page 166. 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
As part of the review the Committee 
also determined that the Global Biotech 
and US BioPharma markets would be 
the primary reference points when 
considering the remuneration policy for 
Executive Directors (with the FTSE 50 
(excluding fi nancial services) retained 
as a secondary reference point). This 
change is intended to refl ect the current 
profi le of the business where North 
America generates the majority of the 
Company’s revenues and is also the 
core market for competing for talent. Dr. 
Ornskov is also located in the US, along 
with the majority of senior management 
and over two-thirds of employees.
The Committee will continue to monitor 
the current arrangements to ensure they 
remain aligned with Shire’s strategic 
goals and shareholder interests.
Context of the Committee’s decisions
Through an eventful 2014, including the 
uncertainty surrounding the offer from 
AbbVie, the Company and its employees 
maintained focus and the business 
continued to grow and operate with 
great success. This has resulted in upper 
quartile performance over the period:
 > Ordinary Share price increased by 
60.7% through 2014 and American 
Depositary Share price increased 
by 52.7%.
 > Net product sales experienced strong 
growth of 23% to $5,830 million 
(2013: $4,757 million).
 > Non GAAP EBITA
1
 of $2,593 million 
exceeded our target of $2,341 million 
by 10.8%, demonstrating the progress 
we made against our strategy to grow 
our business efﬁ ciently, enabling us to 
deliver value to our stakeholders and 
provide more innovative treatments to 
more patients.
 > Strong Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC
1
 
returns of 14.7% versus the target of 
12.8%, driven largely by the strong 
sales growth and efﬁ cient cost base 
of our business.
 > Successful cost management 
ensured that combined Non GAAP 
R&D and SG&A
1
 costs were 
maintained within our target of 
44.3% of net product sales.
Key Committee decisions
The Committee took the decisions 
regarding remuneration during the 
year in the context of the exceptional 
performance of the Company in 2014 
and the Committee is satisfi ed that 
there is strong alignment between 
Company performance and the 
payments to the Executive Directors. 
The key decisions include:
 > Strong performance has resulted in the 
Executive Annual Incentive Plan paying 
out at the maximum opportunity for 
the CEO of 180% of salary.
 > In view of Dr. Ornskov’s excellent 
leadership and the strong performance 
of the Company, the Committee has 
awarded the CEO a base salary 
increase of 3.8% effective from 
January 1, 2015.
 > Graham Hetherington, the Company’s 
CFO, left the Company during the 
year. Full details of the treatment of 
Mr. Hetherington’s remuneration on 
departure are set out in this report and 
I can conﬁ rm that the decisions made 
by the Committee were taken within 
the terms of the approved 2014 
remuneration policy. Mr. Hetherington 
did not receive a bonus for the 2014 
year and his Portfolio Share Plan 
(“PSP”) awards lapsed except for 
the 2012 award which vested subject 
to performance conditions and time 
proration. Mr Hetherington’s deferred 
bonus shares will continue to vest at 
their normal vesting dates.
 > During the year the Committee 
agreed to increase the Chairman’s 
fee to £450,000 in recognition of 
her excellent leadership and 
proven capabilities.
Finally, I would like to thank my fellow 
Committee members as well as the 
internal and external teams who 
supported us with their commitment 
and hard work over the past year.

a) Our remuneration at a glance 
Summary of our strategic priorities
The Executive Director remuneration policy supports Shire’s strategic drivers, which are set out in detail in the Strategy and 
Business model section on page 10 and are summarized below:
 > Growth – Drive performance from our currently marketed products to optimize revenue growth and cash generation.
 > Innovation – Build our future assets through both R&D and business development to deliver innovation and value for the future.
 > Efﬁ ciency – Operate a lean and agile organization and reinvest for growth.
 > People – Foster a high performance culture where we attract and retain the best talent in all aspects of our business.

Part 2 – Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
a) Executive Director remuneration policy 
The purpose of the remuneration policy is to recruit and retain high caliber executives and encourage them to enhance the 
Company’s performance responsibly and in line with the Company’s strategy and shareholder interests. The remuneration 
policy set out in this section is intended to apply for three years from the date of the 2015 AGM, subject to shareholder 
approval. Whilst there is currently no intention to revise the policy more frequently than every three years, the Committee will 
review the policy on an annual basis to ensure it remains strategically aligned and appropriately positioned against the market. 
Where any change to policy is considered, the Committee will consult with major shareholders prior to submitting a revised 
policy for shareholder approval.
The overall remuneration package for the Executive Directors is designed to provide an appropriate balance between fi xed and 
variable, performance-related components, with a signifi cant element of long term variable pay given the long term nature of 
the business. 
In determining the positioning of overall remuneration, the Committee takes into consideration pay levels against a Global 
Biotech peer group and a US BioPharma peer group. These peer groups refl ect the need for Shire to be aligned with the 
Biotech and BioPharma sectors in which the Company operates, the markets in which the Company competes for talent and 
the geographies in which the Company operates. In addition, the FTSE 50 (excluding fi nancial services) is used as a secondary 
reference point, given Shire’s position as a UK listed company. 
The Committee is satisfi ed that the composition and structure of the remuneration package is appropriate and does not 
incentivize undue risk taking.
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and Performance Assessment Opportunity
Fixed elements – Base salary
To recognize the market value of the 
role, an individual’s skills, experience 
and performance and an individual’s 
leadership and contribution to 
Company strategy.
Base salary is paid in cash and is pensionable. 
Individual and corporate performance are factors considered 
during the annual base salary review process. Any increases 
typically take effect on January 1 each year.
Any significant salary increases, such as in cases where Executive 
Directors are relatively new in role, changes in responsibilities or 
significant variance to the market, will be appropriately explained.
Base salary is positioned with reference to 
Global Biotech and US BioPharma peer groups. 
A FTSE 50 (excluding financial services) group is 
used as a secondary reference point. The exact 
positioning depends on a variety of factors such 
as individual experience and performance, total 
remuneration increases across the Company 
and shareholder views.
Where appropriate, base salary increases are 
made in line with the average of employees’ 
salary increases, unless the Committee 
determines otherwise based on the factors 
listed above.
The annual base salaries for the Executive 
Directors are set out in Part 3(a) of this report.
Fixed elements – Retirement and other benefits
To ensure that benefits are 
competitive in the markets in which 
the Company operates.
Executive pension benefits are provided in line with market 
practice in the country in which an Executive is based. 
The Company provides a range of other benefits which may 
include a car allowance, long term disability and life cover, private 
medical insurance and financial and tax advisory support. These 
benefits are not pensionable. Other benefits may be offered if 
considered appropriate by the Committee. 
The Company may also meet certain mobility costs, such as 
relocation support, expatriate allowances, temporary living and 
transportation expenses, in line with the prevailing mobility policy 
and practice for senior executives.
Executive Directors are eligible to participate in the all employee 
share plans operated by the Company, such as the Global 
Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“ESPP”). 
Executive Directors can receive a fixed 
contribution of up to 30% of annual salary by 
way of a retirement benefit provision.
The cost to the Company of providing other 
benefits may vary depending on such things 
as, market practice and the cost of insuring 
certain benefits.  ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 79
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and Performance Assessment Opportunity
Short term incentives – Executive Annual Incentive Plan (“EAIP”) 
To reward individuals with an award 
based on achievement of pre-defined, 
Committee approved corporate 
objectives (the corporate scorecard) 
and the individual’s contributions 
toward achieving those objectives. 
Key performance measures are set 
by the Committee in the context of 
annual performance and ensuring 
progress towards the Company’s 
strategy – to grow value for all our 
stakeholders – focusing and excelling 
in everything we do to meet the 
current and future needs of patients.
In determining EAIP awards for the Executive Directors, the 
Committee considers performance against each of the key 
performance measures within the corporate scorecard, taking 
into account the impact of strategic actions on the Company’s 
performance, the Company’s response to external opportunities 
and events that could not have been predicted at the beginning 
of the year and performance against personal objectives. In 
addition, the Committee may amend the performance measures 
or targets in exceptional circumstances where it considers that 
they are no longer appropriate.
The cash element (75% of any award) is paid in the first quarter of 
the year following the performance year, and the deferred shares 
element (25% of any award) is deferred and normally released 
after a period of three years. The release of deferred shares 
includes dividend shares representing accumulated dividends.
Malus and clawback arrangements are in place. These are 
compliant with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012 (the 
“Code”) and in line with best practice in this area.
Up to 90% of base salary is payable for target 
performance for Executive Directors and up to 
180% is payable for maximum performance, 
although actual payouts can range from 0% 
(threshold performance) upwards.
Each year the Committee determines the 
measures and weightings for the corporate 
scorecard within the following parameters: 
 > At least 75% of the corporate scorecard will 
be based on financial performance; and
 > Non financial corporate scorecard measures 
will be based on other strategic priorities for 
the relevant financial year. For 2015, this will 
be aligned with our four key strategic drivers:
 – Growth;
 – Innovation;
 – Efficiency; and
 – People.
The precise allocation between financial and non 
financial measures (as well as the weightings 
within these measures), will depend on the 
strategic focus of the Company in any given year. 
Long term incentives – Long Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”)
To incentivize individuals to achieve 
sustained growth through superior 
long term performance and to create 
alignment with shareholders.
The LTIP measures, Product 
Sales and Non GAAP EBITDA, 
were selected by the Committee 
as it believes that they represent 
meaningful and relevant 
measurements of performance 
and are an important measure of 
the Company’s ability to meet the 
strategic objective to grow value for all 
our stakeholders.
The Committee reviews annually 
whether the performance measures 
and calibration of targets remain 
appropriate and sufficiently 
challenging taking into account the 
Company’s strategic objectives and 
shareholder interests
LTIP grants for the Executive Directors comprise two types of 
award:
 > SAR awards. A Stock Appreciation Right (“SAR”) is the right 
to receive Ordinary Shares or ADSs linked to the increase in 
value of Ordinary Shares or ADSs from grant to exercise.
 > PSA awards. A Performance Share Award (“PSA”) is the right 
to receive a specified number of Ordinary Shares or ADSs.
SAR and PSA awards granted to Executive Directors vest 
three years from the date of grant, subject to the satisfaction of 
performance measures and are governed by the LTIP rules. SAR 
awards can be exercised up to the seventh anniversary of the 
date of grant. 
Vesting of awards requires the achievement of two independent 
measures: 
 > Product Sales
1
 targets (50% weighting); and 
 > Non GAAP EBITDA
2
 targets (50% weighting). 
The Committee will also use a Non GAAP Adjusted
3
 ROIC 
underpin at the end of the three-year performance period to 
assess the underlying performance of the Company before 
determining final vesting levels. 
The award may include dividend shares representing 
accumulated dividends on the portion of the award that vests.
The Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to the 
measures to reflect significant one off items that occur during the 
vesting period (Significant Adjusting Events (“SAEs”)). Potential 
SAEs are reviewed by the Committee against pre-existing 
guidelines

. The Committee will make full and clear disclosure 
of any such adjustments in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
(“DRR”) at the end of the performance period. 
A two-year holding period will apply following the three-year vesting 
period for both PSAs and SARs. Shares may be sold in order to 
satisfy tax or other relevant liabilities as a result of the award vesting.
Malus and clawback arrangements are in place. These are 
compliant with the Code and in line with best practice in this area.
Executive Directors are encouraged to own shares in the Company 
equivalent to 200% (for the CEO) and 150% (for the CFO) of base 
salary within a five-year period following their appointment. All 
shares beneficially owned by an executive or deferred under the 
EAIP count towards achieving these guidelines.
Maximum annual awards for Executive Directors 
in face value terms are 840% of salary for grants 
under the LTIP , consisting of:
 > 480% of base salary for SAR awards; and 
 > 360% of base salary for PSA awards.
Award levels are set to reflect an individual’s 
role, responsibilities and experience
Threshold vesting is equal to 20% of any award 
made, with maximum vesting being equal to 
100% of any award made.

 Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC reﬂ ects the deﬁ nition used by the Company in its corporate scorecard. This deﬁ nition aims to measure true underlying economic 
performance of the Company, by making a number of adjustments to ROIC as derived from the Company’s Non GAAP ﬁ nancial results including:
 > Adding back to Non GAAP operating income all R&D expenses and operating lease costs incurred in the period;
 > Capitalizing on the Group’s balance sheet historical, cumulative R&D, in process R&D and intangible asset impairment charges and operating lease costs which 
previously have been expensed;
 > Deducting from Non GAAP operating income and amortization charge for the above capitalized costs based on the estimated commercial lives of the relevant 
products;
 > Excluding the income statement and balance sheet impact of non-operating assets (such as surplus cash and non-strategic investments); and
 > Taxing the resulting adjusted operating income at the underlying Non GAAP effective tax rate.

 > The event results from a strategic action that has a short term impact on Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC or Non GAAP EBITDA growth, but is in the long term interest 
of shareholders or the event was external and results in a signiﬁ cant change to the Company’s operating environment;
 > The event is a one off (as opposed to recurring) in nature;
 > The event is “signiﬁ cant” which is deﬁ ned by reference to its impact on Non GAAP EBITDA relative to a materiality threshold; and
 > The event was not taken into account when the performance matrix was set.
Legacy matters in relation to Executive Director remuneration
The Committee will honour remuneration and related commitments to current and former Directors (including the exercise of any discretions available to the 
Committee in relation to such commitments) where the terms were agreed prior to the approval and implementation of the remuneration policy detailed in 
this report.
Notes to the remuneration policy table
Elements of previous policy that continue to apply
The following existing arrangements will continue to operate on the terms and conditions set out in the relevant Portfolio Share 
Plan (“PSP”) rules.
Purpose and link to strategy Operation and Performance Assessment Opportunity
Long term incentives – Portfolio Share Plan (“PSP”)
Previous awards granted to 
incentivize individuals to achieve 
sustained growth through superior 
long term performance and create 
alignment with shareholders’ interests.
Outstanding and unvested awards for the CEO comprise SAR and 
PSA awards. Vesting of PSP awards will be subject to the achievement 
of Non GAAP EBITDA and Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC
 
targets within a 
performance matrix. 
The Committee reserves the right to make adjustments to the measures 
to reflect significant one-off items which occurred during the vesting period 
(SAEs). Potential SAEs are reviewed by the Committee against pre-existing 
guidelines. The Committee will make full and clear disclosure of any such 
adjustments in the relevant DRR at the end of the performance period.
In addition, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the 
underlying financial performance of the Company is sufficient to justify 
the vesting of the awards. 
Malus and clawback arrangements are in place for past awards to 
cover situations where results are materially misstated or in the event 
of serious misconduct.
Where an individual’s employment terminates, the PSP rules provide for 
unvested long term incentive awards to lapse except as set out below.
Under PSP rules, where an individual is determined to be a “good” leaver, 
unvested long term incentive awards vest upon termination subject to 
performance against applicable performance conditions and, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise, pro rating for time. Any Committee 
determination will take into account a number of considerations, in 
particular performance and other circumstances relating to their termination 
of employment.
 > Good leaver reasons include retirement in accordance with the Company’s 
retirement policy, ill health, injury or disability, and redundancy or in other 
circumstances that the Committee determines.
 > Pro rating for time will be calculated on the basis of the number of 
complete weeks in the relevant period during which the executive was 
employed (or would have been employed had the executive remained in 
employment throughout the notice period) as a proportion of the number 
of complete weeks in the relevant period.
The PSP rules provide that unvested awards will normally only vest on a 
change in control to the extent that any performance condition has been 
satisfied, unless the Committee determines otherwise, and would be reduced 
where less than two years have elapsed from the relevant grant date.
Outstanding awards granted to the 
CEO, that were granted in 2013 
and 2014, are set out in Part 3(g) 
of this report. 
Threshold vesting under the 
performance matrix is equal to 25% 
of any award made, with maximum 
vesting being equal to 100%. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 81
Changes to remuneration policy from previous policy
Following a strategic remuneration review during the year, the Executive Director remuneration policy has been revised. The 
following summary sets out the changes when compared to last year’s approved policy. No changes have been made to the 
base salary, retirement and other benefi ts or EAIP policies. 
Policy element Previous policy Changes to policy Rationale for change
Overall 
remuneration 
policy
A “Mid-Atlantic” peer group was used as 
the primary benchmarking reference point 
which comprised a blend of US and UK 
companies, taking into account scale and 
international complexity. 
The Committee will reference pay levels within a 
Global Biotech peer group and a US BioPharma 
peer group. In addition, the FTSE 50 (excluding 
financial services) will be used as a secondary 
reference point. 
Change reflects sectors and 
geographies in which the 
Company operates and the 
markets in which the Company 
competes for talent.
Long term 
incentives
Target levels of award in face value 
terms of: 
 > 400% base salary for SAR awards; and 
 > 300% base salary for PSA awards. 
The Committee had the discretion to 
award between 80% and 120% of these 
levels based on performance.
Maximum opportunity for awards under the LTIP set 
at a face value of 840% of salary:
 > 480% base salary for SAR awards; and 
 > 360% base salary for PSA awards.
Revised quantum is within 
current policy maximum agreed 
by shareholders. However 
fixing awards for the CEO at a 
face value of 840% per annum 
recognizes the competitive gap in 
remuneration that exists relative 
to the Global Biotech and US 
BioPharma and markets.
Vesting of awards subject to the 
achievement of Non GAAP EBITDA and 
Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC targets within 
a performance matrix.
In addition, awards will only vest if the 
Committee determines that the underlying 
financial performance of the Company 
is sufficient to justify the vesting of 
the awards. 
Threshold vesting under the performance 
matrix is equal to 25% of any award 
made, with maximum vesting being 
equal to 100%.
Awards will be tested against two independent 
measures after a three-year performance period: 
 > Product Sales targets (50% weighting); and 
 > Non GAAP EBITDA targets (50% weighting). 
Vesting of awards will be subject to a Non 
GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin at the end of the 
performance period to ensure vesting levels reflect 
the sustainability of revenue and profit.
At threshold performance 20% of any award 
made will vest, with maximum vesting being 
equal to 100%. 
Product Sales, Non GAAP 
EBITDA and Non GAAP Adjusted 
ROIC are directly aligned to the 
business strategy and removal 
of the matrix simplifies the plan 
to enhance transparency for all 
stakeholders. 
Retaining Non GAAP Adjusted 
ROIC as a minimum for any 
vesting ensures a focus on 
quality of earnings, balance 
sheet health and enhancement 
of shareholder value.
No holding period post vesting. Two-year holding period after three-year vesting 
period introduced for both PSA and SAR awards 
granted to Executive Directors from 2015 onwards.
This supports alignment of the 
Executive Directors’ interests with 
that of the long term business 
strategy and shareholders.
Malus and 
clawback
Malus and clawback arrangements for 
short and long term incentive structures 
in place to cover situations where results 
are materially misstated or in the event of 
serious misconduct.
Arrangements for the short and long term incentive 
structures revised in line with the Code requirements.
The Committee believes it 
is appropriate to have the 
power to withhold payments 
in certain circumstances.

Directors’ remuneration report
(continued)
b) Chairman and Non-Executive Director 
Purpose and link to strategy Operation Opportunity
Overall remuneration
To attract and retain high 
caliber individuals by offering 
market competitive fee levels.
The Chairman is paid a single fee for all of his/her responsibilities. 
The Non-Executive Directors are paid a basic fee. The members and 
Chairmen of the main Board committees and the Senior Independent 
Director are paid a committee fee to reflect their extra responsibilities. 
The Chairman and Non-Executive Directors receive 25% of their total 
fees in the form of shares. 
Additional fees may be paid to Non-Executive Directors (excluding the 
Chairman) on a per meeting basis for any non-scheduled Board or 
Committee meetings required in exceptional or unforeseen circumstances, 
up to the relevant fee cap as set out in the Company’s Articles.
The Company reimburses reasonably incurred expenses and Non-
Executive Directors are also paid an additional fee in respect of each 
transatlantic trip made for Board meetings.
The fees paid to the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors 
are not performance related. The Non-Executive Directors do not 
participate in any of the Group share plans, pension plans or other 
employee benefit schemes.
Fees are determined by the Executive 
Directors and the Chairman, with the 
exception of the Chairman’s fee which is 
determined by the Committee. 
To reflect the governance environment in 
which Shire operates fees are benchmarked 
against a UK FTSE 50 (excluding financial 
services) group. As a secondary reference 
point fee levels in the Global Biotech peer 
group and US BioPharma peer group (the 
groups used for the Executive Directors) are 
taken into account.
In addition, the fee levels also take into 
account the anticipated time commitment for 
the role and experience of the incumbent.
The Chairman’s and Non-Executive Directors’ 
fees are reviewed on an annual basis. 
Where appropriate, increases are made with 
reference to the factors listed above and 
average employee salary increases since the 
last increase was applied.
c) Recruitment remuneration policy
The following table sets out the various components which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for 
the appointment of an Executive Director and the approach to be adopted by the Committee in respect of each component. 
Area Policy and operation
Overall > The Committee’s approach when considering the overall remuneration arrangements in the recruitment of a member of 
the Board from an external party is to take account of the Executive Director’s remuneration package in their prior role, 
the market positioning of the remuneration package, and to not pay more than necessary to facilitate the recruitment of 
the individual in question. 
Fixed elements 
(Base salary, retirement 
and other benefits)
 > The salary level will be set with reference to the Company’s Global Biotech and US BioPharma peer groups, with a 
FTSE 50 (excluding financial services) group used as a secondary reference to ensure the positioning is appropriate.
 > The Executive Director shall be eligible to participate in Shire’s employee benefit plans, including coverage under all 
executive and employee pension and benefit programs in accordance with the terms and conditions of such plans, as 
may be amended by the Company in its sole discretion from time to time.
 > The Company may meet certain mobility costs, including but not limited to relocation support, expatriate allowances, 
temporary living and transportation expenses in line with the prevailing mobility policy and practice for senior executives. 
Short term incentives > The appointed Executive Director will be eligible to earn a discretionary annual incentive award in accordance with the 
rules and terms of Shire’s Executive Annual Incentive Plan.
 > The level of opportunity will be consistent with that stated in Part 2(a) of this report.
Long term incentives  > The Executive Director will be eligible for performance based equity awards in accordance with the rules and terms of 
Shire’s Long Term Incentive Plan. 
 > The quantum will be consistent with that stated in Part 2(a) of this report.
Replacement awards > The Committee will consider what replacement awards (if any) are reasonably necessary to facilitate the recruitment of a 
new Executive Director in all circumstances. This includes an assessment of the awards and any other compensation or 
benefits item that would be forfeited on leaving their current employer.
 > The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards such that overall they are not significantly more generous 
in terms of quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited.
 > In determining quantum and structure of these commitments, the Committee will seek to provide broadly equivalent value 
and replicate, as far as practicable, the timing and performance requirements of remuneration foregone. 
 > The Committee will seek to ensure that a meaningful proportion of the replacement awards which are not attributable 
to long term incentives foregone will be delivered in Shire deferred shares, released at a later date and subject to 
continued employment.
 > If the Executive Director’s prior employer pays any portion of the remuneration that was deemed foregone, the 
replacement payments shall be reduced by an equivalent amount.
 > Replacement share awards, if used, will be granted using the Company’s existing long term incentive plan to the extent 
possible, although awards may also be granted outside of this plan if necessary and as permitted under the Listing Rules.
 > In the case of an internal hire, any outstanding awards made in relation to the previous role will be allowed to pay out 
according to their original terms. If promotion is part way through the year, an additional top up award may be made to 
bring the Executive Director’s opportunity to a level that is appropriate in the circumstances. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 83
d) Service contracts and termination arrangements 
Executive Directors
The Committee’s policy on service contracts and termination arrangements for Executive Directors is set out below. As an 
overriding principle, it is the Committee’s policy that there should be no element of reward for failure. The Committee’s approach 
when considering payments in the event of termination is to take account of the individual circumstances including the reason 
for termination, performance, contractual obligations of both parties as well as share plan and pension scheme rules. 
Notice period > The Committee’s policy is that Executive Directors’ service contracts should provide for a notice period of 12 months 
from the Company and the Executive Director.
 > The Committee believes this policy provides an appropriate balance between the need to retain the services of key individuals 
for the benefit of the business and the need to limit the potential liabilities of the Company in the event of termination.
 > Flemming Ornskov’s contract does not have a fixed term but provides for a notice period of 12 months in line with this 
policy. His contract is dated October 24, 2012.
Contractual payments > Executive Directors’ contracts allow for termination with contractual notice from the Company or termination by way of 
payment in lieu of notice, at the Company’s discretion. Neither notice nor a payment in lieu of notice will be given in the 
event of gross misconduct.
 > Payments in lieu of notice could potentially include up to 12 months’ base salary and the cash equivalent of 12 months’ 
pension contributions, car allowance and other contractual benefits. There is no contractual entitlement to annual 
incentive payments in respect of the notice period – any award is at the Committee’s absolute discretion, performance 
related and capped at the contractual target level.
 > Payment in lieu of notice would be made where circumstances dictate that the Executive Directors’ services are not 
required for the full 12 months of their notice period. Contracts also allow for phased payments on termination, which 
allow for further reduction in payments if the individual finds alternative employment outside of the Company during the 
notice period.
Retirement benefits > Normal treatment to apply as governed by the rules of the relevant pension plan; no enhancement for leavers will 
be made.
Short term incentives > Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated after the end of a performance year but before the payment is 
made, the executive will remain eligible for an annual incentive award for that performance year subject to an assessment 
based on performance achieved over the period. Where an award is made the payment may be delivered fully in cash. 
No award will be made in the event of gross misconduct.
 > Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated during a performance year, a pro rata annual incentive award for 
the period worked in that performance year may be payable subject to an assessment based on performance achieved 
over the period.
 > The Committee’s policy is not to award an annual incentive for any portion of the notice period not served.
 > The relevant plan rules provide that any outstanding deferred shares will vest in accordance with the regular vesting 
period, except for where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated for cause in which case they will lapse.
 > In the event of a variation in the equity share capital of the Company, demerger, a special dividend or distribution, or any 
corporate event which might affect the value of an award, the Committee may make adjustments to the number or class 
of stock or securities subject to the award.
Long term incentives > The treatment of unvested long term incentive awards is governed by the rules of the relevant incentive plan, as approved 
by shareholders.
 > Where an individual’s employment terminates, the LTIP rules provide for unvested long term incentive awards to lapse 
except as set out below.
 > Under the LTIP rules, where an individual is determined to be a “good” leaver, unvested long term incentive awards 
will vest at the normal vesting date subject to performance against applicable performance conditions and, unless the 
Committee determines otherwise, pro rating for time. Any Committee determination will take into account a number of 
considerations, in particular performance and other circumstances relating to their termination of employment.
 – Good leaver reasons include retirement in accordance with the Company’s retirement policy, ill health, injury or 
disability, and redundancy or in other circumstances that the Committee determines.
 – Pro rating for time will be calculated on the basis of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period during which 
the Executive was employed as a proportion of the number of complete weeks in the relevant period. Where an 
Executive does not work during their notice period, the Committee may apply pro rating by reference to the date the 
notice period would have expired.
 > Where an Executive Director’s employment is terminated or an Executive Director is under notice of termination for any 
reason at the date of award of any long term incentive awards, no long term incentive awards will be made.
 > In the event of a variation in the equity share capital of the Company, demerger, a special dividend or distribution, or any 
corporate event which might affect the value of an award, the Committee may make adjustments to the number or class 
of stocks or securities subject to the award and, in the case of an option, the option price.
Change in control > In relation to unvested deferred annual bonus awards, the Deferred Bonus Plan rules provide that unvested awards will 
normally vest on a change in control.
 > In relation to unvested long term incentive awards, the LTIP rules provide that unvested awards will normally only vest on 
a change in control to the extent that any performance condition has been satisfied and would be reduced where more 
than a year remains until the relevant vesting date, unless the Committee determines otherwise. 
 > The Committee’s policy is that contracts of employment should not provide additional compensation on severance as 
a result of change in control.

Directors’ remuneration report
(continued)
External appointments
Executive Directors are permitted to hold one fee-paying external non-executive directorship, subject to prior approval by the 
Board. Any fees received from such appointments are retained by the Executive Director. During 2014, there were no external 
non-executive directorships held by the Executive Directors.
Chairman and Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment and are appointed by the Board ordinarily for a term of two years. 
Their initial appointment and any subsequent re-appointment are subject to election, and thereafter annual re-election by 
shareholders. Non-Executive Directors are not entitled to compensation for loss of offi ce.
All Non-Executive Directors are subject to a three-month notice period. 
All service contracts and letters of appointments are available for viewing at the Company’s registered offi ce. 
e) Remuneration scenarios
The composition and value of the CEO’s remuneration package in three performance scenarios is set out in the charts below. 
These show that the proportion of the package delivered through long term incentives supports the long term nature of the 
business and changes signifi cantly across the performance scenarios. The level of remuneration is in accordance with the 
Executive Director remuneration policy set out in Part 2(a) of this report.

  A level of 50% vesting for “on target” performance has been assumed.
The Executive Directors’ remuneration package promotes the achievement of superior long term performance and aligns the 
interests of the Executive Directors with those of shareholders ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 85
f) Shareholder engagement
The Committee takes the views of shareholders very seriously and is committed to ongoing dialog with the Company’s 
shareholder base, which has a signifi cant transatlantic element. This can take a variety of forms including meetings with major 
shareholders to consider signifi cant potential changes to policy or specifi c issues of interest to particular shareholder groups, 
other dialog to update shareholders and receive their feedback on planned refi nements to arrangements, and annual voting 
on the DRR. 
In light of AbbVie terminating its offer for Shire in October 2014, the Committee carried out a shareholder consultation exercise 
in late 2014/early 2015 which included writing to and meeting with many of the Company’s largest shareholders and key 
shareholder advisory bodies. The Committee took the opportunity to discuss proposed changes to the remuneration policy 
for 2015, in particular to the Company’s peer group policy and long term incentive policy. These discussions have informed 
the disclosures in this report, as well as the decisions made by the Committee in determining the remuneration for the 
Executive Directors.
g) Remuneration of other employees
The Committee recognizes that remuneration has an important role to play in supporting the implementation and achievement 
of the Company’s strategy and ongoing performance. When making remuneration decisions in respect of the Executive 
Directors, the Committee is sensitive to pay and employment conditions across the Company, in particular in relation to base 
salary decisions where the Committee considers the broader employee salary increase budget. The Committee approves the 
overall annual bonus funding for the Company each year and has oversight over the grant of all LTIP awards across the 
Company. In addition, annual performance for the Executive Directors is measured against the backdrop of the same 
corporate scorecard that is appropriately used to assess performance across the organization. This assessment of corporate 
scorecard performance includes a review of Non GAAP EBITA, Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC and cost management performance, 
adjusted to exclude the impact of the annual bonus corporate modifi er on the full year results.
Given Shire’s diverse employee base, employing approximately 5,000 people in 34 locations, the Committee does not consider 
it appropriate to consult with employees over the remuneration policy for Executive Directors. However, many of the 
Company’s employees are shareholders through the Company’s all employee share plans, and are therefore able to express 
their views on Director remuneration at each general meeting. The Company also periodically carries out an employee 
engagement survey which provides employees the opportunity to feedback their views on a variety of employment related 
matters, including remuneration. 
The diagram set out on the following page illustrates how our remuneration policy and arrangements reinforce the achievement 
of Shire’s success and ensures that Executives and employees are focused on delivering the same core objectives.

Overall remuneration 
The structure and quantum of individual remuneration packages varies by geography, role and level of responsibility. 
In general, the proportion of variable remuneration in the total remuneration package increases with level of responsibility within the Company.
These act as a framework for remuneration 
decisions across the Company
Clear and 
understandable 
• Remuneration 
should be clear and 
understandable so that 
it can have real impact
• Employees should 
understand the rationale 
for each element of 
remuneration and, 
where relevant, the link 
between performance 
and their reward
Strategically and 
culturally aligned 
• Remuneration should 
reflect and align with our 
business strategy and 
organizational culture
• Equity ownership can 
drive the right, long term 
behaviours and 
alignment, in particular 
for leaders
Performance oriented
 
• The way remuneration 
is structured and 
communicated 
can promote a 
performance culture
• Employees should be 
rewarded based on 
their contribution to 
value creation
Competitive 
• Remuneration must be 
market competitive in 
order to attract and retain 
talent as well as to avoid 
overpaying
Relevant to employees
• Each element of the 
package should be 
valued by employees 
and, as far as 
practicable, meet 
their differing needs 
and preferences
• The ability to impact 
company value 
should influence the 
remuneration mix for 
employees
2 1 3 4 5
Fixed elements
(base salary and benefits) 
> Employees’ base salaries are 
benchmarked against the relevant market 
taking into account the companies with 
whom we compete for talent, geography 
and, where relevant, company size.
> For example, market data for the most 
senior leadership roles, in particular the 
Executive Committee, reflects both the 
geographies in which we operate (with 
over two-thirds of employees as well as 
the majority of senior management based 
in the US) and companies of a comparable 
size in the pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology sectors. 
> Base salary increases across the 
Company are determined in light of similar 
factors as described for the Executive 
Directors.
> Retirement and other benefit 
arrangements are provided to employees 
with appropriate consideration of market 
practice and geographical differences.
Short term incentives 
> For Executive Directors’ short term 
incentives, assessment is made against a 
corporate scorecard of key performance 
measures built around Shire’s key 
financial goals and other strategic 
priorities for the relevant year.
> This same scorecard is appropriately 
used by each business and corporate 
function to ensure alignment with 
corporate goals, and also funds short 
term incentives across the Company.
> Scorecard targets are further used as a 
basis for determination of each 
employee’s performance objectives, with 
annual incentive awards payable in cash, 
strongly differentiated based on individual 
performance through linkages with the 
performance management system.
Long term incentives 
> Discretionary long term equity awards are 
made on an annual basis dependent on 
an employee’s level of responsibility within 
the Company and individual performance.
> For Executive Directors, Executive 
Committee members and Executive Vice 
Presidents, all awards vest at the end of a 
three-year period. 
> For the rest of the employee population, 
phased vesting of awards occurs over a 
period of three years with the majority 
vesting at the end of the three year period.

Part 3 – Annual Report on Remuneration
a) Implementation of Directors’ Remuneration Policy in 2015
In 2015, the Executive Director and Non-Executive Director remuneration policies will be implemented as follows:
Executive Director remuneration policy
Fixed elements – Base salary
Following the year end review, the Committee made the decision to award Dr. Ornskov a base salary increase of 3.8%, to give 
him an annual base salary of $1,350,000 (effective January 1, 2015) which is in line with the disclosed policy in Part 2(a) of this 
report. This decision refl ected strong corporate performance, excellent leadership and the wider average employee salary 
increases of 3.74% across Shire.
2014 salary 2015 salary % change
Flemming Ornskov $1,300,000 $1,350,000 3.8%
Fixed elements – Retirement and other benefits
The implementation of policy in relation to pension and benefi ts is unchanged and in line with the disclosed policy in Part 2(a) 
of this report.
Short term incentives – EAIP
There is no change to the level of EAIP award opportunity for Executive Directors.
The 2015 EAIP will continue to use a scorecard approach and will be comprised of 75% fi nancial and 25% non fi nancial 
performance measures. This weighting recognizes the critical importance of fi nancial results to our shareholders, bonus 
affordability and the important role that non fi nancial performance plays in the success and growth of the Company. These 
measures are aligned with and support our four key strategic drivers for 2015 of Growth, Innovation, Effi ciency and People. 
The targets themselves are considered to be commercially sensitive on the grounds that disclosure could damage the 
Company’s commercial interests. However, retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be 
provided in next year’s DRR to the extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time. Financial and non 
fi nancial targets are set at the start of the performance year and are approved by the Committee, which believes the targets 
are suitably stretching, relevant and measurable. The 2015 corporate scorecard is set out below:
Strategic Drivers Weighting Financial KPIs (weighting)

Long term incentives – LTIP
Following the year end review, the Committee made the following 2015 LTIP award decisions which are in line with the disclosed 
policy in Part 2(a) of this report. These will be made following shareholder approval of the revised Policy at the 2015 AGM:

Flemming Ornskov
SAR 96% 480% $6,480
PSA 72% 360% $4,860
20% of the award will be payable for threshold performance. There is no vesting below this performance level. 100% of the 
award will be payable for maximum performance, which would result in the total award vesting, with straight line vesting within 
this performance range. In all cases, awards will only vest if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the 
Company is suffi cient to justify the vesting of the award.
For the 2015 grant and subsequent policy years, the Committee has determined that LTIP awards will be tested against two 
independent measures at the end of a three-year performance period: 50% Product Sales targets and 50% Non GAAP 
EBITDA targets. The Committee will also use a Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin at the end of the performance period to 
ensure vesting levels refl ect the sustainability of revenue and profi t growth.
The 2015 LTIP targets for Product Sales and Non GAAP EBITDA are based off the 10 x 20 Plan as approved by the Board in 
June 2014 and are considered appropriately stretching by the Committee. The weightings, threshold and maximum target 
fi gures are provided in the table below.
Performance measures Weighting

Non GAAP EBITDA

50% $3,300m $3,675m

  This is a Non GAAP ﬁ nancial measure. For reconciliation to US GAAP please see page 166.
Product Sales targets are expressed as absolute dollar values in line with the 10 x 20 Plan communicated to shareholders 
in June 2014. Non GAAP EBITDA targets have also been expressed as absolute dollar values for consistency between 
the measures.
The Committee has determined that the calibration of these proposed targets is suffi ciently challenging without incentivizing 
inappropriate risk-taking by management, taking into account both Shire’s long range plans as well as brokers’ forecasts.
The Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC underpin will be set at a minimum of 11% for the 2015 LTIP award. If Non GAAP Adjusted 
ROIC over the performance period is below this level no vesting will occur under the LTIP , subject to Remuneration Committee 
discretion. This will ensure awards only pay out for a return in excess of Shire’s Weighted Average Cost of Capital and maintain 
focus on quality of earnings and sustainable returns both in the existing core business and from any future M&A activity.
A two-year holding period will apply following the three-year vesting period for both PSAs and SARs.
Clawback and malus arrangements are in place for awards to cover situations where results are materially misstated or in the 
event of serious misconduct.

The value represents the market value of the 2012 PSP awards for Graham Hetherington which vested upon his departure from 
the Company on March 1, 2014
There is no scheduled vesting of PSP awards for Dr. Ornskov until 2016 when his 2013 PSP awards (2013-2016 performance 
period) vest subject to the achievement of applicable performance conditions.
For Mr. Hetherington, the Committee determined that the 2012 PSP awards would vest in line with the terms of the plan rules 
taking into account the applicable performance conditions and the proportion of the performance period (approximately 
two-thirds) during which Mr. Hetherington remained in employment (see table below).

e) Departure Arrangements for Graham Hetherington (subject to audit)
As disclosed in last year’s DRR, Mr. Hetherington stepped down from Shire’s Board of Directors and his role as CFO on March 
1, 2014. In line with the Committee’s policy, the Committee considered the overall circumstances of the departure as well as 
performance, contractual obligations and plan rules. In particular, the Committee considered Mr. Hetherington’s sustained 
performance and contribution to the Company over a period of almost six years, the excellent 2013 fi nancial results and 
confi dent outlook at the time of departure. The Committee’s determinations, which were consistent with the Committee’s 
termination policy, are set out below.
Remuneration
element Description
Payment in 
Lieu of Notice
No payment in respect of salary or benefits (or compensation in lieu) in respect of any period after March 1, 2014 or compensation 
for loss of office was made. 
Base salary No 2014 base salary increase was awarded given his scheduled departure from the Company.
Retirement and 
other benefits
The Committee determined that it would be appropriate to continue the same level of medical insurance under the Company’s 
private medical scheme until December 31, 2014 and to pay his reasonable legal costs incurred in connection with his departure 
arrangements. The cost of these benefits is included in the 2014 summary remuneration table. 
EAIP No 2014 short term incentives in respect of his period of employment to, or in respect of any period after, March 1, 2014 was 
awarded. Mr. Hetherington was employed throughout the relevant performance period for the 2013 EAIP , therefore payments under 
the 2013 EAIP were made as normal. 
Those elements of Mr. Hetherington’s EAIP awards from previous years that were compulsorily deferred into shares under the EAIP

 The release of deferred shares will include dividend shares representing any accrued dividends, in accordance with the relevant 
plan rules.
3
 Based on the closing share price as at March 3, 2014 (as departure date of March 1, 2014 was a Saturday).
PSP No 2014 PSP grant was made given Mr. Hetherington’s departure date. 
The Committee determined that the 2012 PSP award would vest on the departure date in line with the terms of the plan rules taking 
into account the applicable performance conditions and the proportion of the performance period (approximately two-thirds) during 
which Mr. Hetherington remained in employment. The 2012 PSP vesting values are provided in the table in Part 3(b) of this report. 
Vested SAR awards, in accordance with the terms of the PSP , remain exercisable for a period of 12 months after the departure date, 
and if not exercised will lapse. All other unvested equity awards, namely the 2013 PSP award and 2013 Sharesave, lapsed when 
Mr. Hetherington ceased to be employed. 
Mr. Hetherington was employed throughout the relevant performance period for the 2011 PSP award, therefore the award vested 
as normal. 
f) Payments to past Directors (subject to audit)
No payments (other than payments made to Graham Hetherington set out above) have been made to past Directors for the 
relevant fi nancial year for the purposes of the Schedule 8 Regulations.

g) Directors’ shareholdings and scheme interests (subject to audit)
Employee share ownership is an important means to support alignment of employee interests with those of shareholders
The Committee believes that employee share ownership is an important means to support long term commitment to the 
Company and the alignment of employee interests with those of shareholders.
The interests of the Executive Directors and other senior executives are closely aligned with those of other shareholders in this 
regard through the operation of the Company’s LTIP and, for the Executive Committee, the deferral of one quarter of any EAIP 
award into shares for a period of three years. These remuneration elements constitute a signifi cant proportion of their individual 
remuneration packages.
In addition, to ensure that there are appropriate tools to retain Executive Directors and to encourage alignment with 
shareholders over the long term through increased shareholding and ownership, the Committee has introduced a two-year 
holding period post the three-year performance period which applies to both PSAs and SARs.
The CEO, CFO and other members of the Executive Committee are encouraged to own shares in the Company equivalent 
to 200%, 150% and 100% of base salary, respectively, within a fi ve-year period following their appointment. All shares 
benefi cially owned by an executive or deferred under the EAIP count towards achieving these guidelines. The Committee 
reviews share ownership levels annually for this group. Current shareholding levels for Directors are set out in the table below 
and show that the shareholding guidelines for the Executive Directors have been achieved.

The Company also operates broad-based share plans (a Sharesave scheme in the UK and an ESPP in the US and other 
countries) to encourage wider share ownership among the Company’s employees.
Awards under the Company’s long term incentive plans and broad-based share plans are satisfi ed either by market purchased 
shares which are held in an employee benefi t trust or the issue of new shares within the limits agreed by shareholders when 
the plans were approved. These limits comply with the Investment Association’s guidelines which require that no more than 
10% of a company’s issued share capital be issued in accordance with all employee share plans in any 10-year period, with no 
more than 5% issued in accordance with discretionary employee share plans.

The number of PSA and SAR awards granted in 2011 and subsequently is calculated using an approach based on the average three day closing mid-market 
share price at the time of grant. The number of PSA and SAR awards granted in 2010 was calculated using an approach based on the average closing 
mid-market share price over the prior 12 month period.
1
 Awards are over Ordinary Shares, except where the award type is marked “ADS”. One ADS is equal to three Ordinary Shares. 
2
 The maximum SAR and PSA awards are granted and, subject to the achievement of performance conditions, adjusted at the date of vesting.
3
 Performance conditions attached to SAR and PSA awards granted from 2010 onwards are Non GAAP Adjusted ROIC and Non GAAP EBITDA. In all cases, awards 
will only vest if the Committee determines that the underlying performance of the Company is sufﬁ cient to justify the vesting of the award.
4
 In accordance with the plan rules, the vested PSA awards have been increased to reﬂ ect the dividends paid by Shire in the period from the grant date to the vesting 
date.
5
 On October 31, 2014 Dr. Ornskov exercised an option granted under the Shire ESPP over 109 ADSs at an exercise price of $113.94 per ADS. The PSA award 
granted to Dr. Ornskov on May 2, 2013 was over 10,821 ADSs, and not 10,281 ADSs as previously disclosed.

h) TSR performance graph
The graph below shows the Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”) for Shire and the FTSE 100 Index over the six-year period ending 
December 31, 2014. TSR is calculated as the change (indexed) between the fourth quarter TSR in the relevant year and the 
base year. The FTSE 100 Index refl ects the 100 largest quoted companies by market capitalization in the United Kingdom and 
has been chosen because the FTSE 100 represents the broad market Index within which the Company’s shares are traded. 
Total Shareholder Return – change in value of a hypothetical £100 holding over six years

i) Percentage change in CEO remuneration
The following table shows the percentage change in the base salary, taxable benefi ts and annual bonus of the CEO between 
the current and previous fi nancial year compared to the average percentage change for all other employees.

  Reﬂ ects the 2013 and 2014 remuneration for Flemming Ornskov as reported in the single total ﬁ gure of remuneration table in Part 3(b) of this report.
2
  Reﬂ ects the average change in remuneration for all other employees globally that were annual bonus eligible. To help minimise distortions in the underlying data, 
certain adjustments have been made, in particular the ﬁ gures have been prepared on the basis of permanent employees who have been employed with the 
Company for the two preceding calendar years.
The increase in the CEO’s salary and fees from 2013 to 2014 is due to the CEO designate position he held from January 2, 
2013 to April 29, 2013 and the lower CEO designate salary of $900,000 he received during this period. For 2015, the CEO’s 
salary has been increased to $1,350,000, representing a 3.8% increase from 2014 to 2015 and refl ecting strong corporate 
performance, excellent leadership and the wider average employee salary increases across Shire.
Given that the CEO’s short term incentive is calculated as a percentage of salary, the lower CEO designate salary received in 
2013 is also refl ected in his 2013 annual bonus fi gure. Most of those employees participating in the annual bonus plan received 
a higher bonus in 2014 than 2013, as did the CEO, refl ective of the exceptional performance of the Company this year.
j) Relative importance of spend on pay
The Company considers employee remuneration costs in the context of the general fi nancial performance and position of the 
Company, including when determining the annual salary increase budget, the annual equity grant budget and annual bonus 
funding for the organization. 
The following graphs set out for 2013 and 2014 the overall spend on pay, shareholder distributions (dividends and share 
buybacks) and for further context, Non GAAP EBITDA (from continuing operations).

Shareholders distributions were reduced in 2014 as 2013 included amounts under the Company’s share buy back plan which 
commenced October 25, 2012 and ceased on November 11, 2013. Overall Spend on Pay was reduced in 2014 mainly as a 
result of the One Shire restructuring towards the end of 2013 and through 2014 which has driven cost effi ciencies across our 
employee base. Non GAAP EBITDA increased in 2014 as a result of the strong product sales growth and effi cient cost 
management delivered during the year.

commitments, where applicable. The Committee also determines performance targets applicable to the Company’s annual 
bonus and long term incentive plans, and has oversight of the Company’s share incentive schemes. In December 2014, the 
Committee reviewed its terms of reference and a number of minor changes were made to refl ect various governance 
developments. The revised terms of reference were approved by the Board in February 2015 and are available in full on the 
Company’s website www.shire.com.

Advisors
In discharging its responsibilities in 2014, the Committee was materially assisted by those employees performing the roles 
of Chief Human Resources Offi cer and Vice President, Total Rewards. In addition, PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (“PwC”), 
appointed by the Committee, continued to serve as independent external advisor to the Committee following a competitive 
tendering process in early 2012. PwC also provided global consultancy services to the Company in 2014, primarily in respect 
of tax matters. Fees paid to PwC in relation to remuneration services provided to the Committee totaled £292,000 in 2014 and 
were determined based on the scope and nature of the projects undertaken for the Committee.
The Committee is satisfi ed that the advice received by PwC in relation to executive remuneration matters during the year was 
independent. The Committee reviewed the potential for confl icts of interest and judged that there were appropriate safeguards 
against any potential confl icts. PwC is a member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group which operates a code of conduct 
in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK.

Directors
Appointment and replacement 
Directors may be appointed by the Company by ordinary 
resolution or by the Board. Non-Executive Directors are 
appointed ordinarily for a term of two years, subject to 
shareholder approval. Re-appointment of Non-Executive 
Directors following the expiry of their term of appointment is 
subject to Board approval. The Board may, from time-to-time, 
appoint one or more Directors for such period and on such 
terms as it may determine and may also revoke or terminate 
any such appointment.
The Company’s Articles of Association (the “Articles”) provide 
that at each Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) all those 
Directors who have been appointed by the Board since the 
last AGM, or who held offi ce at the time of the two preceding 
AGMs and who did not retire at either of them, or who held 
offi ce with the Company, other than executive offi ce, for a 
continuous period of nine years or more at the date of the 
meeting, shall retire from offi ce and may offer themselves 
for re-election by the members.
Notwithstanding the provisions in the Articles, in accordance 
with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2012, all Directors 
will be subject to annual re-election.
Powers
Subject to the provisions of the Companies (Jersey) Law 
1991, as amended (the “Companies Act”), the Articles and 
directions given by the Company in general meeting by 
special resolution, the business of the Company is managed 
by the Board which may exercise all the powers of the 
Company whether relating to the management of the 
business of the Company or not. In particular, the Board may 
exercise all the powers of the Company to borrow money 
and to mortgage or charge all or any part of the undertaking, 
property and assets (present and future) and uncalled capital 
of the Company and, subject to the Companies Act, to issue 
debentures and other securities, whether outright or as 
collateral security, for a debt, liability or obligation of the 
Company or of a third party.
Liability insurance and indemnification
In the year under review the Group maintained an insurance 
policy for its Directors and Offi cers in respect of liabilities 
arising out of any act, error or omission whilst acting in their 
capacity as Directors or Offi cers. Qualifying third party 
indemnity provisions were also in place during the year under 
review for the benefi t of Directors in relation to certain losses 
and liabilities which they may potentially incur to third parties 
in the course of their duties. These remain in force at the date 
of this report.
Interests in material contracts 
Other than the insurance/indemnity provisions disclosed 
under “Liability insurance and indemnifi cation” above, none 
of the Directors had a material interest in any contract of 
signifi cance to which the Company or any of its subsidiary 
undertakings was a party during the period under review.
Dividends
Subject to the provisions of the Companies Act, the Company 
may by ordinary resolution, from time-to-time, declare 
dividends not exceeding the amount recommended by the 
Board. Subject to the Companies Act, the Board may pay 
interim dividends, and also any fi xed rate dividend, whenever 
the fi nancial position of the Company, in the opinion of the 
Board, justifi es its payment.
The Board may withhold payment of all or any part of any 
dividends or other monies payable in respect of the shares 
from a person with a 0.25% interest (as defi ned in the 
Articles) if such person has been served with a restriction 
notice (as defi ned in the Articles) after failure to provide the 
Company with information concerning interests in those 
shares required to be provided under the Articles.
Shire has put in place income access share arrangements 
which enable shareholders to elect to receive their dividends 
from a Group company resident for tax purposes in the UK. 
Further information is available in Note 23 to the consolidated 
fi nancial statements.
In respect of the six months to December 31, 2014, the Board 
resolved to pay an interim dividend of 19.09 US cents   
(2013: 16.93 US cents) per Ordinary Share. Together with the 
fi rst interim dividend payment of 3.83 US cents (2013: 3.00 
US cents) per Ordinary Share, this represents total dividends 
of 22.92 US cents (2013: 19.93 US cents) per Ordinary Share 
for the year ended December 31, 2014.
ACS HR Solutions Share Plan Services (Guernsey) Limited 
(the “Trustee”), trustee of the Shire Employee Benefi t Trust 
(the “Trust”), has waived its entitlement to any dividends 
which become due and payable, from time-to-time, in respect 
of shares or other securities which are registered in the name 
of the trustee or its nominee(s). Total dividends waived by the 
Trustee during the year amounted to £350,638.32.

Shares
Share capital
As at the year ended December 31, 2014, the Company’s 
issued share capital comprised 599,057,502 Ordinary Shares 
of 5 pence each of which 9,019,832 Ordinary Shares were 
held in treasury.
Rights and obligations attaching to shares 
The rights and obligations attaching to the Ordinary Shares 
are set out in the Articles which are available on the 
Company’s website. The Articles may only be amended 
by special resolution of the members of the Company.
Variation of rights
Subject to the Companies Act, rights attached to any class 
of shares may be varied with written consent of the holders of 
not less than two-thirds in nominal value of the issued shares 
of that class (calculated excluding any shares held in treasury) 
or with the sanction of a special resolution passed at a 
separate meeting of the holders of those shares. At each 
such separate general meeting, except an adjourned meeting, 
the quorum shall be two persons holding or representing by 
proxy not less than one third in nominal value of the issued 
shares of that class (calculated excluding any shares held 
in treasury).
Issuance of shares
Subject to applicable statutes and subject to and without 
prejudice to any rights attached to existing shares, shares 
may be issued with such rights and restrictions as the 
Company may by special resolution decide or, if no such 
resolution has been passed or so far as the resolution does 
not make specifi c provision, as the Board may decide. 
Subject to the Articles, the Companies Act and other 
shareholders’ rights, unissued shares are at the disposal 
of the Board.
Restrictions on transfer of shares 
There are no restrictions on the transfer of shares in the 
Company, except (i) that certain restrictions may, from 
time-to-time, be imposed by laws and regulations (for 
example insider trading laws); and (ii) pursuant to the Listing 
Rules of the UK Financial Conduct Authority whereby certain 
Directors and employees of the Company require the 
approval of the Company to deal in the Company’s 
Ordinary Shares.
Voting
It is the Company’s practice to hold a poll on every resolution 
at general meetings. Every member present in person or by 
proxy has, upon a poll, one vote for every share held by him. 
In the case of joint holders of a share the vote of the senior 
who tenders a vote, whether in person or by proxy, shall 
be accepted to the exclusion of the votes of the other joint 
holders and, for this purpose, seniority shall be determined by 
the order in which the names stand in the register of members 
in respect of the joint holding.
Restrictions on voting
No member shall, unless the Board otherwise decides, 
be entitled to attend or vote at any general or class meeting 
in respect of any shares held if any call or other sum payable 
by that member remains unpaid. Also, a member may not 
be entitled to attend or vote if served with a restriction notice 
(as defi ned in the Articles).
The Company is not aware of any agreements between 
holders of securities that may result in restrictions on 
voting rights.
The Company maintains an American Depositary Receipt 
(“ADR”) program in the US. Each American Depositary 
Share (“ADS”) represents three Ordinary Shares. An ADS is 
evidenced by an ADR issued by Citibank, N.A. as Depositary, 
and is listed on the NASDAQ Global Select Market. Each ADS 
holder is entitled to the fi nancial rights attached to such 
shares although the ADR Depositary is the registered holder 
of the underlying Ordinary Shares.
As at December 31, 2014, the Trust held 0.25% of the issued 
share capital of the Company on trust for the benefi t of 
participants in the Company’s employee share plans. The 
voting rights in relation to these shares are exercised by the 
Trustee. The Trustee may vote or abstain from voting in any 
way it thinks fi t and in doing so may take into account both 
fi nancial and non-fi nancial interests of the benefi ciaries of 
the Trust or their dependants. Historically the Trustee has 
not exercised its right to vote.
Purchase of own shares
At its AGM held on April 29, 2014 the Company was 
authorized, until the earlier of July 28, 2015 or the conclusion 
of the 2015 AGM, to make market purchases of up to 
58,878,332 of its own Ordinary Shares. Further details 
regarding purchases by the Company of its own shares can 
be found in Note 23 to the consolidated fi nancial statements.

Signiﬁ cant agreements
The following signifi cant agreements contain provisions 
entitling counterparties to exercise the following rights in 
the event of a change of control of the Company:
 > Under the $2,100 million credit facility agreement dated 
December 12, 2014, between, amongst others, the 
Company and a number of its subsidiaries, Barclays Bank plc 
(as the facility agent) and the banks and ﬁ nancial institutions 
named therein as lenders, upon a change of control any 
lender may, following not less than 30 days’ notice, cancel 
its commitments and require prepayment of its participation 
in any outstanding loans. For these purposes, a change of 
control occurs if any person or group of persons acting in 
concert gains the ability to control more than half the votes 
at a general meeting of the Company or holds more than 
half the equity share capital of the Company. A waiver of 
the mandatory prepayment provision would require the 
consent of each lender under the agreement. On February 
23, 2015, Shire requested the utilization of $1,300 million 
under the agreement. 
 > Under the $2,600 million term loan agreement dated 
November 11, 2013, between, amongst others, the 
Company and a number of its subsidiaries, Barclays Bank plc 
(as the facility agent) and the banks and ﬁ nancial institutions 
named therein as lenders, upon a change of control any 
lender may, following not less than 30 days’ notice, cancel its 
commitments and require prepayment of its participation in 
any outstanding loans. For these purposes, a change of 
control occurs if any person or group of persons acting in 
concert gains the ability to control more than half the votes at 
a general meeting of the Company or holds more than half 
the equity share capital of the Company. A waiver of the 
mandatory prepayment provision would require the consent 
of each lender under the agreement. On December 13, 
2013, and at various points during the year ended December 
31, 2014, the Company canceled part of the $2,600 million 
term loan facility. As at February 24, 2015, the agreement 
comprised a fully utilized $850 million term loan facility which 
matures on November 11, 2015. 
 > Under the $850 million term facility agreement dated January 
11, 2015, between, amongst others, Citibank International 
Limited (as the facility agent), upon a change of control any 
lender may, following not less than 30 days’ notice, cancel its 
commitments and require prepayment of its participation in 
any outstanding loans. For these purposes, a change of 
control occurs if any person or group of persons acting in 
concert gains the ability to control more than half the votes 
at a general meeting of the Company or holds more than 
half the equity share capital of the Company. A waiver of 
the mandatory prepayment provision would require the 
consent of each lender under the agreement. On February 
23, 2015, Shire requested the utilization of $850 million 
under the agreement.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 106 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the fi nancial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare fi nancial 
statements for each fi nancial year. Under that law the 
Directors are required to prepare the Group fi nancial 
statements in accordance with accounting principles 
generally accepted in the United States of America. Under 
company law the Directors must not approve the accounts 
unless they are satisfi ed that they give a true and fair view 
of the state of affairs of the Group and of the profi t or loss 
of the Group for that period. 
In preparing the Group fi nancial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 > properly select and apply accounting policies;
 > present information, including accounting policies, in a 
manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
 > provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
speciﬁ c requirements within accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America are insufﬁ cient 
to enable users to understand the impact of particular 
transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s 
ﬁ nancial position and ﬁ nancial performance; and
 > make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are suffi cient to show and explain the 
Group’s transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy 
at any time the fi nancial position of the Group and enable 
them to ensure that the fi nancial statements comply with the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and fi nancial information included 
on the Group’s website. Legislation in Jersey governing the 
preparation and dissemination of fi nancial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibilities statement 
Responsibility statement 
We confi rm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > the Financial Statements, prepared in accordance with the 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, 
ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole;
 > the Strategic Report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
Group and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and
 > the Annual Report and Financial Statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Group’s performance, business model and strategy.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
The acquisition of ViroPharma Inc (“ViroPharma”)
The Director’s determination of the purchase price allocation for the 
acquisition of ViroPharma is included at Note 4.
We identified a risk that the allocation of purchase price to acquired 
assets and liabilities in relation to the ViroPharma acquisition are not 
appropriate.
The underlying judgments made in arriving at fair value include key 
assumptions as to:
 > the product market, pricing and patient growth over the life cycle of 
the intangible assets relating to the currently marketed products 
CINRYZE, PLENADREN
®
 and BUCCOLAM
®
;
 > the probabilities of clinical success for In Process Research & 
Development intangible assets, taking into account the stage of 
completion and the remaining risks and uncertainties surrounding 
the future development and commercialisation; and
 > other factors such as units of account, applicable tax rate and 
discount factors.
This has been highlighted as a significant risk due to its size (consideration 
of $3,997 million) and the complexity of judgments required.
In order to assess the allocation of the purchase price to acquired 
ViroPharma assets and liabilities we have the tested the Group’s relevant 
controls and performed testing including the following specific procedures: 
 > veriﬁ ed the consideration paid and the structure of the acquisition as 
reﬂ ected in the ﬁ nancial statements to the executed agreements;
 > assessed the qualiﬁ cations and experience of key specialists engaged 
by the Group;
 > considered the Directors use of specialist’s input and the Directors’ 
underlying judgments in determining the key assumptions for 
both currently marketed products and In Process Research & 
Development assets;
 > considered the appropriateness of valuation methodologies used and 
the accuracy of calculations; and
 > considered the residual goodwill arising against benchmarks arising 
from other large transactions in the pharmaceutical sector.
US rebates and sales deductions
A description of the key accounting policy for sales deductions is included 
at note 2(d).
The Directors are required to make certain judgments in respect of the 
level of rebates and other sales deductions that will be realized against 
the Group’s sales. 
The most significant of these judgments relate to rebates for Medicaid 
and Managed Care programs in the US for the Neuroscience, GI and 
IM business units. As at 31 December 2014 the Group held accrued 
rebates of $564 million and $318 million for Medicaid and Managed 
care respectively.
The key elements of the judgments relating to Medicaid and Managed 
Care rebates include:
 > the size of the wholesale and retail inventory pipeline;
 > the proportion of the inventory pipeline that will attract speciﬁ c 
rebates; and
 > the future value of rebate per unit expected to be applicable.
We identified a risk that these judgments are not appropriate and 
as a result rebate liabilities and sales deductions are recorded at 
an incorrect level.
We have considered the Group’s processes for making judgments in this 
area and performed the following procedures:
 > considered the appropriateness of the process and tested the controls 
adopted by management in determining the accounting for rebates 
and other sales deductions;
 > undertaken an analysis of the historical accuracy of judgments by 
reference to actual rebates paid in prior periods;
 > conﬁ rmed rebate levels accrued during the year against subsequent 
payments;
 > analysed and recalculated components the year end liability based on 
contracted and statutory rebate rates; and
 > challenged the key elements of judgments that were made in the period 
in light of externally veriﬁ able data and industry practice.
We also evaluated the presentation and disclosure of the transactions within 
the Group financial statements.
Opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements of Shire plc
In our opinion the consolidated fi nancial statements of Shire 
plc and subsidiaries (together the “Group”):
 > give a true and fair view of the state of Shire plc and 
subsidiaries’ affairs (together the Group) as at December 31, 
2014 and of the Group’s proﬁ t for the year then ended;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United 
States of America; and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
The fi nancial statements comprise the consolidated 
balance sheet, the consolidated statement of income, 
the consolidated statement of comprehensive income, 
the consolidated statement of changes in equity, the 
consolidated statement of cash fl ows and the related Notes 
1 to 31. The fi nancial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the Group fi nancial statements 
is applicable law and accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United States of America.
Going concern
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement on page 106 that 
the Group is a going concern. 
We confi rm that:
 > we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the ﬁ nancial 
statements is appropriate; and
 > we have not identiﬁ ed any material uncertainties that may 
cast signiﬁ cant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as 
a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be 
predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s 
ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below 
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Complex tax judgments
As Shire transacts globally within a complex group structure, significant 
judgment is required in determining the level of tax provisions. 
We identified a risk that the judgments made by the Directors are 
inappropriate.
In the current year the most significant judgment related to the tax treatment 
of the break fee of $1.6billion received from AbbVie Inc (“AbbVie”).
As disclosed in Note 26 the Directors have assessed the tax treatment 
of the $1.6billion AbbVie break fee and concluded that this receipt should 
not be taxable in Ireland.
We have reviewed and challenged management’s conclusion by:
 > reviewing the Group’s submission to the Irish tax authorities and the 
advice received by the Group from third party legal counsel and other 
advisors;
 > consulting with our own taxation experts to consider the associated fact 
pattern and to challenge the judgments made; and
 > testing the appropriateness of the process and controls adopted by 
management in making the key judgments and the controls over the 
entity prepared documents used in the control.
The impairment of In Process Research & Development 
intangible assets has not been separately reported on in the 
current year because we focused principally on assets 
acquired in the acquisition of ViroPharma as set out above.
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction 
with the signifi cant issues considered by the Audit Committee 
discussed on page 67.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed 
in the context of our audit of the fi nancial statements as a 
whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts 
or disclosures. Our opinion on the fi nancial statements is not 
modifi ed with respect to any of the risks described above, and 
we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We defi ne materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
fi nancial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or infl uenced. We use materiality both in planning 
the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of 
our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be $70 million 
(2013: $60 million), which is below 5% (2013: 5%) of adjusted 
pre-tax profi t, and below 2% (2013: 2%) of equity. Pre-tax 
profi t has been adjusted by removing the impact of one off 
items such as impairments of intangible assets (see Note 26) 
and the $1.6 billion break fee received from AbbVie. In the 
prior year we also adjusted our materiality calculation to 
exclude the derecognition of the Group’s contingent 
consideration liability in respect of SARcode.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to the Committee all audit differences in excess of $3 million 
(2013: $3 million), as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters 
that we identifi ed when assessing the overall presentation of 
the fi nancial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding 
of the Group and its environment, including Group-wide 
controls, and assessing the risks of material misstatement 
at the Group level. 
Based on that assessment, we focused our Group audit 
scope primarily on the audit work in four territories; US 
(based in Lexington MA, and Chesterbrook PA), UK, Ireland 
and Switzerland. These locations represent the principal 
operations and account for 99% (2013: 94%) of the Group’s 
net assets, 80% (2013: 82%) of the Group’s revenue. 
 Full audit scope 80
 Review scope 20
They were also selected to provide an appropriate basis 
for undertaking audit work to address the risks of material 
misstatement identifi ed above. Our audit work at the four 
locations was performed at a materiality level calculated 
by reference to a proportion of Group materiality appropriate 
to the relative scale of the business concerned. 
At Group level we also audited the consolidation process and 
carried out analytical procedures to confi rm our conclusion 
that there were no signifi cant risks of material misstatement 
of the aggregated fi nancial information of the remaining 
components not subject to full scope audit procedures.
The Group audit team follows a program of planned site visits 
that is designed to ensure that the Senior Statutory Auditor or 
his designate visits each of the full scope locations during the 
year. In addition to this the Group audit team will visit other 
locations not in full scope on a rotational basis. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 109
Opinion on other matters prescribed by engagement letter
In our opinion:
 > the ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with the provisions of the Companies Act 2006 
that would have been applied were the Group incorporated in 
the United Kingdom;
 > the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited 
has been properly prepared in accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 that would have 
been applied were the Group incorporated in the United 
Kingdom; and
 > the information given in the Strategic Report and the 
Directors’ Report for the ﬁ nancial year for which the 
ﬁ nancial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting 
records
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
 > proper accounting records have not been kept, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
 > the ﬁ nancial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Corporate governance statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the 
part of the Corporate governance statement relating to the 
company’s compliance with ten provisions of the UK 
Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report 
arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), 
we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information 
in the annual report is:
 > materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
ﬁ nancial statements; or
 > apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired 
in the course of performing our audit; or
 > otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identifi ed any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that 
they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the audit 
committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
We confi rm that we have not identifi ed any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation 
of the fi nancial statements and for being satisfi ed that they 
give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and 
express an opinion on the fi nancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
We also comply with International Standard on Quality 
Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools 
aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, 
understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review team 
and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an Auditor’s report and/or 
those further matters we expressly agreed to report to them 
on in our engagement letter and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the fi nancial statements suffi cient to give 
reasonable assurance that the fi nancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of signifi cant accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and the overall presentation of the fi nancial 
statements. In addition, we read all the fi nancial and non-
fi nancial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited fi nancial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
(In millions of US dollars, except where indicated)
1. Description of operations
Shire plc and its subsidiaries (collectively referred to as either 
“Shire”, or the “Company”) is a leading biopharmaceutical 
company that focuses on developing and marketing 
innovative specialty medicines for patients with rare diseases 
and other specialty conditions. 
The Company has grown both organically and through 
acquisition, completing a series of major transactions that 
have brought therapeutic, geographic and pipeline growth 
and diversifi cation. The Company will continue to conduct 
its own R&D, focused on rare diseases, as well as evaluate 
companies, products and pipeline opportunities that offer a 
good strategic fi t and have the potential to deliver value 
to all of the Company’s stakeholders: patients, physicians, 
policy makers, payers, investors and employees.
2. Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies
(a) Basis of preparation
The accompanying consolidated fi nancial statements include 
the accounts of Shire plc, all of its subsidiary undertakings 
and the Income Access Share trust, after elimination of 
inter-company accounts and transactions. They have been 
prepared in accordance with generally accepted accounting 
principles in the United States of America (“US GAAP”) and 
US Securities and Exchange Commission (“SEC”) regulations 
for annual reporting.
(b) Use of estimates in consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
The preparation of consolidated fi nancial statements, in 
conformity with US GAAP and SEC regulations, requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
consolidated fi nancial statements and reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to 
the valuation of intangible assets, sales deductions, income 
taxes (including provisions for uncertain tax positions and the 
realization of deferred tax assets), provisions for litigation and 
legal proceedings, contingent consideration receivable from 
product divestments, contingent consideration payable in 
respect of business combinations and asset purchases and 
assets held for sale. If actual results differ from the 
Company’s estimates, or to the extent these estimates are 
adjusted in future periods, the Company’s results of 
operations could either benefi t from, or be adversely affected 
by, any such change in estimate.
(c) Revenue recognition
The Company recognizes revenue when all of the following 
conditions are met:
 > there is persuasive evidence of an agreement 
or arrangement;
 > delivery of products has occurred or services 
have been rendered;
 > the seller’s price to the buyer is ﬁ xed or 
determinable; and
 > collectability is reasonably assured.
Where applicable, all revenues are stated net of value added 
and similar taxes, and trade discounts. No revenue is 
recognized for consideration, the value or receipt of which 
is dependent on future events or future performance.
The Company’s principal revenue streams and their 
respective accounting treatments are discussed below:
Product sales
Revenue for the sale of products is recognized when 
delivery has occurred and substantially all the risks and 
rewards of ownership have been transferred to the customer. 
Provisions for rebates, product returns and discounts to 
customers are provided for as reductions to revenue in 
the same period as the related sales are recorded. 
The provisions made at the time of revenue recognition are 
based on historical experience and updated for changes 
in facts and circumstances including the impact of new 
legislation and loss of a product’s exclusivity. These 
provisions are recognized as a reduction to revenues.
Royalty income
Royalty income relating to licensed technology is 
recognized when the licensee sells the underlying product, 
with the amount of royalty income recorded based on sales 
information received from the relevant licensee. The Company 
estimates sales amounts and related royalty income based on 
the historical product information for any period that the sales 
information is not available from the relevant licensee.
Licensing revenues
Other revenue includes revenues derived from product 
out-licensing arrangements, which typically consist of an 
initial up-front payment to Shire by the licensee on inception 
of the license and subsequent milestone payments to 
Shire by the licensee, contingent on the achievement of 
certain clinical and sales milestones. Product out-licensing 
arrangements often require the Company to provide multiple 
deliverables to the licensee.
Initial license fees received in connection with product 
out-licensing agreements entered into prior to January 1, 
2011 were deferred and are recognized over the period in 
which the Company has continuing substantive performance 
obligations, typically the period over which the Company 
participates in the development of the out-licensed product, 
even where such fees are non-refundable and not creditable 
against future royalty payments.
For product out-licencing arrangements entered into, or 
subject to material modifi cation, after January 1, 2011, 
consideration received is allocated between each of the 
separable elements in the arrangement using the relative 
selling price method. An element is considered separable 
if it has value to the customer on a stand-alone basis. 
The selling price used for each separable element will be 
based on vendor specifi c objective evidence (“VSOE”) 
if available, third party evidence if VSOE is not available, 
or estimated selling price if neither VSOE nor third party 
evidence is available. Revenue is then recognized as each 
of the separable elements to which the revenue has been 
allocated is delivered.
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 118 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
(continued)
(e) Collaborative arrangements
The Company enters into collaborative arrangements 
to develop and commercialize drug candidates. 
These collaborative arrangements often require up-front, 
milestone, royalty or profi t share payments, or a combination 
of these, with payments often contingent upon the success 
of the related development and commercialization efforts. 
Collaboration agreements entered into by the Company 
may also include expense reimbursements or other such 
payments to the collaborating partner.
The Company reports costs incurred and revenue generated 
from transactions with third parties as well as payments 
between parties to collaborative arrangements either on a 
gross or net basis, depending on the characteristics of the 
collaborative relationship.
(f) Cost of product sales
Cost of product sales includes the cost of purchasing fi nished 
product for sale, the cost of raw materials and manufacturing 
for those products that are manufactured by the Company, 
shipping and handling costs, depreciation and amortization 
of intangible assets in respect of favorable manufacturing 
contracts. Royalties payable to third party intellectual property 
owners on sale of Company’s products are also included in 
Cost of product sales.
(g) Leased assets
The costs of operating leases are charged to operations 
on a straight-line basis over the lease term, even if rental 
payments are not made on such a basis.
Assets acquired under capital leases are included in the 
consolidated balance sheet as property, plant and equipment 
and are depreciated over the shorter of the period of the 
lease or their useful lives. The capital element of future 
lease payments is recorded as a liability, while the interest 
element is charged to operations over the period of the 
lease to produce a level yield on the balance of the capital 
lease obligation.
(h) Advertising expense
The Company expenses the cost of advertising as incurred. 
Advertising costs amounted to $56.4 million, $60.9 million 
and $85.8 million for the years to December 31, 2014, 
2013 and 2012 respectively and were included within 
Selling, general and administrative (“SG&A”) expenses.
(i) Research and development (“R&D”) expense
R&D costs are expensed as incurred. Up-front and milestone 
payments made to third parties for in-licensed products that 
have not yet received marketing approval and for which no 
alternative future use has been identifi ed are also expensed 
as incurred.
Milestone payments made to third parties on and subsequent 
to regulatory approval are capitalized as intangible assets, 
and amortized over the remaining useful life of the 
related product.
Milestone payments which are non-refundable, non creditable 
and contingent on achieving certain clinical milestones are 
recognized as revenues either on achievement of such 
milestones if the milestones are considered substantive or 
over the period the Company has continuing substantive 
performance obligations, if the milestones are not considered 
substantive. If milestone payments are creditable against 
future royalty payments, the milestones are deferred and 
released over the period in which the royalties are anticipated 
to be paid.
(d) Sales deductions 
(i) Rebates
Rebates primarily consist of statutory rebates to state 
Medicaid agencies and contractual rebates with health-
maintenance organizations. These rebates are based on 
price differentials between a base price and the selling price. 
As a result, rebates generally increase as a percentage of the 
selling price over the life of the product (as prices increase). 
Provisions for rebates are recorded as reductions to revenue 
in the same period as the related sales are recorded, with the 
amount of the rebate based on the Company’s best estimate 
if any uncertainty exists over the unit rebate amount, and with 
estimates of future utilization derived from historical trends.
(ii) Returns
The Company estimates the proportion of recorded revenue 
that will result in a return, based on historical trends and when 
applicable, specifi c factors affecting certain products at the 
balance sheet date. The accrual is recorded as a reduction to 
revenue in the same period as the related sales are recorded. 
(iii) Coupons 
The Company uses coupons as a form of sales incentive. An 
accrual is established based on the Company’s expectation 
of the level of coupon redemption, estimated using historical 
trends. The accrual is recorded as a reduction to revenue in 
the same period as the related sales are recorded or the date 
the coupon is offered, if later than the date the related sales 
are recorded.
(iv) Discounts
The Company offers cash discounts to customers for 
the early payment of receivables which are recorded as 
reductions to revenue and accounts receivable in the same 
period as the related sale is recorded.
(v) Wholesaler chargebacks
The Company has contractual agreements whereby it 
supplies certain products to third parties at predetermined 
prices. Wholesalers acting as intermediaries in these 
transactions are reimbursed by the Company if the 
predetermined prices are less than the prices paid by 
the wholesaler to the Company. Accruals for wholesaler 
chargebacks, which are based on historical trends, are 
recorded as reductions to revenue in the same period 
as the related sales are recorded.
2. Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (continued) ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 119
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
(m) Income taxes
Uncertain tax positions are recognized in the consolidated 
fi nancial statements for positions which are considered more 
likely than not of being sustained, based on the 
technical merits of the position on audit by the tax 
authorities. The measurement of the tax benefi t recognized 
in the consolidated fi nancial statements is based upon 
the largest amount of tax benefi t that, in management’s 
judgment, is greater than 50% likely of being realized based 
on a cumulative probability assessment of the possible 
outcomes. The Company recognizes interest and penalties 
relating to unrecognized tax benefi ts within income taxes.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties relating to 
income taxes within income taxes. Interest income on 
cash required to be deposited with the tax authorities is 
recognized within interest income.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are recognized for 
differences between the carrying amounts of assets and 
liabilities in the consolidated fi nancial statements and the 
tax bases of assets and liabilities that will result in future 
taxable or deductible amounts. The deferred tax assets 
and liabilities are measured using the enacted tax laws 
and rates applicable to the periods in which the differences 
are expected to affect taxable income. 
Deferred tax assets are reduced by a valuation allowance 
when, in the opinion of management, it is more likely than 
not that some portion or all of the deferred tax assets will 
not be realized.
(n) Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is based upon net income 
attributable to the Company divided by the weighted 
average number of Ordinary Shares outstanding during 
the period. Diluted earnings per share is based upon net 
income attributable to the Company adjusted for the impact 
of interest expense on convertible debt on an “if-converted” 
basis (when the effect is dilutive and prior to the actual 
conversion or redemption of such debt) divided by the 
weighted average number of Ordinary Share equivalents 
outstanding during the period, adjusted for the dilutive 
effect of all potential Ordinary Shares equivalents that were 
outstanding during the year. Such potentially dilutive shares 
are excluded when the effect would be to increase diluted 
earnings per share or reduce the diluted loss per share. 
(o) Share-based compensation
Share-based compensation represents the cost of share-
based awards granted to employees. The Company 
measures share-based compensation cost for awards 
classifi ed as equity at the grant date, based on the estimated 
fair value of the award. Predominantly all of the Company’s 
awards have service and/or performance conditions and 
the fair values of these awards are estimated using a 
Black-Scholes valuation model. 
(j) Valuation and impairment of long-lived assets 
other than goodwill, indeﬁ nite lived intangible assets 
and investments
The Company evaluates the carrying value of long-lived 
assets other than goodwill, indefi nite lived intangible 
assets and investments for impairment whenever events 
or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying 
amounts of the relevant assets may not be recoverable. 
When such a determination is made, management’s estimate 
of undiscounted cash fl ows to be generated by the use and 
ultimate disposition of these assets is compared to the 
carrying value of the assets to determine whether the carrying 
value is recoverable. If the carrying value is deemed not to be 
recoverable, the amount of the impairment recognized in the 
consolidated fi nancial statements is determined by estimating 
the fair value of the relevant assets and recording an 
impairment loss for the amount by which the carrying value 
exceeds the estimated fair value. This fair value is usually 
determined based on estimated discounted cash fl ows.
(k) Finance costs of debt
Finance costs relating to debt issued are recorded as 
a deferred charge and amortized to the consolidated 
statements of income over the period to the earliest 
redemption date of the debt, using the effective interest 
rate method. On extinguishment of the related debt, any 
unamortized deferred fi nancing costs are written off and 
charged to interest expense in the consolidated statements 
of income.
(l) Foreign currency
Monetary assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are 
translated into the functional currency of the relevant 
subsidiary in which they arise at the rate of exchange ruling at 
the balance sheet date. Transactions in foreign currencies are 
translated into the relevant functional currency at the rate of 
exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Transaction 
gains and losses, other than those related to current and 
deferred tax assets and liabilities, are recognized in arriving 
at income from operations before income taxes and equity in 
earnings of equity method investees. Transaction gains and 
losses arising on foreign currency denominated current and 
deferred tax assets and liabilities are included within income 
taxes in the consolidated statements of income.
The results of operations for subsidiaries, whose functional 
currency is not the US Dollar, are translated into the US Dollar 
at the average rates of exchange during the period, with the 
subsidiaries’ balance sheets translated at the rates ruling at 
the balance sheet date. The cumulative effect of exchange 
rate movements is included in a separate component of 
Other comprehensive income.
Foreign currency exchange transaction losses included 
in consolidated statements of income in the years to 
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 amounted to 
$15.6 million, $8.7 million and $3.5 million, respectively.
2. Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (continued) 120 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
(continued)
Inventories include costs relating to both marketed products 
and, for certain products, cost incurred prior to regulatory 
approval. Inventories are capitalized prior to regulatory 
approval if the Company considers that it is highly probable 
that the US Food and Drug Administration (“FDA”) or another 
regulatory body will grant commercial and manufacturing 
approval for the relevant product, and it is highly probable 
that the value of capitalized inventories will be recovered 
through commercial sale.
Inventories are written down for estimated obsolescence or 
unmarketable inventory equal to the difference between the 
cost of inventory and estimated market value based upon 
assumptions about future demand and market conditions. 
If actual market conditions are less favorable than those 
anticipated, inventory adjustments may be required. 
(s) Assets held-for-sale
An asset or asset disposal group is classifi ed as held-for-sale 
when, amongst other things, the Company has committed 
to a plan of disposition, the asset or asset disposal group is 
available for immediate sale, and the plan is not expected to 
change signifi cantly. Assets held-for-sale are carried at the 
lower of their carrying amount or fair value less cost to sell.
The Company does not record depreciation or amortization 
on assets classifi ed as held-for-sale.
(t) Investments
The Company has certain investments in pharmaceutical and 
biotechnology companies.
Investments are accounted for using the equity method of 
accounting if the investment gives the Company the ability 
to exercise signifi cant infl uence, but not control over, the 
investee. Signifi cant infl uence is generally deemed to exist if 
the Company has an ownership interest in the voting stock of 
the investee between 20% and 50%, although other factors 
such as representation on the investee’s Board of Directors 
and the nature of commercial arrangements, are considered 
in determining whether the equity method of accounting is 
appropriate. Under the equity method of accounting, the 
Company records its investments in equity-method investees 
in the consolidated balance sheet under Investments and its 
share of the investees’ earnings or losses together with 
other-than-temporary impairments in value under equity in 
earnings of equity method investees in the consolidated 
statements of income.
All other equity investments, which consist of investments 
for which the Company does not have the ability to exercise 
signifi cant infl uence, are accounted for under the cost 
method or at fair value. Investments in private companies are 
carried at cost, less provisions for other-than-temporary 
impairment in value. For public companies that have readily 
determinable fair values, the Company classifi es its equity 
investments as available-for-sale and, accordingly, records 
these investments at their fair values with unrealized holding 
gains and losses included in the consolidated statement of 
comprehensive income, net of any related tax effect. Realized 
gains and losses, and declines in value of available-for-sale 
securities judged to be other-than-temporary, are included in 
other income, net. The cost of securities sold is based on the 
specifi c identifi cation method. Interest on securities classifi ed 
as available-for-sale are included as interest income.
For share-based compensation awards which cliff vest, the 
Company recognizes the cost of the relevant share-based 
payment award as an expense on a straight-line basis (net 
of estimated forfeitures) over the employee’s requisite service 
period. For those share-based compensation awards with a 
graded vesting schedule, the Company recognizes the cost 
of the relevant share-based payment award as an expense 
on a straight-line basis (net of estimated forfeitures) over the 
requisite service period for the entire award (that is, over the 
requisite service period for the last separately vesting portion 
of the award). The share-based compensation expense is 
recorded in Cost of product sales, R&D, SG&A and 
Reorganization costs in the consolidated statements of 
income based on the employees’ respective functions.
The Company records deferred tax assets for awards that 
result in deductions on the Company’s income tax returns, 
based on the amount of compensation cost recognized and 
the Company’s statutory tax rate in the jurisdiction in which 
it will receive a deduction. Differences between the deferred 
tax assets recognized for fi nancial reporting purposes and 
the actual tax deduction reported on the Company’s 
income tax return are recorded in additional paid-in capital 
(if the tax deduction exceeds the deferred tax asset) or in the 
consolidated statements of income (if the deferred tax asset 
exceeds the tax deduction and no additional paid-in capital 
exists from previous awards).
The Company’s share-based compensation plans are 
described more fully in Note 30.
(p) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents are defi ned as short-term highly 
liquid investments with original maturities of 90 days or less. 
(q) Financial instruments – derivatives 
The Company uses derivative fi nancial instruments to 
manage its exposure to foreign exchange risk principally 
associated with intercompany fi nancing. These instruments 
consist of swap and forward foreign exchange contracts. 
The Company does not apply hedge accounting for these 
instruments. The fair values of these instruments are included 
on the balance sheet in current assets/liabilities, with changes 
in the fair value recognized in the consolidated statements 
of income. The cash fl ows relating to these instruments are 
presented within net cash provided by operating activities 
in the consolidated statement of cash fl ows, unless the 
derivative instruments are economically hedging specifi c 
investing or fi nancing activities.
(r) Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost or market. Cost 
incurred in bringing each product to its present location and 
condition is based on purchase costs calculated on a fi rst-in, 
fi rst-out basis, including transportation costs.
2. Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (continued) ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 121
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Goodwill is reviewed for impairment by comparing the 
carrying value of the reporting unit’s net assets (including 
allocated goodwill) to the fair value of the reporting unit. 
If the reporting unit’s carrying amount is greater than its 
fair value, a second step is performed whereby the portion 
of the reporting unit’s fair value relating to goodwill is 
compared to the carrying value of the reporting unit’s 
goodwill. The Company recognizes a goodwill impairment 
charge for the amount by which the carrying value of goodwill 
exceeds its estimated fair value. In the year to December 31, 
2013 the Company has recorded an impairment charge of 
$198.9 million related to the goodwill allocated to the 
Company’s former Regenerative Medicine (“RM”) reporting 
unit. See Note 13 for further details.
(ii) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets principally comprise intellectual 
property rights for products with a defi ned revenue stream, 
acquired product technology and IPR&D. Intellectual property 
rights for currently marketed products and acquired product 
technology are recorded at fair value and amortized over the 
estimated useful life of the related product, which ranges from 
4 to 23 years (weighted average 18.6 years). IPR&D acquired 
through a business combination is capitalized as an indefi nite 
lived intangible asset until the completion or abandonment of 
the associated R&D efforts. IPR&D is reviewed for impairment 
using a “one-step” approach which compares the fair value of 
the IPR&D asset with its carrying amount. An impairment loss 
is recognized to the extent that the carrying value exceeds 
the fair value of the IPR&D asset. Once the R&D efforts 
are completed the useful life of the relevant assets will be 
determined, and the IPR&D asset amortized over this useful 
economic life. 
The following factors, where applicable, are considered in 
estimating the useful lives of Other intangible assets:
 > expected use of the asset;
 > regulatory, legal or contractual provisions, including the 
regulatory approval and review process, patent issues and 
actions by government agencies;
 > the effects of obsolescence, changes in demand, competing 
products and other economic factors, including the stability 
of the market, known technological advances, development 
of competing drugs that are more effective clinically or 
economically; 
 > actions of competitors, suppliers, regulatory agencies 
or others that may eliminate current competitive 
advantages; and
 > historical experience of renewing or extending similar 
arrangements.
When a number of factors apply to an intangible asset, these 
factors are considered in combination when determining the 
appropriate useful life for the relevant asset.
(u) Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is shown at cost reduced for 
impairment losses, net of accumulated depreciation. The cost 
of signifi cant assets includes capitalized interest incurred 
during the construction period. Depreciation is recorded on a 
straight-line basis at rates calculated to write off the cost less 
estimated residual value of each asset over its estimated 
useful life as follows:
Buildings 15 to 50 years
Offi ce furniture, fi ttings and 
equipment 3 to 10 years
Warehouse, laboratory and 
manufacturing equipment 3 to 15 years
The cost of land is not depreciated. Assets under the course 
of construction are not depreciated until the relevant assets 
are available and ready for their intended use.
Expenditures for maintenance and repairs are charged to the 
consolidated statements of income as incurred. The costs 
of major renewals and improvements are capitalized. At the 
time property, plant and equipment is retired or otherwise 
disposed of, the cost and accumulated depreciation are 
eliminated from the asset and accumulated depreciation 
accounts. The profi t or loss on such disposition is refl ected 
in operating income.
(v) Goodwill and other intangible assets
(i) Goodwill
In business combinations completed subsequent to January 
1, 2009, goodwill represents the excess of the fair value of the 
consideration given and the fair value of any non-controlling 
interest in the acquiree over the fair value of the identifi able 
assets and liabilities acquired. For business combinations 
completed prior to January 1, 2009 goodwill represents the 
excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the 
fair value of the identifi able assets and liabilities acquired.
Goodwill is not amortized, but instead is reviewed for 
impairment, at least annually or whenever events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying value may not 
be recoverable. For the purpose of assessing the carrying 
value of goodwill for impairment, goodwill is allocated at 
the Company’s reporting unit level. Events or changes in 
circumstances which could trigger an impairment review 
include but are not limited to: signifi cant underperformance 
of a reporting unit relative to expected historical or projected 
future operating results; signifi cant changes in the manner of 
the Company’s use of acquired assets or the strategy for the 
overall business; and signifi cant negative industry trends.
2. Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (continued) 122 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
(continued)
To be adopted in future periods
Reporting discontinued operations and disclosures of 
disposals of components of an entity
In April 2014 the FASB issued guidance on the reporting 
of discontinued operations and disclosures of disposals 
of components of an entity. The amendments in this 
update revise the defi nition of discontinued operations by 
limiting discontinued operations reporting to disposals of 
components of an entity that represent strategic shifts that 
have (or will have) a major effect on an entity’s operations and 
fi nancial results. The guidance requires expanded disclosures 
for discontinued operations which provide users of fi nancial 
statements with more information about the assets, liabilities, 
revenues, and expenses of discontinued operations. The 
guidance also requires an entity to disclose the pre-tax profi t 
or loss of an individually signifi cant component of an entity 
that does not qualify for discontinued operations reporting. 
The guidance will be effective for disposals (or classifi cations 
as held-for-sale) of components of an entity that occur within 
annual periods beginning on or after December 15, 2014. 
Early adoption is permitted, but only for disposals (or 
classifi cations as held-for-sale) that have not been reported 
in fi nancial statements previously issued or available for 
issuance. The Company does not expect the adoption of 
this guidance to have a material effect on its consolidated 
fi nancial position, results of operations and cash fl ows.
Revenue from Contracts with Customers
In May 2014 the FASB and the International Accounting 
Standards Board (together as the “Accounting Standards 
Boards”) issued a new accounting standard that is intended 
to clarify and converge the fi nancial reporting requirements 
for revenue from contracts with customers. The core principle 
of the standard is that an “entity recognizes revenue to depict 
the transfer of promised goods or services to customers in 
an amount that refl ects the consideration to which the entity 
expects to be entitled in exchange for those goods or 
services”. To achieve that core principle the Accounting 
Standard Boards developed a fi ve-step model (as presented 
below) and related application guidance, which will replace 
most existing revenue recognition guidance in US GAAP . 
Five-step model:
Step 1: Identify the contract(s) with a customer. 
Step 2: Identify the performance obligations in the contract. 
Step 3: Determine the transaction price. 
Step 4:  Allocate the transaction price to the performance 
obligations in the contract. 
Step 5:  Recognize revenue when (or as) the entity satisfi es 
a performance obligation.
The Accounting Standards Boards also issued new qualitative 
and quantitative disclosure requirements as part of the new 
accounting standard which aims to enable fi nancial statement 
users to understand the nature, amount, timing, and 
uncertainty of revenue and cash fl ows arising from contracts 
with customers. The guidance is effective for annual periods 
beginning after December 15, 2016. Early adoption is not 
permitted. The Company is currently evaluating the impact 
of adopting this guidance.
(w) Non-monetary transactions 
The Company enters into certain non-monetary transactions 
that involve either the granting of a license over the 
Company’s patents or the disposal of an asset or group of 
assets in exchange for a non-monetary asset, usually equity. 
The Company accounts for these transactions at fair value 
if the Company is able to determine the fair value within 
reasonable limits. To the extent the Company concludes that 
it is unable to determine the fair value of a transaction that 
transaction is accounted for at the recorded amounts of the 
assets exchanged. Management is required to exercise its 
judgment in determining whether or not the fair value of the 
asset received or given up can be determined.
(x) New accounting pronouncements
Adopted during the periods
Push down accounting in a business combination
In November 2014 the Financial Accounting Standards 
Board (“FASB”) issued guidance on whether and at what 
threshold an acquired entity that is a business can apply 
pushdown accounting in its separate fi nancial statements. 
The amendments in this update provide an acquired entity 
with an option to apply pushdown accounting in its separate 
fi nancial statements upon occurrence of an event in which 
an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. An acquired 
entity should determine whether to elect to apply pushdown 
accounting for each individual change-in-control event in 
which an acquirer obtains control of the acquired entity. 
If pushdown accounting is not applied in the reporting 
period in which the change-in-control event occurs, an 
acquired entity will have the option to elect to apply 
pushdown accounting in a subsequent reporting period to 
the acquired entity’s most recent change-in-control event. 
An election to apply pushdown accounting in a reporting 
period after the reporting period in which the change-in-
control event occurred should be considered a change in 
accounting principle in accordance with Topic 250, 
Accounting Changes and Error Corrections. If pushdown 
accounting is applied to an individual change-in-control 
event, that election is irrevocable. If an acquired entity 
elects the option to apply pushdown accounting in its 
separate fi nancial statements, it should disclose information 
in the current reporting period that enables users of fi nancial 
statements to evaluate the effect of pushdown accounting.
The amendments in this update became effective on 
November 18, 2014. After the effective date, an acquired 
entity can make an election to apply the guidance to future 
change-in-control events or to its most recent change-in-
control event. However, if the fi nancial statements for the 
period in which the most recent change-in-control event 
occurred already have been issued or made available to be 
issued, the application of this guidance would be a change 
in accounting principle. The guidance has been adopted on 
November 18, 2014. The adoption of the guidance did not 
impact the Company’s consolidated fi nancial position, 
results of operations or cash fl ows.

3. Critical accounting estimates 
The preparation of consolidated fi nancial statements, in 
conformity with accounting principles generally accepted in 
the United States (“US GAAP”) and SEC regulations, requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, disclosure of 
contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the 
consolidated fi nancial statements and reported amounts of 
revenues and expenses during the reporting period. 
Estimates and assumptions are primarily made in relation to 
the valuation of intangible assets, sales deductions, income 
taxes (including provisions for uncertain tax positions and the 
realization of deferred tax assets), provisions for litigation and 
legal proceedings, contingent consideration receivable from 
divestments of products or businesses and contingent 
consideration payable in respect of business combinations 
and asset purchases. If actual results differ from the 
Company’s estimates, or to the extent these estimates are 
adjusted in future periods, the Company’s results of 
operations could either benefi t from, or be adversely affected 
by, any such change in estimate.
(i) Valuation of intangible assets
In accordance with US GAAP the Company classifi es 
intangible assets into three categories: (1) fi nite lived 
intangible assets, which are amortized over their estimated 
useful lives; (2) intangible assets with indefi nite lives, which 
are not subject to amortization; and (3) goodwill. 
At December 31, 2014 the carrying value of the Company’s 
fi nite lived intangible assets was $3,384 million (2013: $1,361 
million; 2012: $2,157 million), the carrying value of the 
Company’s indefi nite lived intangible assets was $1,550 
million (2013: $952 million; 2012: $231 million), and the 
carrying value of the Company’s goodwill was $2,475 million 
(2013: $625 million; 2012: $645 million). The Company’s 
indefi nite lived intangible assets relate solely to IPR&D assets 
acquired through business combinations.
Elimination of Certain Financial Reporting Requirements, 
Including an Amendment to Variable Interest Entities 
Guidance in Topic 810, Consolidation
In June 2014 the FASB issued guidance on the reporting 
requirements for development stage entities. The 
amendments in this update simplify the existing guidance 
by removing all incremental fi nancial reporting requirements 
for development stage entities. The amendments also 
eliminate an exception provided with respect to development 
stage entities in Topic 810, Consolidation, for determining 
whether an entity is a variable interest entity on the basis of 
the amount of equity that is at risk. The elimination of the 
exception may change the consolidation analysis, 
consolidation decision, and disclosure requirements for 
a reporting entity that has an interest in an entity in the 
development stage. The guidance to eliminate the exception 
to the suffi ciency-of-equity-at-risk criterion for development 
stage entities should be applied retrospectively for annual 
reporting periods beginning after December 15, 2015, and 
interim periods therein. Early application of both of these 
amendments is permitted for any annual reporting period or 
interim period for which the entity’s fi nancial statements have 
not yet been issued. The Company is currently evaluating the 
impact of adopting this guidance.
Disclosure of Uncertainties about an Entity’s Ability to 
Continue as a Going Concern
In August 2014 the FASB issued guidance about 
management’s responsibility to evaluate whether there is 
substantial doubt about an entity’s ability to continue as a 
going concern and to provide related footnote disclosures. 
An entity’s management should evaluate whether there are 
conditions or events, considered in the aggregate, that raise 
substantial doubt about the entity’s ability to continue as a 
going concern within one year after the date that the fi nancial 
statements are issued (or within one year after the date that 
the fi nancial statements are available to be issued when 
applicable). Management’s evaluation should be based on 
relevant conditions and events that are known and reasonably 
knowable at the date that the fi nancial statements are issued 
(or available to be issued). Substantial doubt about an entity’s 
ability to continue as a going concern exists when relevant 
conditions and events, considered in the aggregate, indicate 
that it is probable that the entity will be unable to meet its 
obligations as they become due within one year after the date 
that the fi nancial statements are issued (or available to be 
issued). The term probable is used consistently with its use 
in topic 450, Contingencies. The amendments in this update 
are effective for the annual period ending after December 15, 
2016, and for annual periods and interim periods thereafter. 
Early application is permitted. The Company does not expect 
the adoption of this guidance to have a material effect on its 
consolidated fi nancial position, results of operations and 
cash fl ows.
(y) Statutory accounts
The consolidated fi nancial statements as at December 31, 
2014 and 2013, and for each of the three years in the period 
to December 31, 2014 do not comprise statutory accounts 
within the meaning of Section 434 of the UK Companies Act 
2006 or Article 104 of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
2. Summary of signiﬁ cant accounting policies (continued) 124 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
(continued)
(i)  Initial valuation of intangible assets acquired through 
business combinations
The Company accounts for business combinations using the 
acquisition method of accounting, which requires that the 
assets acquired and liabilities assumed be recorded at the 
date of acquisition at their respective fair values. Any excess 
of the fair value of consideration given and the fair value 
of any noncontrolling interest over the fair values of the 
identifi able assets and liabilities acquired is recorded as 
goodwill. The determination of the estimated fair values 
of acquired intangible assets, including determining the 
appropriate unit of account for each intangible asset, as well 
as the useful economic life ascribed to fi nite lived intangible 
assets, requires the use of signifi cant judgment. The use of 
different estimates and assumptions to those used by the 
Company could result in a materially different valuation of 
acquired intangible assets, which could have a material effect 
on the Company’s results of operations. 
US GAAP provides acquirers with a reasonable time to obtain 
the information necessary to identify and measure the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed in a business combination 
(a measurement period). The measurement period cannot 
exceed more than one year from the acquisition date. 
In accordance with US GAAP , if the initial accounting for 
a business combination is incomplete by the end of the 
reporting period in which the acquisition occurred, the 
Company reports in its fi nancial statements preliminary 
amounts for those items for which the accounting is 
incomplete, which may include intangible assets acquired. 
During the measurement period, the Company considers all 
pertinent factors to determine whether new information 
obtained after the acquisition date regarding the values of 
intangible assets should result in an adjustment to the 
provisional amounts recognized or whether that new 
information results from events that occurred after the 
acquisition date and should result in an adjustment through 
current period earnings. Depending upon the nature of this 
new information, signifi cant judgment may be required in 
determining whether the adjustment should be refl ected as 
an adjustment to provisional amounts or adjusted through 
current period earnings. Application of a different judgment 
could materially impact the Company’s results of operations.
Initial valuation of ﬁ nite lived intangible assets
At December 31, 2014 the carrying value of the Company’s 
fi nite lived intangible assets was $3,384 million. In the year 
to December 31, 2014 the Company acquired fi nite lived 
intangible assets totaling $2,320 million, primarily relating to 
the intangible assets for currently marketed products 
acquired with ViroPharma.
The fair values of all fi nite lived identifi able intangible assets, 
for commercialized products and developed product 
technologies, acquired through business combinations have 
been determined using an income approach on a project-by-
project basis using the multi-period excess earnings method. 
The multi-period excess earnings method starts with a 
forecast of all expected future net cash fl ows which a market 
participant could have either generated or saved as a result of 
ownership of the intellectual property, customer relationships, 
product technologies and other intangible assets. These cash 
fl ows are then adjusted to present value by applying a market 
participant discount rate that refl ects the risk factors that a 
market participant would associate with the cash fl ows (to the 
extent the underlying cash fl ows have not similarly been risk 
adjusted). Forecasting these future cash fl ows requires 
various assumptions to be made, including whether and to 
what extent future net cash fl ows are specifi c to Shire or 
could also be achieved by a market participant. These 
valuations are based on information that is known or 
reasonably knowable at the time of the acquisition of the 
identifi able intangible assets, and the expectations and 
assumptions that (i) have been deemed reasonable by the 
Company’s management and (ii) are based on information, 
expectations and assumptions that would be available to and 
made by a market participant. No assurance can be given, 
however, that the underlying assumptions or events 
associated with such valuations will occur as projected. 
For these reasons, among others, actual cash fl ows may 
differ from these forecasts and, dependent on the outcome 
of future events or circumstances, impairment losses (as 
outlined below) may result. The use of different estimates 
and assumptions to those used by the Company could result 
in a materially different valuation of fi nite lived intangible 
assets. However, as the valuation process for intangible 
assets involves a number of inter-related assumptions, the 
Company does not consider it meaningful to quantify the 
sensitivity of the valuation of intangible assets to changes 
in any individual assumption.
Initial valuation of indeﬁ nite lived intangible assets (IPR&D)
IPR&D represents the fair value assigned to incomplete 
technologies and development projects that the Company 
has acquired through business combinations which 
completed after January 1, 2009 which, at the time the 
business combination closed, had not reached technological 
feasibility or which had no alternative future use. At December 
31, 2014 the carrying value of the Company’s indefi nite lived 
intangible assets (IPR&D) was $1,550 million. In the year to 
December 31, 2014 the Company acquired IPR&D assets 
totaling $793 million, primarily relating to the IPR&D assets 
acquired with ViroPharma, Lumena and Fibrotech.
The fair value of IPR&D assets is determined using the 
income approach on a project-by-project basis using the 
multi-period excess earnings method. The fair value of the 
acquired IPR&D assets has been based on the present value 
of probability adjusted incremental cash fl ows which a market 
participant would expect the IPR&D projects to generate on a 
“highest and best use” basis, after the deduction of 
contributory asset charges for other assets employed in these 
projects. This method incorporates an evaluation of the 
probability of success of each development project, and the 
application of an appropriate market participant discount rate 
commensurate with the project’s stage of completion, the 
nature of the product, the scientifi c data associated with the 
technology, the current patent situation and market 
competition. 
The cash fl ows that will ultimately be generated by IPR&D 
projects are subject to major risks and uncertainties including 
whether the IPR&D projects will be completed in a timely 
manner, if at all, whether the necessary regulatory approvals 
will be obtained and how commercially successful the project 
3. Critical accounting estimates (continued) ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 125
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
will be subsequent to commercial launch. The Company is 
required to use estimates and assumptions in relation to 
these risks and uncertainties when valuing IPR&D projects. 
The use of different estimates and assumptions to those used 
by the Company could result in a materially different valuation 
of the related IPR&D. However, as the valuation process for 
IPR&D involves a number of inter-relating assumptions, the 
Company does not consider it meaningful to quantify the 
sensitivity of the valuation of IPR&D to changes in any 
individual assumption.
The initial valuation of indefi nite lived IPR&D is based on 
information that existed at the time of the acquisition of the 
relevant development project, and utilizes expectations and 
assumptions that (i) have been deemed reasonable by the 
Company’s management, and (ii) are based on information, 
expectations and assumptions that would be available to and 
made by a market participant. However, no assurance can be 
given that the underlying assumptions or estimates 
associated with the valuation of IPR&D will occur as 
projected. If IPR&D projects fail during development, are 
abandoned or subject to signifi cant delay, or do not receive 
the relevant regulatory approvals, the Company may not 
realize the future cash fl ows that it has estimated nor recover 
the value of the R&D investment made subsequent to 
acquisition of the project. If such circumstances occur, the 
Company’s future operating results could be materially 
adversely impacted.
(ii) Subsequent measurement of intangible assets
Finite lived intangible assets – estimation of amortization 
charges and impairment losses
Management’s estimate of the useful life of its fi nite lived 
intangible assets considers, amongst other things, the 
following factors:
(i)  the expected use of the fi nite lived intangible asset by the 
Company;
(ii)  any legal, regulatory, or contractual provisions that may 
limit or extend the useful life;
(iii)  the effects of demand and competition, including the 
launch of generic products; and 
(iv)  other general economic and/or industry specifi c factors 
(such as the stability of the industry, known technological 
advances, legislative action that results in an uncertain or 
changing regulatory environment, and expected changes 
in distribution channels).
The Company reviews the useful life of its intangible assets 
subject to amortization at each reporting period, and revises 
its estimate of the useful life if warranted by events or 
circumstances. Any future changes to the useful life of the 
Company’s fi nite lived intangible assets could result in higher 
or lower amortization charges in future periods, which could 
materially affect the Company’s results from operations.
The Company reviews its fi nite lived intangible assets for 
impairment using a “two-step” approach, whenever events 
or circumstances suggest that the carrying value of its fi nite 
lived intangible assets may not be recoverable. Under step 
one, if the undiscounted cash fl ows resulting from the use 
and ultimate disposition of the fi nite lived intangible asset 
(based on entity specifi c assumptions) are less than its 
carrying value, the intangible asset is considered not to be 
recoverable. The impairment loss is determined under step 
two as the amount by which the carrying value of the 
intangible asset exceeds its fair value (based on market 
participant assumptions, which may differ from entity specifi c 
assumptions). 
Events or circumstances that could suggest that the 
Company’s fi nite lived intangible assets may not be 
recoverable, and which would lead to an evaluation of the 
recoverability of the relevant asset, include but are not limited 
to, the following:
(i)  changes to a product’s commercialization strategy;
(ii)  the loss of patent protection, regulatory exclusivity or 
challenge or circumvention by competitors of the 
Company’s regulatory exclusivity patents;
(iii)  the development and marketing of competitive products, 
including generic entrants into the marketplace;
(iv)  changes to the product labels, or other regulatory 
intervention;
(v)  sustained government pressure on prices and, 
specifi cally, competitive pricing; 
(vi)  the occurrence of signifi cant adverse events in respect 
to the Company’s products;
(vii)  a signifi cant deterioration in a product’s operating 
performance compared to expectations; and
(viii)  an expectation that the intangible asset will be divested 
before the end of its previously estimated useful life.
The occurrence of any such events or circumstances may 
result in the Company reducing the estimated future net cash 
fl ows to be generated by, and the fair value of, its fi nite lived 
intangible assets and therefore give rise to an impairment 
loss. 
The Company has not recorded any impairment losses in 
respect of fi nite lived intangible assets in 2014. In 2013, as a 
result of the divestment of DERMAGRAFT to Organogenesis, 
the Company reclassifi ed the DERMAGRAFT fi nite lived 
intangible asset (and other assets subject to disposal) as 
Assets held for sale and recorded an impairment charge of 
$636.9 million, measured at fair value less cost to sell, in the 
year to December 31, 2013. In the year to December 31, 2012 
the Company recognized impairment losses of $126.7 million 
to write-down its RESOLOR fi nite lived intangible assets to 
their fair value. 
Dependent on future events or circumstances, the Company’s 
operating results could be materially and adversely affected 
by future impairment losses relating to its fi nite lived 
intangible assets.
Indeﬁ nite lived intangible assets (IPR&D) – estimation of 
impairment losses
The Company reviews its indefi nite lived intangible assets 
(which currently only relate to IPR&D assets) for impairment 
annually or more frequently if events or changes in 
circumstances indicate that the asset might be impaired. 
3. Critical accounting estimates (continued) 126 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
(continued)
Indefi nite lived assets are reviewed for impairment by 
comparing the fair value of the indefi nite lived asset (based on 
market participant assumptions, which may differ from entity 
specifi c assumptions) with its carrying amount. An 
impairment loss is recognized to the extent that the carrying 
value exceeds the estimated fair value of the relevant 
indefi nite lived intangible asset. 
Events or circumstances that could suggest that the 
Company’s IPR&D assets may not be recoverable, and 
which would lead to an evaluation of the relevant asset for 
impairment, include those factors considered for fi nite lived 
intangible assets (outlined above) as well as any adverse 
changes to the technological or commercial viability of 
the IPR&D projects, which could include abandonment, 
or signifi cant delays in progression, of the IPR&D project 
or a decline in its estimated commercial potential. The 
occurrence of any such events or circumstances could 
result in the Company reducing the estimated future net 
cash fl ows to be generated by, and the fair value of, its 
indefi nite lived intangible assets and therefore give rise 
to an impairment loss.
After the identifi cation of any such events or circumstances, 
and the resultant impairment reviews, the Company 
recognized impairment losses of $190.3 million in the year to 
December 31, 2014, primarily to write-down its SHP602 and 
SHP613 IPR&D assets to their fair value (See Note 14, “Other 
intangible assets, net” to the consolidated fi nancial 
statements set forth in this Annual Report). In 2013 and 2012 
the Company recorded impairment losses of $19.9 million 
and $71.2 million respectively to write-down RESOLOR 
IPR&D assets to their fair values. Dependent on future events 
or circumstances, the Company’s operating results could be 
materially and adversely affected by future impairment losses 
relating to its indefi nite lived intangible assets.
Goodwill – estimation of impairment losses
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment at least 
annually, or more frequently if events or circumstances 
indicate the carrying amount of goodwill may not 
be recoverable.
The Company reviews goodwill for impairment by fi rstly 
assessing qualitative factors, including comparing the market 
capitalization of the Company to the carrying value of its 
assets, to determine whether events or circumstances exists 
which indicate that it is more likely than not that the fair value 
of a reporting unit is less than its carrying amount. If, after 
assessing the totality of events or circumstances, the 
Company determines that it is more likely than not that the 
fair value of a reporting unit exceeds its carrying value, then 
the goodwill is considered recoverable and no further testing 
is performed. If, after assessing these qualitative factors, it is 
deemed more likely than not that the fair value of a reporting 
unit is less than its carrying value, a “two step” quantitative 
assessment is performed. This qualitative determination 
requires the use of judgment in concluding, based on the 
totality of events or circumstances, whether goodwill is 
considered recoverable or whether a further quantitative 
assessment is required to be performed.
Under this “two step” quantitative assessment, the Company 
fi rstly compares the fair value of a reporting unit with its 
carrying value. If the carrying value of a reporting unit is 
greater than its fair value, then goodwill is considered 
impaired and a further test is performed to determine the 
amount by which the carrying value of a reporting unit’s 
goodwill exceeds its fair value, with an impairment loss 
recognized in an amount equal to that excess. The 
quantitative determination of fair value of a reporting unit 
requires the use of signifi cant judgment and assumptions, 
which include, amongst other things, the estimation of future 
forecast cash fl ows and an appropriate discount rate used to 
determine the fair value.
In 2013 the Company identifi ed circumstances which 
indicated that the carrying value of goodwill in the RM 
reporting unit may not have been recoverable, which triggered 
an impairment test in advance of the annual testing date. The 
results of the Company’s March 31, 2013 impairment test 
showed that the carrying amount of the RM reporting unit 
exceeded its fair value and the implied value of the goodwill 
was $nil. As a result the Company recorded an impairment 
charge of $198.9 million related to the goodwill allocated to 
the RM reporting unit of which $191.8 million was 
subsequently reclassifi ed to be presented within discontinued 
operations (See Note 13, “Goodwill” to the consolidated 
fi nancial statements set forth in this Annual Report).
The Company performed its annual goodwill impairment 
review as of October 1, 2014, which indicated, based on 
qualitative factors that the Company’s goodwill was 
recoverable and was not deemed to be at risk of impairment.
(ii) Sales Deductions 
Sales deductions consist primarily of statutory rebates to 
State Medicaid and other government agencies, Medicare 
Part D rebates, contractual rebates with Managed Care 
Organizations (“MCOs”), product returns, sales discounts 
(including trade discounts), distribution service fees, 
wholesaler chargebacks, and allowances for coupon and 
patient assistance programs. These deductions are recorded 
as reductions to revenue in the same period as the related 
sales are recognized. Estimates of future obligations are 
derived from historical experience adjusted to refl ect 
known changes in the factors that impact such reserves. 
On the balance sheet the Company records wholesaler 
chargebacks and trade discounts as a reserve against 
accounts receivable, whereas all other sales deductions 
are recorded within current liabilities.
The Company has the following signifi cant categories of sales 
deductions, all of which involve estimates and judgments 
which the Company considers to be critical accounting 
estimates, and require the Company to use information from 
external sources:
Medicaid and Managed Care Rebates
In the US, statutory and any supplemental rebates to State 
Medicaid agencies and contractual rebates to MCOs under 
managed care programs are based on statutory or negotiated 
discounts to the selling price. Medicaid rebates generally 
increase as a percentage of the selling price over the life of 
the product (if prices increase faster than general infl ation).
3. Critical accounting estimates (continued) ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 127
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
It can take up to six months for information to reach the 
Company on actual usage of the Company’s products in 
managed care and Medicaid programs and on the total 
rebates to be reimbursed. Similarly, it can take some months 
before reimbursement claims are actually made by the 
Medicaid and Managed Care agencies. As a result the 
Company estimates the reserves required for amounts 
payable under these programs relating to sold products.
The amount of these reserves is based on historical 
experience of rebates, the timing of payments, the level of 
reimbursement claims, changes in prices (both normal selling 
prices and statutory or negotiated prices), changes in 
prescription demand patterns, projected product returns and 
the levels of inventory in the distribution channel. Adjustments 
are made for known changes in these factors, including 
changes in product lifecycle, on a quarterly basis.
Shire’s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution 
channel are derived from product-by-product inventory data 
provided by wholesalers and results of independently 
commissioned retail inventory surveys. 
Revisions or clarifi cation of guidelines from the CMS related 
to State Medicaid and other government program 
reimbursement practices with retroactive application can 
result in changes to management’s estimates of the rebates 
reported in prior periods.
The accrual estimation process for Medicaid and managed 
care rebates involves in each case a number of interrelating 
assumptions, which vary for each combination of product and 
Medicaid agency or MCO. Accordingly, it would not be 
meaningful to quantify the sensitivity to change for any 
individual assumption or uncertainty. However, Shire does not 
believe that the effect of these uncertainties, taken as a 
whole, signifi cantly impacts the Company’s fi nancial condition 
or results of operations. 
Aggregate accruals for Medicaid and MCO rebates at 
December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were $882 million, $807 
million and $641 million, or 15%, 17% and 15%, respectively 
of net product sales. Historically, actual rebates have not 
varied signifi cantly from the reserves provided.
Product Returns
The Company typically accepts customer product returns in 
the following circumstances: (a) expiration of shelf life; (b) 
product damaged while in Shire’s possession; (c) under sales 
terms that allow for unconditional return (guaranteed sales); or 
(d) following product recalls or product withdrawals. Generally, 
returns for expired product are accepted three months before 
and up to one year after expiration date of the relevant 
product and the returned product is destroyed. Depending on 
the product and the Company’s return policy with respect to 
that product, the Company may either refund the sales price 
paid by the customer by issuance of a credit, or exchange the 
returned product with replacement inventory. The Company 
typically does not provide cash refunds. 
Shire estimates the proportion of recorded revenue that will 
result in a return by considering relevant factors, including:
(a) past product returns activity;
(b) the duration of time taken for products to be returned;
(c)  the estimated level of inventory in the distribution channel;
(d) product recalls and discontinuances;
(e) the shelf life of products;
(f) the launch of new drugs or new formulations; and
(g)  the loss of patent protection, exclusivity or new 
competition.
Shire’s estimates of the level of inventory in the distribution 
channel are based on product-by-product inventory data 
provided by wholesalers and results of independently 
commissioned third party retail inventory surveys.
Returns reserves for new products and for those products 
with generic (or authorized generic) competition generally 
require a higher level of estimation than those for established 
products without generic (or authorized generic) competition. 
For shipments made to support the commercial launch of a 
new product (which can include guaranteed sales), the 
Company’s policy is to defer recognition of the sales revenue 
until there is evidence of end-patient acceptance of the new 
product (primarily through third-party prescription data). For 
shipments after launch under standard terms (i.e. not 
guaranteed sales), the Company’s initial estimates of sales 
return accruals are primarily based on the historical sales 
returns experience of similar products shortly after launch. 
Once suffi cient historical data on actual returns of the product 
are available, the returns provision is based on this data and 
any other relevant factors as noted above.
The Company estimates returns reserves for products with 
generic (or authorized generic) competition based on 
historical sales, the estimated level of inventory in the 
distribution channel, product utilization and rebate data, 
which are modifi ed through the use of management judgment 
to take into account many factors, including, but not limited 
to, current market dynamics, changes in contract terms, 
changes in sales trends and product pricing. 
The accrual estimation process for product returns involves, 
in each case, a number of interrelating assumptions, which 
vary for each combination of product and customer. 
Accordingly, it would not be meaningful to quantify the 
sensitivity to change for any individual assumption or 
uncertainty. However, Shire does not believe that the effect of 
uncertainties, as a whole, signifi cantly impacts the Company’s 
fi nancial condition or results of operations. 
At December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, provisions for product 
returns were $132 million, $99 million, and $91 million or 2%, 
2% and 2% respectively, of net product sales. Historically, 
actual returns have not varied signifi cantly from the reserves 
provided.
(iii) Income Taxes
In accounting for uncertainty in income taxes, management 
is required to develop estimates as to whether a tax benefi t 
should be recognized in the consolidated fi nancial 
statements, based on whether it is more likely than not that 
the technical merits of the position will be sustained based 
on audit by the tax authorities. The measurement of the tax 
benefi t recognized in the consolidated fi nancial statements 
is based upon the largest amount of tax benefi t that, 
3. Critical accounting estimates (continued) 128 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
(continued)
in management’s judgment, is greater than 50% likely to be 
realized based on a cumulative probability assessment of 
the possible outcomes. In accounting for income tax 
uncertainties, management is required to make judgments in 
the determination of the unit of account, the evaluation of the 
facts, circumstances and information in respect of the tax 
position taken, together with the estimates of amounts that 
the Company may be required to pay in ultimate settlement 
with the tax authority.
Shire operates in numerous countries where its income tax 
returns are subject to audit and adjustment by local tax 
authorities. As Shire operates globally, the nature of the 
uncertain tax positions is often very complex and subject to 
change and the amounts at issue can be substantial. Shire 
develops its cumulative probability assessment to measure 
uncertain tax positions using internal expertise, experience 
and judgment, together with assistance from professional 
advisors. Original estimates are refi ned as additional 
information becomes known. For example, in the year to 
December 31, 2014 the Company released certain provisions 
for uncertain tax positions totaling $221.1 million, primarily 
related to the settlement of certain tax positions with the 
Canadian revenue authorities and the conclusion of prior year 
audits in other territories. These releases were partially offset 
by the recognition of additional provisions for uncertain tax 
positions of $84.5 million in relation to ongoing compliance 
management for current and prior years. 
Any outcome upon settlement that differs from the recorded 
provision for uncertain tax positions may result in a materially 
higher or lower tax expense in future periods, which could 
signifi cantly impact the Company’s results of operations or 
fi nancial condition. However, the Company does not believe it 
is possible to reasonably estimate the potential impact of any 
such change in assumptions, estimates or judgments and the 
resultant change, if any, in the Company’s provision for 
uncertain tax positions, as any such change is dependent on 
factors such as future changes in tax law or administrative 
practice, the amount and nature of additional taxes which 
may be asserted by the taxation authorities, and the 
willingness of the relevant tax authorities to negotiate a 
settlement for any such position. 
At December 31, 2014 the Company recognized a liability of 
$207.8 million for total unrecognized tax benefi ts (2013: 
$355.2 million) and had accrued $25.8 million (2013: $112.2 
million) for the payment of interest and penalties. The 
Company is required in certain tax jurisdictions to make 
advance deposits to tax authorities on receipt of a tax 
assessment. These payments are either offset against the 
income tax liability or establish an income tax receivable but 
do not reduce the provision for unrecognized tax benefi ts.
The Company has signifi cant deferred tax assets due to 
various tax attributes, including net operating losses (“NOLs”), 
tax credits (from Research and Development and Investment 
Tax Credits) principally in the Republic of Ireland, the US, 
Switzerland, Belgium, Germany and the UK. At December 31, 
2014 the Company had gross deferred tax assets of $999 
million (2013: $822 million; 2012: $764 million), against which 
the Company had recorded valuation allowances of $325 
million (2013: $282 million; 2012: $269 million) and deferred 
tax liabilities of $1,428 million (2013: $644 million; 2012: 
$740 million). 
The realization of these assets is not assured and is 
dependent on various factors. Management is required to 
exercise judgment in determining whether it is more likely 
than not that it would realize these deferred tax assets. In 
assessing the need for a valuation allowance, management 
weighs all available positive and negative evidence including 
cumulative losses in recent years, expectations of future 
taxable income, carry forward and carry back potential under 
relevant tax law, expiration period of tax attributes, taxable 
temporary differences, and prudent and feasible tax-planning 
strategies. A valuation allowance is established where there is 
an expectation that on the balance of probabilities 
management considers it is more likely than not that the 
relevant deferred tax assets will not be realized. If actual 
events differ from management’s estimates, or to the extent 
that these estimates are adjusted in the future, any changes 
to the valuation allowance could signifi cantly impact the 
Company’s fi nancial condition and results of operations.
(iv) Litigation and legal proceedings
The Company has a number of lawsuits pending. The 
Company’s principal pending legal and other proceedings 
are disclosed in Note 19, “Commitments and Contingencies, 
Legal and other proceedings” to the consolidated fi nancial 
statements set forth in this Annual Report. The Company 
recognizes loss contingency provisions for probable losses 
when management is able to reasonably estimate the loss. 
When the estimated loss lies within a range, the Company 
records a loss contingency provision based on its best 
estimate of the probable loss. If no particular amount within 
that range is a better estimate than any other amount, the 
minimum amount is recorded. Estimates of losses may be 
developed substantially before the ultimate loss is known, 
and are therefore refi ned each accounting period as additional 
information becomes known. In instances where the 
Company is unable to develop a reasonable estimate of loss, 
no loss contingency provision is recorded at that time. As 
information becomes known a loss contingency provision is 
recorded when a reasonable estimate can be made. These 
estimates are reviewed quarterly and changed when 
expectations are revised. An outcome that deviates from the 
Company’s estimate may result in an additional expense (or 
credit) in a future accounting period. At December 31, 2014 
provisions for litigation losses, insurance claims and other 
disputes totaled $16.9 million (December 31, 2013: $72.7 
million; 2012: $130.5 million).
The outcomes of these proceedings are not always 
predictable and can be affected by various factors. For those 
legal and other proceedings for which it is considered at least 
reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred, the 
Company discloses the possible loss or range of possible 
loss in excess of the recorded loss contingency provision, if 
any, where such excess is both material and estimable. The 
estimation of the likelihood, amount and range of any loss 
arising from these proceedings requires signifi cant judgment. 
Any revisions in the Company’s estimates, or outcomes upon 
settlement that deviate from the Company’s best estimate 
may result in an additional expense (or credit) in a future 
accounting period, which could materially impact the 
Company’s fi nancial condition or results of operations. 
3. Critical accounting estimates (continued) ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 129
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
(v)  Contingent consideration receivable from divestments 
of products or businesses
The Company is eligible to receive contingent consideration 
from Organogenesis and Noven in relation to the divestment 
of the Company’s DERMAGRAFT business and DAYTRANA 
product, respectively. At December 31, 2014 the Company 
has contingent consideration assets of $15.9 million (2013: 
$36.1 million). 
Consideration receivable by the Company on the divestment 
of product rights or businesses typically includes up-front 
receipts and/or milestones and royalties which are contingent 
on the outcome of future events (with such milestones and 
royalties being, for example, based upon the future sales 
performance of the divested product or business). Contingent 
consideration occasionally represents a signifi cant proportion 
of the economic value receivable by the Company for a 
divested product or business. In these situations the 
Company initially recognizes this contingent consideration as 
an asset at its divestment date fair value, with re-
measurement of this asset to its then current fair value at 
subsequent balance sheet dates.
The Company estimates the fair value of contingent 
consideration receivable using the income approach, based 
on a discounted cash fl ow method. This discounted cash fl ow 
approach uses signifi cant unobservable Level 3 inputs (as 
defi ned in US GAAP) including: the probability weightings 
applied to different sales scenarios and related forecast future 
royalties receivable under scenarios developed by the 
Company; and the discount rate to be applied in calculating 
the present value of these forecast future cash fl ows. 
Signifi cant judgment is employed by the Company in 
developing these estimates and assumptions. If actual events 
differ from management’s estimates, or to the extent that 
these estimates are adjusted in the future, the Company’s 
fi nancial condition and results of operations could be affected 
in the period of any such change of estimate. 
(vi) Contingent consideration payable
The fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration 
payable at December 31, 2014 was $629.9 million (December 
31, 2013: $405.9 million).
Contingent consideration payable represents (i) future 
milestones the Company may be required to pay in 
conjunction with various business combinations and (ii) future 
royalties payable as a result of certain business combinations 
and licenses. The amounts ultimately payable by Shire are 
dependent upon (i) the successful achievement of the relevant 
milestones and (ii) future net sales of the relevant products 
over the life of the milestone or royalty term respectively. 
The Company re-measures its contingent consideration 
payable to its then current fair value at each balance sheet 
date. Gains or losses arising on changes to the fair value of 
contingent consideration payable are recorded within 
Integration and acquisition costs in the Company’s 
consolidated statement of income. 
The Company estimates the fair value of contingent 
consideration payable using the income approach, based on 
a discounted cash fl ow method. The discounted cash fl ow 
method uses signifi cant unobservable Level 3 inputs (as 
defi ned under US GAAP), including: the probability of, and 
period in which, the relevant milestone event is expected to 
be achieved; the amount of royalties that will be payable 
based on forecast net sales of the relevant products; and the 
discount rates to be applied in calculating the present values 
of the relevant milestone or royalty. Signifi cant judgment is 
employed by the Company in developing these estimates and 
assumptions. If actual events differ from management’s 
estimates, or to the extent that these estimates are adjusted 
in the future, the Company’s fi nancial condition and results of 
operations could be materially affected in the period of any 
such change of estimate.
(vii) Assets held for sale
Assets held for sale comprise noncurrent assets or disposal 
groups (together with any liabilities), the carrying amounts of 
which will be realized principally through a sale transaction 
expected to conclude within the next 12 months, rather than 
through continued use. 
At December 31, 2014 the carrying value of assets held for 
sale in the consolidated balance sheet is $nil (2013: $31.6 
million). 
In 2013 the assets and liabilities within this disposal group all 
related to the disposal of the DERMAGRAFT asset group, the 
divestment of which occurred on January 16, 2014. At the 
time of their classifi cation as “held for sale,” such assets are 
collectively measured at the lower of their carrying amount 
and fair value less costs to sell, and depreciation or 
amortization ceases. An impairment charge of $637.0 million 
was recorded in the fourth quarter of 2013 refl ecting the 
adjustment of the DERMAGRAFT disposal group’s carrying 
amount to its fair value less cost to sell.
Signifi cant judgment is employed by the Company in 
assessing: at what point all the held for sale presentation 
conditions are met for the disposal group; whether it is 
necessary to allocate goodwill to the disposal group; and 
estimating both the fair value of the disposal group and the 
incremental costs to transact a sale of the disposal group. If 
actual events differ from management’s estimates, or to the 
extent that estimates of selling price or costs to sell are 
adjusted in the future, the Company’s fi nancial condition and 
results of operations could be affected in the period of any 
such change of estimate.

Acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals Inc. (“NPS Pharma”)
On February 21, 2015 Shire completed its acquisition of 
100% of the outstanding share capital of NPS Pharma for $46 
per share or approximately $5,200 million.
The acquisition of NPS Pharma, a rare disease-focused 
biopharmaceutical company, adds NATPARA/NATPAR, 
approved for the treatment of hypoparathyroidism (“HPT”) in 
the US and GATTEX/REVESTIVE, approved for the treatment 
of adults with short bowel syndrome (“SBS”) in the US and 
the EU, to Shire’s portfolio.
The acquisition of NPS Pharma will be accounted for as a 
business combination using the acquisition method. The 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from NPS Pharma 
will be recorded at the date of acquisition, at their fair value. 
Shire’s consolidated fi nancial statements will refl ect these fair

The acquisition-date fair value of cash consideration paid 
on closing was $3,997 million. 
The acquisition of ViroPharma added CINRYZE (C1 esterase 
inhibitor [human]) to Shire’s portfolio of currently marketed 
products. CINRYZE is a leading brand for the prophylactic 
treatment of Hereditary Angioedema (“HAE”) in adolescents 
and adults. 
The acquisition of ViroPharma has been accounted for 
as a business combination using the acquisition method. 
The assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from 
ViroPharma have been recorded at their fair values at the 
date of acquisition, being January 24, 2014. The Company’s 
consolidated fi nancial statements include the results of 
ViroPharma from January 24, 2014. 
The amount of ViroPharma’s post acquisition revenues and 
pre-tax losses included in the Company’s consolidated 
statement of income for the year to December 31, 2014 were 
$538.1 million and $77.8 million, respectively. The pre-tax loss 
includes charges on the unwind of inventory fair value 
adjustments of $91.9 million, intangible asset amortization 
of $106.6 million and integration costs of $101.1 million.
The purchase price allocation was fi nalized in the fourth 
quarter of 2014. During the measurement period the 
Company obtained improved information about the

has not yet been completed, further disclosures relating to 
this acquisition will be included in the Company’s Form 10-Q 
for the three months ended March 31, 2015. 
Acquisition of Meritage Pharma Inc. (“Meritage”)
Prior to the acquisition of ViroPharma by Shire (see below), 
ViroPharma had entered into an exclusive development and 
option agreement with Meritage, a privately owned US 
company focusing on developing oral budesonide suspension 
as a treatment for eosinophilic esophagitis. Under the terms 
of this agreement Meritage controlled and conducted all 
related research up to achievement of pre-defi ned 
development success criteria at which point Shire had the 
option to acquire Meritage for upfront cash consideration of 
$69.9 million and potential additional payments of up to $175 
million, upon achievement of certain clinical and regulatory 
milestones. On February 18, 2015 Shire acquired all the 
outstanding equity of Meritage. As the initial accounting for 
this business combination has not yet been completed, 
further disclosures related to this acquisition will be included 
in the Company’s Form 10-Q for the three months ended 
March 31, 2015.

Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
(b) Other intangible assets – IPR&D
The IPR&D asset of $315.0 million relates to maribavir (now 
SHP620), an investigational antiviral product for 
cytomegalovirus. The fair value of this IPR&D asset was 
estimated based on an income approach, using the present 
value of incremental after tax cash fl ows expected to be 
generated by this development project after the deduction 
of contributory asset charges for other assets employed in 
this project. The estimated cash fl ows have been probability 
adjusted to take into account the stage of completion and 
the remaining risks and uncertainties surrounding the future 
development and commercialization. 
The major risks and uncertainties associated with the timely 
completion of the acquired IPR&D project include the ability 
to confi rm the effi cacy of the technology based on the data 
from clinical trials, and obtaining the relevant regulatory 
approvals as well as other risks as described in the 
Company’s annual report on Form 10-K. The valuation 
of IPR&D has been based on information available at the 
time of the acquisition (and information obtained during the 
measurement period) and on expectations and assumptions 
that (i) have been deemed reasonable by the Company’s 
management and (ii) are based on information, expectations 
and assumptions that would be available to a market 
participant. However, no assurance can be given that the 
assumptions and events associated with such assets will 
occur as projected. For these reasons, the actual cash fl ows 
may vary from forecast future cash fl ows.
The estimated probability adjusted after tax cash fl ows used 
in fair valuing other intangible assets have been discounted 
at rates ranging from 9.5% to 10.0%.
(c) Goodwill
Goodwill arising of $1,655.5 million, which is not deductible 
for tax purposes, includes the expected operational synergies 
that will result from combining the commercial operations 
of ViroPharma with those of Shire (valued at approximately 
$0.4 billion); other synergies expected to be realized due to 
Shire’s structure; intangible assets that do not qualify for 
separate recognition at the time of the acquisition; and the 
value of the assembled workforce. 
This information primarily comprises insights gained from 
continued divestment efforts with a number of pharmaceutical 
companies during 2014. The conclusion of this process in 
the fourth quarter indicated that the acquisition date fair 
value of this IPR&D asset should be adjusted. As a result the 
Company has retrospectively adjusted the preliminary 
amounts recognized as at the acquisition date to refl ect this 
new information. The adjustment reduced the fair value of 
IPR&D intangible assets acquired by $215 million and reduces 
the related non-current deferred tax liability by $80.2 million. 
The residual difference of $134.8 million has been recorded 
as an increase in goodwill. The Company’s allocation of the 
purchase price to the fair value of assets acquired and 
liabilities assumed, including the measurement period 
adjustment with respect to VP20621 and certain other 
immaterial measurement period adjustments during 2014, 
is outlined in the table opposite.
(a) Other intangible assets – currently marketed products
Other intangible assets totaled $2,320.0 million at the date 
of acquisition, relating to intellectual property rights acquired 
for ViroPharma’s currently marketed products, primarily 
attributed to CINRYZE, for the routine prophylaxis against 
HAE attacks in adolescent and adult patients. Shire also 
obtained intellectual property rights to three other 
commercialized products, PLENADREN, an orphan drug for 
the treatment of adrenal insuffi ciency in adults, BUCCOLAM, 
an oromucosal solution for the treatment of prolonged, acute, 
and convulsive seizures in infants, toddlers, children and 
adolescents and VANCOCIN, an oral capsule formulation 
for the treatment of C. diffi cile-associated diarrhea (“CDAD”), 
which was divested by Shire in the third quarter of 2014 
(see Note 5 for details). The fair value of currently marketed 
products has been estimated using an income approach, 
based on the present value of incremental after tax cash fl ows 
attributable to each separately identifi able intangible asset.
The estimated useful lives of the CINRYZE, PLENADREN 
and BUCCOLAM intangible assets range from 10 to 23 years 
(weighted average 22 years), with amortization being 
recorded on a straight line basis.

Notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
(continued)
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company expensed 
costs of $135.5 million (2013: $12.8 million) relating to the 
acquisition and post-acquisition integration of ViroPharma, 
which have been recorded within Integration and acquisition 
costs in the Company’s consolidated statement of income.
Supplemental disclosure of pro forma information
The following unaudited pro forma fi nancial information 
presents the combined results of the operations of Shire 
and ViroPharma as if the acquisition of ViroPharma had 
occurred as at January 1, 2013. The unaudited pro forma 
fi nancial information is not necessarily indicative of what the 
consolidated results of operations actually would have been 
had the acquisition been completed at the date indicated. In 
addition, the unaudited pro forma fi nancial information does 
not purport to project the future results of operations of the 
combined Company.
Acquisition of Lumena Pharmaceuticals, Inc. (“Lumena”)
On June 11, 2014 Shire completed the acquisition of 100% 
of the outstanding share capital of Lumena, a privately 
owned US incorporated biopharmaceutical company. 
The acquisition date fair value of the consideration 
totaled $464.3 million, comprising cash consideration paid 
on closing of $300.3 million and the fair value of contingent 
consideration payable of $164 million. The maximum amount 
of contingent cash consideration which may be payable by 
Shire in future periods is $265 million dependent upon 
achievement of certain clinical development milestones. 
This acquisition brings two novel, orally active therapeutic 
compounds SHP625 (formerly LUM001), in Phase 2 clinical 
development and SHP626 (formerly LUM002), ready to enter 
Phase 1b clinical development in the fi rst half of 2015. Both 
compounds are inhibitors of the apical sodium-dependent 
bile acid transport (“ASBT”), which is primarily responsible 
for recycling bile acids from the intestine to the liver. SHP625 
is being investigated for the potential relief of the extreme 
itching associated with cholestatic liver disease and three 
other indications. SHP626 is in development for the treatment 
of nonalcoholic steatohepatitis.
The acquisition of Lumena has been accounted for as a 
business combination using the acquisition method. 
The assets and liabilities assumed from Lumena have 
been recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition, 
being June 11, 2014. The Company’s consolidated fi nancial 
statements and results of operations include the results of 
Lumena from June 11, 2014.
The purchase price has been allocated to acquired IPR&D 
($467 million), net current assets assumed ($52.6 million, 
including cash of $46.3 million), net non-current liabilities 
assumed (including deferred tax liabilities) ($169.9 million) and 
goodwill ($114.6 million). Goodwill arising of $114.6 million is 
not deductible for tax purposes. 
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company expensed 
costs of $6.9 million (2013: $nil) relating to the Lumena 
acquisition, which have been recorded within Integration 
and acquisition costs in the Company’s consolidated 
income statement. 
Unaudited pro forma fi nancial information to present the 
combined results of operations of Shire and Lumena are not 
provided as the impact of this acquisition is not material to 
the Company’s results of operations for any period presented.
Acquisition of Fibrotech Therapeutics Pty Ltd. (“Fibrotech”)
On July 4, 2014 Shire completed its acquisition of Fibrotech, 
an Australian biopharmaceutical company developing a 
new class of orally available drugs with a novel mechanism 
of action which has the potential to address both the 
infl ammatory and fi brotic components of disease processes. 
The acquisition of Fibrotech is expected to strengthen the 
Company’s growing and innovative portfolio targeting renal 
and fi brotic diseases, and leverage existing renal capabilities.
The acquisition date fair value of the consideration totaled 
$122.6 million, comprising cash consideration paid on closing 
of $75.6 million and the fair value of contingent consideration 
payable of $47 million. The maximum amount of contingent 
cash consideration which may be payable by Shire in future 
periods is $482.5 million dependent upon achievement of 
certain clinical development, regulatory and commercial 
milestones. 
The acquisition of Fibrotech has been accounted for as 
a business combination using the acquisition method. 
The assets and liabilities assumed from Fibrotech have 
been recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition 
being July 4, 2014. The Company’s consolidated fi nancial 
statements and results of operations include the results of 
Fibrotech from July 4, 2014. 
The purchase price has been allocated to acquired IPR&D 
($11 million), net current assets ($1.4 million) and goodwill 
($110.2 million). Goodwill arising of $110.2 million is not 
expected to be deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill 
generated from the acquisition was primarily attributed to 
acquired scientifi c knowledge in fi brotic diseases and the 
potential to optimize the novel mechanism of action to other 
fi brotic conditions.
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company expensed 
costs of $3.3 million (2013: $nil) relating to the Fibrotech 
acquisition, which have been recorded within Integration 
and acquisition costs in the Company’s consolidated 
income statement. 
Unaudited pro forma fi nancial information to present the 
combined results of operations of Shire and Fibrotech are not 
provided as the impact of this acquisition is not material to 
the Company’s results of operations for any period presented.
Other Acquisitions 
On July 9, 2014 Shire acquired BIKAM Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
(“BIKAM”), a US-based biopharmaceutical company with 
pre-clinical compounds that could provide an innovative 
approach to treating autosomal dominant retinitis 
pigmentosa (adRP). In the third quarter of 2014 Shire 
also acquired certain assets and employees related to 
the production of BUCCOLAM from its previous contract 
manufacturer SCM Pharma Limited (“SCM”). The aggregate 
acquisition date fair value of the consideration for these two 
acquisitions was $17.9 million, comprising cash paid on 
closing of $12.1 million and the fair value of contingent 
4. Business combinations (continued) ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 133
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
consideration payable in respect of BIKAM of $5.8 million. 
In respect of BIKAM the maximum contingent consideration 
which may be payable by Shire in future periods is $92 million 
contingent upon the achievement of certain development, 
regulatory and commercial milestones. 
In connection with these two acquisitions, Shire has recorded 
$1 million in current assets, $4.8 million in non-current assets 
and $12.1 million in goodwill. 
Unaudited pro forma fi nancial information to present the 
combined results of operations of Shire, BIKAM and SCM 
are not provided as the impact of these acquisitions is not 
material to the Company’s results of operations for any 
period presented.
Acquisition of SARcode Bioscience Inc. (“SARcode”)
On April 17, 2013 Shire completed the acquisition of 100% 
of the outstanding share capital of SARcode. The acquisition 
date fair value of consideration totaled $368 million, 
comprising cash consideration paid on closing of $151 million 
and the acquisition date fair value of contingent consideration 
payable of $217 million. Following top-line Phase 3 study 
results in December 2013, the maximum amount of 
contingent cash consideration which may now be payable 
by Shire in future periods is $225 million dependent upon 
achievement of certain net sales milestones. 
This acquisition brings the global rights of a new Phase 3 
compound, lifi tegrast (now SHP606), currently under 
development for the treatment of Dry Eye disease, into Shire’s 
portfolio. Top-line results from OPUS-2, a Phase 3 effi cacy 
and safety study of 5.0% SHP606 ophthalmic solution, were 
announced on December 6, 2013. On April 30, 2014 Shire 
announced top-line results from the prospective randomized, 
double masked, placebo-controlled SONATA trial which 
indicated no ocular or drug-related serious adverse events. 
Following a meeting with the FDA, on May 16, 2014 Shire 
announced that it intends to submit an NDA for SHP606 
in the fi rst quarter of 2015 as a treatment for signs and 
symptoms for Dry Eye Disease in adults. 
The acquisition of SARcode has been accounted for as a 
business combination using the acquisition method. The 
assets and liabilities assumed from SARcode have been 
recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition, 
being April 17, 2013. The Company’s consolidated fi nancial 
statements and results of operations include the results of 
SARcode from April 17, 2013. 
The purchase price has been allocated to acquired in process 
research and development (“IPR&D”) in respect of SHP606 
($412 million), net current liabilities assumed ($8.2 million), 
net non-current liabilities assumed, including deferred tax 
liabilities ($122.4 million) and goodwill ($86.6 million). This 
acquisition resulted in goodwill of $86.6 million, which is not 
deductible for tax purposes. Goodwill includes the value of 
the assembled workforce and the related scientifi c expertise 
in ophthalmology which allows for potential expansion into 
a new therapeutic area. 
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company recorded 
costs of $62.9 million (2013: a net credit of $170.7 million) 
within Integration and acquisition costs relating to the 
acquisition of SARcode. The charge in 2014 and the credit in 
2013 arises principally due to re-measuring the fair value of 
contingent consideration payable.
Acquisition of Premacure AB (“Premacure”)
On March 8, 2013 Shire completed the acquisition of 100% 
of the outstanding share capital of Premacure, a privately-
owned Swedish biotechnology company. The acquisition 
date fair value of the consideration totaled $140.2 million, 
comprising cash consideration paid on closing of 
$30.6 million, and the fair value of contingent consideration 
payable of $109.6 million. The maximum amount of 
contingent cash consideration which may be payable by Shire 
in future periods, dependent upon the successful completion 
of certain development and commercial milestones, is 
$169 million. Shire will also pay royalties on relevant net sales.
Premacure was developing a protein replacement therapy 
SHP607 (formerly referred to as “PREMIPLEX
®
”), currently in 
Phase 2 development, for the prevention of Retinopathy of 
Prematurity (“ROP”). ROP is a rare and potentially blinding 
eye disorder that primarily affects premature infants and is 
one of the most common causes of visual loss in childhood. 
Together, the acquisitions of SARcode and Premacure build 
Shire’s presence in the ophthalmic therapeutic area.
The acquisition of Premacure has been accounted for as 
a business combination using the acquisition method. 
The assets and the liabilities assumed from Premacure have 
been recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition, 
being March 8, 2013. The Company’s consolidated fi nancial 
statements and results of operations include the results of 
Premacure from March 8, 2013.
The purchase price has been allocated to acquired IPR&D 
in respect of SHP607 ($151.8 million), net current liabilities 
assumed ($11.7 million), net non-current liabilities assumed, 
including deferred tax liabilities ($29.5 million) and goodwill 
($29.6 million). This acquisition resulted in goodwill of 
$29.6 million, which is not deductible for tax purposes. 
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company expensed 
costs of $33.9 million (2013: $9.5 million) relating to the 
acquisition of Premacure (including charges related to the 
change in fair value of contingent consideration payable), 
which have been recorded within Integration and acquisition 
costs in the Company’s consolidated income statement.
Acquisition of Lotus Tissue Repair, Inc. 
(“Lotus Tissue Repair”)
On February 12, 2013 Shire completed the acquisition of 
100% of the outstanding share capital of Lotus Tissue 
Repair, a privately-owned US biotechnology company. 
The acquisition date fair value of consideration totaled 
$174.2 million, comprising cash consideration paid on 
closing of $49.4 million, and the fair value of contingent 
consideration payable of $124.8 million. The maximum 
amount of contingent cash consideration which may be 
payable by Shire in future periods is $275 million. The 
amount of contingent cash consideration ultimately payable 
by Shire is dependent upon achievement of certain pre-
clinical and clinical development milestones.
4. Business combinations (continued) 134 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
(continued)
The purchase price has been allocated to acquired IPR&D 
in respect of SHP602 ($166.0 million), net current liabilities 
assumed ($6.6 million), net non-current liabilities assumed 
(including deferred tax liabilities) ($46.2 million) and goodwill 
($46.1 million). Goodwill arising of $46.1 million is not 
deductible for tax purposes.
Following the decision to place the ongoing Phase 2 clinical 
trials on hold, the Company recorded an impairment charge 
in respect of SHP602 of $166.0 million in the consolidated 
income statement. For further information, see Note 14. 
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company recorded a 
net credit of $71.4 million (2013: a charge of $10.4 million) 
relating to the FerroKin acquisition, which has been recorded 
within Integration and acquisition costs in the Company’s 
consolidated statement of income. The credit in 2014 arises 
principally due to re-measuring the fair value of contingent 
consideration payable following the decision to place the 
ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for SHP602 on clinical hold.
Acquisition of certain assets & liabilities of Pervasis 
Therapeutics, Inc. (“Pervasis”)
On April 19, 2012 Shire acquired substantially all the 
assets and certain liabilities of Pervasis. The acquisition 
date fair value of the consideration totaled $26.1 million, 
comprising cash consideration paid on closing of $2.5 million 
and the fair value of contingent consideration payable of 
$23.6 million. The maximum amount of contingent cash 
consideration which may be payable by Shire in future 
periods is up to $169.5 million. The amount of contingent 
cash consideration ultimately payable by Shire is dependent 
upon achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory 
and net sales milestones. 
The acquisition has been accounted for as a business 
combination using the acquisition method. The assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed from Pervasis have 
been recorded at their fair values at the date of acquisition, 
being April 19, 2012. The Company’s consolidated fi nancial 
statements and results of operations include the results of 
the assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from Pervasis 
from April 19, 2012. The purchase price has been allocated 
to acquired IPR&D (principally for SHP613, formerly referred 
to as VASCUGEL
®
) ($24.3 million), current liabilities assumed 
($0.2 million) and goodwill ($2.0 million). Goodwill arising of 
$2.0 million is not deductible for tax purposes.
In the second quarter of 2014 the Company identifi ed 
indicators of impairment in respect of SHP613 and recorded 
an impairment charge of $22.0 million in the consolidated 
income statement. For further information, see Note 14.
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company recorded 
a net credit of $23.1 million (2013: $nil) principally due to 
re-measuring the fair value of the contingent consideration 
payable, following the decision to discontinue further 
development of SHP613.
Lotus Tissue Repair was developing a proprietary 
recombinant form of human collagen Type VII (“rC7”) as 
the fi rst and only intravenous protein replacement therapy 
currently being investigated for the treatment of Dystrophic 
Epidermolysis Bullosa (“DEB”). DEB is a devastating orphan 
disease for which there is no currently approved treatment 
option other than palliative care. The acquisition adds to 
Shire’s pipeline a late-stage pre-clinical product for the 
treatment of DEB with global rights. 
The acquisition of Lotus Tissue Repair has been 
accounted for as a business combination using the 
acquisition method. The assets and the liabilities assumed 
from Lotus Tissue Repair have been recorded at their fair 
values at the date of acquisition, being February 12, 2013. 
The Company’s consolidated fi nancial statements and results 
of operations include the results of Lotus Tissue Repair from 
February 12, 2013. 
The purchase price has been allocated to acquired IPR&D 
in respect of rC7, now SHP608 ($176.7 million), net current 
assets assumed ($6.8 million), net non-current liabilities 
assumed, including deferred tax liabilities ($63.4 million) and 
goodwill ($54.1 million). This acquisition resulted in goodwill 
of $54.1 million, which is not deductible for tax purposes. 
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company expensed 
costs of $10.1 million (2013: $2.3 million) relating to the 
acquisition and integration of Lotus Tissue Repair, which 
have been recorded within integration and acquisition costs 
in the Company’s consolidated income statement. 
Acquisition of FerroKin BioSciences, Inc. (“FerroKin”)
On April 2, 2012 Shire completed the acquisition of 
100% of the outstanding share capital of FerroKin. 
The acquisition date fair value of consideration totaled $159.3 
million, comprising cash consideration paid on closing of 
$94.5 million and the fair value of contingent consideration 
payable of $64.8 million. The maximum amount of contingent 
cash consideration which may be payable by Shire in future 
periods is $225.0 million. The amount of contingent cash 
consideration ultimately payable by Shire is dependent upon 
the achievement of certain clinical development, regulatory 
and net sales milestones.
The acquisition of FerroKin adds global rights to a Phase 2 
product SHP602 (formerly referred to as FBS0701), to Shire’s 
pipeline. SHP602 is intended to serve a chronic patient need 
for treatment of iron overload following numerous blood 
transfusions. In the fi rst quarter of 2014, Shire decided to 
place the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial in pediatric and adult 
patients on hold while certain nonclinical fi ndings are 
analysed and evaluated. 
The acquisition of FerroKin has been accounted for as a 
business combination using the acquisition method. The 
assets acquired and the liabilities assumed from FerroKin 
have been recorded at their fair values at the date of 
acquisition, being April 2, 2012. The Company’s consolidated 
fi nancial statements and results of operations include the 
results of FerroKin from April 2, 2012.

5. Divestment of product rights
On January 1, 2014 the Company transferred the marketing authorizations for the CALCICHEW range of products in the UK 
and Ireland to Takeda Pharmaceutical Company Limited. In addition, in the fi rst quarter of 2014 Shire received cash 
consideration of $43.5 million from the sale of certain CALCICHEW trade marks to Takeda Nycomed AS (“Takeda”), resulting in 
a gain (net of taxes) of $43.5 million being recorded in the consolidated statement of income. 
In the third quarter of 2014 the Company completed the divestment of its rights to VANCOCIN, ESTRACE and EXPUTEX. 
The Company received aggregate cash consideration of $64.9 million on the disposal of these non-core products, resulting 
in a gain (net of taxes) of $32.9 million being recorded in the consolidated statement of income.
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company recorded total gains on the sale of product rights, before taxes, of $88.2 million 
(2013: $15.9 million, 2012: $18.1 million), related to the sale of CALCICHEW trademarks to Takeda, the re-measurement of 
contingent consideration receivable from the divestment of DAYTRANA and the sale of non-core products.
6. Reorganization costs
One Shire business reorganization
On May 2, 2013, the Company initiated the reorganization of its business to integrate the three divisions into a simplifi ed 
One Shire organization in order to drive future growth and innovation. 
As part of the One Shire reorganization, the Company undertook a review of all of its pipeline programs and identifi ed those 
projects that fi t with the Company’s new strategic direction and have an acceptable likelihood of success. Following that 
review, and overall streamlining of the R&D organization, several clinical and pre-clinical projects were discontinued which 
resulted in the elimination of a signifi cant number of R&D roles and functional roles that support R&D in Basingstoke, and some 
positions were re-located. 
In addition the Company also relocated its international commercial hub from Nyon, Switzerland to Zug, Switzerland in 2013. 
All Nyon-based employees were affected by the move to Zug. Shire is now operating from its new Zug offi ce and is providing 
employees with a reasonable period of time to manage their relocations.
Certain aspects of the One Shire program were temporarily put on hold due to AbbVie’s offer for Shire, which was terminated 
in October 2014. Subsequent to the termination of AbbVie’s offer, Shire announced on November 10, 2014 its plans to relocate 
over 500 positions to Massachusetts from its Chesterbrook, Pennsylvania, site and establish Lexington, Massachusetts, as the 
Company’s US operational headquarters in continuation of the One Shire effi ciency program. This relocation will streamline 
business globally through two principal locations, Massachusetts and Switzerland, with support from regional and country-
based offi ces around the world.
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company incurred reorganization costs totaling $180.9 million, relating to employee 
involuntary termination benefi ts and other reorganization costs. Reorganization costs of $245.5 million have been incurred 
since May 2013. The One Shire reorganization is expected to be substantially completed by the fi rst quarter of 2016. Currently, 
the Company estimates that further costs in respect of the One Shire reorganization of approximately $130 million will be 
expensed as incurred during 2015 and 2016.
The liability for reorganization costs arising from the One Shire business reorganization at December 31, 2014 is as follows:

At December 31, 2014 the closing reorganization cost liability was recorded within accounts payable and accrued expenses. 
7. Integration and acquisition costs
For the year to December 31, 2014 Shire recorded integration and acquisition costs of $158.8 million (2013: a net credit of 
$134.1 million, 2012: $13.5 million), comprising costs of $144.1 million primarily related to the acquisition and integration 
of ViroPharma and a net charge of $14.7 million relating to the change in fair values of contingent consideration liabilities. 
The change in fair value of contingent consideration liabilities in the year to December 31, 2014 principally relates to the 
acquisition of SARcode, refl ecting Shire’s increased confi dence in the SHP606 program and the acquisition of FerroKin, 
refl ecting the decision to place the ongoing Phase 2 clinical trial for SHP602 on clinical hold. 
In the year to December 31, 2013 integration and acquisition costs primarily related to the acquisitions of SARcode and Lotus 
Tissue Repair Inc. (“Lotus Tissue Repair”) in addition to net charges related to the change in fair values of contingent 
consideration liabilities. 136 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014

Following the divestment of the Company’s DERMAGRAFT business in January 2014, the operating results associated with 
the DERMAGRAFT business have been classifi ed as discontinued operations in the consolidated statements of income for all 
periods presented. The components of discontinued operations which relate to the DERMAGRAFT business are as follows:

Gain/(loss) from discontinued operations, net of taxes 122.7 (754.5) (60.3)
The gain from discontinued operations in the year to December 31, 2014 is $122.7 million, net of tax. This gain includes a 
tax credit of $211.3 million primarily driven by a tax benefi t arising following a reorganization of the RM business undertaken 
in the fourth quarter of 2014, associated with the divestment of the DERMAGRAFT business in the fi rst quarter of 2014. 
This gain was partially offset by costs associated with the divestment of the DERMAGRAFT business, including a loss of 
$33.6 million as a result of re-measuring to fair value the contingent consideration receivable from Organogenesis.
The loss from discontinued operations before income taxes in the year to December 31, 2013 includes a charge of 
$191.8 million, being the proportion of the former Regenerative Medicine (“RM”) reporting unit goodwill impairment charge 
that related to the DERMAGRAFT business, $636.9 million being the impairment charge recorded upon re-measurement of the 
divested assets to their fair value less costs to sell in the fourth quarter of 2013, and $99.6 million being amounts previously 
recorded to Reorganization costs in relation to the DERMAGRAFT business. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 137

As at December 31, 4,934.4 2,312.6 
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company acquired intangible assets totaling $3,118.6 million, primarily relating to the fair 
value of intangible assets for currently marketed products acquired with ViroPharma of $2,320.0 million and IPR&D assets of 
$782.0 million which were acquired with ViroPharma and Lumena (see Note 4 for further details).
The Company reviews its intangible assets for impairment whenever events or circumstances suggest that their carrying value 
may not be recoverable. In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company identifi ed indicators of impairment in respect of its 
SHP602 (iron chelating agent for the treatment of iron overload secondary to chronic transfusion) and SHP613 (for the 
treatment of improvement in patency of arteriovenous access in hemodialysis patients) IPR&D assets. 
The indicators of impairment related to SHP602 included the decision in the fi rst quarter of 2014 to place the ongoing Phase 2 
clinical trial in pediatric and adult patients on hold while certain nonclinical fi ndings are analyzed and evaluated. The Company 
therefore reviewed the recoverability of its SHP602 IPR&D asset in the fi rst quarter of 2014 and recorded an impairment charge 
of $166.0 million within R&D expenses in the consolidated statement of income to record the SHP602 IPR&D asset to its 
revised fair value. This fair value was based on the revised discounted cash fl ow forecasts associated with SHP602, which 
included a reduced probability of commercial launch, and an overall delay in the forecast timing of launch.
The indicators of impairment related to SHP613 comprised the decision in the second quarter of 2014 to discontinue further 
development of this asset based on portfolio prioritization as well as unexpected challenges and complexities with the 
development program. In the second quarter of 2014 the Company recorded an impairment charge of $22.0 million within 
R&D expenses in the consolidated statement of income to fully write off the SHP613 IPR&D asset.
Management estimates that the annual amortization charge in respect of intangible assets held at December 31, 2014 will be 
approximately $227 million for each of the fi ve years to December 31, 2019. Estimated amortization expense can be affected 
by various factors including future acquisitions, disposals of product rights, regulatory approval and subsequent amortization 
of acquired IPR&D projects, foreign exchange movements and the technological advancement and regulatory approval of 
competitor products.

Term Loan Agreement
2015 Facilities Agreement
On January 11, 2015, the Company entered into a $850 million Facility Agreement with, among others, Citi Global Markets 
Limited (acting as mandated lead arranger and bookrunner) (the “2015 Facility Agreement”). The 2015 Facility Agreement 
comprises a $850 million term loan facility. Shire has agreed to act as guarantor for any of its subsidiaries that are or become 
additional borrowers under the 2015 Facility Agreement.
The 2015 Facilities Agreement, which matures on January 10, 2016, may be used only to fi nance the purchase price payable 
in respect of Shire’s acquisition of NPS Pharma (including certain related costs). The maturity date may be extended twice, at 
Shire’s option, by six months on each occasion. On February 23, 2015 Shire requested the utilization of $850 million under 
the 2015 Facilities Agreement to partially fi nance the purchase price payable in respect of Shire’s acquisition of NPS Pharma 
(including certain related costs).
Interest on any loans made under the 2015 Facility Agreement will be payable on the last day of each interest period, which 
may be one week or one, two, three or six months at the election of Shire, or as otherwise agreed with the lenders. The interest 
rate applicable to the 2015 Facility Agreement is LIBOR plus 0.50% per annum and increases by 0.25% per annum six months 
after the date of the agreement and on each subsequent date falling at three-month intervals thereafter.
Shire shall also pay a commitment fee on the available but unutilized commitments under $850 million term loan facility for 
the availability period applicable to each facility. With effect from fi rst utilization, the commitment fee rate will be 35% of the 
applicable margin. Before fi rst utilization, the commitment fee rate will increase in stages from 0% to 35% of the applicable 
margin over a period of three months.
The 2015 Facility Agreement includes customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including 
requirements that the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA of the Group (each as defi ned in the 2015 Facility Agreement) must not, at 
any time, exceed 3.5:1 for the Relevant Period (as defi ned in the 2015 Facility Agreement), except that following certain 
acquisitions, including the merger with NPS Pharma, Shire may elect to increase the ratio to 4.0:1 in the relevant period in 
which the acquisition was completed and the immediately following relevant period. In addition, for each 12-month period 
ending December 31 or June 30, the ratio of EBITDA of the Group to Net Interest (each as defi ned in the 2015 Facility 
Agreement) must not be less than 4.0:1.
The 2015 Facility Agreement restricts (subject to certain exceptions) Shire’s ability to incur additional fi nancial indebtedness, 
grant security over its assets or provide or guarantee loans. Further, any lender may require mandatory prepayment of its 
participation if there is a change of control of Shire. In addition, in certain circumstances, the net proceeds of certain shares, 
undertakings or business disposals by Shire must be applied towards the mandatory prepayment of the facility, subject to 
certain exceptions.
Events of default under the facility include: (i) non-payment of any amounts due under the facility, (ii) failure to satisfy any 
fi nancial covenants, (iii) material misrepresentation in any of the fi nance documents, (iv) failure to pay, or certain other defaults, 
under other fi nancial indebtedness, (v) certain insolvency events or proceedings, (vi) material adverse changes in the business, 
operations, assets or fi nancial condition of Shire and its subsidiaries, (vii) if it becomes unlawful for Shire or any of its 
subsidiaries that are parties to the 2015 Facility Agreement to perform their obligations or (viii) if Shire or any subsidiary of Shire 
which is a party to the 2015 Facility Agreement repudiates the 2015 Facility Agreement or any other fi nance document, among 
others. The 2015 Facility Agreement is governed by English law.

2013 Facilities Agreement
On November 11, 2013, Shire entered into a $2,600 million facilities agreement with, among others, Morgan Stanley Bank 
International Limited (acting as lead arranger and agent) (the “2013 Facilities Agreement”). The 2013 Facilities Agreement 
comprised two credit facilities: (i) a $1,750 million term loan facility and (ii) an $850 million term loan facility. 
On December 13, 2013 and at various points during the year to December 31, 2014, the Company cancelled part of the 
$2,600 million term loan facility. At December 31, 2014 the 2013 Facilities Agreement comprised an $850 million term loan 
facility which matures on November 11, 2015 and was fully utilized. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
The $850 million term loan facility, which matures on November 11, 2015, has been used to fi nance the purchase price payable 
in respect of Shire’s acquisition of ViroPharma (including certain related costs).
Interest on any loans made under the facilities will be payable on the last day of each interest period, which may be one week 
or one, two, three or six months at the election of Shire, or as otherwise agreed with the lenders. 
The interest rate applicable to the $850 million term loan facility commenced at LIBOR plus 1.15% per annum until delivery 
of the compliance certifi cate for the year ending December 31, 2013 and is subject to change depending upon the prevailing 
ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA of the Group (each as defi ned in the 2013 Facilities Agreement), in respect of the most recently 
completed fi nancial year or fi nancial half year.
The 2013 Facilities Agreement includes customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, 
including requirements that the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA of Shire (each as defi ned in the 2013 Facilities Agreement) must 
not, at any time, exceed 3.5:1 for the Relevant Period (as defi ned in the 2013 Facilities Agreement), except that following 
certain acquisitions, including the ViroPharma acquisition, Shire may elect to increase the ratio to 4.0:1 in the relevant period 
in which the acquisition was completed and the immediately following relevant period. In addition, for each 12-month period 
ending December 31 or June 30, the ratio of EBITDA of the Group to Net Interest (each as defi ned in the 2013 Facilities 
Agreement) must not be less than 4.0:1.
The 2013 Facilities Agreement restricts (subject to certain covenants) Shire’s ability to incur additional fi nancial indebtedness, 
grant security over its assets or provide or guarantee loans. Further, any lender may require mandatory prepayment of its 
participation if there is a change of control of Shire. In addition, in certain circumstances, the net proceeds of certain shares, 
undertakings or business disposals by Shire must be applied towards the mandatory prepayment of the facilities, subject to 
certain exceptions.
Events of default under the facilities include: (i) non-payment of any amounts due under the facilities, (ii) failure to satisfy 
any fi nancial covenants, (iii) material misrepresentation in any of the fi nance documents, (iv) failure to pay, or certain other 
defaults, under other fi nancial indebtedness, (v) certain insolvency events or proceedings, (vi) material adverse changes in the 
business, operations, assets or fi nancial condition of Shire and its subsidiaries, (vii) if it becomes unlawful for Shire or any of 
its subsidiaries that are parties to the 2013 Facilities Agreement to perform their obligations or (viii) if Shire or any subsidiary 
of Shire which is a party to the 2013 Facilities Agreement repudiates the 2013 Facilities Agreement or any other fi nance 
document, among others. The 2013 Facilities Agreement is governed by English law. 
Revolving Credit Facility (“RCF”)
On December 12, 2014, Shire entered into a $2,100 million revolving credit facilities agreement (the “RCF”) with a number 
of fi nancial institutions, for which Abbey National Treasury Services PLC (trading as Santander Global Banking and Markets), 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC, 
The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation acted as mandated lead arrangers and 
bookrunners and DNB Bank ASA, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Credit Suisse AG, London Branch, Deutsche Bank 
Luxembourg S.A., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Mizuho Bank, Ltd. and Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited acted as 
arrangers. Shire is an original borrower under the RCF and has agreed to act as guarantor for its subsidiaries, which are also 
original borrowers and for any other of its subsidiaries that become additional borrowers thereunder. At December 31, 2014 
the RCF was undrawn. On February 23, 2015 Shire requested the utilization of $1,300 million under the RCF to partially fi nance 
the purchase price payable in respect of Shire’s acquisition of NPS Pharma (including certain related costs).
The RCF , which terminates on December 12, 2019, may be applied towards fi nancing the general corporate purposes of Shire. 
The RCF incorporates a $250 million US Dollar and Euro swingline facility operating as a sub-limit thereof.
The RCF became immediately available for general corporate purposes as outlined above, on satisfaction of certain customary 
conditions precedent including the cancellation of Shire’s existing multicurrency term and revolving facilities agreement dated 
November 23, 2010 (the “2010 RCF”) with a number of fi nancial institutions, for which Abbey National Treasury Services PLC, 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited (formerly Banc of America Securities Limited), Barclays Bank PLC (formerly 
Barclays Capital), Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC (formerly Lloyds TSB Bank PLC) and The Royal Bank of 
Scotland PLC acted as lead arrangers (the facilities under which at such time were undrawn).  ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 141

half year and (ii) the occurrence and continuation of an event of default in respect of the fi nancial covenants or the failure to 
provide a compliance certifi cate.
Shire shall also pay (i) a commitment fee equal to 35% per year of the applicable margin on available commitments under 
the RCF for the availability period applicable thereto and (ii) a utilization fee equal to (a) 0.10% per year of the aggregate of 
the amount requested by the borrower in a utilization request (the “Base Currency Amount”) of all outstanding loans up to 
an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to $700 million, (b) 0.15% per year of the amount by which the aggregate 
Base Currency Amount of all outstanding loans exceeds $700 million but is equal to or less than $1,400 million and (c) 0.30% 
per year of the amount by which the aggregate Base Currency Amount of all outstanding loans exceeds $1,400 million.
The RCF includes customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including requirements that 
Shire’s (i) ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA in respect of the most recently-ended 12-month Relevant Period (each as defi ned in 
the RCF) must not, at any time, exceed 3.5:1 (except that, following an acquisition fulfi lling certain criteria, Shire may on a 
once only basis elect to increase this ratio to 4.0:1 for the Relevant Period in which the acquisition was completed and for 
that immediately following) and (ii) ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest for the most recently-ended 12-month Relevant Period 
(each as defi ned in the RCF) must not be less than 4.0:1.
The RCF restricts (subject to certain exceptions) Shire’s ability to incur additional fi nancial indebtedness, grant security over 
its assets or provide loans/grant credit. Further, any lender may require mandatory prepayment of its participation if there is a 
change of control of Shire, subject to certain exceptions for schemes of arrangement and analogous schemes.
Events of default under the facilities include, among others: (i) non-payment of any amounts due under the Finance Documents 
(as defi ned in the RCF), (ii) failure to satisfy any fi nancial covenants, (iii) material misrepresentation in any of the Finance

(b) Letters of credit and guarantees
At December 31, 2014 the Company had irrevocable standby letters of credit and guarantees with various banks and 
insurance companies totaling $46 million (being the contractual amounts), providing security for the Company’s performance 
of various obligations. These obligations are primarily in respect of the recoverability of insurance claims, lease obligations and 
supply commitments.
(c) Collaborative and other licensing arrangements
Details of signifi cant updates in collaborative and other licensing arrangements are included below:
Out-licensing arrangements
Shire has entered into various collaborative and out-licensing arrangements under which the Company has out-licensed 
certain product or intellectual property rights for consideration such as up-front payments, development milestones, sales 
milestones and/or royalty payments. In some of these arrangements Shire and the licensee are both actively involved in the 
development and commercialization of the licensed product and have exposure to risks and rewards dependent on its 
commercial success. Under the terms of these collaborative and out-licensing arrangements, the Company may receive 
development milestone payments up to an aggregate amount of $39 million and sales milestones up to an aggregate amount 
of $59 million. The receipt of these substantive milestones is uncertain and contingent on the achievement of certain 
development milestones or the achievement of a specifi ed level of annual net sales by the licensee. In the year to December 
31, 2014 Shire received up-front and milestone payments totaling $2.2 million (2013: $3.0 million, 2012: $18.3 million). In the 
year to December 31, 2014 Shire recognized milestone income of $16.7 million (2013: $5.0 million, 2012: $19.4 million) in 
other revenues and $46.5 million (2013: $58.3 million, 2012: $83.8 million) in product sales for shipment of product to the 
relevant licensee.
In-licensing arrangements
(i) Strategic licensing and collaboration agreement with ArmaGen Technologies Inc. (“ArmaGen”)
On July 23, 2014 Shire and ArmaGen, a US-based privately held biotechnology company, announced a worldwide licensing 
and collaboration agreement to develop and commercialize AGT -182, an investigational enzyme replacement therapy (“ERT”) 
for the potential treatment of both the central nervous system (“CNS”) and somatic manifestations in patients with Hunter 
syndrome (“MPS II”). Under the terms of the agreement, Shire has obtained worldwide commercialization rights for AGT -182 
and an equity stake in ArmaGen in exchange for an up-front cash payment of $15 million. Shire will reimburse ArmaGen for 
research and development work carried out by ArmaGen and pay future milestones up to a maximum of $208 million 
contingent upon the achievement of certain development, regulatory and commercial milestones. ArmaGen will also be entitled 
to royalties on future relevant net sales. In the year to December 31, 2014 Shire’s share of R&D costs under this arrangement 
was $1.7 million, which was expensed to R&D.
Shire and ArmaGen are conducting the collaboration through a joint steering committee. As part of the agreement, ArmaGen is 
responsible for conducting and completing the Phase 1/2 study, after which point Shire will be responsible for further clinical 
development, including Phase 3 trials, and commercialization. 
(ii) Research Collaboration with Santaris Pharma A/S (“Santaris”) on Locked Nucleic Acid (“LNA”) Drug Platform 
On August 24, 2009 Shire announced that it had entered into a research collaboration with Santaris, to develop its proprietary 
LNA technology in a range of rare diseases. LNA technology has the benefi t of shortened target validation and proof of 
concept, potentially increasing the speed and lowering the cost of development. As part of the joint research project Santaris 
will design, develop and deliver pre-clinical LNA oligonucleotides for Shire-selected orphan disease targets, and Shire will 
have the exclusive right to further develop and commercialize these candidate compounds on a worldwide basis.
In the year to December 31, 2014 Shire paid success milestones and other support costs of $nil (2013: $1.5 million; 2012: 
$3.0 million) and $0.4 million (2013: $4.5 million; 2012: $8.1 million) to Santaris respectively, which were expensed to R&D. 
In 2014 all existing research projects were terminated either as a result of technical failure or portfolio prioritization. Unless 
new target indications are nominated, Shire currently has no obligations to pay Santaris development and sales milestones, 
or royalties on net sales of product. 
(iii) Collaboration and license agreement with Sangamo to develop therapeutics for hemophilia
On February 1, 2012 Shire and Sangamo announced that they had entered into a collaboration and license agreement to 
develop therapeutics for hemophilia and other monogenic diseases based on Sangamo’s ZFP technology. Sangamo is 
responsible for all activities through submission of Investigational New Drug Applications and European Clinical Trial 
Applications for each product and Shire will reimburse Sangamo for its internal and external research program-related costs. 
Shire is responsible for clinical development and commercialization of products arising from the collaboration. 
In the year to December 31, 2012 Shire made an upfront payment to Sangamo of $13.0 million, for technology access and 
R&D funding, which was expensed to R&D.  ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 143
19. Commitments and contingencies (continued)
In the year to December 31, 2014 Shire paid success milestones and other support costs of $1.0 million (2013: $nil; 2012: $nil) 
and $22.6 million (2013: $15.2 million; 2012: $8.9 million) to Sangamo respectively, which were expensed to R&D. Shire has 
remaining obligations to pay Sangamo research, regulatory, development and commercial milestone payments up to a 
maximum of $213.5 million for each current indication and to pay royalties on net sales of the product.
(d) Commitments
(i) Clinical testing 
At December 31, 2014 the Company had committed to pay approximately $382 million (December 31, 2013: $346 million) to 
contract vendors for administering and executing clinical trials. The timing of these payments is dependent upon actual 
services performed by the organizations as determined by patient enrollment levels and related activities.
(ii) Contract manufacturing
At December 31, 2014 the Company had committed to pay approximately $384 million (December 31, 2013: $109 million) in 
respect of contract manufacturing. The Company expects to pay $125 million of these commitments in 2015. The increase in 
contract manufacturing commitments arises principally from commitments with ViroPharma’s contract manufacturer of 
CINRYZE.
(iii) Other purchasing commitments
At December 31, 2014 the Company had committed to pay approximately $265 million (December 31, 2013: $128 million) for 
future purchases of goods and services, predominantly relating to active pharmaceutical ingredients sourcing. The Company 
expects to pay $244 million of these commitments in 2015. The increase in other purchasing commitments arises principally 
from commitments with ViroPharma’s suppliers of blood plasma used in the manufacturing of CINRYZE.
(iv) Investment commitments
At December 31, 2014 the Company had outstanding commitments to subscribe for interests in companies and partnerships 
for amounts totaling $67 million (December 31, 2013: $14 million) which may all be payable in 2015, depending on the timing 
of capital calls. The investment commitments include additional funding to certain variable interest entities (“VIE”) of which 
Shire is not the primary benefi ciary. 
(v) Capital commitments
At December 31, 2014 the Company had committed to spend $3 million (December 31, 2013: $12 million) on capital projects. 
(e) Legal and other proceedings
The Company expenses legal costs as they are incurred.
The Company recognizes loss contingency provisions for probable losses when management is able to reasonably estimate 
the loss. When the estimated loss lies within a range, the Company records a loss contingency provision based on its best 
estimate of the probable loss. If no particular amount within that range is a better estimate than any other amount, the 
minimum amount is recorded. Estimates of losses may be developed substantially before the ultimate loss is known, and are 
therefore refi ned each accounting period as additional information becomes known. In instances where the Company is unable 
to develop a reasonable estimate of loss, no loss contingency provision is recorded at that time. As information becomes 
known a loss contingency provision is recorded when a reasonable estimate can be made. The estimates are reviewed 
quarterly and the estimates are changed when expectations are revised. An outcome that deviates from the Company’s 
estimate may result in an additional expense or release in a future accounting period. At December 31, 2014, provisions for 
litigation losses, insurance claims and other disputes totaled $16.9 million (December 31, 2013: $72.7 million).
The Company’s principal pending legal and other proceedings are disclosed below. The outcomes of these proceedings are 
not always predictable and can be affected by various factors. For those legal and other proceedings for which it is considered 
at least reasonably possible that a loss has been incurred, the Company discloses the possible loss or range of possible loss in 
excess of the recorded loss contingency provision, if any, where such excess is both material and estimable.
VYVANSE
In May and June 2011, Shire was notifi ed that six separate Abbreviated New Drug Applications (“ANDAs”) were submitted 
under the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market generic versions of all approved strengths of VYVANSE. The 
notices were from Sandoz, Inc. (“Sandoz”); Amneal Pharmaceuticals LLC (“Amneal”); Watson Laboratories, Inc; Roxane 
Laboratories, Inc. (“Roxane”); Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc.; and Actavis Elizabeth LLC and Actavis Inc. (collectively, “Actavis”). 
Since fi ling suit against these ANDA fi lers, along with API suppliers Johnson Matthey Inc. and Johnson Matthey 
Pharmaceuticals Materials (collectively “Johnson Matthey”), Shire has been engaged in a consolidated patent infringement 
litigation in the US District Court for the District of New Jersey against the aforementioned parties (except Watson, who 
withdrew their ANDA).

19. Commitments and contingencies (continued)
On June 23, 2014, the US District Court for the District of New Jersey granted Shire’s summary judgment motion holding that 
18 claims of the patents-in-suit were both infringed and valid. The ruling prevents all of the ANDA fi lers (Sandoz, Roxane, 
Amneal, Actavis and Mylan) from launching generic versions of VYVANSE until the earlier of either a successful appeal to the 
US Court of Appeals for the Federal Circuit, or the expiration of these patents in 2023. To appeal successfully, the ANDA-
defendants must overturn the court’s rulings for each of these 18 patent claims. All of the defendants have appealed the 
court’s summary judgment ruling to the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit. No dates have been set for oral argument.
LIALDA 
In May 2010, Shire was notifi ed that Zydus Pharmaceuticals USA, Inc. (“Zydus”) had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-
Waxman Act seeking permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45 day period, Shire fi led a lawsuit 
in the US District Court for the District of Delaware against Zydus and Cadila Healthcare Limited, doing business as Zydus 
Cadila. A Markman hearing took place on January 29, 2015. The previously scheduled trial date has been vacated; at present, 
there is no trial date. 
In February 2012, Shire was notifi ed that Osmotica Pharmaceutical Corporation (“Osmotica”) had submitted an ANDA under 
the Hatch-Waxman Act seeking permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45 day period, Shire 
fi led a lawsuit in the US District Court for the Northern District of Georgia against Osmotica. A Markman hearing took place on 
August 22, 2013 and a Markman ruling was issued on September 25, 2014. No trial date has been set. 
In March 2012, Shire was notifi ed that Watson Laboratories Inc.-Florida had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act 
seeking permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45 day period, Shire fi led a lawsuit in the US 
District Court for the Southern District of Florida against Watson Laboratories Inc.-Florida and Watson Pharmaceuticals, Inc. 
Watson Pharma, Inc. and Watson Laboratories, Inc. were subsequently added as defendants. A trial took place in April, 2013 
and on May 9, 2013 the trial court issued a decision fi nding that the proposed generic product infringes the patent-in-suit and 
that the patent is not invalid. Watson appealed the trial court’s ruling to the Court of Appeals of the Federal Circuit (“CAFC”) 
and a hearing took place on December 2, 2013. The ruling of the CAFC was issued on March 28, 2014 overruling the trial court 
on the interpretation of two claim terms and remanding the case for further proceedings. Shire petitioned the Supreme Court 
for a writ of certiori which was granted on January 26, 2015. The Supreme Court also vacated the CAFC decision and 
remanded the case to the CAFC for further consideration in light of the Supreme Court’s recent decision in Teva v Sandoz. 
No dates have been set for the remanded case at the CAFC.
In April 2012, Shire was notifi ed that Mylan Pharmaceuticals, Inc. had submitted an ANDA under the Hatch-Waxman Act 
seeking permission to market a generic version of LIALDA. Within the requisite 45 day period, Shire fi led a lawsuit in the 
US District Court for the Middle District of Florida against Mylan. A Markman hearing took place on December 22, 2014. 
Atrial is scheduled during the court’s trial term beginning on August 3, 2015. 
Subpoena related to ADDERALL XR, DAYTRANA and VYVANSE and Louisiana Complaint related to ADDERALL, 
ADDERALL XR, DAYTRANA, VYVANSE and INTUNIV 
On September 24, 2014, Shire announced that it had resolved all matters with the federal government, the 50 states and the 
District of Columbia relating to a previously disclosed civil investigation of its US sales and marketing practices relating to 
ADDERALL XR, VYVANSE, DAYTRANA, LIALDA and PENTASA. The investigation was led by the US Attorney’s Offi ce for the 
Eastern District of Pennsylvania. Under the agreement, Shire has paid $56.5 million, and interest, fees, and costs, to resolve all 
issues investigated by the government. This fi nal settlement includes the resolution of two related qui tam complaints fi led 
against the Company and a voluntary disclosure relating to LIALDA and PENTASA. In addition, Shire has paid $2.9 million to 
resolve a previously disclosed civil complaint fi led by the State of Louisiana alleging that the Company’s sales, marketing, and 
promotion of ADDERALL, ADDERALL XR, DAYTRANA, VYVANSE and INTUNIV violated state law. The Company recorded a 
$57.5 million provision related to these matters which was charged to SG&A in the fourth quarter of 2012. As part of the 
resolution, Shire has entered into a Corporate Integrity Agreement with the Offi ce of Inspector General for the Department of 
Health and Human Services for a term of fi ve years.
Investigation related to DERMAGRAFT
The Department of Justice, including the US Attorney’s Offi ce for the Middle District of Florida, Tampa Division and the US 
Attorney’s Offi ce for Washington, DC, is conducting civil and criminal investigations into the sales and marketing practices of 
Advanced BioHealing Inc. (“ABH”) relating to DERMAGRAFT. 
Following the disposal of the DERMAGRAFT business in January 2014, Shire has retained certain legacy liabilities including 
any liability that may arise from this investigation. Shire is cooperating fully with these investigations. Shire is not in a position 
at this time to predict the scope, duration or outcome of these investigations.
Civil Investigative Demand relating to VANCOCIN
On April 6, 2012, ViroPharma received a notifi cation that the United States Federal Trade Commission (“FTC”) is conducting an 
investigation into whether ViroPharma had engaged in unfair methods of competition with respect to VANCOCIN. On August 3, 
2012, and September 8, 2014, ViroPharma and Shire respectively received Civil Investigative Demands from the FTC 
requesting additional information related to this matter. Shire intends to continue to cooperate fully with the FTC investigation. 
At this time, Shire is unable to predict the outcome or duration of this investigation. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 145

Lawsuit related to supply of ELAPRASE to certain patients in Brazil
On September 24, 2014 Shire’s Brazilian affi liate, Shire Farmaceutica Brasil Ltda, was served with a lawsuit brought by the 
State of Sao Paulo and in which the Brazilian Public Attorney’s offi ce has intervened alleging that Shire is obligated to provide 
certain medical care including ELAPRASE for an indefi nite period at no cost to patients who participated in ELAPRASE clinical 
trials in Brazil, and seeking recoupment to the Brazilian government for amounts paid for these patients to date, and moral 
damages associated with these claims. Shire intends to defend itself against these allegations but is not able to predict the 
outcome or duration of this case.

21. Financial instruments
Treasury policies and organization
The Company’s principal treasury operations are coordinated by its corporate treasury function. All treasury operations are 
conducted within a framework of policies and procedures approved annually by the Board. As a matter of policy, the Company 
does not undertake speculative transactions that would increase its currency or interest rate exposure.
Interest rate risk
The Company is exposed to interest rate risk on its $2,100 million RCF , its $850 million 2013 Facilities Agreement and its 
$850 million 2015 Facilities Agreement, on which interest is at fl oating rates, to the extent any of these facilities are utilized. 
At December 31, 2014 the RCF was undrawn, and the Company had fully utilized the $850 million of 2013 Facilities 
Agreement. Shire’s exposure under its $850 million 2013 Facilities Agreement is to US Dollar interest rates.
The Company has evaluated the interest rate risk on the RCF and on the 2013 and 2015 Facilities Agreements and considers 
the risks associated with fl oating interest rates on the instruments as appropriate. A hypothetical one percentage point 
increase or decrease in the interest rates applicable to drawings under the 2013 Facilities Agreement at December 31, 
2014 would increase or decrease interest expense by approximately $8.5 million per annum. 
The Company is also exposed to interest rate risk on its restricted cash, cash and cash equivalents and on foreign exchange 
contracts on which interest is at fl oating rates. This exposure is primarily to US Dollar, Pounds Sterling, Euro and Canadian 
Dollar interest rates. As the Company maintains all of its cash, liquid investments and foreign exchange contracts on a short 
term basis for liquidity purposes, this risk is not actively managed. In the year to December 31, 2014 the average interest 
rate received on cash and liquid investments was less than 1% per annum. The largest proportion of these cash and liquid 
investments was in US Dollar money market and liquidity funds. 
No derivative instruments were entered into during the year to December 31, 2014 to manage interest rate exposure. 
The Company continues to review its interest rate risk and the policies in place to manage the risk. 
Credit risk 
Financial instruments that potentially expose Shire to concentrations of credit risk consist primarily of short-term cash 
investments, derivative contracts and trade accounts receivable (from product sales and from third parties from which the 
Company receives royalties). Cash is invested in short-term money market instruments, including money market and liquidity 
funds and bank term deposits. The money market and liquidity funds in which Shire invests are all triple A rated by both 
Standard & Poor’s and by Moody’s credit rating agencies.
The Company is exposed to the credit risk of the counterparties with which it enters into derivative instruments. The Company 
limits this exposure through a system of internal credit limits which vary according to ratings assigned to the counterparties 
by the major rating agencies. The internal credit limits are approved by the Board and exposure against these limits is 
monitored by the corporate treasury function. The counterparties to these derivatives contracts are major international 
fi nancial institutions. 
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information 146 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
Notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements
(continued)
21. Financial instruments (continued)
The Company’s revenues from product sales in the US are mainly governed by agreements with major pharmaceutical 
wholesalers and relationships with other pharmaceutical distributors and retail pharmacy chains. For the year to December 31, 
2014 there were three customers in the US that accounted for 47% of the Company’s product sales. However, such customers 
typically have signifi cant cash resources and as such the risk from concentration of credit is considered acceptable. The 
Company has taken positive steps to manage any credit risk associated with these transactions and operates clearly defi ned 
credit evaluation procedures. However, an inability of one or more of these wholesalers to honor their debts to the Company 
could have an adverse effect on the Company’s fi nancial condition and results of operations.
A substantial portion of the Company’s accounts receivable in countries outside of the United States is derived from product 
sales to government-owned or government-supported healthcare providers. The Company’s recovery of these accounts 
receivable is therefore dependent upon the fi nancial stability and creditworthiness of the relevant governments. In recent years 
global and national economic conditions have negatively affected the growth, creditworthiness and general economic 
condition of certain markets in which the Company operates. As a result, in some countries outside of US, being Argentina, 
Greece, Italy, Portugal and Spain (collectively the “Relevant Countries”) the Company is experiencing delays in the remittance 
of receivables due from government-owned or government-supported healthcare providers. The Company continued to 
receive remittances in relation to government-owned or government-supported healthcare providers in all the Relevant 
Countries in the year December 31, 2014, including receipts of $98 million and $143 million in respect of Spanish and Italian 
receivables, respectively.
To date the Company has not incurred signifi cant losses on accounts receivable in the Relevant Countries, and continues to 
consider that such accounts receivable are recoverable. The Company will continue to evaluate all its accounts receivable for 
potential collection risks and has made provision for amounts where collection is considered to be doubtful. If the fi nancial 
condition of the Relevant Countries or other Eurozone countries suffer signifi cant deterioration, such that their ability to make 
payments becomes uncertain, or if one or more Eurozone member countries withdraws from the Euro, additional allowances 
for doubtful accounts may be required, and losses may be incurred, in future periods. Any such loss could have an adverse 
effect on the Company’s fi nancial condition and results of operations.
Foreign exchange risk
The Company trades in numerous countries and as a consequence has transactional and translational foreign exchange 
exposures.
Transactional exposure arises where transactions occur in currencies different to the functional currency of the relevant 
subsidiary. The main trading currencies of the Company are the US Dollar, Pounds Sterling, Swiss Franc and the Euro. It is the 
Company’s policy that these exposures are minimized to the extent practicable by denominating transactions in the 
subsidiary’s functional currency. 
Where signifi cant exposures remain, the Company uses foreign exchange contracts (being spot, forward and swap contracts) 
to manage the exposure for balance sheet assets and liabilities that are denominated in currencies different to the functional 
currency of the relevant subsidiary. These assets and liabilities relate predominantly to intercompany fi nancing. The foreign 
exchange contracts have not been designated as hedging instruments. Cash fl ows from derivative instruments are presented 
within net cash provided by operating activities in the consolidated cash fl ow statement, unless the derivative instruments are 
economically hedging specifi c investing or fi nancing activities.
Translational foreign exchange exposure arises on the translation into US Dollars of the fi nancial statements of non-US Dollar 
functional subsidiaries.
At December 31, 2014 the Company had 56 swap and forward foreign exchange contracts outstanding to manage currency 
risk. The swap and forward contracts mature within 90 days. The Company did not have credit risk related contingent features 
or collateral linked to the derivatives. The Company has master netting agreements with a number of counterparties to these 
foreign exchange contracts and on the occurrence of specifi ed events, the Company has the ability to terminate contracts and 
settle them with a net payment by one party to the other. The Company has elected to present derivative assets and derivative 
liabilities on a gross basis in the consolidated balance sheet. As at December 31, 2014 the potential effect of rights of set off 
associated with the foreign exchange contracts would be an offset to both assets and liabilities of $4.2 million, resulting in net 
derivative assets and derivative liabilities of $8.4 million and $3.6 million, respectively. Further details are included below:

Certain estimates and judgments were required to develop the fair value amounts. The fair value amounts shown above are not 
necessarily indicative of the amounts that the Company would realize upon disposition, nor do they indicate the Company’s 
intent or ability to dispose of the fi nancial instrument.
The following methods and assumptions were used to estimate the fair value of each material class of fi nancial instrument:
 > Available-for-sale securities – the fair values of available-for-sale securities are estimated based on quoted market prices for 
those investments. 
 > Contingent consideration receivable – the fair value of the contingent consideration receivable has been estimated using the 
income approach (using a probability weighted discounted cash ﬂ ow method). 
 > Foreign exchange contracts – the fair values of the swap and forward foreign exchange contracts have been determined using 
an income approach based on current market expectations about the future cash ﬂ ows.
 > Contingent consideration payable – the fair value of the contingent consideration payable has been estimated using the income 
approach (using a probability weighted discounted cash ﬂ ow method).

22. Fair value measurement (continued)
The Company re-measures the CCR (relating to contingent consideration due to the Company following divestment of certain 
of the Company’s products) at fair value at each balance sheet date, with the fair value measurement based on forecast cash 
fl ows, over a number of scenarios which vary depending on the expected performance outcome of the products following 
divestment. The forecast cash fl ows under each of these differing outcomes have been included in probability weighted 
estimates used by the Company in determining the fair value of the CCR.
Contingent consideration payable represents future milestones the Company may be required to pay in conjunction with 
various business combinations and future royalties payable as a result of certain business combinations and licenses. 
The amount ultimately payable by Shire in relation to business combinations is dependent upon the achievement of specifi ed 
future milestones, such as the achievement of certain future development, regulatory and sales milestones. The Company 
assesses the probability, and estimated timing, of these milestones being achieved and re-measures the related contingent 
consideration to fair value each balance sheet date. The amount of contingent consideration which may ultimately be payable 
by Shire in relation to future royalties is dependent upon future net sales of the relevant products over the life of the royalty 
term. The Company assesses the present value of forecast future net sales of the relevant products and re-measures the 
related contingent consideration to fair value each balance sheet date. 
The fair value of the Company’s contingent consideration receivable and payable could signifi cantly increase or decrease due 
to changes in certain assumptions which underpin the fair value measurements. Each set of assumptions and milestones is 
specifi c to the individual contingent consideration receivable or payable. The assumptions include, among other things, the 
probability and expected timing of certain milestones being achieved, the forecast future net sales of the relevant products 
and related future royalties payable, the probability weightings applied to different sales scenarios of the Company’s divested 
products and forecast future royalties receivable under scenarios developed by the Company, and the discount rates used to 
determine the present value of contingent future cash fl ows. The Company regularly reviews these assumptions, and makes 
adjustments to the fair value measurements as required by facts and circumstances. 
Assets Measured At Fair Value on a Non-Recurring Basis in the period using Signiﬁ cant Unobservable Inputs (Level 3)
In the year to December 31, 2014 the Company reviewed its SHP602 IPR&D intangible asset for impairment and recognized an 
impairment charge of $166 million, recorded within R&D in the consolidated income statement, to write down this asset to fair 
value. The fair value was determined using the income approach, which used signifi cant unobservable (Level 3) inputs. These 
unobservable inputs included, among other things, probabilities of the IPR&D intangible asset receiving regulatory approval, 
risk-adjusted forecast future cash fl ows to be generated by this asset and the determination of an appropriate discount rate to 
be applied in calculating the present value of forecast future cash fl ows.

23. Shareholders’ equity
Authorized common stock
The authorized stock of Shire plc as at December 31, 2014, was 1,000,000,000 Ordinary Shares and 2 subscriber 
Ordinary Shares.
Dividends
Under Jersey law, Shire plc is entitled to make payments of dividends from its accumulated profi ts and other distributable 
reserves. At December 31, 2014, Shire plc’s distributable reserves were approximately $12.1 billion.
Treasury stock 
The Company records the purchase of its own shares by the EBT and under share buy-back program as a reduction of 
shareholders’ equity based on the price paid for the shares. At December 31, 2014, the EBT held 0.7 million Ordinary Shares 
(2013: 2.4 million; 2012: 3.8 million) and 0.3 million ADSs (2013: 0.4 million; 2012: 1.1 million) and shares held under the share 
buy-back program were 9.0 million Ordinary Shares (2013: 9.8 million; 2012: 3.6 million) and 0.9 million ADSs (2013: 0.9 million; 
2012: 0.3 million). During the year to December 31, 2014 the Company did not purchase any shares either through the EBT or 
under any share buy-back program. In the year to December 31, 2013 a total of 4.2 million Ordinary Shares (2012: 4.5 million) 
and 0.8 million ADSs (2012: 0.9 million) had been purchased for total consideration of $243.8 million (2012: $205.8 million), 
including stamp duty and broker commission. 
Share buy-back Program
In 2012 the Company commenced a share buy-back program of up to $500 million through both direct purchases of Ordinary 
Shares and through the purchase of Ordinary Shares underlying ADRs. The purchases have been made through independent 
third parties who have made trading decisions independently of, and uninfl uenced by, the Company. The independence of the 
third parties enabled the Company to purchase Ordinary Shares (including Ordinary Shares underlying ADRs) during close 
periods and other prohibited periods, should they arise. The amount, timing or prices of purchases, varied based on market 
conditions and other factors. The shares purchased to date are held as treasury shares.
During the year ending December 31, 2013, the Company made on-market repurchases totaling 6,191,965 Ordinary Shares 
at a cost of $193 million (excluding transaction costs). This represents 1.0% of the issued share capital of the Company as 
at the end of the quarter. Ordinary Shares purchased may be cancelled or be held as treasury shares, in accordance with 
the authority renewed by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting (“AGM”). At its AGM on April 24, 2012 the 
Company was authorized to make market purchases of up to 56,253,208 of its own Ordinary Shares. That authority expired 
at the AGM held on April 30, 2013 and was renewed. Under the new authority, which expires on the earlier of July 29, 2014 
or the conclusion of the 2014 AGM, the Company was authorized to make market purchases of up to 55,741,587 of its own 
Ordinary Shares.
On November 11, 2013, contemporaneous with Shire’s announcement of its acquisition of ViroPharma, the Company’s share 
buyback program was terminated. Since the inception of the share buyback program the Company had purchased $300 
million of Ordinary Shares and Ordinary Shares underlying ADRs.
Conversion of Shire’s 2.75% Convertible Bonds 
On November 26, 2013, Shire issued an optional redemption notice under the Trust Deed dated May 9, 2007 to holders of the 
Company’s Bonds. Consequently, as of December 31, 2013, Bondholders had voluntarily converted the Bonds into 33,806,464 
fully paid Ordinary Shares. 
Income Access Share Arrangements (“IAS Trust”)
Shire has put into place income access arrangements which enable ordinary shareholders, other than ADS holders, to choose 
whether they receive their dividends from Shire, a company tax resident in the Republic of Ireland, or from Shire 
Biopharmaceutical Holdings (“Old Shire”), a Shire group company tax resident in the UK. 
Old Shire has issued one income access share to the Income Access Trust (the “IAS Trust”) which is held by the trustee of the 
IAS Trust (the “Trustee”). The mechanics of the arrangements are as follows:
i) If a dividend is announced or declared by Shire plc on its Ordinary Shares, an amount is paid by Old Shire by way of a 
dividend on the income access share to the Trustee, and such amount is paid by the Trustee to ordinary shareholders who 
have elected (or are deemed to have elected) to receive dividends under these arrangements. The dividend which would 
otherwise be payable by Shire plc to its ordinary shareholders will be reduced by an amount equal to the amount paid to its 
ordinary shareholders by the Trustee.
ii) If the dividend paid on the income access share and on-paid by the Trustee to ordinary shareholders is less than the total 
amount of the dividend announced or declared by Shire plc on its Ordinary Shares, Shire plc will be obliged to pay a dividend 
on the relevant Ordinary Shares equivalent to the amount of the shortfall. In such a case, any dividend paid on the Ordinary 
Shares will generally be subject to Irish withholding tax at the rate of 20% or such lower rate as may be applicable under 
exemptions from withholding tax contained in Irish law. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 151
23. Shareholders’ equity (continued)
iii) An ordinary shareholder is entitled to make an income access share election such that she/he will receive his/her dividends 
(which would otherwise be payable by Shire plc) under these arrangements from Old Shire.
iv) An ordinary shareholder who holds 25,000 or fewer Ordinary Shares at the fi rst record date after she/he fi rst becomes an 
ordinary shareholder, and who does not make a contrary election, will be deemed to have made an election (pursuant to the 
Shire plc articles of association) such that she/he will receive his/her dividends under these arrangements from Old Shire.
The ADS Depositary has made an election on behalf of all holders of ADSs such that they will receive dividends from Old Shire 
under the income access share arrangements. Dividends paid by Old Shire under the income access share arrangements will 
not, under current legislation, be subject to any UK or Irish withholding taxes. If a holder of ADSs does not wish to receive 
dividends from Old Shire under the income access share arrangements, she/he must withdraw his/her Ordinary Shares from 
the ADS program prior to the dividend record date set by the Depositary and request delivery of the Shire plc Ordinary Shares. 
This will enable him/her to receive dividends from Shire plc (if necessary, by making an election to that effect).
It is the expectation, although there can be no certainty, that Old Shire will distribute dividends on the income access share to 
the Trustee for the benefi t of all ordinary shareholders who make (or are deemed to make) an income access share election in 
an amount equal to what would have been such ordinary shareholders’ entitlement to dividends from Shire plc in the absence 
of the income access share election. If any dividend paid on the income access share and or paid to the ordinary shareholders 
is less than such ordinary shareholders’ entitlement to dividends from Shire plc in the absence of the income access share 
election, the dividend on the income access share will be allocated pro rata among the ordinary shareholders and Shire plc will 
pay the balance to these ordinary shareholders by way of dividend. In such circumstances, there will be no grossing up by 
Shire plc in respect of, and Old Shire and Shire plc will not compensate those ordinary shareholders for, any adverse 
consequences including any Irish withholding tax consequences. 
Shire will be able to suspend or terminate these arrangements at any time, in which case the full Shire plc dividend will be paid 
directly by Shire plc to those ordinary shareholders (including the Depositary) who have made (or are deemed to have made) 
an income access share election. In such circumstances, there will be no grossing up by Shire plc in respect of, and Old Shire 
and Shire plc will not compensate those ordinary shareholders for, any adverse consequences including any Irish withholding 
tax consequences.
In the year ended December 31, 2014 Old Shire paid dividends totaling $112.8 million (2013: $91.1 million; 2012: $81.5 million) 
on the income access share to the Trustee in an amount equal to the dividend Shire ordinary shareholders would have received 
from Shire.

25. Segmental reporting
Shire comprises a single operating and reportable segment engaged in the research, development, licensing, manufacturing, 
marketing, distribution and sale of innovative specialist medicines to meet signifi cant unmet patient needs. 
This segment is supported by several key functions: a Pipeline group, consisting of R&D and Corporate Development, which 
prioritizes its activities towards late stage development programs across a variety of therapeutic areas, while focusing its 
pre-clinical development activities primarily in Rare Diseases; a Technical Operations group responsible for the Company’s 
global supply chain; and an In-line marketed products group focuses on commercialized products. The In-Line marketed 
products group has commercial units that focus exclusively on the commercial execution of its marketed products including 
in the areas of Rare Diseases, Neuroscience, and GI and Internal Medicine, and to support the development of our pipeline 
candidates, in Ophthalmics. This ensures that the Company provides innovative treatments, and services the needs of its 
customers and patients, as effi ciently as possible. The business is also supported by a simplifi ed, centralized corporate 
function group. None of these functional groups meets all of the criteria to be an operating segment.
This single operating and reportable segment is consistent with the fi nancial information regularly reviewed by the Executive 
Committee (which is Shire’s chief operating decision maker) for the purposes of evaluating performance, allocating resources, 
and planning and forecasting future periods.

26. Receipt of break fee
On July 18, 2014, the Boards of AbbVie and Shire announced that they had agreed the terms of a recommended combination 
of Shire with AbbVie, subject to a number of conditions including approval by shareholders and regulators. On the same date 
Shire and AbbVie entered into a co-operation agreement in connection with the recommended combination. On October 16, 
2014, the Board of AbbVie confi rmed that it had withdrawn its recommendation of its offer for Shire as a result of the 
anticipated impact of a US Treasury Notice on the benefi ts that AbbVie expected from its offer. As AbbVie’s offer was 
conditional on the approval of its stockholders, and given their Board’s decision to change its recommendation and to advise 
AbbVie’s stockholders to vote against the offer, there was no realistic prospect of satisfying this condition. Accordingly, Shire’s 
Board agreed with AbbVie to terminate the cooperation agreement on October 20, 2014. The Company entered into a 
termination agreement with AbbVie, pursuant to which AbbVie paid the break fee due under the cooperation agreement of 
approximately $1,635.4 million. The Company has obtained advice that the break fee should not be taxable in Ireland. 
The Company has therefore concluded that no tax liability should arise and has not recognized a tax charge in the income 
statement in the current accounting period. However, this has not been agreed with the tax authorities.
27. Retirement beneﬁ ts
The Company makes contributions to defi ned contribution retirement plans that together cover substantially all employees. 
The level of the Company’s contribution is fi xed at a set percentage of each employee’s pay. 
Company contributions to personal defi ned contribution pension plans totaled $49.8 million, $45.7 million and $46.4 million for 
the years to December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively, and were charged to operations as they became payable.

 In addition to being subject to the Irish Corporation tax rate of 25%, in 2014 the Company is also subject to income tax in other territories in which the Company 
operates, including: Canada (15%); France (33.3%); Germany (15%); Italy (27.5%); Luxembourg (21.0%); the Netherlands (25%); Belgium (33.99%); Spain (30%); 
Sweden (22%); Switzerland (8.5%); United Kingdom (21.5%) and the US (35%). The rates quoted represent the statutory federal income tax rates in each territory, 
and do not include any state taxes or equivalents or surtaxes or other taxes charged in individual territories, and do not purport to represent the effective tax rate 
for the Company in each territory.

 Intra-group items principally relate to the effect of inter-company dividends, capital receipts (either taxable or non-taxable) and other intra-territory eliminations, the 
pre-tax effect of which has been eliminated in arriving at the Company’s consolidated income from continuing operations before income taxes, non-controlling 
interests and equity in earnings/(losses) of equity method investees.
Provisions for uncertain tax positions
The Company fi les income tax returns in the Republic of Ireland, the US (both federal and state) and various other jurisdictions 
(see footnote (1) to the table above for major jurisdictions). With few exceptions, the Company is no longer subject to income 
tax examinations by tax authorities for years before 2008. Tax authorities in various jurisdictions are in the process of auditing 
the Company’s tax returns for fi scal periods from 2008; these tax audits cover a range of issues, including transfer pricing and 
potential restrictions on the utilization of net operating losses.
While tax audits remain open, the Company also considers it reasonably possible that issues may be raised by tax authorities 
resulting in increases to the balance of unrecognized tax benefi ts, however, an estimate of such an increase cannot be made. 
A reconciliation of the beginning and ending amount of unrecognized tax benefi ts is as follows:

28. Taxation (continued)
Decreases for tax positions taken in prior years are primarily driven by the settlement with the Canadian revenue authorities. 
During the year, the Company received assessments from the Canadian revenue authorities which agreed with original 
positions adopted by the Company in its Canadian tax returns for the period 1999-2004.The Company received repayments 
from the Canadian revenue authorities totaling $417 million. Following receipt of the assessments the Company recorded a net 
credit to income taxes of $235 million which includes the release of provisions for uncertain tax positions including interest and 
penalties of $289.4 million partially offset by associated foreign tax credits. 
The Company considers it reasonably possible that certain audits currently being conducted will be concluded in the next 12 
months, and as a result the total amount of unrecognized tax benefi ts recorded at December 31, 2014 could decrease by up to 
approximately $25 million. As at the balance sheet date, the Company believes that its reserves for uncertain tax positions are 
adequate to cover the resolution of these audits. However, the resolution of these audits could have a signifi cant impact on the 
fi nancial statements if the settlement differs from the amount reserved.
The Company recognizes interest and penalties accrued related to unrecognized tax positions within income taxes. During the 
year ended December 31, 2014 the Company recognized a net credit to income taxes of $103.1 million and in the years ended 
December 31, 2013 and 2012 a charge of $0.4 million and $5.1 million, respectively with respect to interest and penalties and 
the Company had a liability of $25.8 million, $112.2 million and $119.6 million for the payment of interest and penalties accrued 
at December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012, respectively.

 Excluding $24.6 million of deferred tax assets at December 31, 2014 (2013: $15.0 million), related to net operating losses that result from excess stock-based 
compensation and for which any beneﬁ t realized will be recorded to stockholders’ equity.
At December 31, 2014, the Company had a valuation allowance of $324.7 million (2013: $282.4 million) to reduce its 
deferred tax assets to estimated realizable value. These valuation allowances related primarily to operating loss, capital 
loss and tax-credit carry-forwards in Ireland (2014: $75.2 million; 2013: $78.8 million); the US (2014: $77.5 million; 
2013: $60.9 million); Germany (2014: $27.5 million; 2013: $30.8 million); and other foreign tax jurisdictions (2014: $144.5 million; 
2013: $111.9 million).
Management is required to exercise judgment in determining whether deferred tax assets will more likely than not be realized. 
A valuation allowance is established where there is an expectation that on the balance of probabilities management considers 
it is more likely than not that the relevant deferred tax assets will not be realized. In assessing the need for a valuation 
allowance, management weighs all available positive and negative evidence including cumulative losses in recent years, 
projection of future taxable income, carry-forward and carry-back potential under relevant tax law, expiration period of tax 
attributes, taxable temporary differences, and prudent and feasible tax planning strategies. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 157
28. Taxation (continued)
The net increase in valuation allowances of $42.3 million is principally due to increases of losses and other temporary 
differences in European jurisdictions where management consider that there is insuffi cient positive evidence in respect of 
the factors described above to overcome cumulative losses and therefore it is more likely than not that the relevant deferred 
tax assets will not be realized in full.
At December 31, 2014, based upon a consideration of the factors described above, management believes it is more likely 
than not that the Company will realize the benefi ts of these deductible differences, net of the valuation allowances. However, 
the amount of the deferred tax asset considered realizable could be adjusted in the future if these factors are revised in the 
future periods. 
The approximate tax effect of NOLs, capital losses and tax credit carry-forwards as at December 31, are as follows:

Foreign tax jurisdictions 347.8 273.1 
R&D and other tax credits 137.8 48.3 
The approximate gross value of NOLs and capital losses at December 31, 2014 is $3,313.0 million (2013: $2,583.7 million). 
The tax-effected NOLs, capital losses and tax credit carry-forwards shown above have the following expiration dates:

The Company does not provide for deferred taxes on the excess of the fi nancial reporting over the tax basis in investments 
in foreign subsidiaries that are essentially permanent in duration. At December 31, 2014, that excess totalled approximately 
$8.1 billion. The determination of additional deferred taxes is not practicable and is not provided.
29. Related parties
Shire considers that ArmaGen is a related party by virtue of a combination of Shire’s 18% equity stake in ArmaGen and 
the worldwide licensing and collaboration agreement between the two parties to develop and commercialize AGT -182 
(see Note 19 for details). In the year to December 31, 2014, Shire paid $15 million in cash to ArmaGen in exchange for an 
equity stake in ArmaGen and the license to develop and commercialize AGT -182. In addition, Shire’s share of R&D costs 
under the collaboration arrangement during 2014 was $1.7 million, recorded within R&D expense in the consolidated income 
statement, of which $1.0 million was accrued as at December 31, 2014.

30. Share-based compensation plans (continued)
There were no capitalized share-based compensation costs at December 31, 2014 and 2013.
At December 31, 2014, $83.1 million (2013: $97.0 million, 2012: $102.3 million) of total unrecognized compensation cost 
relating to non-vested awards is expected to be recognized over a period of three years. 
At December 31, 2014, $71.2 million (2013: $90.3 million, 2012: $74.6 million) of total unrecognized compensation cost relating 
to non-vested in-the-money awards (based on the average share price during the year) is expected to be recognized over a 
weighted average period of 1.9 years (2013: 1.7 years, 2012: 1.7 years). 
On May 2, 2013, the Company initiated the reorganization of its business to integrate the three divisions into a simplifi ed One 
Shire organization (see Note 6 for details). As a result of this reorganization the Company modifi ed the terms of certain of its 
equity awards to employees and Directors impacted by the One Shire reorganization. Included in the stock compensation 
expense for the year to December 31, 2014, is $30.4 million (2013: $3.3 million, 2012: $nil) of incremental stock compensation 
costs related to the modifi cation of awards granted to those individuals impacted by the One Shire reorganization.
Share-based compensation plans
The Company grants stock-settled share appreciation rights (“SARs”) and performance share awards over Ordinary Shares 
and ADSs to Executive Directors and employees under the Shire Portfolio Share Plan (Parts A and B). The SARs and PSAs 
granted under the Shire Portfolio Share Plan (Part A & B) to Executive Directors are exercisable subject to performance and 
service criteria.
The principal terms and conditions of SARs and PSAs are as follows: (i) the contractual life of SARs is seven years, 
(ii) the vesting period of SARs and PSAs granted to employees below the level of Executive Vice President allows for 
graded vesting, and (iii) awards granted to Executive Directors contain performance conditions based on growth in adjusted 
return on invested capital (“Adjusted ROIC”) and Non-GAAP earnings before interest, taxation, depreciation and amortization 
(“Non-GAAP EBITDA”). 
The Company also operates an Employee Share Purchase Plan and a Sharesave Scheme.
The following awards were outstanding as at December 31, 2014:

Stock-settled SARs and stock options
(a) Portfolio Share Plan – Part A
Stock-settled share appreciation rights granted under the Portfolio Share Plan – Part A are exercisable subject to performance 
and service criteria. 
In respect of any award made to Executive Directors, performance criteria are based on Non-GAAP EBITDA and Adjusted 
ROIC targets. These performance measures provide increased alignment to the core activities and strategy of the Company. 
Awards granted to employees below Executive Director level are not subject to performance conditions and are only subject to 
service conditions. 
Once awards have vested, participants will have until the seventh anniversary of the date of grant to exercise their awards.
(b) Shire Sharesave Scheme (“Sharesave Scheme”)
Options granted under the Sharesave Scheme are granted with an exercise price equal to 80% and 75% of the mid-market 
price on the day before invitations are issued to UK and Ireland employees, respectively. Employees may enter into three or 
fi ve year savings contracts. No performance conditions apply.
(c) Shire Employee Stock Purchase Plan (“Stock Purchase Plan”)
Under the Stock Purchase Plan, options are granted with an exercise price equal to 85% of the fair market value of a share on 
the enrolment date (the fi rst day of the offering period) or the exercise date (the last day of the offering period), whichever is the 
lower. Employees agree to save for a period up to 12 months. No performance conditions apply.
(d) Legacy plans – principally the Shire 2000 Executive Share Option Scheme 
Options granted under this scheme were subject to certain performance criteria, which were based on the Company’s share 
price or diluted EPS growth compared to a fi xed growth rate. At December 31, 2014 all stock options outstanding under this 
scheme had met the required conditions and were exercisable.

Exercises of employee share-based awards
The total intrinsic values of share-based awards exercised for the years to December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 were 
$200.8 million, $298.3 million and $224.1 million, respectively. The total cash received from employees as a result of employee 
share option exercises for the period to December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was approximately $17.4 million, $17.2 million 
and $16.2 million, respectively. In connection with these exercises, the tax benefi t credited to additional paid-in capital for the 
years to December 31, 2014, 2013 and 2012 was $39.6 million, $11.9 million and $40.1 million respectively.
The Company will settle future employee share award exercises with either newly listed common shares or with shares held in 
the EBT. The number of shares to be purchased by the EBT during 2014 will be dependent on the number of employee share 
awards granted and exercised during the year and Shire plc’s share price. At December 31, 2014 the EBT held 0.7 million 
Ordinary Shares and 0.3 million ADSs. ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 161
30. Share-based compensation plans (continued)
Valuation methodologies
The Company estimates the fair value of its share-based awards using a Black-Scholes valuation model. Key input 
assumptions used to estimate the fair value of share-based awards include the grant price of the award, the expected 
stock-based award term, volatility of the Company’s share price, the risk-free rate and the Company’s dividend yield. 
The Company believes that the valuation technique and the approach utilized to develop the underlying assumptions are 
appropriate in estimating the fair values of Shire’s stock-based awards. Estimates of fair value are not intended to predict 
actual future events or the value ultimately realized by employees who receive equity awards, and subsequent events are 
not indicative of the reasonableness of the original estimates of fair value made by the Company under guidance issued 
by the FASB on share-based payment transactions.
The fair value of share awards granted was estimated using the following assumptions:
Period ended December 31, 2014 2013 2012
Risk-free interest rate
1
 0.3-1.8% 0.1-0.9% 0.2-1%
Expected dividend yield 0.2-0.4% 0.4-0.6% 0-0.6%
Expected life 1-4 years 1-4 years 1-4 years
Volatility 23-27% 23-26% 24-32%
Forfeiture rate 5-7% 5-9% 5-7%
1
 Risk free interest rate is for UK and US grants
The following assumptions were used to value share-based awards:
 > risk-free interest rate – for awards granted over ADSs, the US Federal Reserve treasury constant maturities rate with a term 
consistent with the expected life of the award is used. For awards granted over Ordinary Shares, the yield on UK government 
bonds with a term consistent with the expected life of the award is used;
 > expected dividend yield – measured as the average annualized dividend estimated to be paid by the Company over the expected 
life of the award as a percentage of the share price at the grant date;
 > expected life – estimated based on the contractual term of the awards and the effects of employees’ expected exercise and 
post-vesting employment termination behaviour; 
 > expected volatility – measured using historical daily price changes of the Company’s share price over the respective expected life 
of the share-based awards at the date of the award; and
 > the forfeiture rate is estimated using historical trends of the number of awards forfeited prior to vesting.

All subsidiary undertakings of Shire plc are benefi cially owned (directly or indirectly) as to 100% and are all consolidated in

Other:
 > Net income tax credit (being income tax, interest and 
estimated penalties) related to the settlement of certain 
tax positions with the Canadian revenue authorities.
 > Costs associated with AbbVie’s terminated offer for Shire, 
including costs of employee retention awards.
 > Break fee received in relation to AbbVie’s terminated offer 
for Shire.
Depreciation, which is included in Cost of product sales, R&D 
and SG&A costs in our US GAAP results, has been separately 
disclosed for the presentation of 2014, 2013 and 2012 Non 
GAAP earnings.
Cash generation represents net cash provided by operating 
activities, excluding up-front and milestone payments 
for in-licensed and acquired products, tax and interest 
payments. In 2014 the receipt of the break fee in relation 
to AbbVie’s terminated offer for Shire has been excluded 
from cash generation.
Free cash fl ow represents net cash provided by operating 
activities, excluding up-front and milestone payments for 
in-licensed and acquired products, but including capital 
expenditure in the ordinary course of business. In 2014 the 
receipt of the break fee in relation to AbbVie’s terminated 
offer for Shire has been excluded from free cash fl ow.
Growth at CER, which is a Non GAAP measure, is computed 
by restating 2014 results using average 2013 foreign exchange 
rates for the relevant period.
Average exchange rates used by Shire for the year to 
December 31, 2014 were $1.65:£1.00 and $1.33:€1.00 
(2013: $1.56:£1.00 and $1.33:€1.00).
Non GAAP adjusted ROIC aims to measure true underlying 
economic performance of the Group, by making a number 
of adjustments to ROIC as derived from Shire’s Non GAAP 
fi nancial results including:
 > Adding back to Non GAAP operating income all R&D 
expenses and operating lease costs incurred in the period;
 > Capitalizing on the Group’s balance sheet historic, cumulative 
R&D, IPR&D, intangible asset impairment charges and 
operating lease costs which previously have been expensed;
 > Deducting from Non GAAP operating income an amortization 
charge for the above capitalized costs, based on the 
estimated commercial lives of the relevant products;
 > Excluding the income statement and balance sheet impact 
of non-operating assets (such as surplus cash and non-
strategic investments); and
 > Taxing the resulting adjusted operating income at the 
underlying Non GAAP tax rate.
Non GAAP EBITDA represents Non GAAP EBITA 
before depreciation.
Other ﬁ nancial information
Non GAAP measures
Non GAAP fi nancial measures are used by the Company’s 
management to make operating decisions because they 
facilitate internal comparisons of the Company’s performance 
to historical results and to competitors’ results. The 
Company’s Remuneration Committee uses certain key Non 
GAAP measures when assessing the performance and 
compensation of employees, including the Company’s 
executive director.
The Non GAAP measures are presented in this Annual Report 
as the Company’s management believe that they will provide 
investors with a means of evaluating, and an understanding of 
how the Company’s management evaluates, the Company’s 
performance and results on a comparable basis that is not 
otherwise apparent on a US GAAP basis, since many 
non-recurring, infrequent or non-cash items that the 
Company’s management believe are not indicative of the core 
performance of the business may not be excluded when 
preparing fi nancial measures under US GAAP .
These Non GAAP measures should not be considered in 
isolation from, as substitutes for, or superior to fi nancial 
measures prepared in accordance with US GAAP .
Where applicable the following items, including their tax 
effect, have been excluded when calculating Non GAAP 
earnings for 2014, 2013 and 2102:
Amortization and asset impairments:
 > Intangible asset amortization and impairment charges; and
 > Other than temporary impairment of investments.
Acquisitions and integration activities:
 > Up-front payments and milestones in respect of in-licensed 
and acquired products;
 > Costs associated with acquisitions, including transaction 
costs, fair value adjustments on contingent consideration 
and acquired inventory;
 > Costs associated with the integration of companies; and
 > Non-controlling interests in consolidated variable interest 
entities.
Divestments, reorganizations and discontinued 
operations:
 > Gains and losses on the sale of non-core assets;
 > Costs associated with restructuring and reorganization 
activities;
 > Termination costs; and
 > Income/(losses) from discontinued operations.
Legal and litigation costs:
 > Net legal costs related to the settlement of litigation, 
government investigations and other disputes (excluding 
internal legal team costs). ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 167

E-communications
Shire offers shareholders the ability to access shareholder 
documents, such as its annual reports and notices of AGMs, 
by way of e-communications as an alternative to receiving 
paper copies through the post. 
To register for e-communications, simply log onto 
www.shareview.co.uk/myportfolio and follow the online 
instructions. To start, you will require your shareholder 
reference number which you will fi nd on your share certifi cate 
or dividend tax voucher. Following registration, you will need 
to alter your mailing preference to e-communications and 
confi rm your email address.
Shareholders who do not elect to receive documents or 
notifi cations via e-communications will continue to receive 
paper copies.
Shareholder security
Many companies have become aware that their shareholders 
have received unsolicited phone calls or correspondence 
concerning investment matters. These are typically from 
overseas based “brokers” who target UK shareholders, 
offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless or 
high risk shares in US or UK investments.
Shareholders are advised to be very wary of any unsolicited 
advice, offers to buy shares at a discount or offers of free 
company reports. If you receive any unsolicited investment 
advice:
 > make sure you get the name of the person and organization;
 > check that they are properly authorized by the FCA before 
getting involved by visiting www.fca.org.uk/register/; and
 > report the matter to the FCA either by calling 0800 111 6768 
or by completing an online form at: www.fca.org.uk/
consumers/scams/report-scam/share-fraud-form 
If you deal with an unauthorized fi rm, you will not be eligible 
to receive payment under the Financial Services 
Compensation Scheme.
Details of any share dealing facilities that the Company 
endorses will be included in Company mailings.
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be

Dividends
Shareholders are able to choose how they receive their 
dividends:
 > directly into their bank account*; or
 > by cheque.
* Shire preferred option.
The quickest and most effi cient way to receive your 
dividends is to have them paid directly into your bank 
account. Those selecting this payment method receive a tax 
voucher with each payment. To change how you receive your 
dividends, either log on to www.shareview.co.uk/myportfolio 
or contact Equiniti.
Income Access Share (“IAS”) arrangements
Shareholders who elect, or are deemed to have elected, 
to receive their dividends via the IAS arrangements will 
receive their dividends from a UK source (rather than directly 
from the Company which is an Irish tax resident company) 
for UK tax purposes.
Shareholders who hold 25,000 or fewer shares at the fi rst 
dividend record date after becoming a shareholder in 
the Company will be deemed to have elected to receive 
their dividends under the IAS arrangements, unless they 
elect otherwise.
Shareholders who hold more than 25,000 shares and who 
wish to receive their dividends from a UK source must make 
an IAS Election. All elections remain in force indefi nitely 
unless revoked. Unless shareholders have made an IAS 
Election, or are deemed to have made an IAS Election, 
dividends will be received from an Irish source and will 
be taxed accordingly.
An IAS dividend election form can be found on Shire’s 
website at: http://www.shire.com/shireplc/en/investors/

Statements included herein that are not historical facts are 
forward-looking statements. Such forward-looking statements 
involve a number of risks and uncertainties and are subject 
to change at any time. In the event such risks or uncertainties 
materialize, Shire’s results could be materially adversely 
affected. The risks and uncertainties include, but are not 
limited to, that: 
 > Shire’s products may not be a commercial success; 
 > product sales from ADDERALL XR and INTUNIV are subject 
to generic competition; 
 > the failure to obtain and maintain reimbursement, or an 
adequate level of reimbursement, by third-party payers 
in a timely manner for Shire’s products may affect future 
revenues, ﬁ nancial condition and results of operations;
 > Shire conducts its own manufacturing operations for 
certain of its products and is reliant on third party contract 
manufacturers to manufacture other products and to provide 
goods and services. Some of Shire’s products or ingredients 
are only available from a single approved source for 
manufacture. Any disruption to the supply chain for any 
of Shire’s products may result in Shire being unable to 
continue marketing or developing a product or may result 
in Shire being unable to do so on a commercially viable 
basis for some period of time;
 > the manufacture of Shire’s products is subject to extensive 
oversight by various regulatory agencies. Regulatory 
approvals or interventions associated with changes to 
manufacturing sites, ingredients or manufacturing processes 
could lead to signiﬁ cant delays, an increase in operating 
costs, lost product sales, an interruption of research activities 
or the delay of new product launches;
 > Shire has a portfolio of products in various stages of 
research and development. The successful development 
of these products is highly uncertain and requires signiﬁ cant 
expenditures and time, and there is no guarantee that 
these products will receive regulatory approval;
 > the actions of certain customers could affect Shire’s ability 
to sell or market products proﬁ tably. Fluctuations in buying or 
distribution patterns by such customers can adversely affect 
Shire’s revenues, ﬁ nancial conditions or results of operations;
 > investigations or enforcement action by regulatory authorities 
or law enforcement agencies relating to Shire’s activities in 
the highly regulated markets in which it operates may result 
in signiﬁ cant legal costs and the payment of substantial 
compensation or ﬁ nes;
 > adverse outcomes in legal matters and other disputes, 
including Shire’s ability to enforce and defend patents and 
other intellectual property rights required for its business, 
could have a material adverse effect on Shire’s revenues, 
ﬁ nancial condition or results of operations;
 > Shire faces intense competition for highly qualiﬁ ed personnel 
from other companies and organizations. Shire is undergoing 
a corporate reorganization and was the subject of an 
unsuccessful acquisition proposal and the consequent 
uncertainty could adversely affect Shire’s ability to attract 
and/or retain the highly skilled personnel needed for Shire 
to meet its strategic objectives; 
 > failure to achieve Shire’s strategic objectives with respect to 
the acquisition of NPS Pharmaceuticals, Inc. may adversely 
affect Shire’s ﬁ nancial condition and results of operations,
and other risks and uncertainties detailed from time to time in 
Shire’s fi lings with the Securities and Exchange Commission, 
including those risks outlined in pages 32 to 39.

Income Access Share arrangements
Shire operates Income Access Share (“IAS”) arrangements 
enabling shareholders to choose whether they receive their 
dividends from a company tax resident in the Republic of 
Ireland or from a company tax resident in the UK. Further 
details in respect of the IAS arrangements can be found 
in Note 23 of the Shire Annual Report.
Results and dividends
A profi t on ordinary activities before taxation of $1,481.2 
million was recorded for the year ended December 31, 
2014 (year ended December 31, 2013: loss before taxation 
of $69.9 million).
The net assets of the Company increased from $10,474.1 
million for the year ended December 31, 2013 to $12,058.9 
million for the year ended December 31, 2014, primarily 
as a result of the break fee received of $1,635.4 million 
following the termination of a cooperation agreement with 
AbbVie Inc. (“AbbVie”). 
Dividends paid and dividend policy
The Company paid dividends amounting to $8.9 million 
in the year (2013: $5.7 million). In accordance with 
IAS arrangements, the Company directed Shire 
Biopharmaceuticals Holdings to pay dividends totaling 
$112.7 million (2013: $91.1 million) to those shareholders 
who choose to receive their dividends from a company 
tax resident in the UK.
A fi rst interim dividend for the six months to June 30, 2014 
of 3.83 cents (2.24 pence) per Ordinary Share, equivalent to 
11.49 cents per ADS, was paid in October 2014. The Board 
has resolved to pay a second interim dividend of 19.09 cents 
(12.51 pence) per Ordinary Share equivalent to 57.27 cents 
per ADS for the six months to December 31, 2014.
This is consistent with Shire’s stated policy of paying a 
dividend biannually, set in US cents per Ordinary Share. 
Typically, the fi rst interim payment each year will be higher 
than the previous year’s fi rst interim US Dollar dividend. 
Dividend growth for the full year will be reviewed by the 
Board when the second interim dividend is determined.
Liquidity, cash ﬂ ow and going concern 
The Company and the Group’s business activities, together 
with the factors likely to affect its future development, 
performance and position are set out in Shire’s Annual Report 
in the Chairman’s review, Chief Executive Offi cer’s review 
and the review of our business. The fi nancial position of the 
Company and the Group, its cash fl ows, liquidity position 
and borrowing facilities are described in the Liquidity and 
capital resources section of the review of our business. 
The review of our business also includes information in 
respect of the Group’s objectives, policies and processes 
for managing capital; its fi nancial risk management 
objectives; details of its hedging activity; and its exposures 
to credit risk and liquidity risk. Details of the Company’s 
fi nancial instruments are disclosed in Note N on page 193

become additional borrowers thereunder. At December 31, 
2014 the RCF was undrawn. On February 23, 2015, Shire 
requested the utilization of $1,300 million under the RCF to 
partly fi nance the purchase price payable in respect of Shire’s 
acquisition of NPS Pharma (including certain related costs).
The RCF , which terminates on December 12, 2019, may be 
applied towards fi nancing the general corporate purposes 
of Shire. The RCF incorporates a $250 million US Dollar 
and Euro swingline facility operating as a sub-limit thereof.
The RCF became immediately available for general corporate 
purposes as outlined above, on satisfaction of certain 
customary conditions precedent including the cancellation 
of Shire’s existing multicurrency term and revolving facilities 
agreement dated November 23, 2010 (the “2010 RCF”) with 
a number of fi nancial institutions, for which Abbey National 
Treasury Services PLC, Bank of America Merrill Lynch 
International Limited (formerly Banc of America Securities 
Limited), Barclays Bank PLC (formerly Barclays Capital), 
Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC (formerly 
Lloyds TSB Bank PLC) and The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC 
acted as lead arrangers (the facilities under which at such 
time were undrawn). 
Interest on any loans made under the RCF will be payable 
on the last day of each interest period, which may be one 
week or one, two, three or six months at the election of Shire, 
or as otherwise agreed with the lenders. The interest rate for 
the RCF will be: LIBOR (or, in relation to any revolving loan 
in Euro, EURIBOR); plus 0.30% per year until delivery of the 
fi rst compliance certifi cate required to be delivered after the 
date of the RCF , subject to change thereafter depending 
upon (i) the prevailing ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA (each as 
defi ned in the RCF) in respect of the most recently completed 
fi nancial year or fi nancial half year and (ii) the occurrence and 
continuation of an event of default in respect of the fi nancial 
covenants or the failure to provide a compliance certifi cate. 180 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014

Shire 2.75% convertible bonds due 2014
On November 26, 2013, Shire issued an optional redemption 
notice under the Trust Deed dated May 9, 2007 (the “Trust 
Deed”) to holders (the “Holders”) of the Company’s 2.75% 
Convertible Bonds due 2014 (the “Bond”). The aggregate 
outstanding principal amount of Bonds on November 25, 
2013, the last practicable date prior to the date of the optional 
redemption notice, was $1,075,070,000. The last day on 
which bondholders were able to exercise their conversion 
rights was December 13, 2013. Those Bonds which were 
not voluntarily converted were redeemed by the Company 
on December 27, 2013 at par together with interest accrued 
to that date. As of December 31, 2013, Bonds in an 
aggregate principal amount of the $1,099,050,000 had been 
voluntary converted into 33,806,464 fully paid Ordinary 
Shares at a conversion price of $32.51 per Ordinary Share, 
in the capital of the Company, with par value of £0.05 each. 
The remaining outstanding Bonds in an aggregate principal 
amount of $950,000 were redeemed pursuant to the Optional 
Redemption Notice issued on November 26, 2013. Following 
the redemption of all the outstanding Bonds, the Company 
cancelled the listing of the Bonds on the Offi cial List 
maintained by the UK Listing Authority and the admission 
to trading of the Bonds on the Professional Securities Market 
of the London Stock Exchange.
Going concern 
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly, the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the fi nancial 
statements. Further details regarding the adoption of the 
going concern basis can be found in the accounting policies 
in the notes to the fi nancial statements.

Shire shall also pay (i) a commitment fee equal to 35% per 
year of the applicable margin on available commitments 
under the RCF for the availability period applicable thereto 
and (ii) a utilization fee equal to (a) 0.10% per year of the 
aggregate of the amount requested by the borrower in 
a utilization request (the “Base Currency Amount”) of 
all outstanding loans up to an aggregate Base Currency 
Amount equal to $700 million, (b) 0.15% per year of the 
amount by which the aggregate Base Currency Amount 
of all outstanding loans exceeds $700 million but is equal 
to or less than $1,400 million and (c) 0.30% per year of the 
amount by which the aggregate Base Currency Amount 
of all outstanding loans exceeds $1,400 million.
The RCF includes customary representations and warranties, 
covenants and events of default, including requirements that 
Shire’s (i) ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA in respect of the most 
recently-ended 12-month Relevant Period (each as defi ned 
in the RCF) must not, at any time, exceed 3.5:1 (except that, 
following an acquisition fulfi lling certain criteria, Shire may 
on a once only basis elect to increase this ratio to 4.0:1 for 
the Relevant Period in which the acquisition was completed 
and for that immediately following) and (ii) ratio of EBITDA 
to Net Interest for the most recently-ended 12-month 
Relevant Period (each as defi ned in the RCF) must not 
be less  than 4.0:1.
The RCF restricts (subject to certain exceptions) Shire’s ability 
to incur additional fi nancial indebtedness, grant security over 
its assets or provide loans/grant credit. Further, any lender 
may require mandatory prepayment of its participation if there 
is a change of control of Shire, subject to certain exceptions 
for schemes of arrangement and analogous schemes.
Events of default under the facilities include, among others: 
(i) non-payment of any amounts due under the Finance 
Documents (as defi ned in the RCF), (ii) failure to satisfy any 
fi nancial covenants, (iii) material misrepresentation in any of 
the Finance Documents, (iv) failure to pay, or certain other 
defaults, under other fi nancial indebtedness, (v) certain 
insolvency events or proceedings, (vi) material adverse 
changes in the business, operations, assets or fi nancial 
condition of Shire as a whole, (vii) if it becomes unlawful for 
Shire plc (or any successor parent company) or any of their 
respective subsidiaries that are parties to the RCF to perform 
their obligations thereunder or (viii) if the Company (or any 
successor parent company) or any subsidiary thereof which 
is a party to the 2010 RCF repudiates such agreement or 
other Finance Document.  ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 181

Purchase of own shares
During the year ending December 31, 2013 the Company 
made on-market repurchases totaling 6,191,965 Ordinary 
Shares at a cost of $193 million (excluding transaction costs). 
The program covers purchases of Ordinary Shares for 
cancellation or to be held as treasury shares, in accordance 
with the authority renewed by shareholders at the Company’s 
AGM on April 30, 2013 when the Company was authorized 
to make market purchases of up to 55,741,587 of its own 
Ordinary Shares. 
Following the announcement of the acquisition of 
ViroPharma, the Company also announced that it was 
ceasing its share buyback program on November 11, 
2013 with immediate effect. The contracts were cancelled 
on this date.
Directors’ liability insurance and indemniﬁ cation
In the year under review, the Group maintained an insurance 
policy for its Directors and Offi cers in respect of liabilities 
arising out of any act, error or omission whilst acting in 
their capacity as Directors or Offi cers. Qualifying third party 
indemnity provisions were also in place during the year under 
review for the benefi t of Directors in relation to certain losses 
and liabilities which they may potentially incur to third-parties 
in the course of their duties. These remain in force at the date 
of this report.
Subsequent events
In February 2015 Shire completed the acquisition of 
NPS Pharma Inc. This acquisition adds global rights to 
an innovative product portfolio with multiple growth 
catalysts, including, GATTEX/REVESTIVE with growing 
sales for the treatment of adults with SBS, a rare GI condition; 
and NATPARA/NATPAR, the only bioengineered hormone 
replacement therapy for use in the treatment of HPT, 
a rare endocrine disease, which received FDA approval 
in January 2015.
On February 23, 2015, Shire plc requested the utilization of 
$1,300 million under the RCF to partly fi nance the purchase 
price payable in respect of Shire’s acquisition of NPS Pharma 
(including certain related costs). In addition, on February 23, 
2015, Shire plc requested the utilization of $850 million under 
the 2015 Facility Agreement to partly fi nance the purchase 
price payable in respect of Shire’s acquisition of NPS Pharma 
(including certain related costs). 
Auditor

taken as a Director in order to make himself/herself aware of 
any relevant audit information and to establish that the 
Company’s auditor is aware of that information.

February 24, 2015 182 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the fi nancial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare fi nancial 
statements for each fi nancial year. Under that law the 
Directors have elected to prepare the fi nancial statements 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards 
and applicable law). Under company law the Directors must 
not approve the fi nancial statements unless they are satisfi ed 
that they give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
company and of the profi t or loss of the company for that 
period. In preparing these fi nancial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
 > select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
 > make judgments and accounting estimates that are 
reasonable and prudent;
 > state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have 
been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the ﬁ nancial statements; and
 > prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate 
accounting records that are suffi cient to show and explain 
the company’s transactions and disclose with reasonable 
accuracy at any time the fi nancial position of the company 
and enable them to ensure that the fi nancial statements 
comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They 
are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the 
Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and 
integrity of the corporate and fi nancial information included 
on the company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of fi nancial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Directors’ responsibilities statement 
Responsibility statement 
We confi rm that to the best of our knowledge:
 > the fi nancial statements, prepared in accordance with 
United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, 
give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, fi nancial 
position and profi t or loss of the Company and the 
undertakings included in the consolidation taken as 
a whole;
 > the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the development 
and performance of the business and the position of the 
company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal 
risks and uncertainties that they face; and;
 > the Annual Report and ﬁ nancial statements, taken as a 
whole, are fair, balanced and understandable and provide 
the information necessary for shareholders to assess the 
Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Independent auditor’s report to the members
of Shire plc 
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Investment in subsidiaries
There is a risk related to the size of the Company’s investments of $13bn 
in Shire Pharmaceutical Holdings Ireland Limited and Shire Regenerative 
Medicine Inc which are disclosed in note H.
We have challenged the Directors’ impairment analysis and have considered 
the valuation of the Company’s subsidiary against other indicators of value 
such as the overall stock market capitalisation of the Shire Group.
Complex tax judgments
As Shire transacts globally within a complex group structure, significant 
judgment is required in determining the level of tax provisions. 
We identified a risk that the judgments made by the Directors are 
inappropriate.
In the current year the most significant judgment related to the tax 
treatment of the break fee of $1.6 billion received from AbbVie Inc 
(“AbbVie”).
As disclosed in note 26 the Directors have assessed the tax treatment 
of the $1.6bn AbbVie break fee and concluded that this receipt should 
not be taxable in Ireland.
We have reviewed and challenged management’s conclusion by:
 > reviewing the Company’s submission to the Irish tax authorities and 
the advice received by the Company from third party legal counsel 
and other advisors;
 > consulting with our own taxation experts to consider the associated 
fact pattern and to challenge the judgments made; and
 > testing the appropriateness of the process and controls adopted by 
management in making the key judgments and the controls over the 
entity prepared documents used in the control.
Opinion on the ﬁ nancial statements of Shire plc
In our opinion the fi nancial statements:
 > give a true and fair view of the state of the Company’s 
affairs as at December 31, 2014 and of its loss for the year 
then ended;
 > have been properly prepared in accordance with United 
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
 > have been prepared in accordance with the requirements 
of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
The fi nancial statements comprise the profi t and loss 
account, balance sheet and the related Notes A to P . 
The fi nancial reporting framework that has been applied 
in their preparation is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Going concern
We have reviewed the Directors’ statement that the Company 
is a going concern. 
We confi rm that:
 > we have concluded that the Directors’ use of the going 
concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the 
ﬁ nancial statements is appropriate; and
 > we have not identiﬁ ed any material uncertainties that may 
cast signiﬁ cant doubt on the Company’s ability to continue 
as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can 
be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the 
Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below 
are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, 
the allocation of resources in the audit and directing the 
efforts of the engagement team:
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction 
with the signifi cant issues considered by the Audit Committee 
discussed on page 67.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed 
in the context of our audit of the fi nancial statements as a 
whole, and not to express an opinion on individual accounts 
or disclosures. Our opinion on the fi nancial statements is not 
modifi ed with respect to any of the risks described above, and 
we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We defi ne materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the 
fi nancial statements that makes it probable that the economic 
decisions of a reasonably knowledgeable person would be 
changed or infl uenced. We use materiality both in planning 
the scope of our audit work and in evaluating the results of 
our work.
We determined materiality for the Company to be $69 million, 
based on the net assets of the Company.
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report 
to the Committee all audit differences in excess of $3 million 
(2013: $3 million), as well as differences below that threshold 
that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. 
We also report to the Audit Committee on disclosure matters 
that we identifi ed when assessing the overall presentation 
of the fi nancial statements. 184 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the 
entity and its environment, including internal control, and 
assessing the risks of material misstatement. Audit work to 
respond to the risks of material misstatement was performed 
directly by the audit engagement team.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
Adequacy of explanations received and 
accounting records
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required 
to report to you if, in our opinion:
 > we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit; or
 > proper accounting records have not been kept, or returns 
adequate for our audit have not been received from branches 
not visited by us; or
 > the ﬁ nancial statements are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), 
we are required to report to you if, in our opinion, information 
in the annual report is:
 > materially inconsistent with the information in the audited 
ﬁ nancial statements; or
 > apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially 
inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Company acquired 
in the course of performing our audit; or
 > otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have 
identifi ed any inconsistencies between our knowledge 
acquired during the audit and the Directors’ statement that 
they consider the annual report is fair, balanced and 
understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit 
Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. 
We confi rm that we have not identifi ed any such 
inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement, the Directors are responsible for the preparation of 
the fi nancial statements and for being satisfi ed that they give 
a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express 
an opinion on the fi nancial statements in accordance with 
applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We 
also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 
(UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology and tools aim to 
ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, 
understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems 
include our dedicated professional standards review team 
and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as 
a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies 
(Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit work has been undertaken so 
that we might state to the Company’s members those matters 
we are required to state to them in an Auditor’s report and/or 
those further matters we expressly agreed to report to them 
on in our engagement letter and for no other purpose. To the 
fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume 
responsibility to anyone other than the Company and the 
company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this 
report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the fi nancial statements suffi cient to give 
reasonable assurance that the fi nancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. 
This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and 
have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the 
reasonableness of signifi cant accounting estimates made by 
the Directors; and the overall presentation of the fi nancial 
statements. In addition, we read all the fi nancial and non-
fi nancial information in the Annual Report to identify material 
inconsistencies with the audited fi nancial statements and to 
identify any information that is apparently materially incorrect 
based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge 
acquired by us in the course of performing the audit. If we 
become aware of any apparent material misstatements or 
inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements 
For the year ended December 31, 2014
A. Presentation of the ﬁ nancial statements
Preparation of ﬁ nancial statements
These separate fi nancial statements of the Company are 
prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally 
Accepted Accounting Practice (“UK GAAP”) as at December 
31, 2014 and in accordance with the requirements of the 
Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They have been prepared 
under the historical cost convention except for the revaluation 
of certain fi nancial instruments at fair value as permitted by 
the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 and in accordance with 
applicable United Kingdom accounting standards.
Consolidated accounts prepared in conformity with 
accounting principles generally accepted in the United States 
of America (“US GAAP”), in which the fi nancial results and 
cash fl ow statement of the Company and its subsidiaries 
are included, can be found in the Shire Annual Report.
These fi nancial statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the Company’s accounting policies 
described below, which have been applied consistently 
throughout the current and preceding year and have 
been approved by the Board.
B. Accounting policies
Going Liquidity, cash ﬂ ow and going concern 
The Group’s balance sheet includes $2,982.4 million of cash 
and cash equivalents at December 31, 2014. 
The Company also has a revolving credit facility of 
$2,100 million which matures in 2019, which was undrawn 
at December 31, 2014. On February 23, 2015, Shire 
requested the utilization of $1,300 million under the RCF to 
partly fi nance the purchase price payable in respect of Shire’s 
acquisition of NPS Pharma (including certain related costs). 
In connection with its acquisition of ViroPharma, on 
November 11, 2013 the Company also entered into a 
$2,600 million term loan facilities agreement (the “2013 
Facilities Agreement”). Amounts drawn under the 2013 
Facilities Agreement were subsequently reduced to $850 
million. At December 31, 2014 the 2013 Facilities Agreement 
comprised an $850 million term loan facility which matures 
on November 11, 2015, which was fully utilized and recorded 
within short term borrowings.
Following Shire’s announcement to acquire NPS Pharma, 
on January 11, 2015 the Company entered into an $850 
million term loan facilities agreement (the “2015 Facilities 
Agreement”). On February 23, 2015 the Company requested 
utilization of $850 million under the 2015 Facilities Agreement 
to partially fi nance the purchase price payable in respect 
of Shire’s acquisition of NPS Pharma (including certain 
related costs).
The Directors have a reasonable expectation that the 
Company and the Group have adequate resources to 
continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. 
Accordingly the Directors continue to adopt the going 
concern basis of accounting in preparing the report and 
fi nancial statements.
Investments
Investments held as fi xed assets are stated at historic cost 
less any provision for impairment. In the event of a return 
of capital by a subsidiary the Company’s accounting policy 
is to apply the return of capital against the cost of investment 
such that the Company’s investment in its subsidiary is 
recorded at its recoverable amount. Any surplus return of 
capital is recorded as an excess return of capital in the profi t 
and loss account.
Dividends paid and received
Dividend distributions to the Company’s shareholders are 
recognized as a liability in the Company’s fi nancial statements 
in the period in which the shareholders’ right to receive 
payment is established. Dividend income is recognized in 
the profi t and loss account on the date the Company’s right 
to receive payment is established.
Expenditure
Expenditure is recognized in respect of goods and services 
received when supplied in accordance with contractual terms. 
Provision is made when an obligation exists for a future 
liability in respect of a past event and where the amount 
of the obligation can be reliably estimated.
Local currency and currency translation
The fi nancial statements have been presented in local 
currency. The local currency is defi ned as the currency 
of the primary economic environment in which the 
Company operates.
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate 
of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary 
assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies 
at the balance sheet dates are reported at the rate of 
exchange prevailing at that date. Non-monetary items 
that are measured at historical cost in a foreign currency 
are not retranslated. 
Share-based compensation
The Company operates equity-settled, share-based 
compensation plans. The fair value of the employee services 
received in exchange for the grant of the options has been 
valued using option-pricing models. Options and 
performance share awards granted without market conditions 
are valued using the Black-Scholes option-pricing model. 
Options and performance share awards granted with market 
conditions are valued using a binomial model. In accordance 
with FRS 20 “Share-based payment”, the resulting cost for 
the Company’s employees is recognized as an expense on 
a straight-line basis over the vesting period of the awards. 
The value of the charge is adjusted to refl ect expected and 
actual levels of vesting. The cost for awards granted to the 
Company’s subsidiaries’ employees represents additional 
capital contributions by the Company in its subsidiaries. 
An additional investment in subsidiaries has been recorded 
in respect of those awards granted to the Company’s 
subsidiaries’ employees, with a corresponding increase in 
the Company’s shareholders’ equity. The additional capital 
contribution is based on the fair value at the grant date of 
the awards issued. This accounting treatment applies as 
the parent has granted the share option rather than being 
subsidiary granting an option in the parent’s equity.  ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 187
Strategic Report Governance Financial Statements Other Information
Convertible bonds
On issuance, or substitution from other Shire Group 
companies, of convertible bonds the Company bifurcates 
these convertible bonds into their debt and equity 
components. The fair value of the debt component is 
estimated using the market interest rate for an equivalent 
non-convertible bond. If the fair value of an equivalent 
non-convertible bond is greater than the carrying value 
of convertible bond, then the limit of the carrying value of 
convertible bond allocated to the liabilities is that carrying 
value. The amount allocated to the debt component is 
classifi ed as a liability and subsequently measured on an 
amortized cost basis until extinguished on conversion or 
redemption of the bonds. The remainder of the proceeds 
from the issuance, or the fair value on substitution from other 
Shire Group companies, of convertible bonds is allocated 
to the equity component, (which represents the embedded 
conversion option), and is classifi ed in shareholders’ equity, 
net of any income tax effects. The carrying amount of the 
equity component is not re-measured in subsequent periods. 
On conversion the equity component has been reclassifi ed 
to Other Reserves in line with the requirements of FRS 25 
“Financial Instruments: Presentation”.
Treasury Shares
Where the Company purchases the Company’s own share 
capital, the consideration paid is deducted from the total 
shareholders’ funds and classifi ed as treasury shares until 
they are cancelled. Where such shares are subsequently sold 
or re-issued, any consideration received is included in total 
shareholders’ funds. 
Where the Company enters a fi nancial close or other 
prohibited period and broker contracts cannot be cancelled 
in this period, a liability equivalent to the present value of the 
maximum number of shares available to purchase is debited 
against total equity. Accretion of the discount is recorded in 
the profi t and loss during the close period. Shares purchased 
in the close period are deducted from the liability and are 
recorded as treasury shares with any remaining liability on 
leaving the close period is reversed with a corresponding 
credit in shareholder equity.
B. Accounting policies (continued)
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classifi ed 
according to the substance of the contractual arrangements 
entered into. An equity instrument is any contract that 
evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Company 
after deducting all of its liabilities.
Taxation
Current tax is provided at amounts expected to be paid 
or recovered using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognized in respect of all timing differences 
that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet 
date where transactions or events that result in an obligation 
to pay more tax in the future or a right to pay less tax in the 
future have occurred at the balance sheet date. Timing 
differences are differences between the Company’s taxable 
profi ts and its results as stated in the fi nancial statements 
that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax 
assessments in periods different from those in which they 
are recognized in the fi nancial statements.
A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and 
therefore recognized only when, on the basis of all available 
evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there 
will be suitable taxable profi ts from which the future reversal 
of the underlying timing differences can be deducted.
Deferred tax is measured at the rates that are expected 
to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are 
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that 
have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance 
sheet date. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Related party transactions
Under the provisions of FRS 8 “Related party disclosures”, 
as the consolidated fi nancial statements in which the 
Company’s results are included have been made available 
to the public, the Company is not required to separately 
disclose details of related party transactions with relation 
to wholly owned subsidiaries. 
Pensions
The Company contributes to personal defi ned contribution 
pension plans of employees. Contributions are charged to the 
profi t and loss account as they become payable. Differences 
between contributions payable in the year and contributions 
actually paid are shown as either accruals or prepayments in 
the balance sheet. 188 SHIRE PLC ANNUAL REPORT 2014

E. Receipt of break fee 
On July 18, 2014, the Boards of AbbVie and Shire announced that they had agreed the terms of a recommended combination 
of Shire with AbbVie, subject to a number of conditions including approval by shareholders and regulators. On the same date 
Shire and AbbVie entered into a co-operation agreement in connection with the recommended combination. On October 16, 
2014, the Board of AbbVie confi rmed that it had withdrawn its recommendation of its offer for Shire as a result of the 
anticipated impact of the US Treasury Notice on the benefi ts that AbbVie expected from its offer. As AbbVie’s offer was 
conditional on the approval of its stockholders, and given their Board’s decision to change its recommendation and to advise 
AbbVie’s stockholders to vote against the offer, there was no realistic prospect of satisfying this condition. Accordingly, 
Shire’s Board agreed with AbbVie to terminate the cooperation agreement on October 20, 2014. The Company entered into 
a termination agreement with AbbVie, pursuant to which AbbVie paid the break fee due under the co-operation agreement 
of approximately $1,635.4 million. The Company has obtained advice that the break fee should not be taxable in Ireland. 
The Company has therefore concluded that no tax liability should arise and has not recognized a tax charge in the income 
statement in the current accounting period. However, this has not been agreed with the tax authorities.
F . Tax on proﬁ t/(loss) on ordinary activities
A company which is incorporated in Jersey but managed and controlled and resident for tax purposes outside of Jersey in 
a country or territory where the highest rate at which any company may be charged to tax on any part of its income is 20% 
or higher will not be regarded as resident in Jersey for tax purposes. 
As the company is both managed and controlled and tax resident in Ireland it will not be regarded as resident in Jersey for 
tax purposes. 
The Company is managed and controlled in Ireland, and is therefore subject to Irish Corporation Tax.

M. Treasury shares
The treasury shares reserve represents the cost of shares in the Company purchased in the market and held by the Company 
for the purpose of returning funds to shareholders. The number of Ordinary Shares held by the Company as at December 31, 
2014 was 9,019,832 with a purchase value of $275.6 million (including transaction costs) (2013: 9,823,536 with a purchase 
value of $300.1 million). 
The Company instructed independent third parties to purchase the shares of the Company up to a maximum value of 
$500 million. These contracts could be cancelled at any time other than when the Company was in a fi nancial close or other 
prohibited period. As the contracts could not be cancelled in a close or other prohibited period, the Company was obliged 
to recognize a liability equivalent to the present value of the maximum number of shares still available to purchase which 
was debited against total equity. Accretion of the discount is recorded in the profi t and loss during the close or other 
prohibited period. Shares purchased in the close period or other prohibited were deducted from the liability and recorded 
as treasury shares with any remaining liability on leaving the close or other prohibited period was reversed with a credit 
recognized in shareholder equity.
Following the announcement of the acquisition of ViroPharma, the Company also announced that it was ceasing its share 
buyback program on November 11, 2013 with immediate effect. The contracts were cancelled on this date.
N. Risk management and ﬁ nancial instruments
Financial risk factors
The Company’s risks are managed on a Group basis.
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of fi nancial risks: credit risk; liquidity risk; and market risk (including foreign 
currency exchange risk, price risk and interest rate risk).
The Group’s overall risk management program focuses on the unpredictability of fi nancial markets and seeks to minimize 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s fi nancial performance. The Group uses derivative fi nancial instruments to hedge 
certain risk exposures.
The Group’s fi nancial risk management is carried out by a corporate treasury function conducted within a framework of policies 
and procedures approved annually by the Company’s Board of Directors. The corporate treasury function identifi es, evaluates 
and hedges fi nancial risks in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. As a matter of policy, the Group does not 
undertake speculative transactions that would increase currency or interest rate exposure.
Further information in respect of the fi nancial risk management of the Group can be obtained from the Shire Annual Report 
in the consolidated accounts for the year ending December 31, 2014.
Credit risk
As at December 31, 2014 the Company had amounts due from Group undertakings and other debtors which in the aggregate 
totaled $1,679.6 million. The Company’s maximum exposure to credit risk from these amounts is $1,679.6 million. 
Liquidity risk
Prudent liquidity risk management implies maintaining suffi cient cash and cash equivalents and the availability of funding 
through an adequate amount of committed credit facilities.
The Company fi nances its activities through debt securities and committed bank facilities, borrowings and the repayment of 
loans from Group companies and the proceeds of asset or investment disposals and cash generated from private and public 
offerings of equity.
The Company anticipates that its funding sources will be suffi cient to meet its anticipated future administrative expenses, 
debt principal, dividend obligations and service costs as they become due over the next 12 months.

N. Risk management and ﬁ nancial instruments (continued)
Market risk
Foreign currency exchange risk
As at December 31, 2014 substantially all of the Company’s fi nancial assets and fi nancial liabilities were denominated in its 
functional currency, the US dollar. The Company is not exposed to any signifi cant foreign exchange currency risk.
Price risk
As at December 31, 2014 the Company held no investments other than fi xed asset investments in subsidiary undertakings 
which are held at historic cost less any provision for impairment. The Company is not exposed to any price risk.
Interest rate risk
As at December 31, 2014 the Company held no cash or cash equivalents or had any trade debtors or creditors which were 
interest bearing. The Company had short-term borrowings of $1,772.2 million from another Group company, which are 
repayable on demand and bear interest at fl oating rates. Interest on these borrowings in the period amounted to $15.8 million 
and the Directors do not perceive that servicing this debt poses any signifi cant risk to the Company given its size in relation 
to the Company’s net assets. Interest on other loans totaled $13.1 million in the year and the Directors do not perceive that 
servicing this debt poses any signifi cant risk to the Company. 
Market risk sensitivity analysis
FRS 29 “Financial Instruments: Disclosures” requires a market risk sensitivity analysis illustrating the fair value of the 
Company’s fi nancial instruments and the impact on the Company’s profi t and loss account and shareholders’ equity of 
reasonably possible changes in selected market risks. The Company has no fi nancial assets or liabilities that expose it to 
market risk, other than amounts owed to Group undertakings of $1,772.2 million. The Directors do not believe that a 1% 
movement in interest rates will have a material impact on the Company’s profi t and loss account or shareholders’ equity.
Financial instruments
The table below sets out the Company’s accounting classifi cation of each class of fi nancial assets and fi nancial liabilities

 The fair value of the Company’s convertible bonds is based on the quoted market price of the bonds at the balance sheet date – as such the fair value quoted 
above represents the composite fair value for both the liability and equity components of the convertible bonds, whereas the carrying amount represents only 
the liability component.

 The carrying amount of amounts for the loan facility is at approximate fair value because of the short-term maturity of the amounts.
Capital risk management
The capital structure of the Company consists of debt, which includes borrowings disclosed in Note J, issued capital, reserves 
and retained earnings as disclosed in Note L. The Company manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able 
to continue as a going concern and to ensure the Group has suffi cient capital available to meet future funding requirements. 
The Group is in strong fi nancial position with net cash of, as determined under US GAAP , of $2,119 million at December 31, 
2014 (2013 net cash: $2,231 million), which positions the Group to take advantage of any opportunities that might arise to 
develop the business. Details of funding requirements are explained in the Liquidity and capital resources section of the 
review of our business in the Shire Annual Report in the consolidated accounts for the year ending December 31, 2014.
The Company is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements.

Guarantees
The Company has guaranteed external lease commitments, overdrafts, trade facility lines and other banking obligations 
of various subsidiaries, amounting to $45.7 million (2013: $130.7 million).
Term Loan agreement
2015 Facilities Agreement
On January 11, 2015, the Company entered into a $850 million Facility Agreement with, among others, Citi Global Markets 
Limited (acting as mandated lead arranger and bookrunner) (the “2015 Facility Agreement”). The 2015 Facility Agreement 
comprises a $850 million term loan facility. Shire has agreed to act as guarantor for any of its subsidiaries that are or become 
additional borrowers under the 2015 Facility Agreement.
The 2015 Facilities Agreement, which matures on January 10, 2016, may be used only to fi nance the purchase price payable 
in respect of Shire’s acquisition of NPS Pharma (including certain related costs). The maturity date may be extended twice, at 
Shire’s option, by six months on each occasion. On February 23, 2015, the Company requested the utilization of $850 million 
under the 2015 Facilities Agreement to partially fi nance the purchase price payable in respect of Shire’s acquisition of NPS 
Pharma (including certain related costs).
Interest on any loans made under the 2015 Facility Agreement will be payable on the last day of each interest period, which 
may be one week or one, two, three or six months at the election of Shire, or as otherwise agreed with the lenders. The interest 
rate applicable to the 2015 Facility Agreement is LIBOR plus 0.50% per annum and increases by 0.25% per annum six months 
after the date of agreement and on each subsequent date falling at three month intervals.
Shire shall also pay a commitment fee on the available but unutilized commitments under $850 million term loan facility for 
the availability period applicable to each facility. With effect from fi rst utilization, the commitment fee rate will be 35% of the 
applicable margin. Before fi rst utilization, the commitment fee rate will increase in stages from 0% to 35% of the applicable 
margin over a period of three months.
The 2015 Facility Agreement includes customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, including 
requirements that the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA of the Group (each as defi ned in the 2015 Facility Agreement) must not, 
at any time, exceed 3.5:1 for the Relevant Period (as defi ned in the 2015 Facility Agreement), except that following certain 
acquisitions, including the merger with NPS Pharma, Shire may elect to increase the ratio to 4.0:1 in the relevant period in 
which the acquisition was completed and the immediately following relevant period. In addition, for each 12-month period 
ending December 31 or June 30, the ratio of EBITDA of the Group to Net Interest (each as defi ned in the 2015 Facility 
Agreement) must not be less than 4.0:1.
The 2015 Facility Agreement restricts (subject to certain exceptions) Shire’s ability to incur additional fi nancial indebtedness, 
grant security over its assets or provide or guarantee loans. Further, any lender may require mandatory prepayment of its

2013 Facilities Agreement
On November 11, 2013, Shire entered into a $2,600 million facilities agreement with, among others, Morgan Stanley Bank 
International Limited (acting as lead arranger and agent) (the “2013 Facilities Agreement”). The 2013 Facilities Agreement 
comprised two credit facilities: (i) a $1,750 million term loan facility and (ii) a $850 million term loan facility. 
On December 13, 2013 and at various points during the year to December 31, 2014, the Company cancelled part of the $2,600 
million term loan facility. At December 31, 2014 the 2013 Facilities Agreement comprised an $850 million term loan facility 
which matures on November 11, 2015 and was fully utilized. All other terms and conditions remain unchanged.
The $850 million term loan facility, which matures on November 11, 2015, has been used to fi nance the purchase price payable 
in respect of Shire’s acquisition of ViroPharma (including certain related costs).
Interest on any loans made under the facilities will be payable on the last day of each interest period, which may be one week 
or one, two, three or six months at the election of Shire, or as otherwise agreed with the lenders.  ANNUAL REPORT 2014 SHIRE PLC 195
O. Commitments (continued)
The interest rate applicable to the $850 million term loan facility commenced at LIBOR plus 1.15% per annum until delivery 
of the compliance certifi cate for the year ending December 31, 2013 and is subject to change depending upon the prevailing 
ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA of the Group (each as defi ned in the 2013 Facilities Agreement), in respect of the most recently 
completed fi nancial year or fi nancial half year.
The 2013 Facilities Agreement includes customary representations and warranties, covenants and events of default, 
including requirements that the ratio of Net Debt to EBITDA of Shire (each as defi ned in the 2013 Facilities Agreement) must 
not, at any time, exceed 3.5:1 for the Relevant Period (as defi ned in the 2013 Facilities Agreement), except that following 
certain acquisitions, including the ViroPharma acquisition, Shire may elect to increase the ratio to 4.0:1 in the relevant period 
in which the acquisition was completed and the immediately following relevant period. In addition, for each 12-month period 
ending December 31 or June 30, the ratio of EBITDA of the Group to Net Interest (each as defi ned in the 2013 Facilities 
Agreement) must not be less than 4.0:1.
The 2013 Facilities Agreement restricts (subject to certain covenants) Shire’s ability to incur additional fi nancial indebtedness, 
grant security over its assets or provide or guarantee loans. Further, any lender may require mandatory prepayment of its 
participation if there is a change of control of Shire. In addition, in certain circumstances, the net proceeds of certain shares, 
undertakings or business disposals by Shire must be applied towards the mandatory prepayment of the facilities, subject to 
certain exceptions.
Events of default under the facilities include: (i) non-payment of any amounts due under the facilities, (ii) failure to satisfy 
any fi nancial covenants, (iii) material misrepresentation in any of the fi nance documents, (iv) failure to pay, or certain other 
defaults, under other fi nancial indebtedness, (v) certain insolvency events or proceedings, (vi) material adverse changes in 
the business, operations, assets or fi nancial condition of Shire and its subsidiaries, (vii) if it becomes unlawful for Shire or any 
of its subsidiaries that are parties to the 2013 Facilities Agreement to perform their obligations or (viii) if Shire or any subsidiary 
of Shire which is a party to the 2013 Facilities Agreement repudiates the 2013 Facilities Agreement or any other fi nance 
document, among others. The 2013 Facilities Agreement is governed by English law.
Revolving credit facility (“RCF”)
On December 12, 2014, Shire entered into a $2,100 million revolving credit facilities agreement (the “RCF”) with a number of 
fi nancial institutions, for which Abbey National Treasury Services PLC (trading as Santander Global Banking and Markets), 
Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited, Barclays Bank PLC, Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC, 
The Royal Bank of Scotland PLC and Sumitomo Mitsui Banking Corporation acted as mandated lead arrangers and 
bookrunners and DNB Bank ASA, The Bank of Tokyo-Mitsubishi UFJ, Ltd., Credit Suisse AG, London Branch, Deutsche Bank 
Luxembourg S.A., Goldman Sachs Bank USA, Mizuho Bank, Ltd. and Morgan Stanley Bank International Limited acted as 
arrangers. Shire is an original borrower under the RCF and has agreed to act as guarantor for its subsidiaries, which are also 
original borrowers and for any other of its subsidiaries that become additional borrowers thereunder. At December 31, 2014 
the RCF was undrawn. On February 23, 2015, Shire requested the utilization of $1,300 million under the RCF to partly fi nance 
the purchase price payable in respect of Shire’s acquisition of NPS Pharma (including certain related costs).
The RCF , which terminates on December 12, 2019, may be applied towards fi nancing the general corporate purposes of Shire. 
The RCF incorporates a $250 million US Dollar and Euro swingline facility operating as a sub-limit thereof.
The RCF became immediately available for general corporate purposes as outlined above, on satisfaction of certain customary 
conditions precedent including the cancellation of Shire’s existing multicurrency term and revolving facilities agreement dated

Bank of America Merrill Lynch International Limited (formerly Banc of America Securities Limited), Barclays Bank PLC (formerly 
Barclays Capital), Citigroup Global Markets Limited, Lloyds Bank PLC (formerly Lloyds TSB Bank PLC) and The Royal Bank of 
Scotland PLC acted as lead arrangers (the facilities under which at such time were undrawn). 
Interest on any loans made under the RCF will be payable on the last day of each interest period, which may be one week 
or one, two, three or six months at the election of Shire, or as otherwise agreed with the lenders. The interest rate for the RCF 
will be: LIBOR (or, in relation to any revolving loan in Euro, EURIBOR); plus 0.30% per year until delivery of the fi rst compliance 
certifi cate required to be delivered after the date of the RCF , subject to change thereafter depending upon (i) the prevailing ratio 
of Net Debt to EBITDA (each as defi ned in the RCF) in respect of the most recently completed fi nancial year or fi nancial half 
year and (ii) the occurrence and continuation of an event of default in respect of the fi nancial covenants or the failure to provide 
a compliance certifi cate.
Shire shall also pay (i) a commitment fee equal to 35% per year of the applicable margin on available commitments under 
the RCF for the availability period applicable thereto and (ii) a utilization fee equal to (a) 0.10% per year of the aggregate of 
the amount requested by the borrower in a utilization request (the “Base Currency Amount”) of all outstanding loans up to 
an aggregate Base Currency Amount equal to $700 million, (b) 0.15% per year of the amount by which the aggregate Base 
Currency Amount of all outstanding loans exceeds $700 million but is equal to or less than $1,400 million and (c) 0.30% per

immediately following) and (ii) ratio of EBITDA to Net Interest for the most recently-ended 12-month Relevant Period (each 
as defi ned in the RCF) must not be less than 4.0:1.
The RCF restricts (subject to certain exceptions) Shire’s ability to incur additional fi nancial indebtedness, grant security over

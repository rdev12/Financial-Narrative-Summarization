AS WE HAD PREVIOUSLY INDICATED, 2008 PROVED 
TO BE A CHALLENGING YEAR, WITH RECORD RAW 
MATERIAL AND ENERGY COSTS COMBINED WITH 
A DRAMATIC DROP IN DEMAND FROM CONSTRUCTION 
RELATED CUSTOMERS. NEVERTHELESS, MUCH WAS 
ACHIEVED DURING 2008 AND WE CAN TAKE COMFORT 
FROM THE RESILIENT NATURE OF THE MAJORITY OF 
OUR BUSINESS WHERE VOLUMES HAVE BEEN LESS 
AFFECTED AND MARGINS HAVE REMAINED ROBUST.
THE CURRENT YEAR HAS STARTED IN LINE WITH 
EXPECTATIONS AND A NUMBER OF KEY FACTORS 
HAVE MOVED IN OUR FAVOUR. THERE IS NO 
QUESTION THAT THIS YEAR WILL BE VERY 
CHALLENGING, BUT WE DO CURRENTLY ANTICIPATE 
A YEAR OF PROGRESS COMPARED TO 2008 WHEN 
THE ECONOMIC DOWNTURN REDUCED CUSTOMER 
DEMAND AND WE HAD A NUMBER OF VERY DIFFICULT 
COST ISSUES TO DEAL WITH. WE HAVE TAKEN THE 
NECESSARY STEPS TO ELIMINATE EXCESS CAPACITY, 
REDUCE OUR COST BASE AND INVEST IN GROWING 
MARKETS AND WE ARE CONFIDENT THAT THIS WILL 
RESULT IN IMPROVED RETURNS IN FUTURE YEARS.

INTRODUCTION
As we had previously indicated, 2008 proved to be 
a challenging year, with record raw material and 
energy costs combined with a dramatic drop in 
demand from construction related customers.
Losses from the industrial part of our UK business, 
caused by this fall in demand, have been a major 
drag on Group proﬁ tability. We have taken decisive 
action to close excess capacity which has resulted 
in a signiﬁ cant charge to this year’s proﬁ ts.
Nevertheless, we can take comfort from the 
resilient nature of the majority of our business 
where volumes have been less a ﬀ ected and 
margins have remained robust. 
Despite our expectations for an improved 
performance in 2009, we are recommending 
a reduced dividend for the full year we 
are reporting on, as we believe it is prudent 
to preserve cash and support the balance 
sheet in these uncertain times.
RESULTS
On sales of £481 million (2007: £424 million), 
operating proﬁ t, before net restructuring costs, 
declined to £12.6 million (2007: £1 4.6 million). 
Net restructuring costs of £5.4 million (2007: 
£0.7 million) reﬂ ect closure and redundancy 
costs of £5.4 million (2007: £2.0 million). The 
2007 charge is net of a £1.3 million property 
gain. £4.0 million of the above costs are 
a provision for the closure of our Stockton 
site which we announced in November 2008 
and which will be completed during 2009.
After an increase in net ﬁ nancing costs to 
£3.3 million (2007: £2.4 million), the proﬁ t 
before tax was £3.9 million (2007: £1 1.5 million). 
Before restructuring costs, proﬁ t before tax was 
£9.3 million (2007: £12.2 million). Earnings per 
share were 1 0.67p (2007: 32.36p). Earnings per 
share, before restructuring costs, were 25.53p 
(2007: 34.26p). 
Operating proﬁ ts were impacted by increases 
in raw material costs during the ﬁ rst three 
quarters of the year and by soaring energy 
costs, particularly in the fourth quarter. Although 
we coped reasonably well with these factors, 
our UK business was also hit by a signiﬁ cant 
drop in demand from the construction sector, 
which traditionally accounts for around 15% 
of Group turnover, and this resulted in the 
decision to close our Stockton site.
Total volumes for the year were 305,000 
tonnes (2007: 316,000). At the half year they 
were 7,000 ahead of 2007, mainly due to the 
Canadian acquisition in August 2007. However, for 
the third quarter they fell by over 5,500 tonnes and 
in the fourth quarter by over 12,000 tonnes. After 
eliminating seasonal variations in agricultural sales, 
most of the annual volume loss can be attributed 
to the construction and industrial sectors.
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending a reduced ﬁ nal 
dividend of 7.5p per share for the year ended 
31 December 2008 (2007: 15p), making a total 
for the year of 1 4.5p (2007: 22p). The ﬁ nal dividend 
is payable on 21 July 2009 to shareholders on the 
register at the close of business on 1 3 March 2009. 
CASH FLOW & BORROWINGS
Net borrowings increased to £76 million 
(2007: £65 million) as at 31 December 2008. 
This increase can be entirely attributed to the 
e ﬀ ect of exchange rate movements on 
non-sterling denominated borrowings. 
Interest cover on bank borrowings, before 
exceptional costs, reduced to three times 
from the 2007 level of almost four times. As we 
envisaged, our net annual capital expenditure was 
slightly higher at £1 4.6 million (2007: £13.2 million). 
Expenditure for 2009 will be similar at around 
£1 4.0 million mainly due to investment in the 
Ardeer facility to incorporate new plant and certain 
items of machinery transferred from Stockton.
We envisage that, once completed, the closure 
of Stockton and the recent drop we have seen in 
raw material costs will have the e ﬀ ect of reducing 
our working capital.
We also anticipate substantial proceeds from 
the disposal of both the Stockton and Essex sites, 
but this may not happen for some time.
In September we renegotiated our banking 
facilities to ensure that we had headroom to 
see us through the next few years and carry 
out current and potential restructuring. This did 
not come without cost, but seemed a prudent 
move in the current credit climate. Our ongoing 
total available facilities, after repayment of 
a private placement of £20 million by July 2009, 
will be £1 16 million comprising revolving credits 
of £57.5 million renewable in 201 1, asset ﬁ nance 
of £17.5 million repayable over a ﬁ ve year period 
and short-term facilities of £41 million. 
GROUP PENSION SCHEME
The deﬁ cit in the pension scheme increased to 
nearly £26 million (2007: £1 8 million). The e ﬀ ect 
of falling investment values was largely o ﬀ set by 
the increase in the discount rate which is used 
to value liabilities. The reduction in asset values 
will, however, have a signiﬁ cant adverse e ﬀ ect 
on reported proﬁ ts for 2009 with net pension 
funding likely to move from a credit of 
£1 million to a charge of £1.5 million.

GROUP DEVELOPMENT
Despite the disappointing result for the year, 
much was achieved during 2008.
The expansion of our facility at Leominster, 
which manufactures industrial and silage 
stretchwrap, was completed on time and 
within budget. Two new ﬁ ve layer blown 
co-extrusion lines were installed in a purpose 
built extrusion bay. An additional ﬁ ve layer line 
was installed at Zele, in Belgium, their third ﬁ ve 
layer line for silage stretchwrap. These two facilities 
oﬀ er our customers unrivalled quality and service 
in this product which we supply across Europe 
and beyond.
At Ardeer, we successfully commissioned 
a back-seam tuber which makes tubular form 
ﬁ ll and seal feedstock from sheeting for use on 
automatic sack ﬁ lling lines, particularly in the 
cement industry. This type of packaging has the 
potential to eventually replace the paper cement 
sack when current packing machinery is replaced.
Our Consumer Packaging business at Worcester, 
which supplies printed ﬁ lm and bags for produce 
and bread, saw the installation of the ﬁ rst of two 
ten colour ﬂ exo presses, making this site the best 
equipped ﬂ exo print facility in the UK. The second 
press is currently being installed.
Our Chinese facility is now successfully making 
similar Consumer products and exporting to the 
Middle East, Australasia, the UK and also starting 
to manufacture for the Chinese domestic market. 
All of the above investments are in line with our 
strategy to invest in capacity in growing markets, 
supporting the future growth of the Group.
RESTRUCTURING
We have previously highlighted the need for 
change in our traditional UK business where 
it was clear that our capacity was no longer 
aligned with customer demand. 
In May we announced the closure of a small 
manufacturing site at Buckhurst Hill, in Essex, 
with the loss of some 45 jobs.
The dramatic drop in demand from the UK 
construction sector during 2008 necessitated 
further decisive action and in November we 
announced the intention to close the large 
manufacturing facility at Stockton-on-Tees, 
with the loss of 1 65 jobs.
The Essex closure and other restructuring in the 
UK business led to costs of £0.5 million in the ﬁ rst 
six months and £0.9 million in the second half. The 
estimated closure costs for Stockton, including 
asset write downs and equipment relocation costs, 
will be £5.0 million. £4.0 million of the total has 
been provided in 2008 with the balance to be 
charged in 2009. This brings the total 
restructuring cost for 2008 to £5.4 million. 
Both the Stockton and Essex sites are freehold 
and your Board is conﬁ dent that at some time 
in the future, and subject to relevant planning 
permissions, proceeds from the property sales 
will cover these closure costs. 
RAW MATERIAL COSTS
The collapse in commodity polymer prices 
at the end of 2008 was long overdue. The 
cash margin over the cost of a barrel of oil had 
reached an all time high and although those 
producers buying ethylene or naphtha were 
at a signiﬁ cant disadvantage, the integrated 
producers of polyethylene had never had it 
so good, enjoying margins never seen 
before in the industry.
It is a di ﬀ erent scenario today. Towards the 
end of 2008, the price of commodity grades 
of polymer fell ﬁ rst and fell sharply. Prices 
for speciality grades, which we use for many 
of our high quality products, fell less quickly 
and to a lesser extent and many did not move 
at all until early 2009.
This drop in the price of polymer has been 
accompanied by a drop in the value of sterling, 
resulting in smaller price reductions in the UK 
than in euro-priced markets.
The end result of these price changes will be 
a signiﬁ cant reduction in turnover and a drop 
in our working capital, as the average selling 
price per tonne falls in line with the reduced 
cost of the raw material.
New capacity for polymer production will continue 
to come on stream over the next few years, and, 
subject to continuity of the current oil price and 
minimum ﬂ uctuation in exchange rates, we 
anticipate that the price of our raw material will 
remain at or around current levels for some time.
ENERGY COSTS
Energy costs in the last few months of 2008 
were the highest that we have ever experienced. 
In 2008 our total energy bill increased by £8.5 
million to £22.0 million, with nearly £8.0 million 
of that increase arising in the UK.
It is clear that the UK, devoid of a coherent 
energy policy for a number of years, will struggle 
with energy costs and supplies over the next 
decade. Reduced demand from industry, as 
a consequence of the current recession, may help 
in the short term, but unless we can detect some 
sign that energy costs in the UK are going to align 
with those in our other manufacturing locations, 
we will ﬁ nd it di ﬃ  cult to invest in capacity in 
a country with energy costs so much higher 
than in the rest of the world.
PROSPECTS AND CURRENT TRADING
The defensive sectors of the business – agriculture, 
retail food and related transit packaging, healthcare 
and refuse sacks – currently remain resilient 
and we anticipate that volumes in these sectors 
in 2009 will be close to last year. Construction, 
industrial and non-food retail sectors are not 
doing so well, and for the ﬁ rst six months will 
be materially behind the same period last year. 
As indicated, action is being taken to reduce 
capacity in these di ﬃ  cult sectors and direct 
labour costs have already been drastically 
reduced at Stockton. However, it will be 201 0 
before we see the beneﬁ ts of this closure, as 
relocating production, while maintaining service 
to our customers, will take most of the year. 
By that time, we will have a much leaner, better 
equipped and lower cost operation to service 
our UK industrial and construction customers. 
The current year has started in line with 
our expectations and certain key factors have 
moved in our favour. Polymer, scrap, energy and 
other important input costs have all reduced from 
where they were during 2008. The movement 
in sterling exchange rates has made imports of 
polythene ﬁ lm products to the UK less attractive 
and has improved the competitiveness of our UK 
plants exposed to those imports. However, credit 
risks have increased and liquidity is uncertain 
in some export markets.
There is no question that 2009 will be very 
challenging, but we do currently anticipate a year 
of progress compared to 2008 when the economic 
downturn reduced customer demand and we 
had a number of very di ﬃ  cult cost issues to deal 
with. However, in the current climate, it would be 
imprudent not to have a sense of caution in 
relation to the e ﬀ ects the economic background 
may have on our customers. 
Looking to the longer term, we have taken steps 
to eliminate excess capacity, reduce costs and 
invest in growing markets. Your Board is conﬁ dent 
that these steps will result in improved returns 
in future years.

RISK FACTORS
BPI MA Y BE AFFECTED BY A NUMBER OF RISKS, NOT ALL OF WHICH ARE WITHIN 
OUR CONTROL. OUTLINED BELOW IS A DESCRIPTION OF SOME OF THE F ACTORS 
THA T MA Y AFFECT OUR BUSINESS. OTHER F ACTORS, IN ADDITION TO THOSE 
LISTED BELOW, MA Y ALSO ADVERSEL Y AFFECT THE GROUP . THE PROCESS THA T 
BPI HAS IN PLACE FOR MANAGING THESE RISKS IS DESCRIBED IN THE CORPORA TE 
GOVERNANCE REPORT ON P AGE 34.
RISK DESCRIPTION MITIGATION
The Group is exposed to a variety of market sectors which may be a ﬀ ected, 
to a greater or lesser extent, by the current poor economic conditions. Around 
two thirds of the business is in the retail food, agriculture, healthcare and waste 
services sectors which, so far, have proved more resilient to the economic 
downturn. The remainder of the business is in construction, industrial and 
non-food retail. These sectors have already su ﬀ ered a signiﬁ cant downturn. 
The major geographical markets are UK, Ireland, Belgium, the Netherlands 
and North America. Reduced demand leads to lost contribution, but can 
also put pressure on margins as competitors ﬁ ght for remaining volumes. 
For analysis of sales by market and geographical sector, see page 2.
–  Reduce production capacity to align with demand. The closure of the 
Stockton facility, which was heavily dependent on the construction sector, 
has already been announced. If volumes continue to fall, further action 
would be considered to reduce our cost base.
–  Increased focus on credit assessment and prompt action 
on overdue accounts.
–  Some accounts are credit insured, particularly in Europe 
and in the agricultural sector.
In the current economic climate, the risk of customer insolvency is increased.
The Group’s main raw material, polymer, is subject to volatility on a month by 
month basis due to ﬂ uctuating prices for ethylene and, to a lesser extent oil. 
Supplier actions can also inﬂ uence prices due to maintenance periods and 
breakdowns at their production plants. This creates a risk of erosion in margins 
if price increases cannot be passed through immediately to customers. Prices 
have fallen signiﬁ cantly from all time highs in the middle of 2008 and there 
is now some pressure for increases. 
–  Centralised Group purchasing arrangements to ensure 
the best purchase price.
–  Co-ordinated instructions to sales teams on forward pricing.
–  Some linkage of customer pricing to polymer price indices.
–  Management of stock levels depending on anticipated price movements.
–  Ability to hedge using London Metal Exchange futures contracts, 
but currently very limited due to lack of liquidity.
As a process business and a signiﬁ cant user of energy, our results can be a ﬀ ected 
by major price movements.
–  Monitor energy prices and buy forward when advantageous.
–  Group energy saving programme implemented on each manufacturing site.
A number of our products are dependent on seasonal weather conditions 
and certain weather conditions could lead to reduced volumes.
–  Geographical spread of markets.
–  Diversiﬁ cation of product portfolio.
–  Controlled stock build for seasonal products.
As we operate in several non UK countries, have considerable exports from the 
UK and our main competitors are based in Europe, we are exposed to medium 
term movements in exchange rates, particularly the euro and the US dollar.
–  Hedging of known currency exposures.
–  T ransfer production among Group sites in UK, Europe, North America 
and China, where possible.
While polythene ﬁ lm is the most lightweight durable packaging medium, 
perceptions continue to exist that it is environmentally unfriendly which, 
together with adverse comments on plastic and packaging, could lead 
to changes in customer preference.
–  Communication and education e ﬀ orts with customers and others 
to dispel some of the myths.
Our business is subject to regulation in many countries and this can impact 
on our performance as we have seen recently with the European Commission 
Anti-Dumping Duties on certain products from China.
–  Monitor new and existing legislation and train sta ﬀ  accordingly.

Food wastage in less developed countries 
without packaging has been shown to be 
between 30% and 50%. If the products 
we packed had been wasted in similar 
proportions this would represent an 
energy loss of 23,000-35,000 gigajoules.
Flexible ﬁ lm packaging protects on average 
between 1 00 and 400 times its weight 
in food.
Of the total energy used in the food chain, 
50% is consumed in producing the food, 
10% in transporting it to the retailer, 10% 
in its packaging and 30% by the consumer 
in its collection, storage and cooking.

KEY PERFORMANCE INDICATORS
THE GROUP UTILISES THE FOLLOWING INDICA TORS OF PERFORMANCE TO ASSESS ITS 
DEVELOPMENT AGAINST ITS STRA TEGIC, FINANCIAL AND OPERA TIONAL OBJECTIVES.
IT SHOULD BE NOTED THA T AN ADDITIONAL MEASURE OF DILUTED EARNINGS PER 
SHARE HAS BEEN SHOWN WHICH EXCLUDES RESTRUCTURING COSTS. THESE COSTS 
WERE VERY SIGNIFICANT IN 2008 AND EXCLUDING THEM FROM THE MEASURE GIVES 
A BETTER UNDERST ANDING OF THE UNDERL YING PERFORMANCE OF THE BUSINESS.
 FINAN CIAL KPIS
STRA TEGIC RA TIONALE
Operating proﬁ t per tonne is the most signiﬁ cant 
measure of operating performance for the Group. 
We relate performance to the volume of sales 
rather than the value of sales because the latter 
can be highly volatile due to ﬂ uctuating raw 
material prices.
DEFINITION AND CALCULA TION
The deﬁ nition of operating proﬁ t is proﬁ t before
restructuring costs as shown on the face of the 
Income Statement. Sales volumes were 
305 ktonnes in 2008.
STRA TEGIC RA TIONALE
Earnings per share is important to our 
shareholders because it is one of the major 
factors which determine shareholder value. 
It is one of the measures on which senior 
management is rewarded through our L TIP plan.
DEFINITION AND CALCULA TION
Diluted earnings per share is proﬁ t either before 
or after restructuring costs and after tax divided 
by the diluted average number of ordinary shares 
and is calculated on the same basis as Note 8 
to the Accounts.
STRA TEGIC RA TIONALE
Dividend cover is important to many of our
shareholders because we are recognised 
as a high yield stock.
DEFINITION AND CALCULA TION
Dividend cover is proﬁ t after tax divided by 
the proposed annual dividend. If restructuring 
costs were excluded, dividend cover would 
be 1.76 times in 2008.

STRA TEGIC RA TIONALE
As a manufacturing business with a very 
rigorous focus on Health and Safety issues 
we measure lost time accidents for each site 
and benchmark against the rest of the Group 
and other manufacturing businesses. 
Our L T A rate for 2008 is similar to the rate for all 
plastics and rubber manufacturers published by 
the Health and Safety Executive. Our business, 
however, has a signiﬁ cant element of recycling 
and our performance compares very favourably 
with other recycling businesses.
DEFINITION AND CALCULA TION
Lost time accidents are accidents that cause 
employees to be unavailable for normal duties 
for more than three consecutive days. The rate 
is expressed as the number of accidents per 
1 00,000 hours worked.
STRA TEGIC RA TIONALE
As a relatively labour intensive business, 
absenteeism can be a signiﬁ cant cost and 
lost opportunity for the Group. We monitor 
absenteeism by site and for the Group 
as a whole. 
The Chartered Institute of Personnel & 
Development ﬁ gures for 2008 show a rate of 
3.5% for all sectors and 3.2% for manufacturing 
and production employers. Both of these rates 
have improved during 2008.
DEFINITION AND CALCULA TION
Absenteeism is expressed as the number of 
hours of absence as a percentage of annual 
contractual hours. Absence is deﬁ ned as time 
o ﬀ  through illness or authorised at the discretion 
of management along with any unauthorised 
non-attendance. It does not include any legal 
or contractual absence from work.
OPERATIONAL KPIS
STRA TEGIC RA TIONALE
We monitor electricity usage per tonne as part of 
our overall environmental policy of minimising our 
use of resources and also as a means of reducing 
a signiﬁ cant input cost for the business.
There was a slight increase in usage per tonne 
in 2008, mainly due to ine ﬃ  ciencies caused 
by reduced volumes. This is explained further 
on page 29.
DEFINITION AND CALCULA TION
Electricity usage is consumption in kilowatt hours 
per tonne of production output.

OVER THE LAST 20 YEARS BPI 
HAS BECOME A WORLD LEADING 
MANUF ACTURER OF SILAGE FILM 
USED BY F ARMERS TO CONSERVE 
FODDER FOR THE OVER WINTERING

Silage provides farmers with a natural, 
cost e ﬀ ective, means of feeding their stock. 
Our silage ﬁ lm is used to conserve fodder 
for dairy cows, suckler cows, ﬁ nishing cattle, 
store cattle, sheep and horses.
In 2008, we supplied farmers in 40 countries 
with su ﬃ  cient silage ﬁ lm to ensile some 
1 5 million tonnes of fodder. 
If all the ﬁ lm we supplied in 2008 was used 
by dairy farmers, the fodder made would 
provide the over winter silage forage 
requirements of 3.75 million cows.

MARKET OVERVIEW
THE EUROPEAN POL YTHENE FILM EXTRUSION MARKET IS ESTIMA TED A T OVER 
7 MILLION TONNES AND IS HIGHL Y FRAGMENTED WITH NO INDIVIDUAL BUSINESS 
HAVING MORE THAN 5% OF THE MARKET . THE MARKET IS CHARACTERISED 
BY STRONG REGIONAL PLA YERS AND A NUMBER OF SPECIALISTS.
Major end use applications include the 
protection of goods in transit using stretchﬁ lm, 
collation shrinkwrap and pallet shrinkwrap. 
Stretchﬁ lm has enjoyed good growth rates, 
as in most cases, it is the most cost e ﬀ ective 
solution. The main process is cast technology 
although the blown ﬁ lm process has greater 
ﬂ exibility to tailor ﬁ lms to particular needs and 
is mainly used for silage ﬁ lms and, increasingly, 
stretch hoods. Bags and sacks are a major sector 
with a wide variety of uses from small coin bags 
to carrier bags, to heavy duty sacks for chemicals 
and animal feed. Carrier bag production in Europe 
has declined because of increasing volumes of 
imported bags and environmental pressures to 
reduce their usage. The heavy duty sack market is 
moving to continuous form, ﬁ ll and seal processes 
which are replacing individual open mouth and 
valve sacks. There are still a large number of paper 
sacks in use and market sectors such as animal 
feed, pet food and cement are increasingly under 
pressure to move to polythene sacks. The refuse 
sack market continues to be resilient despite 
downgauging and movements to wheelie bins 
and communal containers. A high proportion 
of refuse sacks are made with recycled materials. 
Non-packaging uses for polythene ﬁ lms are 
primarily in building and agricultural applications, 
including damp prooﬁ ng and ﬁ lm used for silage, 
mulch wrap and greenhouse covers.
The nature of the polythene ﬁ lm industry is such 
that a signiﬁ cant proportion is manufactured as 
ﬁ lm on the reel which is then sold to converters 
for a wide variety of other applications.
Polymer, the main raw material, is produced as 
a downstream product from the oil industry with 
the main suppliers being the large multinational 
oil and petrochemical companies. Raw material 
prices have always been volatile due to supply 
and demand and the inﬂ uence of oil and ethylene 
prices. Increases in oil and ethylene prices, 
combined with increasing demand from the 
Far East, particularly China, have contributed to 
a steadily rising polymer price over the last ﬁ ve 
years. The average polymer price per annum has 
increased every year since 2002 reaching an all 
time high in 2008. Substantial increases during 
2008 led to a new peak with Platts LD, 
the main published index, reaching £1,255 
per tonne. Substantial investment is being 
made in the Middle East, including Iran, and 
signiﬁ cant additional capacity has come on 
stream from the end of 2008 and this will 
continue progressively during 2009 and 
201 0. A new plant in the UK is expected to be 
commissioned in the second quarter of 2009. 
A combination of the fall in oil prices, economic 
downturn and new capacity from the Middle 
East led to a collapse in polymer prices in the 
ﬁ nal quarter of 2008.
A recycling industry has developed with over 
700,000 tonnes of process and post consumer 
waste recycled for use by the ﬁ lm extrusion 
industry in a variety of products.
 
Polythene ﬁ lm has been highly successful in 
substituting other materials within the packaging 
industry such as paper and aluminium, due to its 
superior characteristic of lightweight strength. 
The industry is now reaching a degree of maturity 
and recent years have been challenging with 
growth rates now averaging less than 2% per 
annum, caused by slower underlying economic 
growth, continuing downgauging of ﬁ lms and 
increased import penetration of converted bags 
from Asia. Rising raw material and other input 
costs, increased imports and price pressure 
from customers have all conspired to put 
pressure on margins. 
The industry in Mainland Europe and the 
UK has over capacity in certain product areas 
and would beneﬁ t from some rationalisation 
and consolidation to redress this imbalance.

BUSINESS OVERVIEW
SUMMARY
Group operating proﬁ t, before restructuring costs, 
reduced from £1 4.6 million to £12.6 million as raw 
material price increases and higher UK energy 
costs reduced margins. Overall volumes fell below 
2007 as we felt the full impact of the reduction in 
UK construction activity and experienced a sharp 
reduction in overall volumes in the ﬁ nal quarter. 
Our agricultural acquisition in North America 
performed ahead of expectations and contributed 
ﬁ rst time operating proﬁ ts of £0.8 million.
RAW MATERIAL PRICES
Raw material prices continued to increase during 
2008 and reached a record price in August before 
falling in the ﬁ nal quarter due to the fall in the price 
of oil and the economic downturn. In August, the 
Platts price index for low density polymer reached 
a new record high of £1,255 per tonne and the 
average for 2008 was over £1,000 per tonne 
and 16% above the average for 2007.
During the year, higher increases were charged 
by our suppliers on certain grades of polymer and 
some price reference organisations failed to reﬂ ect 
the higher market price movements. This required 
our sales team to increase selling prices above 
reported movements in an e ﬀ ort to recover 
these input costs without excessive delay.
 JOHN L ANGL ANDS 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
  Our primary ﬁ nancial objectives are to grow operating proﬁ ts and earnings per share and improve 
our return on capital.
 We see further growth opportunities in agricultural markets, recycling and printed consumer products.
 We intend to develop our mainland European, Chinese and North American operations.
  We require to restructure our UK ﬁ lms and UK industrial sectors.
  We aim to provide ﬁ rst class customer service by delivering high quality products at competitive prices.
  We aim to be number 1 or number 2 in the major markets in which we operate. 
 We aim to achieve organic growth in product areas and market sectors that continue to develop.
  We will invest in modern manufacturing equipment to enable us to develop new products, 
expand capacity in growing markets and improve added value and production e ﬃ  ciencies.
  We will aim for continuing product development to ensure we remain at the leading edge 
of technical advances.
 We will seek continual improvement in our operational performance and reduction in our cost base
 to ensure we remain competitive.
 Acquisition opportunities will be considered, but will only be completed at the right price.
  We ﬁ rmly believe that the prevention of accidents involving personal injury is essential to the successful 
operation of our business and we regard the health and safety of our employees as paramount.
  As a leading manufacturer and supplier of polythene, we recognise our responsibility to operate with 
due concern for the environment in which we live and work and to minimise the impact of our activities 
on that environment.
 We recognise that our people continue to be central to the development of the business.
  As part of the review, the strategy was amended to reﬂ ect our intention to develop our North American 
operation, to exploit the opportunity for growth in printed consumer products and to rationalise 
the operations in our UK ﬁ lm and industrial sectors due to over capacity.
  Our strategy was reviewed during the year and broadly remained unchanged in that we are a focused 
polythene ﬁ lm business and will develop our market leading positions as:
  – The largest recycler of polythene ﬁ lm in Europe. 
 – A leading global supplier of agricultural ﬁ lm products. 
 –  A leading European supplier of packaging for the protection of food and other goods.

Also, the pricing for many specialist polymers 
used to produce thinner products to enable 
downgauging no longer followed the commodity 
LDPE prices and it became necessary to de-link 
sales pricing from the traditional published LDPE 
price references.
Commodity polymer prices fell signiﬁ cantly 
in quarter 4 with specialist grades falling less 
quickly as they waited for the quarterly reduction 
in ethylene in January. At the start of 2009 the 
ethylene market has moved, temporarily, to 
monthly pricing. All polymer suppliers are 
attempting to recover the February ethylene 
increase of 70 euros and an increase in March 
is also likely.
The outlook for prices in 2009 will see an average 
price much reduced from 2008 due to lower 
expected oil prices, lack of demand due to 
the economic downturn and new capacity 
from the Middle East coming on stream.
The new UK LD plant in the North East of England 
has been delayed and is now not expected to start 
until quarter 2 in 2009.
 
SALES AND MARGINS
Total sales rose by 13% to £481 million and, 
excluding our North American acquisition, were up 
1 0% reﬂ ecting the increase in raw material prices. 
Sales to destinations outside the UK now amount 
to 42% of sales compared to 36% in 2007, with 5% 
of sales now in North America compared to 2% in 
2007. The normal delay in recovering raw material 
prices together with the impact of higher UK 
electricity costs resulted in margin compression.
ENERGY COSTS
Electricity prices increased substantially in the 
UK with our total costs up by nearly £8 million 
to over £1 8 million, an increase of 80%. The prices 
were particularly high in the second half with 
summer prices above the previous winter. In the 
ﬁ nal quarter, as most commodity prices collapsed, 
the UK electricity costs spiralled to unprecedented 
levels reﬂ ecting real concern that the UK 
had insu ﬃ  cient capacity to meet our energy 
requirements. Our UK electricity cost per tonne 
of product produced in 2008 is signiﬁ cantly higher 
than the equivalent production costs in Belgium, 
the Netherlands, China or Canada and places UK 
industry at a signiﬁ cant disadvantage.
The reduction in commodity prices and reduced 
demand from industry has resulted in a signiﬁ cant 
reduction in energy prices in 2009 despite the very 
cold spell in February. Prices do, however, remain 
above prices in all of Europe with signiﬁ cantly 
lower wholesale prices available in Scandinavia 
and Spain.
SCRAP
For most of the year, scrap prices continued 
to climb on the back of the higher polymer 
prices and availability remained di ﬃ  cult, with 
70% of plastic packaging waste being exported 
for reprocessing overseas. Due to the lack 
of available good clean waste we continue 
to concentrate our recycling activities on the 
more di ﬃ  cult and heavily contaminated waste, 
including agricultural ﬁ lm waste.
In the ﬁ nal quarter of 2008, the export 
market collapsed due to a fall in commodity 
prices and the economic downturn and this 
has resulted in more plastic waste becoming 
available in the UK and a reduction in scrap prices. 
This potentially threatened the ability of the UK 
to meet its plastic recycling targets in 2008 and 
highlights the risk in placing such heavy reliance 
on overseas markets to achieve compliance 
with the Packaging Waste Regulations.
SALES VOLUMES
Our total sales volumes of manufactured 
product fell from 316,000 tonnes to 305,000 
tonnes as we experienced a signiﬁ cant reduction 
in demand from the UK construction sector.
Our North American business which was part 
of the Group for 12 months (2007: 5 months) 
contributed 13,000 tonnes compared to 5,000 
tonnes in 2007. Excluding North America, our 
volumes fell from 31 1,000 tonnes to 292,000 
tonnes, a fall of some 1 9,000 tonnes or 6%. The 
fall is attributable to the reduction in activity in 
the UK construction sector, the overall downturn 
in quarter 4 and some continued downgauging. 
Sales volumes in the ﬁ rst half were ahead of the 
previous year but down 8% in quarter 3 and 1 9% 
in quarter 4 which saw reductions in all sectors.
 
RESTRUCTURING
During the year we carried out a signiﬁ cant level 
of restructuring as we continued to reduce our 
cost base and take decisive action to counter the 
impact of the downturn in construction activity.
In January, at our Stockton site we announced 
a number of measures to reduce our cost base 
and this resulted in the loss of 15 jobs.
In March, we consolidated our refuse sales o ﬃ  ces 
at Heanor resulting in the closure of the Stockton 
sales o ﬃ  ce and the loss of nine jobs.
In May, we closed our small unproﬁ table 
manufacturing site at Buckhurst Hill in Essex 
with the loss of 45 jobs and moved the business 
to our other small sites at Flint and Cowdenbeath.
BPI-100205 Annual Report Front 2008 76pp V5.indd   17 BPI-100205 Annual Report Front 2008 76pp V5.indd   17 6/4/09   12:47:36 6/4/09   12:47:36 18 REPORT BY DIRECTORS & BUSINESS REVIEW
In September, as the downturn in the 
construction industry had resulted in reduced 
volumes of construction ﬁ lms, we decided to 
consolidate the production of all construction 
ﬁ lms at our main facility in Rhymney in Wales. 
All manufacture of temporary protecting 
sheeting was moved from Greenock to Rhymney 
and Greenock was moved from our Recycled 
Products sector to our Industrial sector. 
We also announced the closure of the “Old Bank” 
at Stockton Films and the transfer of equipment 
to Ardeer, Greenock and Swansea as the operation 
of these lines was uncompetitive. This resulted 
in the loss of 25 jobs.
In October, in our stretchﬁ lms sector, we 
announced the transfer of two blown lines from 
Bridgwater to Leominster to consolidate blown 
ﬁ lm production on the larger Leominster site. 
Bridgwater continues as a low cost, high volume, 
high performance cast ﬁ lm manufacturer. Around 
30 jobs will be lost at Bridgwater as a result of this 
move. A further ten jobs were lost in our plain ﬁ lms 
sector due to a downturn in demand.
All these changes resulted in a loss of 134 jobs 
and a restructuring charge of £1.4 million.
In November, we announced the closure of our 
large manufacturing facility at Stockton with the 
lost of 1 65 jobs and the transfer of all business to 
other Group sites including Greenock and Ardeer. 
Over 40% of the business at Stockton was to the 
construction sector and demand had reduced 
dramatically with little prospect of improvement. 
The site had made losses over the last few years 
and, given the reduced demand in the market 
place, the requirement to reduce operating 
costs and the spare capacity available elsewhere, 
production at Stockton was no longer viable.
There will be a gradual run down of operations 
throughout 2009 to avoid any disruption to our 
customers. Around 70 employees left in January 
and we currently envisage closing our sacks lines 
at the end of quarter 1. Manufacture of other 
products will continue until at least quarter 
3 to allow investment in our Ardeer site.
The estimated closure costs, including asset 
write-downs, equipment relocation and site 
clearance, were £5.0 million of which £4.0 million 
has been provided in the 2008 accounts.
In January and February we have implemented 
35 redundancies across our Recycled Products 
sector and announced the closure of our 
Rochdale sales o ﬃ  ce.
Our total UK workforce has reduced to 
1,858 employees at the end of December and 
with the closure of Stockton and other reductions 
in Recycled Products, we would expect our UK 
employees to be below 1,650 by the end of 2009.
We cannot understate the amount of disruption 
all of these changes have made to the business 
and our employees continue to perform well 
under these very di ﬃ  cult circumstances.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
Total capital expenditure at £1 4.6 million 
was higher than the depreciation charge of 
£1 3.4 million as we spent £7.3 million on new 
stretch lines for our sites in Zele and Leominster 
and £1.8 million on a ten colour printing press 
for Worcester.
Other expenditure totalled £5.5 million as 
we continued to invest for new products 
and production e ﬃ  ciencies.
Expenditure in 2009 will include building work 
at Ardeer to increase the warehouse space and 
we will also install another ten colour printing 
press at our Worcester site.
STRATEGY
Our strategy, which was reviewed during 2008, 
is set out on page 16. The only changes arising 
from the review were to add printed consumer 
products and North American agricultural markets 
as areas for growth and development and conﬁ rm 
the need to rationalise our traditional UK ﬁ lm and 
industrial sectors. 
We progressed our strategy during 2008.
In the agricultural markets we:
–  Installed three new ﬁ ve layer stretch lines to 
provide additional capacity for silage stretchwrap 
and our new products Baletite
®
 and SilotitePro
®
. 
–  Assessed the European market for our Canadian 
silage and grain bag products and authorised the 
construction of folding machines for installation 
at Ardeer to service the European market.
In the printed consumer markets we:
–  Authorised the purchase of two ten colour 
printing presses for Worcester.
– Filled our additional print capacity at Zele.
–  Developed printed consumer sales in 
China through exporting to the Middle 
East and Australasia.
In Recycling we:
–  Consolidated construction ﬁ lm at Rhymney. 
– Installed a small washing plant at Rhymney.
We began the rationalisation of UK ﬁ lms and 
industrial sectors by:
– Closing our loss making Essex operation.
–  Announcing the closure of Stockton to focus 
production at Ardeer and Greenock. 
–  Moving the two remaining blown lines from 
Bridgwater to leave Bridgwater as a focused 
cast packaging stretchwrap plant.
KEY RELATIONSHIPS
The Group does not have any customers that 
amount to more than 3% of the Group turnover.
The Group purchases its main raw materials 
from a number of key suppliers including 
Dow, ExxonMobil and Sabic and has supply 
arrangements in place. All these suppliers have 
a number of plants both in Europe and the Middle 
East and alternative sources are available, except 
for some very specialised grades. 
OUTLOOK
The current outlook remains very uncertain but 
nearly 70% of our sales are in the more resilient 
sectors of the food retail chain, agriculture, 
healthcare and waste collection. Volumes 
continue to hold up in these sectors.
In previous years, we have been adversely 
impacted by price increases in polymer, scrap 
and energy but they have all returned to more 
acceptable levels.
Exchange rate movements in the euro and US 
dollar are favourable in that they make our exports 
more competitive and make imports from these 
areas more expensive. Exchange movements 
will also improve the translation of our proﬁ ts 
in Europe and North America. 
We have taken decisive action during 2008 
to eliminate excess capacity, reduce our cost 
base and move our business towards more 
resilient sectors.
There is no doubt that 2009 will be challenging, 
but we have taken positive action to reduce 
our cost base and external factors are looking 
more encouraging.

OPERATING REVIEW
EUROPE
 
Our European business comprises two 
manufacturing sites in Belgium, one manufacturing 
site in the Netherlands and a sales operation in 
France. The business specialises in the manufacture 
and sale of high quality printed ﬁ lm for the food 
industry, form ﬁ ll and seal ﬁ lms (FFS) and heavy 
duty sacks, including valve bags and Waviblok for 
the chemical, construction, horticulture and fertiliser 
industries, pallet protection ﬁ lms including stretch 
hoods, insulation ﬁ lm, general industrial ﬁ lms and 
silage and packaging stretchwrap. Main markets 
are Belgium, the Netherlands, North of France 
and Germany, except for silage stretch which 
is sold throughout mainland Europe.
During the year we transferred two FFS 
production lines from Zele to Hardenberg, 
thereby consolidating the manufacture of all 
FFS at Hardenberg in the Netherlands. Our Zele 
site in Belgium is, therefore, focused on printed 
ﬁ lm for the food industry and stretchwrap.
The reported sterling proﬁ t at £7.3 million was 
above 2007 due to the currency movement 
of the euro against sterling. The 2007 proﬁ ts 
were translated at 1.46 while 2008 proﬁ ts were 
translated at 1.26. Actual euro proﬁ ts fell 6% due 
to lower volumes and reduced margins arising 
from increased raw material prices.
FILM PRODUCTS
Europe produces a range of ﬁ lm on the reel products 
which are supplied to a wide variety of markets.
Total volume sales of silagewrap were in line 
with 2007 as we consolidated the 20% growth 
achieved in that year. Growing conditions were 
not as good in 2008 with sales stopping in August. 
Sales of our new products SilotitePro
®
 and 
Baletite
®
 were minimal, but with the machinery 
manufacturers launching new balers in 2009, 
we should see better sales. Baletite
®
 is a 
replacement for traditional round bale netting 
and SilotitePro
®
 is a new generation of silage ﬁ lm 
with improved economical and environmental 
properties and both will reinforce our market 
leading position in the silage wrap business.
Sales of pallet protection ﬁ lm, insulation ﬁ lm 
and general purpose ﬁ lm were steady for most 
of the year, but were well down in the ﬁ nal quarter.
CONVERTED PRODUCTS
Converted products include all our printed 
and converted products which are supplied 
to a wide range of markets. 
Sales of printed ﬁ lm for deep frozen vegetables 
and frozen chips were 20% ahead of 2007 which 
was a poor year due to shortage of vegetables 
and potatoes in the ﬁ rst half of the year. 
We achieved growth in ﬁ lm for frozen 
chips to ﬁ ll our new print capacity. 
Industrial volumes fell by 1 0% due to the slow 
down in the economy, with reduced activity by 
our customers in the building, fertiliser, salt and 
peat markets. Sales to the petrochemical sector 
were also well down in the last quarter. All types 
of bags reduced in 2007 as the market continued 
to move to FFS. Margins were depressed due 
to the increases in raw material prices.
CAPITAL EXPENDITURE
During the year we installed a further ﬁ ve layer 
stretchline which will add capacity to meet the 
growing demand for silage stretch and provide 
capacity for our new products Baletite
®
, SilotitePro
®
 
and also Bontite
®
, which is our high quality 
industrial packaging stretchwrap product. 
UK & IRELAND
Our UK and Ireland business consists of 16 UK 
manufacturing sites and ﬁ ve sales/ service o ﬃ  ces 
in the UK and Ireland. It also includes our plant 
in China as most of its production is currently 
sold in the UK.
Operating proﬁ ts fell due to the higher polymer 
prices and an additional £8 million of energy costs.
Volumes fell 7% to 230,000 tonnes reﬂ ecting 
the reduced activity in the construction sector 
and a very poor ﬁ nal quarter.
FILM PRODUCTS
Film products include a range of ﬁ lm on the 
reel for a variety of di ﬀ erent markets and includes 
products such as stretchfilm, plain shrink film, 
printed shrink film, produce films, bread films, 
lamination ﬁ lms, liquid packaging ﬁ lms and surface 
protection ﬁ lms. Incorporating highly respected 
brand names such as Novatek
®
, Brithene
®
 and 
Surpreme
®
, the range of products provides secure 
cost e ﬀ ective transit and primary packaging for 
the most demanding applications.

Sales of collation shrink wrap which are mainly 
to the food and drink industries fell by nearly 1 0%. 
The poor weather, in the UK, at Easter and during 
the summer reduced demand. We have continued 
to develop a range of downgauged shrink ﬁ lms 
to meet our customers’ packaging needs. 
Sales to the converter sector recovered by 5% 
from 2007 despite a poor ﬁ nal quarter as we 
beneﬁ ted from the euro exchange rate.
Total volume sales of industrial stretchwrap 
were 5% down on 2007, mainly due to reduced 
volumes in blown hand rolls as we exited some 
low margin business and converted some 
customers to our prestretch WrapsmartUltra
®
 
product. The new WrapsmartUltra
®
 hand roll 
product is 7 micron compared to our traditional 
hand roll at 12 to 17 micron and, therefore, uses 
nearly half the material. The new hand rolls o ﬀ er 
the same strength and high performance levels 
as standard stretchﬁ lm products, despite their 
ultra lightweight and thinner gauge. We have 
successfully exported these products and are 
currently installing two machines in our Chinese 
factory to service the Australasian market. Our cast 
lines continued to operate at close to capacity as 
exchange rates movements have made us more 
competitive against the European producers.
Sales of silage stretch were modestly ahead of 
2007, with good sales in the UK and Scandinavia. 
Sales in Ireland were well down as local 
competition ensured that this was the poorest 
margin market in Europe. In the UK, we positioned 
ourselves as suppliers to the largest co-operatives 
and agricultural merchants who wish to sell our 
well marketed, branded, high quality silage ﬁ lm. 
Selling prices rose to reﬂ ect the signiﬁ cant raw 
material increases and ﬁ lm was in short supply 
in the UK.
During the year we completed the installation 
of two new ﬁ ve layer lines at our Leominster 
facility. These lines have increased capacity 
and enabled us to produce our new products 
SilotitePro
®
 and Baletite
®
. 
Volumes of silage sheet were ahead of 2007 
as we regained the export business lost in that 
year and achieved higher sales in the UK.
Sales of horticultural ﬁ lm were, disappointingly, 
below 2007 as growers in the UK delayed 
re-covering their tunnels and exports did 
not achieve the expected growth. 
RECYCLED PRODUCTS
We are the leading recycler of polythene ﬁ lms 
in the UK with an annual recycling capacity of 
nearly 70,000 tonnes. We recycle scrap from our 
own operations, used products taken back from 
customers and scrap purchased in the open 
market. We are also able to recycle the more 
heavily contaminated scrap, including agricultural 
ﬁ lms. Recycled material is used in the manufacture 
of construction ﬁ lms, including damp proof course, 
refuse sacks and rigid products.
Our construction business trades under the 
Visqueen Building Products brand and supplies 
construction ﬁ lms including temporary protective 
sheeting, damp proof membrane, damp proof 
course and a number of specialist products 
to the major builders merchants in the UK. 
Following the slow down in construction activity 
in the UK and Ireland, manufactured sales volumes 
fell by nearly 25% over the previous year with the 
reduction accelerating each quarter. Total export 
sales remained at similar levels to 2007, as 
increased sales to Mainland Europe o ﬀ set a fall 
in Ireland. We have taken action to reduce our 
cost base by consolidating all ﬁ lm production 
on one site at Rhymney in Wales. This market 
clearly remains weak and sales in January 
were well below 2008.
Our speciﬁ cation products business which 
has seen strong growth over the last four years 
reported sales down by 24% against 2007 despite 
some growth in our eco-membrane and similar 
sales of the Zedex DPC systems. Sales in our 
Visqueen gas barrier systems were well down due 
to the introduction in 2008 of new regulations 
which relaxed the technical standards.
On a more positive note, we secured the contract 
to supply both Zedex DPC and gas barrier DPM 
to the Olympic village and the GX geomembrane 
for the Olympic stadium.
Volume sales of our moulded products, Plaswood, 
and cores fell 3%.
Sales of refuse sacks were slightly down on 2007 
as we saw some more signiﬁ cant downgauging 
in certain sectors. Some business was lost as 
we pushed up prices during the year to reﬂ ect 
the higher raw material and energy prices. We 
launched the Green Sack™, a 1 00% recycled 
product including UK farm waste, and this 
has been well received by the market and 
our customers.
Recycling volumes fell in the year reﬂ ecting 
the reduction in our sales volumes.
In Rhymney, we reinstalled the washing plant 
that we purchased in 2007 and, while progress has 
been slow, it is now operating at a reasonable level. 
This equipment is intended to provide a base for 
a second washing plant for heavily contaminated 
agricultural ﬁ lm, which we hope will be available 
once the new regulations on non-packaging 
farm plastic waste are introduced.
In January, we have taken some further action 
to reduce our cost base including closing our 
Rochdale sales o ﬃ  ce and consolidating all 
construction, speciﬁ cation and Plaswood sales 
administration at Heanor. In total, some 35 jobs 
will go across the various sites at a minimal cost.
The impact of various regulatory changes relating 
to China, including the imposition of an anti 
dumping duty and a reduction in the amount 
of VAT reclaimable on exports, resulted in the 
manufacture of certain products being moved 
back from China to the UK. As a result, volumes 
manufactured in China fell compared to 2007. 
 
CONVERTED PRODUCTS
Converted Products comprise all our print 
and conversion plants and serve a wide range 
of markets from construction to industrial 
to consumer.
Total sales volume of industrial packaging to the 
construction and industrial markets fell by 17% 
to just under 40,000 tonnes.
A wave of plant closures and extended 
shutdowns signiﬁ cantly reduced demand from 
the construction sector. Demand for aggregate 
packaging was poor and dropped sharply in 
quarter 4 and, as there are high levels of packed 
stock, this will impact on demand in 2009. Demand 
for insulation ﬁ lm was in line with 2007 and we are 
conﬁ dent of growing volumes in 2009 as we o ﬀ er 
a ﬁ lm to replace polypropylene.
In animal feed, customers delayed placing 
orders and sales were, therefore, below 2007. 
The cold winter weather has, however, resulted 
in a promising start to 2009. Fertiliser volumes 
were down on the previous year.
Sales to the furniture and bedding sector 
have remained steady, although we have seen 
a continued move from bags to ﬁ lm on the reel.
Sales to the horticultural industry were down 
on 2007 due to a poor second half as customers 
delayed orders due to a lack of conﬁ dence.
The dramatic reduction in demand from the 
construction sector with little prospect of 
improvement resulted in our decision to close 
Stockton and focus production of heavy industrial 
packaging at Ardeer and Greenock in Scotland 
and Swansea in Wales.
Sales volumes at our small manufacturing sites 
fell due to their exposure to the construction 
industry which amounts to 25% of sales. We 
closed our small loss making site in Essex and 
manufacture is now focused at Flint in Wales 
and Cowdenbeath in Scotland.
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
BPI-100205 Annual Report Front 2008 76pp V5.indd   20 BPI-100205 Annual Report Front 2008 76pp V5.indd   20 6/4/09   12:48:30 6/4/09   12:48:30 21 REPORT BY DIRECTORS & BUSINESS REVIEW
At Ardeer, we have now commissioned 
a backseam conversion line with in-line print 
which will enable us to supply packaging to the 
cement industry as it moves certain products 
from paper to polythene packaging.
We have entered the mailing/courier bag market 
and have secured some promising accounts which 
we will service from Swansea.
Sales from our small trading operation were 
in line with 2007 and, as we eliminated low 
margin business and reduced operating costs, 
our operating proﬁ t improved. 
Consumer is involved in printing and converting 
plain ﬁ lm into packaging for the fresh produce, 
bread and other food markets. The plant at 
Worcester installed a ten colour printing press 
in quarter 4 to replace older six colour presses. 
A second ten colour printing press will be 
delivered in quarter 1 of 2009 to meet growing 
demand. Our plant at Worcester will then have 
two ten colour printing presses, seven eight 
colour printing presses and a six colour printing 
press, making it one of the largest and most 
modern facilities in Europe.
Despite a quieter ﬁ nish to the year, sales volumes 
were 7% ahead of 2007 as we experienced 
continued growth from our major customers, 
especially in fresh produce. Sales in the ﬁ nal 
quarter were below expectations as the grocery 
sector did not seem to have its normal rush at 
the end of the year. Increased raw material prices 
reduced margins.
Our consumer sector in China became busier 
as we exported bread and produce bags to 
Australasia and the Middle East as well as the UK.
Our pre-press and plate making business provides 
artwork, origination and plate making to Group 
businesses and to external customers. Overall sales 
were down in 2008, with lower demand from both 
internal and external customers, and the business 
recorded a small loss. 
NORTH AMERICA
Our North American business comprises AT 
Films based in Edmonton in Canada. The main 
plant manufactures polythene ﬁ lm for the North 
American horticultural and agricultural markets 
and we also have a small conversion facility which 
folds and packs bags used for the storage of silage 
and grain.
The business was acquired in August 2007 and has 
performed ahead of expectations and contributed 
an operating proﬁ t of £0.8 million.
Total sales volumes were 8% ahead of the previous 
full year due to increased sales of silage sheet 
and large agricultural bags used for the storage 
of grain. Sales of silage sheet increased as we 
improved market share by securing new dealers 
in certain regions and crop yields in the year were 
good. Growth in the market for grain bags drove 
signiﬁ cantly higher volumes. Selling prices were 
increased to reﬂ ect the higher raw material costs.
During 2008, we installed the necessary 
infrastructure required to establish the business 
as a self contained unit. AT Films successfully 
implemented our standard IT system and certain 
functions were transferred to our Shared Service 
Centre in Greenock.
Some small capital expenditure was made 
to improve e ﬃ  ciency and the quality of the 
ﬁ nal product. A new wide width welding unit 
was installed to enable the supply of wider 
silage sheet to our customers. In early 2008, 
we acquired the trade, brands and equipment 
of Sacomatic in Canada for a small cash 
consideration. The Sacomatic memory 
bale tube is used to store forage for animal 
feed and will enable us to expand our sales 
in this product area.
An explosion and ﬁ re at our main polymer supplier 
on the Edmonton site caused some short term 
disruption, but our production lines were quickly 
up and running and we found replacement 
sources of polymer.
We are pleased with the acquisition of AT Films 
and see opportunities to develop the business.

FILM RECYCLER IN EUROPE WITH 
THE ABILITY TO REPROCESS IN 
EXCESS OF 70 KTES A T OUR UK 
ENVIRONMENT AGENCY AND S.E.P.A 
ACCREDITED SITES EACH YEAR. 
We recycle commercial, industrial and 
domestic packaging as well as highly 
contaminated farm plastics. We turn this 
waste plastic into building ﬁ lms, refuse 
sacks, construction and marine materials 
and street and garden furniture.
In 2008, we launched The Green Sack
TM
, 
a range of 100% recycled refuse sacks. 
These sacks are thinner, stronger, have an 
ultra low carbon footprint and use recycled 
UK farm waste from our unique wash plants 
in Scotland and Wales.
For every tonne of plastic recycled rather 
than sent to landﬁ ll there is a saving 
of 1.96 tonnes of carbon.
For every tonne of recycled plastic used 
in place of prime plastic there is a saving 
of 79,300 MJ LHV of energy.

RESULTS
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements for the 
Group, which are prepared in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards, as 
adopted by the EU, are included on pages 45 
to 70. The individual accounts of the holding 
company, British Polythene Industries PLC, 
continue to be prepared under UK GAAP 
and are shown separately on pages 71 to 76.
SALES
Total sales increased by 13.3% to £480.7 million. 
This includes £22.7 million (2007: £6.5 million) 
from AT Films which was acquired in August 2007, 
so continuing sales increased by 9.7%. Despite 
this increase in sales value, underlying volumes 
reduced by 6.3%. Exchange movements on euro 
sales contributed to the increase, but it was mainly 
due to higher average selling prices as we passed 
through signiﬁ cant increases in input costs during 
the year.
OPERATING PROFIT
Operating proﬁ t, before net restructuring costs, 
reduced from £1 4.6 million to £12.6 million. This 
represented an 1 1% fall in operating proﬁ t per 
tonne from £46/tonne to £41/tonne. Polymer 
prices rose steeply from January to August, 
reaching a record high price of £1,255/tonne. 
As usual, there was a lag in passing these 
increases on to customers and margins were, 
inevitably, squeezed. During this period overall 
volumes held up reasonably well, although 
demand was poor from construction related 
sectors. Polymer prices started to fall steeply 
from September and, under normal circumstances, 
we should have beneﬁ ted from margin recovery 
on the downturn. However, general demand fell 
away sharply in the last quarter and UK electricity 
prices escalated, negating any beneﬁ t from falling 
polymer prices. Electricity costs in the UK were 
£7.8 million higher than 2007 which represents 
£34/tonne. These increases proved much more 
di ﬃ  cult to recover fully from customers than 
polymer price increases. In order to mitigate 
the margin e ﬀ ect, we continued to reduce 
our ﬁ xed cost base, wherever possible. 
RESTRUCTURING
Signiﬁ cant restructuring costs were incurred in 
2008 as we continued to reduce capacity in line 
with demand from some of our traditional UK 
sectors. We announced two site closures during 
the year, at Essex and Stockton. In addition, we 
reduced employee numbers in other parts of the 
business. The closure costs charged for 2008 and 
estimated for 2009 can be analysed as follows:
The non-cash cost of £1.7 million is mainly asset write downs 
at Stockton.
INTEREST
Net borrowing costs increased from £3.6 million 
to £4.2 million. Average borrowings increased 
during the year due to polymer price increases 
which added to the value of working capital for 
most of the year. Interest rates were higher due 
to signiﬁ cant increases in LIBOR during 2008, 
although this began to fall towards the end 
of the year. A large part of Group borrowings 
are denominated in euros and interest costs 
increased due to the strengthening of the 
euro against sterling. 
TAXATION
The UK tax rate reduced from 30% to 28% 
in April 2008. The rate in Belgium is 34%, 
Netherlands 25.5% and Canada 32%. The 
current year tax rate is adjusted by a number 
of prior year items due to the settlement of 
outstanding discussions with the relevant tax 
authorities and adjustments made on ﬁ ling of 
prior year tax returns. This gives an overall tax 
rate of 28% which is 2% higher than last year.
EARNINGS PER SHARE
Diluted earnings per share, after all 
restructuring costs, reduced from 32.36p 
to 1 0.67p. If restructuring costs are excluded, 
EPS rises to 25.53p (2007: 34.26p). 
DIVIDEND
The proposed ﬁ nal ordinary dividend of 7.5p 
per share (2007: 15p) is to be paid on 21 July 
2009 to shareholders on the register at the 
close of business on 13 March 2009 making 
with the interim ordinary dividend of 7p per 
share (2007: 7p) paid on 1 9 November 2008 
a total of 1 4.5p (2007: 22p) per share for the 
year. Dividend cover is 0.7 4 times. If restructuring 
costs were excluded, dividend cover would 
be 1.76 times.

CASH FLOW & BORROWINGS
Cash generated from operations improved 
by £6 million to £28 million. The e ﬀ ect of the 
lower operating result was o ﬀ set by £3 million 
of reduced pension fund contributions and 
an £8 million improvement in working capital. 
Other payables include £2 million of provisions 
for the closure of the Stockton site, so the 
underlying reduction in working capital is £6 
million. There has been considerable focus during 
the year on reducing stock levels and improving 
debtor collection. The fall in polymer prices in the 
last quarter also reduced the value of working 
capital, although the full beneﬁ t in relation to cash 
will not be seen until early 2009 when the ﬁ nal 
reductions ﬂ ow through to supplier payments.
Capital expenditure, including computer software, 
reduced by £0.8 million to £1 4.6 million. Annual 
depreciation is £13.4 million which excludes £1.7 
million of impairment write downs relating to the 
Stockton closure. In 2007, there were £2.2 million 
proceeds from the sale of freehold properties. 
There were no property sales in 2008.
Net borrowings were £1 1.2 million higher 
at £76.0 million. At constant exchange rates, 
net borrowings would have been at the same 
level as December 2007. However, a high 
proportion of Group debt is denominated in 
euros and lesser amounts in other currencies. 
The weakening of sterling compared to December 
2007 added £1 1.2 million to the translated 
value of non-sterling borrowings at the year 
end. These borrowings are maintained to hedge 
the net investment in our overseas subsidiaries.
BORROWING FACILITIES
The Group banking facilities were renegotiated 
in 2008 and total available facilities were increased 
by £46 million to £136 million. £20 million of 
this will be used to reﬁ nance a 1 0 year ﬁ xed rate 
private placement which is due for repayment by 
July 2009 and, therefore, moved into short-term 
borrowings at 31 December 2008. The remaining 
increase in the facilities will provide su ﬃ  cient 
headroom to ﬁ nance the restructuring of parts 
of our UK business.
The remaining facilities of £1 16 million following 
the repayment of the private placement comprise 
a three year revolving credit facility of £57.5 million 
repayable in November 201 1, £41 million of 
short-term facilities and £17.5 million of HP 
and leasing facilities.
As part of the renegotiation of facilities, covenant 
terms were altered to accommodate ﬂ exibility 
in the timing of restructuring costs.
LIQUIDITY RISK
As highlighted in the section on Risk Factors on 
page 7, the current economic conditions present 
some challenges in terms of Group performance.
The possibility of further reductions in customer 
demand is a risk. However, around two thirds 
of our business is in sectors like retail food, 
agriculture, healthcare and waste services which 
should be more resilient to economic downturn.
The risk of customer insolvency has also increased. 
However, our customers are spread across a wide 
range of market sectors and geographical regions 
and no single customer represents more than 
3% of Group turnover. We continue to carry 
some credit insurance in Europe and in the 
agricultural sector.
Movements in exchange rates can also be 
a risk. Weakness of sterling, particularly against 
the euro, tends to be positive for Group 
performance. UK exports become more 
competitive and UK domestic sales are better 
protected against mainland European competition. 
Also, proﬁ ts from our European operations are 
worth more in sterling terms. On the other hand, 
euro denominated borrowings become higher 
in sterling terms. 
We are currently restructuring parts of our 
UK business to reduce capacity in line with 
current demand. New banking facilities have 
recently been agreed which provide better 
headroom to carry out this restructuring. 
The revolving credit elements of the facilities 
are repayable in November 201 1 and some 
of the asset ﬁ nance lines extend beyond that. 
This moves the longer term part of our facilities, 
not due for repayment until 2-5 years, from 
£32.5 million to £72.6 million. Short-term 
overdraft facilities are renewable on an annual 
basis. Where this renewal period falls within 
12 months, no matters have been drawn to the 
attention of the Directors to suggest that renewal 
may not be forthcoming on acceptable terms.
In view of the uncertainties resulting from current 
economic conditions, the decision has been taken 
to reduce the ﬁ nal dividend to 7.5p (2007: 15p) 
to preserve cash and support the balance sheet.
Further disclosures in respect of credit and liquidity 
risk management are included in Notes 15-17 
of the Accounts.
GOING CONCERN
The Group’s projections, taking account 
of the risks outlined above, show that the 
Group should be able to operate within its 
current banking facilities. As a result, the 
Directors have a reasonable expectation 
that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for 
the foreseeable future. For this reason, 
they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements.
TREASURY POLICY
Borrowings are held in currencies other than 
sterling to provide a hedge against the net asset 
position in overseas subsidiaries and short-term 
trading assets and liabilities in subsidiary entities. 
Derivative instruments are only used to facilitate 
this hedging policy or to balance interest rate 
exposures and, where signiﬁ cant, are approved 
at Board level. £20 million of sterling borrowings 
were maintained on a ﬁ xed basis during the year. 
All other borrowings were on ﬂ oating rates.
The advent of a futures market for linear low 
density polyethylene on the London Metal 
Exchange may, eventually, provide the Group 
and its customers with opportunities to reduce 
the e ﬀ ect of raw material price volatility. The 
market commenced trading in May 2005, but 
liquidity has been low and the correlation with 
physical transaction prices has been poor in 
Europe. The decision during 2007 to introduce 
spot prices and launch new regional contracts has 
not yet provided a signiﬁ cant increase in liquidity 
to enable a more e ﬀ ective hedging mechanism. 
PENSION FUND
The deﬁ cit in the UK pension fund increased from 
£1 8 million at 31 December 2007 to £26 million 
at 31 December 2008. The main reasons for the 
increase were:
The reduction in asset values will have a signiﬁ cant 
adverse e ﬀ ect on reported proﬁ ts in 2009 with 
net pension funding likely to move from a credit 
of £1 million to a charge of £1.5 million.

FINANCIAL REVIEW
The triennial actuarial review of the fund was 
carried out at 30 April 2008. The actuary certiﬁ ed 
a deﬁ cit of £1 9 million and recommended a future 
funding rate of £2.7 million per annum above the 
current service cost. This is expected to result in 
pension contributions of £3.7 million during 2009. 
SHARE CAPITAL
The Company has only one class of Ordinary 
Shares as capital. The Company ’s aim is to 
maintain a balance between issued share capital 
and other forms of long-term ﬁ nance. Details of 
the shares in issue and share movements during 
the year are set out in Note 22 to the Accounts. 
The ordinary shares carry no right to ﬁ xed income, 
but holders are entitled to receive dividends as 
declared from time to time and are entitled to 
one vote per share at meetings of the Company. 
All shares rank equally with regard to the 
Company ’s residual assets and there are no 
restrictions on the transfer of the Company ’s 
shares. During the period the Company complied 
fully with the requirements that apply to the 
Company ’s shares as a consequence of these 
shares being listed on the London Stock Exchange.
All UK employees are entitled to acquire shares 
in the Company through the Save As You Earn 
savings scheme. 
ISSUE AND BUY-BACK OF SHARES
The Directors have broad powers to act to 
promote the success of the Company for the 
beneﬁ t of its shareholders, however, there are 
speciﬁ c powers in relation to issue and buy-back 
of its own shares.
1.  The Directors are generally and unconditionally 
authorised to exercise all the powers of the 
Company to allot securities up to 30% of 
the issued ordinary share capital. 
2.  The Directors can allot shares for cash provided 
that this power is limited to:
–  the allotment of equity securities where such 
securities have been o ﬀ ered (whether by way 
of a rights issue or open o ﬀ er or otherwise) 
to the holders of ordinary shares of 25p in 
proportion to their respective holdings and 
–  otherwise, the allotment of equity securities 
up to 5% of the issued ordinary share capital.
3.  The Directors can make market purchases up 
to 1 4.9% of the issued share capital of ordinary 
shares. This is subject to a minimum price 
of 25p and a maximum by reference to the 
Company ’s recent share price. A maximum of 
1 0% of the Company ’s issued share capital can 
be held as treasury shares after such a buy-back.
Each of the above authorities requires to be 
renewed at each Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) 
or on the last date when by law the AGM must 
be held.
POLICY ON PAYMENT OF SUPPLIERS
Terms and conditions are agreed with suppliers 
before business takes place and the policy is to 
pay agreed invoices in accordance with the terms 
of payment. At the year end the amount owed to 
trade creditors by the Group was equivalent to 58 
days (2007: 55 days) of purchases from suppliers.
The Group does not follow any code or standard 
on payment practice, but it is the Group’s policy 
to pay all of its suppliers within 35 days of the 
end of the month in which it receives the goods 
or services unless other payment terms have 
been agreed.
AUDITORS
A resolution is to be proposed at the AGM for 
the re-appointment of KPMG Audit Plc as auditors 
of the Company and for their remuneration 
to be agreed by the Directors.
STATEMENT AS TO DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION 
TO AUDITORS
The Directors who held o ﬃ  ce at the date of 
approval of this report conﬁ rm that, so far as 
they are each aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company ’s auditors are 
unaware; and each Director has taken all the steps 
that he/ she ought to have taken as a Director 
to make himself/herself aware of any audit 
information and to establish that the Company ’s 
auditors are aware of that information.

HEALTH AND SAFETY 
POLICY
The Group’s policy on Health and Safety states:
 “We ﬁ rmly believe that the prevention of accidents 
involving personal injury or damage to property 
is essential to the successful operation of our 
business and we regard the health and safety 
of our employees as paramount.
We, therefore, through this statement of intent, 
aﬃ  rm our commitment to achieving the highest 
possible standard of health and safety for all our 
employees and any others whose health and 
safety may be a ﬀ ected by our work activities.
The Board of Directors:
–  Accept their individual and collective 
responsibility in providing health and 
safety leadership.
–  Will ensure that all business decisions reﬂ ect 
its health and safety intentions as set out 
in this statement.
–  Will provide a working environment that is 
both safe and which has the lowest possible 
risk to health.
–  Will provide su ﬃ  cient information, instruction, 
training and supervision to enable all employees 
to contribute to their own health and safety 
at work.
The Managing Director of each business through 
their reporting Directors is responsible for ensuring 
that suitable and su ﬃ  cient organisation and 
arrangements are employed for achieving 
the deﬁ ned objectives.
Health and Safety is as important an issue as all 
other commercial considerations. No task is so 
important that a person’s health or safety is put 
at risk. The Board of Directors will, therefore, 
pursue this policy with the utmost diligence.
We do stress, however, the need for all of our 
employees to co-operate in our aim to provide 
a working environment that is safe and which has 
the lowest possible risk to health. This is not simply 
because of our legal obligations, but because it is 
in all our interests that we should work together 
to achieve this end.”
The Group Health and Safety Manager is 
independent of the individual Business Directors 
and reports directly to the Chief Executive. 
PERFORMANCE
The Group is pleased to report that the total 
number of accidents reported in 2008 decreased 
in comparison with the previous year and it has 
achieved its best overall accident performance.
The Lost Time Accident Frequency Rate was 
maintained at 0.5 accidents/100,000 hours 
worked (2007: 0.5). If our Canadian business was 
excluded our existing businesses equalled their 
best ever performance at 0.4 accidents/ 1 00,000 
hours. However, the Canadian conversion 
operation acquired in mid August 2007 did not 
perform so well and e ﬀ orts are being made to 
raise its safety standards in line with the rest 
of the Group. 
The minor accident Frequency Rate is at its lowest 
ever recorded level at 6.9 accidents/ 1 00,000 hours 
worked (2007: 7.8).
In addition to this improvement, nine of 
our operational sites successfully completed 
2008 with no Lost Time Accidents reported.
It is disappointing to report that the Group 
accident severity rate, which measures the days 
lost as a result of all accidents as a percentage 
of the total hours worked, increased to 0.01 9% 
(2007: 0.013%) due to two accidents which 
resulted in protracted periods of absence 
from work. 
While there is a good overall trend, it is still 
recognised that we should continually improve 
on our performance and target for all sites 
to perform equally well.
The Group works hard to identify the root 
causes of all accidents, dangerous incidents, 
and near-miss situations, and uses a range of 
investigation procedures to help avoid repetition. 
Conclusions about underlying causes are used 
to improve our Health and Safety management 
systems, with relevant information being shared 
across the Group. Business Health and Safety 
Managers meet throughout the year to share best 
practice and ensure that there is a standardised 
approach to safety management across the Group. 
All our manufacturing sites are audited on 
a rolling programme by the Group Health and 
Safety Department and areas of improvement 
are identiﬁ ed. Some sites are externally audited 
and certiﬁ ed to OHSAS 1 8001.
The Group strives continually to improve its safety 
performance by:
–  Developing and maintaining a good safety 
culture at all locations.
–  Continually improving communications and 
sharing best practice throughout the Group.
–  Ensuring the robust auditing of safety 
management systems.
–  Ensuring active involvement of senior 
managers in auditing and promoting safety.
Safety at work remains a top priority and its 
importance is reﬂ ected in it being a key agenda 
item at all Main Board, Management Board 
and Business Review meetings.
PROJECTS
Occupational Road Safety remains an important 
issue for the Group. The risks associated with 
driving cannot be eliminated entirely, but they 
can be actively managed and minimised. 
Since 2001, the Group has provided successful 
 ‘on the road’ training for employees who drive 
on company business. In 2008, the Group revised 
and re-issued its Road Safety Policy providing 
drivers with comprehensive safety information 
and instruction. 
The Group is committed to supporting the 
improvement in health and safety standards in 
the wider plastics industry and continues to work 
closely with the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) 
and in 2008 was involved in several joint projects.
In 2008, the HSE commissioned a project 
to investigate the potential for inhalation of 
carcinogens and asthmagens in the plastics 
processing industry. BPI took part in this project 
and results from extensive air sampling 
monitoring at the bpi.recycled products site 
at Heanor conﬁ rmed that no carcinogens or 
respiratory irritants/sensitisers were detected. 
These details will be published in 2009 as part 
of a larger project report which is being 
produced for the plastics industry.
The Group participated in a working group 
headed up by the HSE to produce a new UK 
Machinery Safety Standard for Compacting 
and Baling Machines. This standard will be 
issued by the HSE in 2009.
The HSE have recently highlighted that 
the accident statistics for the plastics industry 
are above the manufacturing average, and will 
therefore be carrying out a targeted initiative 
on the whole plastics industry from 2009. The 
Group will represent the ﬁ lms packaging sector 
of the industry and will be a member of the 
recently formed Plastics Industry Advisory 
Committee, which will be responsible for 
developing and implementing a new 
industry health and safety strategy. 
In 2008, a detailed review of ﬂ ood exposure 
was carried out across the Group. Sites located 
in potential ﬂ ood risk areas have all carried out 
detailed Flood Emergency Response Plans and 
Flood Response Training to minimise any risk 
to business continuity.

ENERGY
In calculating the CO2 output/tonne of 
production we have used national average 
electricity CO2 emissions for each country 
in which we manufacture as provided by 
the International Energy Agency (IEA) on 
a consistent basis. In 2008, the Department for 
Environment Food and Rural A ﬀ airs (DEFRA) 
introduced a rolling average for UK emissions 
which is 25% higher than that provided for by 
the IEA. If the DEFRA average had been used 
for UK emissions the CO2 output for 2008 would 
have been 349 kg/tonne (2007: 361kg/tonne).
On a like for like basis we have maintained 
our CO2 emissions at last years low level. Our 
UK electricity supplier for 2008 has conﬁ rmed 
that its CO2 emissions for electricity supply are 
only 23% of the UK rolling average for 2008, as 
it uses a mixture of nuclear and coal generation. 
This is not reﬂ ected in the above table which 
is based on IEA data. The adjusted CO2 output 
ﬁ gure for 2008 would have been 132 kg/tonne 
(2007: 125kg/tonne).
Electricity costs in the UK escalated during 
2008 which brought increased focus to our 
energy reduction programme. In addition to 
the good housekeeping practices which have 
been introduced at every site, there is an on 
going improvement plan in place to purchase 
more e ﬃ  cient equipment and ﬁ t energy saving 
devices, especially to motors, compressors 
and lighting schemes. There is also a project 
underway to balance the motors and drives 
on extruders to bring e ﬃ  ciency beneﬁ ts. 
Despite these e ﬀ orts, electricity usage per 
tonne of ﬁ nished goods increased marginally 
in 2008. The year was characterised by 
reduced volumes in certain sectors and shorter 
production runs. This led to higher downtime 
and more frequent job changes, which reduced 
e ﬃ  ciency and contributed to increased usage 
of electricity per tonne of output. Also, 
downgauging by customers in order to reduce 
weight requires the use of more sophisticated 
polymers and raises the process energy 
per tonne of ﬁ lm.
Twelve of our UK sites, representing 88% 
of UK electricity usage, are in Climate Change 
Agreements with DEFRA. In order to remain in the 
Agreement and secure abatement of the Climate 
Change Levy they are under an obligation to 
achieve agreed energy reductions. Five sites beat 
their targets in 2008 and seven met their targets 
by purchasing carbon credits. 
Detailed investigations have been ongoing in 
the use of wind turbines to generate electricity 
at one of our major sites, which has been 
selected as it has the potential to be highly 
e ﬃ  cient and the location can meet the 
necessary planning criteria.
Gas usage increased due to higher production 
levels at a major print site which uses gas in 
connection with the VOC emissions equipment.
The only UK site using oil heating replaced it with 
electricity in 2008. One of our larger continental 
European sites continues to use oil and accounts 
for 88% of Group usage in 2008.
Water re-circulating systems are used extensively 
to provide cooling water and in wash recycling 
systems. An increase in wash recycling capabilities 
has not increased our usage per tonne.
WASTE TO LANDFILL 
The waste sent to landﬁ ll is either process 
waste from our manufacturing activities or waste 
from the recycling of post-use scrap polythene. 
The post-use scrap contains an element of 
non-polythene which has to be separated out 
before recycling and this is the major element 
of waste.
In addition, the feedstock for our agricultural 
recycling operations is heavily contaminated 
with soil and is extensively washed prior to 
recycling. The soil which is recovered represents 
73% of the total material which we send to landﬁ ll, 
but it is not actually waste; it is used by landﬁ ll 
operators as a topping to compact the landﬁ ll 
site and prevent materials from blowing around.
Our agricultural recycling plant underwent 
a major refurbishment in 2006 and early 2007 
and production was signiﬁ cantly reduced. In 
2008 it was back at normal production levels. 
There has been a general deterioration in 
the quality of scrap available for this plant 
with increasing levels of contamination. Steps 
have been taken to work with waste collectors 
to improve the quality of scrap taken in from 
agricultural sources which, in turn, will reduce 
the volume of material sent to landﬁ ll.
Throughout the Group there is a programme 
progressively to reduce the amount of waste 
which goes to landﬁ ll by reducing waste arising 
from operations and ensuring that as much 
as possible is separated and sent for recycling.
Promopack, our pre-press operation, has now 
become the ﬁ rst Group site to adopt a “zero to 
landﬁ ll” policy for all production and o ﬃ  ce waste.
VOLATILE ORGANIC COMPOUND (VOC) EMISSIONS
Sites which have printing activities require to be 
compliant with Integrated Pollution Prevention 
& Control of Emissions (IPPC) in the handling and 
use of solvents which is a major factor in VOC 
emissions. There were twelve compliant print sites 
with ﬁ ve sites using VOC abatement (the process 
of changing these potentially environmentally 
unfriendly substances before controlled emission 
into the atmosphere) techniques to comply 
and the remainder using water based inks.
VOC solvent purchases for our print sites were:
The tonnage of solvents used in the printing 
process reduced by 169 tonnes (9.2%).
Whilst we remain dependent on solvent 
based inks for many of our customers’ print 
requirements, we will use water based products 
where the application allows.
Promopack makes printing plates for all 
our print sites. In 2007, it became the ﬁ rst UK 
manufacturer, supplying printing plates to the 
wide width ﬂ exographic printing market, to 
eliminate completely solvents from all areas 
of the business. This was recognised in 2008 
with a Special Achievement Award at the 20th 
World Packaging Innovation Ceremony 
sponsored by DuPont.

CORPORATE SOCIAL RESPONSIBILITY REVIEW
ENVIRONMENTAL POLICY
As a leading manufacturer and supplier of 
polythene ﬁ lm and other products we recognise 
our responsibility to operate with due concern 
for the environment in which we live and work 
and to minimise the impact of our activities 
on that environment. Through close contact 
with national governments and industry 
regulators we are at the forefront of legislative 
developments. We continue to develop our 
processes and working practices to meet, as 
a minimum standard, both our legal and social 
obligations. We seek continually to improve 
our environmental performance by setting 
objectives and targets combined with 
clear management programmes and initiatives 
to minimise our impact on the environment. 
Speciﬁ cally we are committed to:
–  manufacture all of our products to meet 
the relevant legislative standards in all the 
countries and regions in which we operate.
–  minimise the use of resources and to 
work with our customers to minimise their 
use of resources through environmentally 
responsible packaging systems.
–  promote the re-use, recycling and recovery 
of our materials and to assist in this recovery 
wherever it is practical and environmentally 
beneﬁ cial to do so. 
–  improve the environmental performance of 
our processes by reducing emissions and energy 
use, minimising waste and controlling noise.
–  be a responsible employer and a good neighbour.
–  provide suitable and unambiguous 
environmental information for our employees, 
customers and the local community. 
–  maintain leadership in the development of 
new products and processes using recycled 
materials and support initiatives which beneﬁ t 
the environment.
The Group Environmental Director, Andrew 
Green, is a member of the Group Management 
Board and reports to the Chief Executive. With 
the increasing focus on environmental issues, 
and the enhanced interest in packaging and 
recycling, it is important that the Group has 
an experienced representative and spokesman 
on these topics. Andrew is also on the Board of 
Valpak, the UK’s largest compliance scheme 
for packaging waste regulations and is a member 
of the UK Government Advisory Committee 
on Packaging.
PACKAGING AND THE ENVIRONMENT
There was continued media focus on packaging 
and the environment in 2008, but the debate 
appears to have become more balanced to 
reﬂ ect the very necessary and important role 
of packaging in preventing waste and the 
spoilage of products.
BPI supports packaging minimisation where 
it does not result in increased product damage 
or spoilage, thereby creating a more signiﬁ cant 
environmental problem. Indeed, we have 
reduced the weight of our packaging products 
on like for like volumes by over 6,000 tonnes 
in the last few years.
However, consumers need to recognise that 
lightweight plastic packaging is there for a very 
good reason, namely to protect and preserve 
the goods they buy throughout the supply chain. 
During 2008 the Company worked with DEFRA’s 
Advisory Committee on Packaging to produce 
a factsheet entitled “Packaging in Perspective”. 
Some of the key points in this document are 
as follows:
–  In the developing world 50% of food is wasted 
before it reaches the consumer due to lack 
of packaging compared with 3% in the 
developed world.
–  Each household’s annual purchases weigh 
nearly 3 tonnes, and require 110GJ of energy 
to produce. Less than 200kg of packaging 
is required to protect and preserve these 
products until they are used or consumed 
and this requires 7GJ of energy to produce.
–  Of the total energy used in the food chain, 50% 
is used in food production, 1 0% on transport to 
the shops and in retailing, 1 0% to produce the 
packaging and the remaining 30% is consumed 
by shoppers to travel to the shops and to store 
and cook food.
–  A recent study by Environment Resources 
Management has shown that 27% more fruit 
was wasted from orchard to home when 
supplied loose compared with fruit supplied 
in a shrink wrapped tray.
–  A study by the Cucumber Growers’ Association 
has shown that a 1.5 gram shrink wrapping 
extends the life of the cucumber from 3 to 
1 4 days, yet most consumers would think shrink 
wrapping around cucumbers was unnecessary.
–  25% of all plastic packaging in the UK is currently 
recycled, the remainder represents 4.1% 
by weight of the municipal waste stream.
BIODEGRADEABLE PL ASTICS
The Group welcomes the recent advances made 
in the technical characteristics of biopolymers 
manufactured from renewable resources. However, 
we caution that the most important and valuable 
environmental credential of plastic ﬁ lms is their 
ability to perform a packaging, industrial or 
agricultural requirement using the most lightweight 
materials available for the task. The integrity and 
resource e ﬃ  ciency of this primary purpose of 
protection is of far greater environmental impact 
than the speed at which the plastic will eventually 
biodegrade. Above all, our overriding commitment 
is to o ﬀ er biodegradable products to our 
customers only where we can guarantee 
the integrity of our product.

During the last six years the Ardeer site on 
the west coast of Scotland has chosen to use 
a rather unique method of controlling VOC 
emissions from its printing process. Instead 
of a conventional thermal oxidising unit 
which burns o ﬀ  the ﬂ ammable vapour, they 
have used an environmentally friendly bio-ﬁ lter.
The principle behind the system is simple. 
The VOCs from the printing process are 
pumped into a series of large containers which 
were, until recently, half ﬁ lled with mussel shells. 
A water spray forces the VOCs through the 
mussel bed and harmless bacteria which live 
on the shells feed on the VOCs. The cleaned 
air is then exhausted to the atmosphere.
It was discovered in recent years that some 
of the mussel shells had began to collapse, 
causing a reduction in performance. After 
looking at several alternatives oyster shells 
were found to be the best substitute. With 
a much larger surface area and thicker body 
they have been proven to double the e ﬃ  ciency 
of the system. 
Sadly no pearls were found during the change 
of media.

RECYCLING AND PACKAGING WASTE LEGISL ATION
We are the UK’s largest recycler of polythene ﬁ lms, 
reprocessing over 70,000 tonnes in 2008. Since 
the Packaging Waste Regulations were introduced 
in the UK we have invested £18m in state of 
the art plastic reprocessing equipment at our 
Environment Agency and Scottish Environment 
Protection Agency accredited sites. 
In 2008, we continued to work with the DEFRA 
on its Advisory Committee on Packaging and, 
via its Advisory Group on Farm Plastics, to support 
the introduction of Farm Plastic Producer 
Responsibility legislation in the near future.
In 2008, the price of plastic PRNs rose considerably 
during the ﬁ nal quarter when the export market 
for waste plastic virtually closed. For the last few 
years the UK has met its EU target for recycling 
plastic packaging waste by exporting 70% for 
reprocessing overseas, mainly in the Far East. 
When this market collapsed due to falling 
commodity prices and weak demand the 
prospect for UK compliance in plastic 
was seriously put at risk.
As a result of this, considerably more plastic waste 
became available for recycling in the UK and our 
Group was able to increase its reprocessing of 
packaging waste and thereby generate additional 
PRNs. We hope the lessons of these events will 
convince DEFRA and UK compliance schemes 
of the dangers of placing such heavy reliance 
on access to overseas markets to meet our 
EU obligations for reprocessing.
The Group’s Packaging Waste recovery and 
recycling obligation for 2008 was 12,353 tonnes, 
which was a small increase of 317 tonnes 
on the previous year. We continue to discharge 
our obligations through membership of the 
national compliance scheme, Valpak, and 
satisﬁ ed our plastic recycling obligation 
through our own recycling plants. Our cost 
of compliance was broadly in line with 2007.
The Group limits the amount of material which goes 
to landﬁ ll by ensuring that virtually all scrap arising 
from polymer used in the manufacturing process 
is reprocessed or recycled within the Group. 
BUSINESS ACCREDITATIONS
QUALITY ASSURANCE
At all of its twenty two manufacturing sites the 
Group has achieved either ISO 9001, covering 
quality management systems, or ISO 9002 which 
is the emerging global standard for product 
and process quality.
BRITISH RETAIL CONSORTIUM (BRC)
All nine sites (in the UK, Europe and China) which 
supply the retail food market have achieved the 
highly regarded BRC certiﬁ cation. BRC is the lead 
UK trade association representing the whole 
range of retailers, from the large multiples and 
department stores through the independents.
ENVIRONMENT
Nine sites in the Group have achieved ISO 14001 
which is the International Environmental 
Management System standard.
OCCUPATIONAL HEALTH AND SAFETY ASSESSMENT 
SERIES (OHSAS 1 8001)
Two sites in Europe have achieved OHSAS 1 8001 
certiﬁ cation which requires robust management 
systems to control occupational health and safety 
risks and improve performance. The Group is 
looking to extend this to other manufacturing 
sites in the future.
EMPLOYMENT POLICIES
Our people continue to be central to the 
development of the business. We strive to 
reach the highest standards in all aspects of 
employment and health and safety policy and 
practice in our UK, mainland European, Chinese 
and North American operations. 
ETHICS
The Group has an ethical policy which sets out 
speciﬁ c provisions to ensure that employees deal 
with the Company, its customers, suppliers and 
fellow employees in a fair manner with honesty 
and integrity, observing high standards of 
personal and business ethics.
RECRUITMENT AND RETENTION 
We operate an equal opportunities policy and 
recruit people for any vacancies regardless of 
sex, colour, religion, age or disability. We recruit 
graduates from universities and young workers 
as modern apprentices. We employ a large 
number of older workers over the age of 50 
and have fully complied with age discrimination 
legislation. Our retention rates have improved 
and have now stabilised at an acceptable level 
with employee turnover at 17% (2007: 1 8%). 
Our employee turnover tends to occur with 
shorter serving employees in lower skilled 
jobs. We, therefore, consistently retain longer 
serving, higher skilled employees. The di ﬃ  culty 
in recruiting and retaining UK employees for 
certain positions has led to an increase in the 
employment of Eastern European labour and 
we currently employ over 80 Polish workers 
(2007: 120) across many of our UK sites.
DISABLED EMPLOYEES 
Applications for employment by disabled persons 
are always fully considered, bearing in mind the 
aptitudes of the applicant concerned. In the event 
of members of sta ﬀ  becoming disabled, every 
e ﬀ ort is made to ensure that their employment 
with the Group continues and that appropriate 
training is arranged.
TRAINING AND DEVELOPMENT 
Our employees are amongst the most skilled in 
the industry. We invest in a range of development 
activities including NVQ’s and MBA’s and support 
other professional and technical training. Our 
capital investment programme is supported by 
training in the use of new machinery. Training 
in health and safety (in conjunction with the 
trade unions) is a particular Group strength. We 
increasingly appraise our workforce annually in 
order to identify their training needs. Members 
of the Group Personnel Department regularly 
train our managers and supervisors in a variety 
of employment matters to ensure best practice 
people management is carried out. The Group 
Health and Safety Department also actively train 
our managers, supervisors and employees to 
maximise their health and well being at work.
ATTENDANCE 
Our absenteeism rate for all Group 
sites in 2008 has been maintained at 3.2%
(2007: 3.2%). This is a signiﬁ cant improvement 
from prior years, and compares favourably 
with other manufacturing businesses in the 
UK and mainland Europe. We continue to 
train managers in absenteeism management 
techniques and operate attendance bonus 
schemes across many sites.
COMMUNICATIONS 
We recognise trade unions across eleven 
sites in the Group for separate collective 
bargaining purposes, including two in North 
America. We provide information, consult and 
negotiate with the trade unions on a range of 
subjects including pay, hours and holidays. We 
have Works Councils in mainland Europe and at 
a number of our non unionised sites in the UK. 
We have local site Communication Forums at 
some sites. Our Managing Directors and senior 
site Directors also deliver regular business 
updates direct to the workforce. 
The Group’s Employee Information & 
Communication Body (EICB) was established in 
2005 and meets twice per year. The EICB brings 
together employee representatives from across 
our UK business to discuss business issues with 
senior Directors within the Group including Main 
Board members. This involves the provision of 
information, consultation and discussions with 
a view to reaching agreement regarding 
decisions that are likely to lead to substantial 
changes in work organisation or in contractual 
relations prior to any action being taken. The 
annual European Communication Forum (ECF) 
discusses trans-national issues that may a ﬀ ect 
our employees in the UK, Netherlands, Belgium 
and Ireland. Employees regularly receive written 
communications explaining issues discussed 
at these meetings. 
We have a ‘Whistle Blowing Policy’ in place 
which seeks to encourage employee participation 
in the identiﬁ cation of any wrong doing within 
the organisation. We have a ‘Grievance Policy’ 
which operates throughout our sites allowing 
employees to communicate any employment 
dissatisfaction which they may have.

PAY AND BENEFITS 
Terms and conditions (including pay) are set 
at local site level. We have a range of beneﬁ ts 
including competitive pay rates, a number of 
bonus schemes for employees at all levels and 
ﬁ nal salary and other pension schemes with 
employer contributions and a range of health 
care beneﬁ ts. Senior employees’ pay and rewards 
are formally benchmarked against market data. 
We voluntarily operate enhanced maternity and 
paternity pay schemes and regularly consider 
and agree requests for ﬂ exible working. We 
have introduced a childcare voucher scheme 
to support employees who are working parents. 
CHINA 
We have a highly committed and skilled 
workforce which has worked to build this 
business over the past thirteen years. The same 
standards of health and safety, fairness, equality 
and merit applied in our European businesses 
are replicated in China. Senior UK Directors are 
responsible for this business. We comply with 
International Labour Organisation standards on 
working hours, working wage, freedom of labour, 
child labour, freedom of association, discipline 
and discrimination. Employees are recruited from 
the local area, do not live at the work premises 
and return home at the end of their shift. Rates 
of pay are competitive for the region and are 
negotiated by elected representatives.
EDUCATION
We are active in supporting education, working 
with schools, universities and other institutions. 
We operate a range of activities from providing 
advice and resources for teaching as well as 
sponsorship of educational projects aimed at 
increasing the awareness of plastics, packaging 
and the environment. We continue to support the 
Schools Starpack Design Awards and extended 
this into Higher Education with sponsorship of 
the equivalent competition for Universities and 
Colleges – ‘Student Starpack 08’. We believe our 
sponsorship of the Starpack Awards, together 
with the accompanying educational support 
package, helps both students and their tutors 
better understand the key role plastic packaging 
plays in reducing product wastage for the overall 
beneﬁ t of the wider environment. We again 
partnered Valpak in their prestigious European 
Y outh Eco-Parliament project which selected 
ﬁ ve pupils from Walton High School in Milton 
Keynes to represent Great Britain in debating 
environmental issues, with a particular focus 
on managing waste and resources, at the 
Third Y outh Eco-Parliament in Prague in 2008. 
The Group continues to sponsor two teachers 
at the Polymer Study Tours organised by The 
British Plastics Federation and the Worshipful 
Company of Horners which assists science, 
design and technology teachers to 
understand the applications of polymers 
in the industrial environment.
CHARITABLE SUPPORT AND SPONSORSHIP
Charitable donations made during the year 
amounted to £50,000 (2007: £54,000). 
No donations were given for political purposes.
The Group supports national and international 
charities involved in relieving su ﬀ ering. We also 
support a number of wildlife funds, ecological 
projects and other good causes. This support 
is in both products donated and ﬁ nancial 
contributions. Most of our businesses sent 
out electronic Christmas cards, rather than 
traditional cards, and donated the money saved 
to local charities. Unclaimed dividends after 
a period of twelve years are donated to charity.
The Group encourages each site to donate 
a percentage of its turnover to local charities 
and many of our sites are regularly involved 
in fund raising for local charities.
We sponsor a number of bodies relevant to 
our industry and our customers’ activities. 
In particular, we are regular sponsors of the 
Farmers Weekly Awards, which recognise 
the achievements of British Farmers.

CORPORATE GOVERNANCE REPORT
Throughout the year to 31 December 2008, 
the Group complied with the provisions of 
the Combined Code on Corporate Governance 
(June 2006) issued by the Financial Reporting 
Council. The Board remains committed to the 
highest standards of corporate governance and 
this statement describes how the principles of 
the Code are applied and reports on the Group’s 
compliance with the Code’s provisions.
THE BOARD
The Group is controlled through its Board of 
Directors which normally meets six times per year. 
In 2008, the Board held an additional meeting 
to review the Group Strategy. The Board’s main 
roles are to create shareholder value, to provide 
leadership to the Group, to approve the Group’s 
strategic objectives and to ensure that the 
necessary ﬁ nancial and other resources are 
made available to allow the Group to meet 
those objectives. The Board has adopted a formal 
schedule of matters reserved for its decision 
such as the approval of corporate strategy plans, 
annual budgets and risk management strategy. 
Major acquisitions and disposals, as well as major 
capital expenditure, are authorised by the Board 
and are subsequently monitored by the Board 
after execution. The Board also reviews the 
environmental, health and safety performance 
of the Group.
The Board has delegated the following 
responsibilities to the Group Management 
Board: the development and recommendation 
of strategic plans for consideration by the Board 
that reﬂ ect the longer term objectives and 
priorities established by the Board; implementation 
of the strategies and policies as determined by the 
Board; monitoring operational and ﬁ nancial results 
against budgets; prioritising the allocation of 
capital, technical and human resources; ensuring 
that appropriate management development and 
succession plans are in place; and developing 
and implementing risk management systems.
The Group has in place appropriate insurance 
cover for the Board members, in respect of any 
legal action taken against them.
CHANGES TO BOARD COMPOSITION DURING THE YEAR
There were no changes to the Board’s composition 
during the year.
THE RESPONSIBILITIES OF THE CHAIRMAN 
AND CHIEF EXECUTIVE
The division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman of the Board, Cameron McLatchie, 
and the Chief Executive, John Langlands, is clearly 
deﬁ ned and has been approved by the Board.
The Chairman provides guidance to the 
Group Management Board in matters of strategy 
and leads the Board in the determination of its 
strategy and in the achievement of its objectives. 
The Chairman is responsible for organising the 
business of the Board, ensuring its e ﬀ ectiveness 
and setting its agenda. The Chairman facilitates 
the e ﬀ ective contribution of Non-Executive 
Directors, manages the relationship between 
executive and Non-Executive Directors, and 
ensures that Directors receive accurate, timely 
and clear information and that there is e ﬀ ective 
communication with shareholders. The Chairman 
continues to have an executive role in the strategy 
for polymer purchasing and authorisation 
of capital expenditure proposals. 
The Chief Executive has direct charge of the 
Group on a day to day basis and is accountable 
to the Board for its ﬁ nancial and operational 
performance. He chairs the Group Management 
Board and is also responsible for Environmental 
Matters, Health and Safety and Human Resources. 
He has a senior management team that look after 
the day to day activities and report directly to him.
The role of Non-Executive Deputy Chairman 
and Senior Independent Director is carried 
out by Hamish Grossart.
DIRECTORS AND DIRECTORS’ INDEPENDENCE
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, 
the Chief Executive, the Finance Director and 
three independent Non-Executive Directors. 
Biographical details of each Director are shown 
on page 33. All of the Directors served throughout 
the entire year under review. The independent 
Non-Executive Directors constructively challenge 
and help develop proposals on strategy and bring 
strong independent judgement, knowledge 
and experience to the Board’s deliberations. 
The independent Directors are of su ﬃ  cient 
calibre and number that their views carry 
signiﬁ cant weight in the Board’s decision making. 
The Board considers all of its Non-Executive 
Directors who served during the year to be 
independent in character and judgement.
PROFESSIONAL DEVELOPMENT
On joining the Board, Directors are provided with 
documentation on the Group and its activities. 
An induction programme and site visits are 
arranged to major business units and to meet 
with members of the Group Management Board 
and other key senior executives. Throughout their 
period in o ﬃ  ce the Directors are regularly updated 
on the Group’s business, the competitive and 
regulatory environment and the industry it 
operates in. Board Meetings are regularly held 
at operational sites and tours are arranged to 
ensure that the Board is kept up to date with 
the latest operational developments. 
Directors are also advised, on appointment, 
of their legal and other duties and obligations 
as a Director of a listed company, both in writing 
and in face to face meetings with the Company 
Secretary. External training courses are provided 
where necessary. They are reminded of these 
duties each year and are also updated on changes 
to the legal and governance requirements of the 
Group and themselves as Directors. 
PERFORMANCE EVALUATION 
The Board has established a formal review 
process, led by the Chairman, for the annual 
evaluation of the performance of the Board, its 
principal Committees and individual Directors. 
The Directors are made aware that their 
performance will be subject to an annual 
evaluation. The process includes speciﬁ c 
references to the objectives of the Board and 
Committees and each Board member participates 
in the process. The Chairman consolidates the 
feedback of the Directors into a performance 
assessment summary for each individual 
Director and the Board performance as a whole. 
The Chairman shares and discusses the individual 
performance summary for each Director with 
that Director only and discusses the consolidated 
performance review with the Board as a whole.
The Chairman meets annually with the 
Non-Executive Directors to review performance 
and other matters.
The Deputy Chairman, who is also the Company ’s 
Senior Independent Director, sought the views 
of the Executive Directors and met with each of 
the other Non-Executive Directors, in the absence 
of the Chairman, to discuss and assess the 
Chairman’s performance. 
RE-ELECTION OF DIRECTORS
Directors appointed by the Board other than at 
an Annual General Meeting are required to retire 
at the following Annual General Meeting when 
they may o ﬀ er themselves for election. Directors 
are thereafter required to seek re-election every 
three years. The Chairman, who was previously 
Chief Executive, has voluntarily decided to seek 
re-election each year. Non-Executive Directors, 
subject to satisfactory performance evaluation, 
are appointed for an initial period of three years. 
Before the third and sixth anniversary of the 
Non-Executive Director’s ﬁ rst appointment, 
the Director discusses with the Board whether 
it is appropriate for a further three year term to 
be served. No Non-Executive Directors have 
served for more than nine years.
For any new Non-Executive Director, terms and 
conditions of appointment are made available 
for inspection at the Annual General Meeting 
and the Company ’s registered o ﬃ  ce. 
CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
Following implementation of the new rules on 
Directors’ conﬂ icts of interest in the Companies 
Act 2006, the Board undertook a review of its 
arrangements for dealing with conﬂ icts to 
formalise the procedures for any actual or 
potential conﬂ ict situation under the new regime 
and for exercising the Board’s power, which was 
approved by shareholders at the last Annual 
General Meeting, to authorise such conﬂ icts. 
BPI-100205 Annual Report Front 2008 76pp V5.indd   34 BPI-100205 Annual Report Front 2008 76pp V5.indd   34 6/4/09   12:50:37 6/4/09   12:50:37 35 REPORT BY DIRECTORS & BUSINESS REVIEW
The procedures that have been adopted by the 
Board require prompt notiﬁ cation by Directors 
of any possible conﬂ ict situation and the scrutiny 
initially of the Nominations Committee and then 
the Board before any decision to authorise or 
not is taken. The Board may approve a conﬂ ict 
situation unconditionally, give approval subject 
to conditions or decide not to approve and 
require that the Director concerned resolve 
the circumstances giving rise to the conﬂ ict. 
Any approval will be reviewed regularly and may 
be amended or withdrawn by the Board at any 
time. Only Directors who have no interest in the 
matter being considered are able to take the 
relevant decisions and at all times the Directors 
making such decisions must act in a way they 
consider, in good faith, will be most likely to 
promote the Group’s success. The Board is 
satisﬁ ed that these procedures are operating 
eﬀ ectively and will keep them under review 
in light of emerging best practice in this area.
THE COMPANY SECRETARY
The Board has access to the advice and 
services of a full time experienced Company 
Secretary who is responsible for advising the 
Board through the Chairman on all governance 
matters. The Company ’s Articles of Association 
and the schedule of matters reserved to the 
Board for decision provide that the appointment 
and removal of the Company Secretary 
is a matter for the full Board.
Directors are also given access to independent 
professional advice, at the Group’s expense, when 
the Directors deem it necessary in order for them 
to carry out their responsibilities. No such advice 
was sought in the year.
ARTICLES OF ASSOCIATION
Any proposed amendment to the Articles 
of Association is subject to approval by the 
shareholders in General Meeting.
AVAILABILITY OF INFORMATION
Executive management is responsible for 
providing the Board with all the information, of 
which it is aware, that is relevant to the discharge 
of the Board’s responsibilities. The Board therefore 
expects to receive timely advice on all material 
information about the Company, its operating 
units, its activities, performance and its investment 
projects. The Chairman, together with the 
Company Secretary, establishes the agenda for 
each Board meeting and the necessary papers 
are distributed to Board members in advance of 
the meeting. Presentations on speciﬁ c subjects 
are sent to the Board in advance, so that Board 
meeting time is used for focused discussion.
RELATIONS WITH SHAREHOLDERS
In fulﬁ lment of the Chairman’s obligations under 
the Combined Code, the Chairman gives feedback 
to the Board on issues raised with him by major 
shareholders. Non-Executive Directors remain 
available to meet with major institutional 
shareholders if required. External analysts’ 
and brokers’ reports are circulated to all Board 
members and, where appropriate, formally 
discussed at Board meetings.
The Board seeks to encourage shareholders to 
attend its Annual General Meeting. The Company 
uses the Annual General Meeting to communicate 
with private investors and to encourage their 
participation. They have the opportunity to put 
questions to members of the Board on matters 
relating to the Group’s operation and performance. 
All Directors are expected to be present and those 
who chair Committees of the Board will be 
available to answer any relevant questions. The 
level of proxy votes lodged on each Resolution 
is indicated at the meeting and also shown 
on the Group’s website at www.bpipoly.com 
Each year a programme of meetings with major 
institutional investors takes place covering the 
principal issues a ﬀ ecting the Group, its trading 
and its results. 
INTERNAL CONTROL
In accordance with the guidance of the Turnbull 
Committee the Board of Directors is responsible 
for the Group’s system of internal control; sets 
appropriate policies on internal control; seeks 
regular assurances that enable it to satisfy itself 
that the system is functioning e ﬀ ectively; and 
ensures that the system of internal control is 
eﬀ ective in managing risks in the manner which 
it has approved. The risk management process 
and systems of internal control are designed to 
manage rather than eliminate the risk of the Group 
failing to achieve its business objectives. It should 
be recognised that such systems can only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against 
material misstatement or loss.
The Directors have continued to review the 
eﬀ ectiveness of the Group’s system of ﬁ nancial 
and non-ﬁ nancial controls. These reviews include 
an assessment of internal controls by the internal 
audit function, risk assessments by the business 
management and reports from the external 
auditors on matters identiﬁ ed in the course 
of the statutory audit. A key part of these reviews 
is a bi-annual risk assessment process where 
responsible managers conﬁ rm the adequacy of 
their systems of internal ﬁ nancial and non-ﬁ nancial 
controls, their compliance with Group policies 
(including health, safety and the environment), 
local laws and industry regulations. This formal 
risk assessment process also identiﬁ es, evaluates 
and conﬁ rms what actions are being taken to 
mitigate any material identiﬁ ed risks. All these 
risk assessments are reviewed bi-annually 
by the Board and Audit Committee. 
BOARD COMMITTEES
The number of Board meetings and Committee 
meetings attended by each Director during the 
year was as follows:
A copy of the full terms of reference for the Nominations, 
Remuneration and Audit Committees are available 
on the Group’s website at www.bpipoly.com
NOMINATIONS COMMITTEE
The Board as a whole is responsible for the 
procedure of agreeing the appointment of its 
own members, for nominating them for election 
by the shareholders on ﬁ rst appointment 
and, thereafter, at three yearly intervals. 
The Nominations Committee, comprising the 
Non-Executive Directors, has the responsibility 
for making recommendations for new 
appointments to the Board. Hamish Grossart, 
Non-Executive Deputy Chairman and Senior

In addition, the Committee regularly reviews 
the Group’s remuneration policy relative to 
its competitors and industry norms.
The Chairman of the Committee is available to 
answer questions at the Annual General Meeting. 
AUDIT COMMITTEE 
The Company has an Audit Committee comprising 
the Non-Executive Directors and it is chaired by 
Eric Hagman. The Committee meets three times 
a year and has written terms of reference that 
outline its authority and duties. 
The Committee:
–  Monitors the integrity of the ﬁ nancial statements 
of the Group.
–  Reviews the Group’s internal ﬁ nancial control 
and risk management systems.
–  Monitors and reviews the e ﬀ ectiveness 
of the Group’s internal audit function.
–  Oversees the Group’s relationship with the 
external auditor.
Should the Committee’s monitoring and 
review activities reveal any material cause for 
concern or scope for improvement, it will make 
recommendations to the Board on action needed 
to address the issue or make improvements.
The Company Secretary acts as secretary to the 
Committee and the minutes of the Committee 
are circulated to all Board members. The Finance 
Director attends the meetings by invitation. 
The Chairman and Chief Executive also attend, 
if required to do so, by the Committee. A senior 
representative from each of the internal and 
external auditors also attends each meeting. 
The Committee discharges its responsibilities by:
–  Reviewing the external and internal audit 
work plans.
–  Receiving and reviewing half yearly 
risk management reports and risk tables. 
Business and Group management operate 
a risk management process which identiﬁ es 
the key risks facing each business and the 
Group and reports as to how those risks are 
being managed. This is based on business 
and Group risk tables identifying the key risks, 
the probability of those risks occurring, the 
estimated potential impact if they do occur and 
the actions being taken to manage those risks.
–  Receiving and considering reports from 
management and internal audit on the system 
of internal control and any signiﬁ cant control 
weaknesses. The Audit Committee also receives 
reports from the external auditors who consider 
controls only to the extent necessary to form 
an opinion as to the truth and fairness of the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
–  Discussing with management the actions taken 
on control weaknesses identiﬁ ed in internal and 
external audit reports.
–  Receiving and reviewing the annual Combined 
Code internal control report prepared by internal 
audit. This is based on a combination of risk 
management reporting and the completion 
by each business of key control questionnaires 
which conﬁ rm the extent to which the business 
complies with the Group control procedures. 
Each business Managing Director and Finance 
Director is required to sign a declaration 
conﬁ rming that they have reviewed the 
business risk table and control questionnaires 
and conﬁ rming compliance with 
statutory obligations.
–  Reviewing the Group’s draft interim, 
preliminary and ﬁ nal ﬁ nancial statements 
prior to Board approval and considering 
any signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial reporting judgements 
contained in the ﬁ nancial statements to 
ensure that the integrity of these statements 
is maintained. The Committee also reviews 
the external auditor’s reports thereon. 
–  Considering the appropriateness of the Group’s 
accounting policies.
–  Reviewing the performance of the Group’s 
internal and external auditors and making 
appropriate recommendations to the 
Board relating to their reappointment 
and remuneration.
The external and internal auditors are given the 
opportunity each year to speak conﬁ dentially 
to the Non-Executive Directors.
The Audit Committee also monitors the 
Group’s whistle blowing procedures, ensuring 
that appropriate procedures are in place to 
allow employees to raise matters of possible 
impropriety in conﬁ dence.
AUDITORS’ INDEPENDENCE AND OBJECTIVITY
The Audit Committee monitors regularly 
the non-audit services being provided by the 
external auditors to ensure their independence. 
There are services which the external auditors 
are precluded from undertaking, including the 
provision of internal audit services, as well as 
services they are permitted to provide, but 
which require the speciﬁ c approval of the Audit 
Committee. This occurs where non-audit work 
per project is in excess of £50,000 or £1 00,000 
in aggregate in any one year and within these 
parameters certain services are delegated to the 
Executive Directors to approve. Any activities that 
may be perceived to be in conﬂ ict with the role 
of external auditor must be submitted to the 
Committee for approval prior to engagement.
Details of the amount paid to the external auditors 
during the year for audit and other services are 
set out in the notes to the ﬁ nancial statements 
on page 53.

DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT
POLICY ON DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION
The remuneration policy is set by the Board and is described below. Individual remuneration packages for 
Executive Directors are determined by the Remuneration Committee within the framework of this policy 
and approved by the Board. 
The remuneration of all Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Executive Directors and approved 
by the Board.
GENERAL INFORMATION
The names of the Directors who have served on the Remuneration Committee during the year are as follows:
–  Hamish M Grossart – Chairman
–  Eric M Hagman 
–  Lord Lindsay 
The Remuneration Committee has previously taken advice from the Monks Partnership on structuring 
Directors’ remuneration packages. Monks Partnership does not provide any other services to the Company.
GENERAL POLICY
The Company ’s policy on Directors’ remuneration is designed to attract, retain and motivate high calibre 
individuals, to reward Directors fairly for their contribution, whilst remaining within the range of beneﬁ ts 
oﬀ ered by similar companies in the sector. The Remuneration Committee seeks to structure total beneﬁ t 
packages which align the interests of shareholders and Senior Executives. Directors’ remuneration will 
be the subject of regular review, in accordance with this policy in the next and following ﬁ nancial years.
The Remuneration Committee has established a number of performance related elements of the executive 
remuneration packages. These consist of an annual Executive Bonus, targeted at an improvement in pre-tax 
proﬁ ts, calculated as a percentage of basic salary. The Executive Bonus is limited to 80% of basic salary. In 
addition, there is a Long-Term Incentive Plan (“LTIP”) which grants annual awards of shares to an upper limit 
of 1 00% of basic salary and is dependent upon performance conditions measured over a three year period. 
The LTIP replaced the previous Share Option Scheme and the Restricted Share Plan. It is considered that 
the non-performance and performance elements of the Directors’ packages are equally important.
Executive Directors also participate in the Employee Proﬁ t Sharing Scheme, which is available to most of the 
employees in the Group and rewards performance based on improvements in proﬁ ts compared with an 
average of the previous three years results. It is calculated at individual business level, with overall UK and 
Group participation rates for employees not aligned to a particular business.
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN (“LTIP”)
Participants are granted awards of shares, the vesting of which will be dependent upon performance 
conditions measured over a period of three years. There is an individual upper limit on each award of 1 00% 
of basic salary per annum. The Remuneration Committee decided that one half of each award is subject to 
an Earnings Per Share (“EPS”) performance condition and the remaining half is subject to a Total Shareholder 
Return (“TSR”) performance condition comparing the Company ’s TSR with that of the companies comprising 
the FTSE Small Cap Industrials Index.
In respect of the proportion of any TSR linked award, no vesting will occur for ranking below median. At 
the median 1 0% of the award will vest with the full 50% vesting for a ranking at or above the upper quartile. 
Vesting occurs on a sliding scale between these two points. No awards will vest unless the remuneration 
committee is satisﬁ ed that there has been a satisfactory and sustained improvement in the Group’s 
underlying ﬁ nancial position and performance over the performance period.
The EPS linked proportion of any award will vest in full if the Company ’s EPS growth is at least the Retail Price 
Index (“the RPI”) plus 1 0% per annum over the performance period; no shares will vest if EPS growth is not at 
least RPI plus 3% per annum. For performance between these two points, vesting will occur on a sliding scale.
The Remuneration Committee is satisﬁ ed that these conditions are challenging and that the full award will 
only vest if exceptional performance has been achieved.
In conjunction with the introduction of the LTIP the Remuneration Committee has adopted a formal 
shareholding guideline, which requires Executive Directors to acquire and retain a beneﬁ cial share holding 
with a value equal to 1 00% of one year’s basic annual salary over a ﬁ ve year period.
SERVICE CONTRACTS
The Company ’s policy on the duration of Director’s contracts is that:
–  Executive Directors should have rolling service contracts terminable on no more than one year’s 
notice served by the Company or the Director.
–  Non-Executive Directors are appointed for ﬁ xed terms of three years, renewable on the agreement 
of both the Company and the Director.
The policy on termination payments is that the Company does not normally make payments beyond its 
contractual obligations including any payment in respect of notice to which a Director is entitled after 
mitigation is considered. In exceptional circumstances an additional ex-gratia payment may be considered, 
based on factors including the Directors’ past contribution and the circumstances of the Director’s departure.

DIRECTORS’ EMOLUMENTS AND COMPENSATION
The auditors are required to report on the information contained in the remainder of this Directors’ 
Remuneration Report.
The emoluments in connection with qualifying services and compensation of each person who served 
as a Director during the year were as follows:
Beneﬁ ts receivable by Executive Directors comprise a car buy out allowance and healthcare insurance.
The supplementary allowance payable to A Thorburn is in compensation for the restriction imposed by the 
Pensions Earnings Cap on her prospective pension entitlement. The earnings cap was discontinued in April 
2006, but the Remuneration Committee has decided to continue with a similar cap in order not to add 
to the past service liabilities of the Deﬁ ned Beneﬁ t Pension Scheme.
PENSION ARRANGEMENTS 
A Thorburn is an active member of the British Polythene Pension Scheme and J T Langlands, who left 
the Scheme on 31 December 2006, is a deferred member. Their dependants are eligible for dependants’ 
pensions and the payment of a lump sum in the event of death in service. Final pensionable earnings, 
excluding bonuses and Employee Proﬁ t Share Scheme payments, are used to determine the director’s 
pension entitlement and are subject to an earnings cap. Life assurance cover is provided at four times 
annual salary.

The pension entitlements earned by the directors during the year calculated in accordance with the 
requirements of the UK Listing Authority listing rules and the Companies Act 1 985 as provided by our 
consulting actuaries and conﬁ rmed by them were as follows.
Transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with regulations 
for calculating transfer values for occupational pension schemes. The reduction in transfer values over 
the year, identiﬁ ed in the column headed “Net change in transfer value during year”, reﬂ ects an increase 
in the discount rate used to value the pension entitlements.
Although C McLatchie has no pension entitlement remaining in the Scheme, a lump sum death in service 
beneﬁ t is provided for him under the Scheme at a cost of £1,600 per annum.
A Thorburn
The pension entitlements shown above are the amounts which would be paid annually from retirement age 
based on service to the end of the year 2008. The increase in accrued pension during the year excludes any 
increase for inﬂ ation.
Member contributions of 1 1% of pensionable salary are o ﬀ set in calculating the values shown in columns 
headed “Transfer value of net increase over year” and “Net change in transfer value during year”.
J T Langlands
J T Langlands left the Scheme on 31 December 2006 and, therefore, has no pension accrual during the year, but 
he is provided with lump sum and spouse’s pension beneﬁ ts on death in service at a cost of £1 3,800 per annum.
The pension entitlements shown above are the amounts which would be paid annually from retirement 
age based on service to the end of the year 2006, increased for inﬂ ation to 2008.
The Company contributed £64,000 (2007: £61,000) to J T Langlands’ personal pension arrangements.
DIRECTORS’ SHARE INCENTIVES
The following table sets out details of savings related share options held by each Director during the year:
The mid market closing share price of the Company ’s 25p Ordinary Shares ranged from 160p to 280p 
during the year and on 31 December 2008 was 1 87.5p (2007: 256p).
RESTRICTED SHARE PLAN
The Executive Directors participated, along with other key executives in the Group, in a Restricted Share Plan, 
which was approved by shareholders at the 1 996 Annual General Meeting. The amount that Executives could 
invest was restricted to 30% of their base salary. If the net of tax executive bonus was invested in shares of 
the Company, and retained, the Company would match these shares on a one-for-one basis after three, ﬁ ve 
and seven years. Following the introduction of an Executive Share Option Plan in 2003, there was only one 
matching of shares after three years from 2003 onwards. As a result of the introduction of the LTIP in 2005 
no further awards will be made under the Restricted Share Plan.
The following awards have been made under the 1 996 Restricted Share Plan:

The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with applicable 
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company ﬁ nancial statements for each ﬁ nancial year. Under that law they are required to prepare 
the Group ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable law and have elected to prepare the parent company ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
The Group ﬁ nancial statements are required by law and IFRSs as adopted by the EU to present fairly the ﬁ nancial position and the performance of the Group; 
the Companies Act 1 985 provides in relation to such ﬁ nancial statements that references in the relevant part of that Act to ﬁ nancial statements giving a true 
and fair view are references to their achieving a fair presentation.
The parent company ﬁ nancial statements are required by law to give a true and fair view of the state of a ﬀ airs of the parent company.
In preparing each of the Group and parent company ﬁ nancial statements, the Directors are required to:
–  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently.
– make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent.
–  for the Group ﬁ nancial statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU.
–  for the parent company ﬁ nancial statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the parent company ﬁ nancial statements; and
–  prepare the ﬁ nancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company will continue
in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial position of the parent company 
and enable them to ensure that its ﬁ nancial statements comply with the Companies Act 1 985. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as are reasonably 
open to them to safeguard the assets of the Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
Under applicable law and regulations, the Directors are also responsible for preparing a Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report and Corporate Governance 
Statement that comply with that law and those regulations.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁ nancial information included on the Company ’s website. Legislation in the UK 
governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may di ﬀ er from legislation in other jurisdictions.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN RESPECT OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL REPORT
On behalf of the Directors of the Company we conﬁ rm that to the best of our knowledge:
–  the ﬁ nancial statements, prepared in accordance with the applicable set of accounting standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position 
and proﬁ t or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
–  the Report by Directors and Business Review includes a fair review of the development and performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.

Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view and whether the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1 985 and, as regards the Group ﬁ nancial statements, 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁ nancial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit, or if information speciﬁ ed by law regarding Directors’ remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate Governance Statement reﬂ ects the Company ’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2006 Combined Code speciﬁ ed for our 
review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on internal 
control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the e ﬀ ectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read the other information contained in the Annual Report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited ﬁ nancial statements. We consider the implications 
for our report if we become aware of any apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the ﬁ nancial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information.
BASIS OF AUDIT OPINION
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited. It also 
includes an assessment of the signiﬁ cant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the ﬁ nancial statements, and of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company ’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide us with su ﬃ  cient evidence 
to give reasonable assurance that the ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether 
caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the ﬁ nancial statements 
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited.
OPINION
In our opinion:
–  the Group ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, of the state of the Group’s a ﬀ airs as at 31 December 2008 
and of its proﬁ t for the year then ended.
–  the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1 985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
–  the parent company ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice, of the state of the 
parent company ’s a ﬀ airs as at 31 December 2008.
–  the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1 985; and
–  the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent with the ﬁ nancial statements.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2008
1 . BASIS OF PREPARATION AND SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
British Polythene Industries PLC (the “Company”) is a company domiciled and incorporated in the United Kingdom. The consolidated annual ﬁ nancial statements 
(the “ﬁ nancial statements”) of the Company for the year ended 31 December 2008 incorporate the ﬁ nancial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries 
(together referred to as the “Group”).
STATEMENT OF COMPLIANCE
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (“ adopted IFRSs”). 
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with UK GAAP. These are presented on pages 71 to 76. 
The accounting policies set out below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
BASIS OF PREPARATION 
The ﬁ nancial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative ﬁ nancial instruments, intangible assets acquired through business combinations, 
and the assets and liabilities of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme. These are stated at their fair value.
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis. The reasons for this are outlined in the Finance Review on page 24. 
BASIS OF CONSOLIDATION
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating policies 
of an entity so as to obtain beneﬁ ts from its activities.
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated income statement from the eﬀ ective date of acquisition or up to the 
eﬀ ective date of disposal, as appropriate.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the ﬁ nancial statements of subsidiaries acquired to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group.
All intra Group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation. 
The interest of minority shareholders is stated at the minority ’s proportion of the fair values of the assets and liabilities recognised. Subsequently, any losses applicable 
to the minority interest in excess of the minority interest are allocated against the interests of the parent.
TURNOVER RECOGNITION
Turnover from the sale of goods and services is measured at the fair value of the consideration, net of rebates, trade discounts, VAT and other sales-related taxes. 
Turnover from the sale of goods and services is recognised when the Group has transferred the signiﬁ cant risks and rewards of ownership of the goods and services 
to the buyer, the amount of turnover can be measured reliably and it is probable that the economic beneﬁ ts associated with the transaction will ﬂ ow to the Group. 
LEASING AND HIRE PURCHASE
Leases are classiﬁ ed as ﬁ nance leases when, on inception of the lease, the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. 
All other leases are classiﬁ ed as operating leases.
Assets held under ﬁ nance leases (including hire purchase contracts) are initially recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of 
the minimum lease payments, each determined at the inception of the lease. The corresponding liability to the lessor is included in the balance sheet as a ﬁ nance lease 
obligation. Lease payments are apportioned between ﬁ nance charges and reduction of the lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability. Finance charges are charged directly through the income statement as borrowing costs. 
Rentals payable under operating leases are charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the term of the relevant lease.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES 
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities carried at historical cost that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the historical cost was determined. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in income and expense for the period.
On consolidation, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s overseas operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition of a foreign entity, 
are translated at exchange rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Income and expense items are translated at the average exchange rates for the period. Exchange 
diﬀ erences arising are recognised directly in the Group’s translation reserve. Such translation di ﬀ erences are recognised as income or as expenses in the period in which 
the operation is disposed of.
GOVERNMENT GRANTS
Government grants on capital expenditure are released through cost of sales over the expected useful lives of the relevant assets or the qualifying period if shorter. 
Grants of a revenue nature are credited to the consolidated income statement in the period in which the costs are incurred.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS 
Payments to deﬁ ned contribution retirement beneﬁ t schemes are charged as an expense as they fall due. Payments made to state-managed retirement beneﬁ t schemes 
are dealt with as payments to deﬁ ned contribution schemes where the Group’s obligations under the schemes are equivalent to those arising in a deﬁ ned contribution 
retirement beneﬁ t scheme.
For deﬁ ned beneﬁ t retirement beneﬁ t schemes, the cost of providing beneﬁ ts in respect of each plan is determined in an annual actuarial report using the Projected Unit 
Credit Method. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. They are recognised outside the income statement and presented in the 
consolidated statement of recognised income and expense in accordance with IAS 1 9.
BPI-100205 Accounts 2008 V5.indd   48 BPI-100205 Accounts 2008 V5.indd   48 6/4/09   13:19:33 6/4/09   13:19:33 49 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The retirement beneﬁ t obligation recognised in the balance sheet represents an actuarial assessment of the present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation as reduced 
by the fair value of scheme assets. 
TAXATION
The tax expense represents the sum of the current taxes payable and deferred tax.
The current tax payable is based on taxable proﬁ t for the period. Taxable proﬁ t diﬀ ers from net proﬁ t as reported in the income statement because it excludes items 
of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current 
tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on di ﬀ erences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the ﬁ nancial statements and the 
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable proﬁ t, and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method. Deferred tax liabilities are generally 
recognised for all taxable temporary di ﬀ erences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable proﬁ ts will be available against 
which deductible temporary di ﬀ erences can be utilised. 
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary di ﬀ erences arising on investments in subsidiaries, except where the Group is able to control the reversal 
of the temporary di ﬀ erence and it is probable that the temporary di ﬀ erence will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that su ﬃ  cient taxable proﬁ ts 
will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised using tax rates that have 
been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. Tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items charged 
or credited directly to equity, in which case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
GOODWILL
Goodwill has been recognised on acquisitions of subsidiaries and represents the di ﬀ erence between the cost of acquisition and the Group’s interest in the fair 
value of the identiﬁ able assets and liabilities and contingent liabilities at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. 
The carrying amount is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested annually for impairment. Any impairment is recognised immediately in income or expense 
and is not subsequently reversed.
In respect of acquisitions prior to 1 January 2004, goodwill is included on the basis of its deemed cost, which represents the amount recorded under UK GAAP. 
The classiﬁ cation and accounting treatment of business combinations that occurred prior to 1 January 2004 was not reconsidered in preparing the Group’s opening 
IFRS balance sheet at 1 January 2004. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁ t or loss on disposal, except for goodwill written o ﬀ  to reserves 
under UK GAAP prior to 1 998 which has not been reinstated and is not included in determining any subsequent proﬁ t or loss on disposal.
Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition is recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as a credit to proﬁ t from operations.
OTHER INTANGIBLE ASSETS
Other intangible assets are carried at cost less accumulated amortisation and accumulated impairment losses. Amortisation begins when an asset is available for use 
and is calculated on a straight line basis to allocate the cost of assets over their estimated useful lives as follows:
 
Computer software 4 - 5 years
Customer lists 3 - 1 0 years
Other intangible assets 5 years
The cost of intangible assets acquired in a business combination is the fair value at acquisition date. The cost of separately acquired intangible assets, including computer 
software, comprises the purchase cost and any directly attributable costs of preparing the asset for use. Computer software costs that are directly associated with the 
implementation of major business systems are capitalised as intangible assets.  
Other intangible assets currently comprise a property lease obtained on favourable terms on the acquisition of AT Films Inc. 
PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and any accumulated impairment losses. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of property, plant and equipment. 
Land is not depreciated. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Freehold buildings 20 - 50 years
Leasehold buildings 1 0 - 40 years
Plant and equipment 4 - 1 0 years
 
Residual values and useful lives are reassessed annually.  
Assets held under ﬁ nance leases/hire purchase are capitalised and depreciated over their expected useful lives on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, 
over the term of the relevant lease. 
BPI-100205 Accounts 2008 V5.indd   49 BPI-100205 Accounts 2008 V5.indd   49 6/4/09   13:19:33 6/4/09   13:19:33 50 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2008
IMPAIRMENT OF TANGIBLE AND INTANGIBLE ASSETS 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying amounts of its tangible assets and intangible assets with deﬁ nite useful lives to determine whether there 
is any indication that those assets have su ﬀ ered an impairment loss. If any such indication exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order to determine 
the extent of the impairment loss. Where the asset does not generate cash ﬂ ows that are independent from other assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount 
of the cash generating unit to which the asset belongs. Intangible assets with indeﬁ nite useful lives and goodwill are tested for impairment annually and whenever there 
is an indication that the asset may be impaired.
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future cash ﬂ ows are discounted to their present 
value using a pre-tax discount rate that reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time value of money and the risks speciﬁ c to the asset. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset is reduced to its recoverable amount. 
An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses in respect of assets other than goodwill, the carrying amount of the asset is increased to the revised estimate of its 
recoverable amount, but so that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined had no impairment loss been 
recognised for the asset in prior years. A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately.
INVENTORIES
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that 
have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs 
of completion and costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.
TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES
Trade and other receivables are stated at their amortised cost less an allowance for irrecoverable amounts. 
CASH AND CASH EQUIVALENTS
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand 
and form an integral part of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash ﬂ ows. 
TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES 
Trade and other payables are stated at amortised cost. 
PROVISIONS 
A provision is recognised in the balance sheet when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past event, and it is probable that an outﬂ ow 
of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation. If the e ﬀ ect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash ﬂ ows at a pre-tax 
rate that reﬂ ects current market assessments of the time value of money and, when appropriate, the risks speciﬁ c to the liability. 
INTEREST 
Interest is recognised in income or expense using the e ﬀ ective rate of interest method. Financing fees are amortised over the life of the related facility. 
EARNINGS PER SHARE 
The Group presents basic and diluted earnings per share (EPS) data for ordinary shares. Basic EPS is calculated by dividing the proﬁ t or loss attributable to ordinary 
shareholders by the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the period. Diluted EPS is determined by dividing the proﬁ t or loss attributable 
to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of shares outstanding adjusted for the e ﬀ ects of all dilutive potential ordinary shares. 
FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
The Group’s objectives, policies and processes for measuring and managing risk, and the Group’s management of capital address the exposure to credit risk, liquidity risk 
and market risk from the use of ﬁ nancial instruments. Further quantitative disclosures are included throughout these ﬁ nancial statements. 
The Board of Directors has overall responsibility for the establishment and oversight of the Group’s risk management framework. 
The Audit Committee oversees how management monitors compliance with the Group’s risk management policies and procedures and reviews the adequacy of the risk 
management framework in relation to the risks faced by the Group. 
Certain derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Group’s treasury policy. Hedges are classiﬁ ed as follows: 
–  Fair value hedges that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability. 
–  Cash ﬂ ow hedges that hedge exposure to variability in cash ﬂ ows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability 
or a forecast transaction. 
–  Net investment hedges that hedge exposure to changes in the value of the Group’s interests in the net assets of foreign operations. 
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the consolidated income statement. Any gain or loss on the 
hedged item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and similarly recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
BPI-100205 Accounts 2008 V5.indd   50 BPI-100205 Accounts 2008 V5.indd   50 6/4/09   13:19:33 6/4/09   13:19:33 51 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
For cash ﬂ ow hedges and net investment hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an e ﬀ ective hedge, as deﬁ ned by 
IAS 39 “Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement”, is recognised in equity, with any ine ﬀ ective portion recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
When hedged cash ﬂ ows result in the recognition of a non ﬁ nancial asset or liability, the associated gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial 
measurement of the asset or liability. For all other cash ﬂ ow hedges, the gains or losses that are recognised in equity are transferred to the consolidated income statement 
in the same period in which the hedged cash ﬂ ows a ﬀ ect the consolidated income statement. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
When a hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. 
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the consolidated 
income statement. 
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS 
The fair value of equity settled employee share options granted is calculated at grant date and the resulting cost is charged to the income statement over the vesting 
period of the options with a corresponding increase in equity. The value of the charge is adjusted to reﬂ ect expected and actual levels of options vesting. Failures to vest 
as a result of market conditions are not reversed. 
TREASURY SHARES 
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. 
Repurchased shares are classiﬁ ed as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from revenue reserves.  
KEY ACCOUNTING ESTIMATES AND JUDGEMENTS 
The preparation of the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements requires the Directors to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that a ﬀ ect the application of policies 
and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and various other 
factors that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and 
liabilities that are not readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may di ﬀ er from these estimates. Areas requiring the Directors to make judgements, estimates 
and assumptions are highlighted in these accounting policies and throughout the notes to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. Key estimation and judgement areas 
are as follows: 
 
–  PROPERTY, PLANT AND EQUIPMENT 
Depreciation rates are regularly reviewed to ensure that they reﬂ ect accurately useful lives and residual values are reviewed on an annual basis in line 
with market conditions. 
 
–  TRADE AND OTHER RECEIVABLES 
The recoverability of trade and other receivables are kept under constant review and provision is made where appropriate in line with disclosures in Note 15.
 
–  TRADE AND OTHER PAYABLES 
Where the amount payable in respect of any liability is uncertain the amount provided in the accounts is based on the best estimate available at the time.
–  DEFINED BENEFIT PENSION PLANS
A qualiﬁ ed independent actuary undertakes the estimation of the present value of the Group’s obligations under deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension schemes using 
assumptions taken from a range of possible actuarial assumptions. These assumptions may not be borne out in practice, especially due to the long timescales 
involved. Changes in the key assumptions, which include discount rates, inﬂ ation, mortality and expected return on assets, could have a signiﬁ cant e ﬀ ect on the 
proﬁ t or loss for the period and the ﬁ nancial position of the Group. Details of assumptions employed to determine the liability at 31 December 2008 are set out 
in Note 31. The valuation of scheme assets is based on the fair value at the balance sheet date. As these assets are not intended to be sold in the short-term, 
their value may change signiﬁ cantly prior to realisation. 
–  TAXATION
The Group is subject to income taxes in the jurisdictions in which it operates. Signiﬁ cant judgements are required in determining the consolidated provision for 
income taxes. During the ordinary course of business, there are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. As a result, 
the Group recognises tax liabilities for anticipated tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes will be due. The amount of such liabilities is based on 
an assessment of various factors, such as experience of previous tax audits and di ﬀ ering interpretations of tax law. This assessment relies on estimates and assumptions 
and involves a series of complex judgements about future events. To the extent that the ﬁ nal tax outcome of these matters is di ﬀ erent from the amounts recognised, 
such di ﬀ erences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in which such determination is made.
STANDARDS AND INTERPRETATIONS NOT YET APPLIED
A number of new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations are not yet e ﬀ ective for the year ended 31 December 2008 and have not been applied 
in preparing these ﬁ nancial statements.
IAS 1 PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS: A REVISED PRESENTATION (eﬀ ective year ending 31 December 2009) will require the Group to present 
a statement of changes in equity accompanied by either a statement of comprehensive income or an income statement accompanied by a statement 
of other comprehensive income.
AMENDMENT TO IAS 23 BORROWING COSTS (eﬀ ective year ending 31 December 2009) removes the previously available option to expense all borrowing costs incurred 
on production of qualifying assets. It is not expected to have a signiﬁ cant impact on the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2008
AMENDMENT TO IAS 27 CONSOLIDATED AND SEPARATE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS (e ﬀ ective year ending 31 December 2009) removes the requirement to record 
pre-acquisition dividends as a credit to investment rather than income in the parent company. It is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
AMENDMENT TO IAS 32 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: PRESENTATION AND IAS 1 PRESENTATION OF FINANCIAL STATEMENTS – PUTTABLE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS 
AND OBLIGATIONS ARISING ON LIQUIDATION (eﬀ ective year ending 31 December 2009) provides exemptions from the existing requirements when certain circumstances 
are met. It is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements.
AMENDMENT TO IAS 39 FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS: RECOGNITION AND MEASUREMENT: ELIGIBLE HEDGED ITEMS (eﬀ ective year ending 31 December 201 0) 
clariﬁ es two hedge accounting issues: inﬂ ation in a ﬁ nancial hedged item and a one sided risk in a hedged item. It is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated 
ﬁ nancial statements. 
AMENDMENTS TO IAS 39 AND IFRS 7: RECLASSIFICATION OF FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS (eﬀ ective year ending 31 December 2009) permits certain reclassiﬁ cations 
of ﬁ nancial assets. It is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. 
AMENDMENT TO IFRS 2 SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS – VESTING CONDITIONS AND CANCELLATIONS (eﬀ ective year ending 31 December 2009) clariﬁ es the deﬁ nition 
of vesting conditions in relation to share-based payments, amongst other things. The Group has not yet determined the potential eﬀ ect of the amendment; however, 
it is not expected to be signiﬁ cant.
IFRS 3 (REVISED) BUSINESS COMBINATIONS (eﬀ ective year ending 31 December 201 0) requires acquisition costs incurred in a business combination to be expensed 
as incurred rather than included in the cost of acquisition and determination of goodwill. It also brings about changes to the current accounting in relation to contingent 
consideration and various other aspects of accounting for business combinations. This will e ﬀ ect any future acquisitions by the Group.
IFRS 8 OPERATING SEGMENTS (eﬀ ective year ending 31 December 2009) is a disclosure standard which may result in changes to the segmental information currently 
disclosed, but will have no impact on the reported results or the ﬁ nancial position of the Group.
IFRIC 16 HEDGES OF A NET INVESTMENT IN A FOREIGN OPERATION (eﬀ ective year ending 31 December 2009) provides guidance on hedging the foreign currency 
risk arising from net investments in foreign operations. It is not expected to have any impact on the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements. 
IMPROVEMENTS TO IFRSS 2007 (eﬀ ective year ending 31 December 2009) incorporates a number of non-urgent amendments to IFRSs. The Group has not yet 
determined the full potential e ﬀ ect of the amendments; however, they are not expected to be signiﬁ cant.
The Revision to IFRS 3, the amendments to IAS 27 and the amendment to IAS 39 relating to eligible hedged items have not yet been endorsed by the EU. The remaining 
standards and interpretations have been endorsed. 
There are a number of additional standards and interpretations not yet in force which are not relevant to the Group. These include amendments to IFRS 1 and IAS 27 
relating to ﬁ rst time adoption of IFRSs and IFRICs 12, 13, 15 and 17.

CREDIT RISK
Credit risk is the risk of ﬁ nancial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty fails to meet its contractual obligations and arises principally from amounts receivable 
from customers.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is inﬂ uenced mainly by the individual characteristics of each customer and before accepting any new customer, the Group uses 
an external credit scoring system to assess the potential customer’s credit quality and deﬁ nes credit limits by customer. Limits and scoring attributed to customers 
are reviewed once a year. In addition, the Group has a policy of insuring certain debtors.
The geographical proﬁ le of credit risk over the year is broadly in line with that of turnover by destination as disclosed in Note 2.
EXPOSURE TO CREDIT RISK
The carrying amount of ﬁ nancial assets, which includes trade receivables net of impairment losses as stated below and cash of £0.4 million (2007: £0.6 million), 
represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk at each year end.
IMPAIRMENT LOSSES
The ageing of trade receivables at the reporting date was as follows:
     2008 2008 2007 2007
     £M  £M  £M  £M 
     GROSS IMPAIRMENT GROSS IMPAIRMENT

Over 30 days overdue   4.4 1.5 4.4 1.5
  
   59.6 1.6 63.5 1.6
An impairment allowance has been made for estimated irrecoverable amounts from the sale of goods. 
In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable, the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially 
granted up to the reporting date. The Group has no signiﬁ cant concentration of credit risk, with exposure spread over a large number of counterparties and customers
in many di ﬀ erent markets and sectors. This is discussed further within the Finance Review, on page 24. Accordingly, the Directors believe that there is no further 
provision required in excess of the allowance for doubtful debts.

LIQUIDITY RISK
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its ﬁ nancial obligations as they fall due. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining adequate banking 
facilities, by continuously monitoring forecast and actual cash ﬂ ows and matching the maturity proﬁ les of ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities. The Group has at its disposal 
additional undrawn facilities which further reduces liquidity risk. Refer to the Finance Review on page 24 for further discussion of liquidity risk.

The carrying value approximates to fair value either because of the short maturity of the instruments or because the interest rates are reset after periods of not greater 
than six months.
FINANCE LEASES/HIRE PURCHASE
The fair value of the obligations approximates to their carrying amount.
MARKET RISK
Market risk is the risk that changes in market prices, such as interest rates and foreign currency exchange rates, will a ﬀ ect the Group’s income or the value of its holdings 
of ﬁ nancial instruments. The objective of market risk management is to manage and control market risk exposures within acceptable parameters, while optimising 
the return. Generally the Group seeks to minimise this risk through hedge arrangements designed to manage a proportion of the Group’s overall exposure. 
HEDGING
NET INVESTMENT IN OVERSEAS OPERATIONS
The Group has a policy of maintaining borrowings in the currency of most of its overseas operations to cover the net asset position in those companies.  
CASH FLOW HEDGE – FOREIGN CURRENCY
Sales orders in currency are covered in most instances at the time of receipt by the creation of a currency overdraft. Purchases are covered with forward contracts or 
reduction in borrowings in the relevant currency where appropriate. Any signiﬁ cant exception to this is approved at Board level. Any cash ﬂ ow and proﬁ t e ﬀ ect would 
crystalise within six months of the year end when the forecast transactions being hedged materialise. The value of these hedges at 31 December 2008 was £0.7 million 
(2007: £0.3 million). No ine ﬀ ectiveness was recognised in the income statement in relation to cash ﬂ ow hedges.

CAD   1.9528 2.0268 1.7914 1.9565
INTEREST RATE MANAGEMENT
Exposure to ﬂ uctuating interest rates is managed by maintaining a proportion of the Group’s debt on a ﬁ xed basis and topping this up as appropriate with derivative 
ﬁ nancial instruments to maintain the desired ﬁ xed/variable mix. Due to the seasonal nature of working capital requirements funded by borrowings this is done by ﬁ xing 
a value rather than a percentage. 
SENSITIVITY ANALYSIS
In managing interest rate and currency risks the Group aims to reduce the impact of short-term ﬂ uctuations on the Group’s earnings. Over the longer term, however, 
permanent changes in foreign exchange and interest rates would have an impact on consolidated earnings.  
At 31 December 2008, it is estimated that a change of 1 00 basis points in interest rates would result in a change of £0.5 million in proﬁ t before tax. This has been 
calculated by taking 1% of the Group’s ﬂ oating rate borrowings as at 31 December 2008. It assumes that all other variables, including foreign currency, remain 
constant. In 2007, the estimated change in proﬁ t before tax was calculated as £0.3 million, using the same method and assumptions.  
It is estimated that a change of 1 0 euro cents against the value of sterling over the period would result in an increase or decrease in proﬁ t or loss by £0.5 million. 
This has been determined by calculating the e ﬀ ect of such a change on the translation of our European results. In 2007, the impact was estimated at £0.5 million, 
using the same method.  
It is estimated that a fall in the discount rate of 0.5% would increase the pension scheme deﬁ cit by £15 million, an increase in life expectancy of one year would 
increase it by £4 million and a fall in equity markets of 1 0% would increase it by £5 million.

30. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
LONG-TERM INCENTIVE PLAN
In 2005 the Group introduced a new Long-Term Incentive Plan for senior executives. Shares are conditionally awarded under this plan and vest in employees based 
on the following performance criteria. 
The EPS part of an award will vest if the Company ’s EPS growth is at least RPI plus 1 0% per annum over the performance period; no shares will vest if EPS growth 
is not at least RPI plus 3% per annum. For performance between these two points, vesting will occur on a sliding scale.
For the portion of the award based on Total Shareholder Return (“TSR”), no vesting will occur for ranking below median. At the median 1 0% of the award will vest 
with the full 50% vesting for a ranking at or above the upper quartile. Vesting occurs on a sliding scale between these two points.

SAVINGS RELATED SHARE OPTION SCHEME
The employee savings related share option scheme is open to almost all UK employees. Employees save over three or ﬁ ve years at the end of which shares 
can be purchased during the following six month period. During the period the Group did not issue any shares (2007: 36,398 shares at a weighted average 
price of £2.66) under this scheme. Grants of options were made on 1 9 October 2006 and 9 October 2007 at a price 1 0% below the market price on the date 
of o ﬀ er and on 13 October 2008 at market price. 
At 31 December 2008 the individual options, not yet exercised, of Directors and other employees under the savings related share option scheme are as follows:

Expected volatility was determined by calculating the historical volatility of the Group’s share price over the three years immediately preceding grant. The expected life 
used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s best estimate, for the e ﬀ ects of non-transferability, exercise restrictions, and behavioural considerations.
The Group recognised total expenses of £0.4 million relating to equity-settled share-based payment transactions in 2008 (2007: £0.1 million).

BRITISH POLYTHENE DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEME
The assets of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t section of the British Polythene Pension Scheme are invested in a self-administered trust fund and are separated from the Group’s 
business assets. The scheme was closed to new entrants in June 2000.
A full actuarial valuation in relation to the scheme was carried out on 5 April 2008 and was updated by the actuary at 31 December 2008. The previous valuation was 
carried out on 6 April 2005 and was updated by the actuary at 31 December 2005, 2006 and 2007. The present value of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligation, the related 
current service cost and past service cost were measured using the projected unit credit method.
The major assumptions used by the actuary in the valuations were:
     
   2008 2007
Rate of increase in pensionable earnings     2.60% 3.20% 
Rate of increase in pensions in payment  
    – service up to 31 December 2006     2.60% 3.20%
    – service from 1 January 2007     2.40% 2.40% 
Rate of increase in deferred pensions     2.60% 3.20% 
Discount rate applied to scheme liabilities     6.50% 5.80% 
Inﬂ ation assumption     2.60% 3.20% 
Life expectancy: 
    – Male aged 60 (current life expectancy)      23.2  23.1 
    – Female aged 60 (current life expectancy)      26.0   26.0 
    – Male aged 45 (life expectancy at age 60)      24.9   24.8 
    – Female aged 45 (life expectancy at age 60)      27.7   27.7 
The assumptions used by the actuary are the best estimates chosen from a range of possible actuarial assumptions which, due to the timescale covered, 
may not necessarily be borne out in practice.

The rates quoted are the expected net rate of return after allowing for investment expenses. 
The fair value of the Scheme assets are not intended to be realised in the short-term and may be subject to signiﬁ cant change before they are realised. 
The present value of the Scheme liabilities is derived from cash ﬂ ow projections over a long period and is thus inherently uncertain.

NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2008
The expected rate of return on each class of scheme assets is based on market expectations, as at 31 December 2008. For equities it has been assumed 
that the long-term return will exceed that of bonds by a margin, the “equity risk premium”, of 4.5% p.a. above long-term gilt yields at the measurement date.

OTHER DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEMES 
The Company ’s subsidiary in Ireland operates a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme. Disclosures are not provided in relation to this scheme as the amounts involved are not 
signiﬁ cant. At 31 December 2008, the scheme has total assets of €2.5 million (2007: €3.1 million) and total liabilities of €2.7 million (2007: €2.8 million).  
The Company ’s overseas subsidiary in the Netherlands operates a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t scheme in conjunction with a number of other employers. However, as it is not possible 
to identify their share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reliable basis, the Group is accounting for this scheme as a deﬁ ned contribution scheme. 
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES
The assets of the deﬁ ned contribution section of the British Polythene Pension Scheme, other deﬁ ned contribution schemes and deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes treated 
as deﬁ ned contribution schemes as detailed above are held separately from those of the Group, being invested in funds under the control of a number of insurance 
companies. The pension charge includes contributions payable by the Group to the various insurance companies.  
The total cost charged to income in 2008 of £1.4 million (2007: £1.1 million) represents contributions payable to these schemes by the Group at rates speciﬁ ed 
in the rules of the plans.  
OTHER EMPLOYEE BENEFITS 
The Group has two other arrangements classiﬁ ed as other long-term beneﬁ ts. In the UK there is a self-insured Permanent Health Scheme with recognised liabilities 
of £0.8 million (2007: £0.8 million) and in the Netherlands there is a ‘’Jubilee’’ provision of £0.6 million (2007: £0.5 million) which provides for additional payments 
to employees with long service. There was previously an additional post employment beneﬁ t plan in the AT Films business in Canada which provided medical 
and dental cover to certain employees. This has now been closed and no further liability is recognised (2007: £0.2 million).
32. RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
The Group has a related party relationship with its subsidiaries (see Note 13), with its Directors and executive o ﬃ  cers including key management personnel, 
and with the British Polythene Pension Scheme. Disclosures relating to Directors are shown on pages 37 to 40.
Transactions between the Company and its subsidiaries, which are related parties, have been eliminated on consolidation and are not disclosed in this note. 
There were no trading transactions with related parties who are not members of the Group in the year ended 31 December 2008.
REMUNERATION OF KEY MANAGEMENT PERSONNEL 
The remuneration of the key management personnel of the Group is set out below in aggregate for each of the categories speciﬁ ed in IAS 24 “Related Party Disclosures”.

IMPACT OF ACQUISITION ON THE RESULTS OF THE GROUP  
Included in the proﬁ t from operations for 2007 is £0.2 million attributable to the acquisition of AT Films. Had the acquisition been e ﬀ ected at 1 January 2007, 
the turnover of the Group from continuing operations would have been £434.1 million, and the proﬁ t from operations would still have been £13.9 million.  
The Directors consider these ‘pro-forma’ numbers to represent an approximate measure of the performance of the combined Group on an annualised basis and to provide 
a reference point for comparison in future periods.   
In determining the ‘pro-forma’ turnover and proﬁ t of the Group had AT Films been acquired on 1 January 2007, the Directors have calculated depreciation and amortisation 
of non-current assets acquired on the basis of the fair values acquired rather than the carrying amounts recognised in the pre-acquisition ﬁ nancial statements.  
The other intangible asset is a property lease entered into at less than an economic rent.

NOTES TO THE UK GAAP PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
FOR THE YEAR ENDED 31 DECEMBER 2008
1 . SIGNIFICANT ACCOUNTING POLICIES
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The Company ’s ﬁ nancial statements are prepared on the historical cost basis, except for derivative ﬁ nancial instruments which are stated at their fair value, 
and in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards. The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared on a going concern basis, for the reasons outlined 
in the Finance Review on page 24.
The following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Company ’s ﬁ nancial statements.
PROFIT AND LOSS ACCOUNT
Under Section 230 (4) of the Companies Act 1 985, the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own proﬁ t and loss account.
RELATED PARTY TRANSACTIONS
As the parent company of the British Polythene Industries PLC Group (the ﬁ nancial statements for which can be found on pages 45 to 70, the Company has taken 
advantage of the exemption contained in FRS 8 and has therefore not disclosed transactions or balances with entities which form part of the Group.
FOREIGN CURRENCIES 
Transactions in currencies other than pounds sterling are recorded at the rates of exchange prevailing on the dates of the transactions. At each balance sheet date, 
monetary assets and liabilities that are denominated in foreign currencies are retranslated at the rates prevailing on the balance sheet date. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities carried at historical cost that are denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the rates prevailing at the date when the historical cost was determined. 
Gains and losses arising on retranslation are included in the proﬁ t and loss account for the year.
TAXATION
The Company ’s tax charge is based on the result for the year and tax rates in force during the year. Estimation of the tax charge requires an assessment to be made 
of the potential tax treatment of certain items which will only be resolved once ﬁ nally agreed with the relevant tax authorities.
DEFERRED TAXATION
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all timing di ﬀ erences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes 
which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 1 9. A net deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore 
recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as more likely than not that there will be su ﬃ  cient taxable proﬁ ts from which the future 
reversal of the underlying timing di ﬀ erences can be deducted.
INVESTMENTS
Investments are stated at cost less provisions for any impairment.
DERIVATIVE FINANCIAL INSTRUMENTS
Certain derivative ﬁ nancial instruments are designated as hedges in line with the Company ’s treasury policy. Hedges are classiﬁ ed as follows:
– Fair value hedges that hedge the exposure to changes in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability.
–  Cash ﬂ ow hedges that hedge exposure to variability in cash ﬂ ows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a recognised asset or liability 
or a forecast transaction.
For fair value hedges, any gain or loss from remeasuring the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised in the proﬁ t and loss account. Any gain or loss on the hedged 
item attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying amount of the hedged item and similarly recognised in the proﬁ t and loss account.
For cash ﬂ ow hedges, the portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument that is determined to be an e ﬀ ective hedge, as deﬁ ned by FRS 26, is recognised in equity, 
with any ine ﬀ ective portion recognised in the proﬁ t and loss account. When hedged cash ﬂ ows result in the recognition of a non ﬁ nancial asset or liability, the associated 
gains or losses previously recognised in equity are included in the initial measurement of the asset or liability. For all other cash ﬂ ow hedges, the gains or losses that are 
recognised in equity are transferred to the proﬁ t and loss account in the same period in which the hedged cash ﬂ ows aﬀ ect the proﬁ t and loss account.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments not designated as hedges are recognised in the proﬁ t and loss account.
When a hedging instrument is sold, terminated or exercised, or the entity revokes designation of the hedge relationship but the hedged forecast transaction is still 
expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss at that point remains in equity and is recognised in accordance with the above policy when the transaction occurs. 
If the hedged transaction is no longer expected to take place, the cumulative unrealised gain or loss recognised in equity is recognised immediately in the proﬁ t 
and loss account. 
FINANCIAL GUARANTEE CONTRACTS
Where the Company enters into ﬁ nancial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, the Company considers these to be 
insurance arrangements, and accounts for them as such. In this respect, the Company treats the guarantee contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes 
probable that the Company will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.
SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The fair value of employee share options granted is calculated at grant date and the resulting cost is charged to the proﬁ t and loss account over the vesting period 
of the options with a corresponding increase in equity. The value of the charge is adjusted to reﬂ ect expected and actual levels of options vesting. Failures to vest 
as a result of market conditions are not reversed.
TREASURY SHARES
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised as a change in equity. 
Repurchased shares are classiﬁ ed as treasury shares and presented as a deduction from proﬁ t and loss reserves. 
BPI-100205 Accounts 2008 V5.indd   72 BPI-100205 Accounts 2008 V5.indd   72 6/4/09   13:19:35 6/4/09   13:19:35 73 FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
PROVISIONS AND CONTINGENT LIABILITIES
In accordance with FRS 12 “Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets”, provisions are recognised where there is a present obligation as a result of a past 
event, it is probable that a transfer of economic beneﬁ ts will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation. 
If these conditions are not met, no provision is recognised. However, contingent liabilities are disclosed in the Notes to the Financial Statements, unless the possibility 
of a transfer of economic beneﬁ ts is remote. Contingent gains are not recognised unless realisation of the proﬁ t is virtually certain. 
DIVIDENDS PAYABLE
Dividends payable to the Company ’s shareholders are recorded as a liability in the period in which the dividends are approved.
RETIREMENT BENEFIT OBLIGATIONS
The Company participates in a group-wide scheme, the British Polythene Pension Scheme, which has a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t section (providing beneﬁ ts based on ﬁ nal 
pensionable pay) and a deﬁ ned contribution section. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Company. The pension costs for the deﬁ ned 
contribution section are charged to the proﬁ t and loss account on the basis of contributions due in respect of the ﬁ nancial year. In relation to the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t section 
of the scheme, the Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities on a consistent and reliable basis and therefore, as required by FRS 17, 
the Company accounts for this scheme as a deﬁ ned contribution scheme. As a result, the amount charged to the proﬁ t and loss account in respect of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
section represents the contributions payable to the scheme in respect of the year.

as at 31 December 2008.
15. CONTINGENT LIABILITIES  
The Company has guaranteed the bank overdrafts of certain subsidiaries amounting at 31 December 2008 to £1 0.9 million (2007: £1 4.1 million) including interest from 
time to time thereon. The Company also has an obligation under the Group VAT registration amounting at 31 December 2008 to £2.7 million (2007: £4.3 million).  
16. SHARE-BASED PAYMENTS
The Company considers the IFRS 2 Group disclosures found at Note 30 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements to satisfy all FRS 20 disclosure requirements.  
17. PENSIONS
DEFINED CONTRIBUTION SCHEMES
The assets of the deﬁ ned contribution section of the British Polythene Pension Scheme and other deﬁ ned contribution schemes are held separately from those 
of the Group, being invested with a number of insurance companies. The pension charge includes contributions payable to the various insurance companies.
DEFINED BENEFIT SCHEME
The Company is a member of a larger group wide pension scheme providing beneﬁ ts based on pensionable pay. As the Company is unable to identify its share of 
the scheme assets and liabilities on a reliable and consistent basis, as permitted by FRS 17 “Retirement beneﬁ ts”, the scheme is accounted for as if it were a deﬁ ned 
contribution scheme. The Company made contributions of £0.2 million (2007: £0.2 million) in the year. There were no outstanding or prepaid Company contributions 
at either the beginning or the end of the ﬁ nancial year. 
The assets of the deﬁ ned beneﬁ t section are invested in a self-administered trust fund and hence are also separated from the Group’s business assets.
FRS 17 DISCLOSURES
The Company considers the IAS 1 9 Group disclosures found at Note 31 to the consolidated ﬁ nancial statements to satisfy all FRS 17 disclosure requirements.

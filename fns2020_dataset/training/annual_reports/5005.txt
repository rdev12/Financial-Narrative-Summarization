Our aims
I want DS Smith to deliver financial returns
that are sustainable and attractive to
shareholders. That means organic volume
growth in excess of GDP growth, less
cyclicality in profitability and returns, higher
margins to make the Group more financially
resilient, and consistent delivery of a return
on capital above our cost of capital. 
In order to evaluate the business, the Group
management team have first reviewed 
our current business mix and critically
considered which markets and businesses
will provide the sort of sustainable returns
that are attractive to shareholders and those
that will not. We have then considered how
we differentiate ourselves, so that we win in
the markets in which we choose to compete,
and how we match our offering with our
customers’ needs. These factors will drive
margins and produce greater resilience
across the business. Next we have
considered the efficiency and effectiveness
of the Group, including cost efficiency,
Our Strategy
“When I joined DS Smith in May 2010 I knew that it had the potential to be a
great company with much better financial returns for shareholders. Following
work with the senior management team, I explained the new strategy for the
Group in December 2010. The aim of this strategy is to make DS Smith operate
as one business and to transform the profile of our financial returns. DS Smith
will be a Group that delivers consistent growth ahead of GDP , has reduced
cyclicality, higher margins and a return on capital above our cost of capital. 
Set out over the next few pages is how we will achieve that.”
capital efficiency and the structure of our
business organisation as well as our
commercial contracts. We have further
considered the culture of the organisation
and also how to align our employees with
the tasks ahead. Finally, we have considered
how to achieve this while minimising
implementation risk.
Our focus
The Group aspires to be the leading supplier
of recycled packaging for consumer goods.
This is the area of the business that we will
seek to develop through investment of our
time and capital. 
In order to achieve this we intend to focus 
on our packaging business, particularly
building on our fast moving consumer 
goods (FMCG) customers. We will expand
our recycling business that supports and 
is integral to our recycled packaging. 
We will reduce our exposure to paper
manufacturing where it is not aligned with
packaging, and look to streamline the
Group. We will also realise significant cost
and capital efficiencies through changing
the organisational structure and ways 
of working.
The next few pages take you through each
of these themes in turn, showing why we
think that recycled packaging for consumer
goods is the right business to achieve our
aims, how we will differentiate ourselves and
the steps that we are taking to deliver the
efficiency, cultural shift and risk management
that we need.

We see sustained growth in
corrugated packaging for 
consumer goods
We believe that there is considerable
sustainable growth potential in our
corrugated packaging businesses, both in
Western Europe and in Central and Eastern
Europe. The corrugated packaging sector
has growth prospects in excess of GDP
growth. The use of retail-ready packaging is
being driven by major retailers and FMCG
companies, for whom it helps to reduce 
costs and build sales. We have identified
opportunities within the UK and France to
drive further adoption of higher quality 
retail-ready packaging and for greater use
of corrugated packaging, in substitution for
other materials that are less easily recycled.
In Central and Eastern Europe, consumption
of corrugated packaging for FMCG is
growing on the back of increased domestic
consumption, and of growing export
volumes. It is our aim to grow our businesses
in this region in absolute terms and to
increase the proportion of profits they bring
to the Group. This will be achieved by
organic growth and, where appropriate, 
by acquisition. 
Recycling gives us access to our 
raw material
Our recycling business gives us security of
supply of our essential raw material, waste
paper. This is our urban forest. The recycling
business also connects us with the end-user
of our packaging, the retailer, facilitating the
use of corrugated packaging. The model of
owning our recycling business has proved
successful in the UK and we plan to expand
it in continental Europe in conjunction with
our customers.
The Plastic Packaging business has a similar
customer base to the corrugated packaging
business and has some synergies with it. We
will continue to invest in Plastic Packaging
where appropriate. 
We will focus on our strategic
priorities
Our facilities for production of paper used
for corrugated packaging will be maintained
where integrated supply is strategically
beneficial, such as in the UK. Paper
production for external sale will be reduced.
For example, we have announced the start 
of consultation in respect of the proposed
closure of one mill in the UK (capacity 95
thousand tonnes per annum). 
Our Office Products Wholesaling business
has no synergies with the packaging
business and has the lowest margins in 
the Group. We have strengthened the
management team to realise the
opportunities to improve performance, 
in order to maximise shareholder value.
Our Strategy continued
Improving our
business mix
to drive growth, reduce cyclicality
and improve our return on capital.

Acquiring
Otor
was a signiﬁcant ﬁrst
step in improving our
business mix 
On 1 September 2010 DS Smith acquired
the business of Otor, a corrugated
packaging business with six main sites in
France and a strong FMCG customer base.
Otor has a tradition of excellent service 
and of innovation, demonstrated by the 
50 patents they hold. Otor has historically
delivered consistent high returns without
signiﬁcant cyclicality – the average return on
sales for the three years prior to acquisition
was 8.6%. Acquiring Otor was a signiﬁcant
ﬁrst step in improving our business mix, by
increasing our exposure to the attractive
FMCG market for corrugated packaging.

We will meet our customers’ high
standards for service, quality 
and innovation
We aim to differentiate our corrugated
packaging products through the service,
quality and innovation that we offer to our
customers. We will continue to invest in, and
focus on, delivering short lead times and 
high quality products. These qualities are
necessary to win and keep the high quality
but demanding FMCG customers which we
have today and which we are targeting for
the future. We aim to match the service
requirements that they are expected to
deliver to their own customer, the retailer.
We work continuously with customers to
ensure our solutions add value to, and
reduce costs in, the supply chain of which
they form a part.
High standards of service 
are essential to be a trusted 
business partner
Service is measured by the proportion of
orders that we deliver to our customer 
on-time, in-full, essential to being a trusted
business partner. This metric is now reported
on regularly by all parts of the Group. While
we have made considerable progress over
the year 2010/11, improving from 94% to
96%, we aim to continue to improve to a
97% target level in 2011/12. 
Innovation delivers solutions 
to our customers
We aim to drive sales through offering
innovative products that solve the packaging
needs of our customers. The acquisition of
Otor has accelerated this process due to the
strong legacy of innovation within Otor, with
products such as the “Otor 8” – a box with
angled corners for greater strength. In the
UK, R-Flute® was first launched in 2009 
and over the year 2010/11 we have been
marketing it to customers with considerable
success. Work is ongoing to ensure that
innovation designed in one part of the
business is effectively leveraged by the
whole organisation. R-Flute® is now being
rolled out into continental Europe to fulfil
demand from our largest customers.
By offering our customers innovative
solutions that help them cut their costs and
their carbon footprint, we aim to maintain
and build our competitive position.
We offer our customers 
sustainable solutions
We differentiate DS Smith from our
competition with our recycling proposition.
Through DS Smith Recycling, we are able to
offer a “cradle-to-cradle” service, recycling
waste packaging rather than sending it 
to landfill. We have a strong relationship 
with many of the largest retailers in the 
UK who use DS Smith Recycling to manage 
their recycling. We offer our customers 
a 24/7/365 service, making sure that
corrugated packaging fits easily in their
supply chain. The recycling proposition 
is an important point of differentiation as
consumer goods companies and retailers
seek to fulfil their environmental
commitments. It also facilitates the use 
of corrugated board as a packaging
material and secures our supply 
of this valuable resource. 
Differentiating
by adding value
and by focusing on our 
customers’ needs.
Thicker corrugated board is usually the
strongest, whilst board where the ﬂuting 
is close together gives a better surface 
for printing. DS Smith has designed and
registered a new type of corrugated board, 
R-Flute®, that delivers the best of both in 
terms of strength and print quality, ideal 
for retail-ready packaging. 
20% fewer vehicles
The Saucy Fish Co. receives more
packaging per delivery, resulting in
20% fewer vehicles on the road.
Beneﬁts:
• Packaging is 20% thinner, meaning more
packaging can be delivered per pallet and
per vehicle, with less warehousing required
– all of which saves cost and carbon in the
supply chain
• Reported improved packing line efﬁciency
• High quality print ﬁnish – attractive 
to consumers
• Better quality perforations give cleaner 
edges for an attractive retail display
Our Strategy continued
We will build our market share by delivering 
to our customers’ high standards of service,
quality and innovation in the sustainable
packaging solutions we offer.

We will drive the efficiency and
effectiveness of the business
We will be improving further the efﬁciency 
of the Group, in respect of both operations
and capital. Operational efﬁciencies will
come from a change in the structure of 
the Group, with businesses more closely
integrated to eliminate duplicate overheads
and to drive revenue growth through co-
ordinated customer management and shared
best practice in innovation. Annual cost
savings of £10 million are expected to 
be realised by April 2014 from the changes
in structure to the UK businesses, and are
expected to cost £10 million to achieve in
cash terms. We expect to deliver £3 million
of these savings in 2011/12.
There are opportunities to reduce
costs in purchasing
Further, we are targeting annual cost savings
from procurement of £10 million by April
2012, by building a central purchasing
team. Work has been underway since
January 2011 and progress is being made,
with a total of £6 million (split between
operational and capital expenditure)
expected to be delivered in 2011/12.
We are improving our capital
efficiency too
We will also improve our capital efficiency in
relation to working capital and investment.
We face a significant challenge in working
capital as rising prices increase the carrying
value of inventories and debtors. On working
capital, our targeted savings are for a
reduction in working capital as a percentage
of revenue from 8% to 5% over the three
years to April 2014, equivalent to c. £75
million. £24 million has been achieved by
30 April 2011. 
Capital investments will be made on a
strategic basis, with an emphasis on the
packaging businesses and market sectors
that have historically delivered higher and
less cyclical operating margins. 
Efﬁciency
by restructuring and 
integrating operations.
Through adopting a new structure and 
adding expertise in areas such as
procurement, we expect to make 
material savings in cost and capital
• £10 million from UK structural costs by 
April 2014
• £10 million from procurement by 
April 2012
• £75 million from working capital by 
April 2014

Becoming 
one
DS Smith 
We are re-branding those parts of the
business that have not previously used 
the DS Smith name. Severnside Recycling
has become DS Smith Recycling whilst 
St Regis has become DS Smith Paper.
Meanwhile in France, the Otor business
and existing French corrugated packaging
operations are now trading as DS Smith
Packaging France. It is now visible to 
our customers, employees and local
communities that we are one business.

We are developing our people
We are undertaking a series of steps to
improve engagement among employees 
with the corporate goals and to align our
employees with the aims of the Group. 
A new Group-wide development appraisal
programme is being rolled out so that
everyone understands the part they play in
the organisation. We have also conducted
our first Group-wide employee survey 
to understand how to develop our 
people further. 
Employees are being aligned 
with shareholders
Our people are also being offered the
opportunity to be shareholders in the Group,
with the roll-out of a Sharesave Plan to UK
employees in early 2011. There are plans 
to extend similar offers to employees in 
other regions. 
In 2010/11 DS Smith completed its first
Group-wide engagement survey, with 79% 
of employees taking the time to participate.
This is a very high level of participation for 
a first survey, which reflects the dedication
and commitment of the Group’s employees.
The engagement survey is an opportunity to
listen to the structured feedback and views 
of our employees. The results have been
analysed and communicated, and priorities
for improvement have been identified by
management teams with action plans
developed for the coming year. A further
survey will be completed in 2012 to monitor
the progress made against these plans. 
The Group has also embarked on a
programme to communicate and engage 
all its employees with the new corporate
strategy. This programme will ensure that 
all employees know the Group’s vision and
values, its strategic goals and the role they
can play.
We aim to be a great – 
and safe – place to work
Safety at work is always our first priority. 
We are delighted with the progress that has
been made this year to improve further on our
record – for example we recorded a 9%
reduction in lost time accidents and a 7%
reduction in the accident frequency rate for
the Group as a whole. The acquisition of
Otor presents us with the challenge and
opportunity to bring their safety record into
line with that of the rest of the Group.
Senior management has 
been enhanced
Senior management in the Group has been
strengthened, for example, with the creation
of the new role of Divisional Chief Executive
of the UK Packaging business, encompassing
the recycling, paper and corrugated
packaging businesses, and a Group
Procurement Officer. Senior managers 
now have a major element of their annual
remuneration linked both to profit and to
return on average capital employed in 
order to align their interests with those 
of shareholders. 
The Group Steering Team has been
established (chaired by Miles Roberts), 
to manage the progress of the Group 
as a whole.
Managing our execution risk
The execution risk associated with this
business strategy is being managed by
ensuring that our actions are rooted in 
our existing capabilities and customers.
Opportunities for investment will be critically
assessed on the basis of demand from our
existing group of customers, with care taken
that no individual customer accounts for too
large a proportion of our revenue.
Customers are at the centre 
of our new structure
We have put in place a pan-European
customer management team to ensure that
we take care of our largest customers in a
co-ordinated way across the Group. This
team comprises account executives and
senior regional managers, who work
together to ensure that these customers 
are offered a seamless service and that 
we organise our business to deliver to 
them in the most effective manner.
Developing a
winning culture,
building on our
foundations
to align our people with our strategy
and position DS Smith for the future.
Our Strategy continued
Our people are essential in the successful
implementation of the strategy. We are
working, therefore, to ensure that everyone
understands the part they play, underpinned
by a strong management team.

Chairman’ s Statement
I am delighted to report on the considerable
progress achieved during 2010/11 under
our new Group Chief Executive, Miles
Roberts, who joined on 4 May 2010.
Trading performance improved significantly,
a new and ambitious strategic vision was
set, performance measures are established
which will generate significant shareholder
value, and major corporate developments
have been delivered, not least the acquisition
of Otor in France. 
Corporate developments 
and strategy
In July 2010 we announced that DS Smith
had agreed to purchase Otor, a leading
packaging business in France. The acquisition
was completed on 1 September 2010. To
maintain prudent levels of debt, we issued
an additional 39.3 million shares at the time
of agreement. This share issue was heavily
oversubscribed and placed at a discount of
less than 1% to the opening share price on
the day. The combined operations in France
have been re-branded as DS Smith
Packaging France under a management
team drawn from both businesses. This
transaction has exceeded our expectations
both in terms of financial returns and the
support we have received from customers. 
In December 2010 Miles presented his
strategic vision for the Group to our investors.
That vision is set out in the preceding pages
of this document and will transform the
financial profile of the business. The
management team have made a strong start
in implementing the plan and the results for
the year show that this strategy is already
yielding results. The Otor acquisition, though
it pre-dated the strategic announcement, fits
squarely into the vision, as it accelerates our
leadership in corrugated packaging
solutions for consumer goods customers. 
Trading performance
The restructuring and repositioning of the 
DS Smith Group in the recent difficult years
has enabled us to benefit fully from the
recovery in the European economy. Our
focus on fast moving consumer goods
customers, central to the Group’s strategy,
has served us well as we report like-for-like
volume growth of 8% in our packaging
business for the year. This growth, together
with the benefits of tight cost control, 
resulted in an adjusted operating profit 
“The full year dividend has been increased by 
41.3%. I am confident that the coming year 
will be one of considerable further progress.”

of £136.1 million, an increase of 38.7%
year-on-year, or 20.0% excluding the benefit
of the Otor acquisition. This improvement
has been achieved despite significant input
cost increases, which we have recovered 
through pricing. Adjusted earnings 
per share rose 36.0% to 18.9 pence
(2009/10: 13.9 pence). 
Dividend
The Board considers the dividend to be an
important component of shareholder returns.
As part of the review of business strategy,
we re-defined our dividend policy to reflect
the expected change in our financial profile.
In considering dividends, the Board will be
mindful of the Group’s debt levels, earnings
growth potential and opportunities for
profitable growth. To sustain a progressive
dividend policy, the Board anticipates that
dividend cover should average 2.0 to 2.5
times through the cycle. 
Accordingly, the Board recommends a 
final dividend for the year 2010/11 of 
4.5 pence per share which, together with
the interim dividend of 2.0 pence, gives 
a total dividend for the year of 6.5 pence
(2009/10: 4.6 pence). This represents 
an increase of 41.3% over the prior year, 
a cover of 2.9 times in relation to our
adjusted earnings per share (2009/10: 
3.0 times), and is a significant first step
towards our target.
Board changes
DS Smith has a very strong Board. This
reflects the exciting potential the Company
has for growth in the coming years.
In addition to welcoming Miles Roberts, 
our Group Chief Executive, at the start 
of the financial year, we have had two 
other Board changes. We are delighted 
that Gareth Davis joined the Board on 
1 June 2010, having previously been 
Chief Executive of Imperial Tobacco PLC
from 1996 to 2010. He also is Chairman 
of Wolseley plc and of William Hill PLC. 
As expected, he has brought a great deal 
of vigour as well as highly relevant
experience to the Board discussions.
Bob Beeston retired from the Board in
December 2010 having served for ten
years, for much of that period as Senior
Independent Director. I would like to thank
him for his ceaseless challenge and support. 
I am also pleased to congratulate another
non-Executive Director, Philippe Mellier, 
on his appointment as Group Chief
Executive Officer of De Beers. 
After ten years as our Company Secretary,
Carolyn Cattermole will be leaving the
Group on 30 June 2011. I would like to
thank her for the tremendous support she 
has given the Board and particularly me
over these years and wish her well in her
future career. I am pleased to report that
Matthew Jowett will be joining the Group 
as Company Secretary and General
Counsel, taking over the role from 
1 July 2011. He brings substantial
international and business experience 
and we look forward to working with him. 
Finally, on behalf of the Board, I would 
like to thank all our colleagues across the
business for their continued hard work and
commitment. It has been their support for 
our efforts to recover rising input costs and
sustain growth by focusing on delivering 
the service, quality and innovation our
customers demand that has enabled us 
to deliver our profit performance. 
I am confident that the coming year will 
be one of considerable further progress.

Operating Review
Group Chief Executive’s Statement
Overview 
In the year to 30 April 2011 DS Smith grew revenue by 19.5%
(10.0% excluding Otor, the French corrugated packaging business
acquired on 1 September 2010), improved adjusted operating
profit margin by 80bps to 5.5% (2009/10: 4.7%) and increased
adjusted operating profit by 38.7% (20.0% excluding Otor) 
to £136.1 million (2009/10: £98.1 million). 
The Group increased its market share in its key markets and recovered
rising input costs in line with our expectations. This progress was
achieved by focusing on what matters to our customers – service,
quality and innovation – and relentless attention to pricing for input
cost recovery.
This has also been a year of significant change for the business,
with initiation of our new strategy – to become the leading supplier
of recycled packaging for consumer goods – in December 2010
and the acquisition of Otor. With this acquisition we are now the
leading supplier of corrugated packaging for fast moving consumer
goods (FMCG) customers in France. Otor has also brought with it a
number of patented innovations that are now being offered to our
customers throughout the Group. 
The Group was strongly cash generative in the year, with free 
cash flow of £100.7 million (2009/10: £76.8 million). Net debt
increased by £111.5 million to £351.0 million (2009/10: 
£239.5 million) due to expenditure of £203.2 million to purchase
Otor (including acquired net debt), partly offset by strong operating
cash flow and funds raised through the issue of equity in July 2010.
I am very pleased to report that the Group’s adjusted return on
average capital employed (ROACE) increased substantially in
2010/11 to 12.7% (2009/10: 10.1%), exceeding the Group’s
estimated cost of capital of around 11.0% on the current business
mix. This reflects the improved profitability of the Group and a
significant focus on capital management. Divisional management
now have their remuneration aligned to return on capital measures
as well as to profit.
Delivery against our strategic goals
In December 2010 I set out our strategy to become the leading
supplier of recycled packaging for consumer goods, and the
resultant expected improvement in our medium-term financial
performance. I am pleased that these results demonstrate an
encouraging first step towards our financial goals. I also said that
we would deliver our strategy through focusing on improving our
business mix, differentiating ourselves from our competition, and 
at the same time concentrating on our efficiency, culture and
implementation risk management.

I have been pleased with the progress we have already made on
implementing our strategy over the year.
With regard to business mix, the biggest change has been the
acquisition of Otor, which transforms our focus on FMCG customers in
continental Europe and raises the proportion of revenue from FMCG
customers across the packaging business. Our recycling business,
another key area for growth, has made considerable progress
developing its activities organically in the UK and undertaking
preparatory work in Central and Eastern Europe, in advance of
further expansion. Our capital expenditure has been applied in line
with our strategy, with 80% of our net capital expenditure spent in
either packaging or recycling.
We have also made progress in reducing our involvement in non-
integrated paper manufacturing, which is also part of our strategy 
to change our business mix. As previously announced, we plan to
reduce our net capacity by c. 250 thousand tonnes per annum. 
We are making progress on this objective and have announced 
the commencement of consultation regarding the proposal that we 
close a UK paper mill and make an investment in our Kemsley Mill,
with capital expenditure in line with depreciation, to make high
performance papers to support our growing recycled retail-ready
packaging offering across Europe. Together, these proposed changes
would reduce output by approximately 95 thousand tonnes per
annum whilst maintaining Kemsley’s position as one of the most
efficient production sites across Europe, offering leading standards
of service, quality and innovation.
The Group has focused on its customer differentiation over the year,
with customer service, as measured by the proportion of orders
delivered on-time, in-full (OTIF), now a key performance measure for
all parts of the Group. While many parts of the Group were already
providing excellent service, considerable focus has been given to
this area resulting in our Group average OTIF now standing at 96%,
up 2% from 94% at the end of the prior year. We believe that this
focus on customer service has been instrumental in growing our
packaging volumes ahead of growth in the market as a whole.
The Otor acquisition has broadened the range of innovative designs
we are able to offer as Otor brings with it 50 patents and 10 licences.
Our UK business has its own innovative packaging products and
materials, most notably R-Flute®, a thinner corrugated board ideal
for retail-ready packaging. We have begun the work to integrate our
innovation know-how to leverage it across the Group. Corrugating
equipment to manufacture R-Flute® is now being rolled out in
continental Europe. 
In terms of efficiency, we are on target to deliver the planned cost
savings, as previously announced, totalling £20 million (£10 million
per annum by 30 April 2014, from improving the effectiveness of
the UK operations and £10 million per annum by 30 April 2012
from co-ordinated procurement). In the current year 2011/12 we
expect to see a £3 million benefit from UK efficiency savings 
and a £6 million benefit from procurement (split equally between
operational expenditure and capital expenditure). We are also 
now able to increase our estimate of the cost savings we expect
from the Otor acquisition from our original estimate of €9.3 million
to €13.0 million (currently equivalent to £11.6 million), and we
expect those savings to be delivered by April 2013, one year 
earlier than originally expected. With regard to capital efficiency, 
as at 30 April 2011 we had achieved an improvement in working
capital of c. £24 million. 
Our actions to reduce cyclicality in our profits and margins, through
changes to our pricing review periods within customer contracts,
have progressed to plan. The average price renewal period in the
UK and continental Europe, excluding Otor, is now at four months,
down from six months, meaning that we can recover rising input
costs more promptly. We expect to make continued progress on 
this as contracts come up for renewal.
Whilst I am pleased with the progress to date, I believe that there 
is substantially further to go to realise the full potential of the Group.
Over the coming year, I plan to focus further on business mix –
building the recycled packaging business in our target regions 
and reducing non-core activities. The actions to improve our
differentiation through service, quality and innovation are now
underway and we continue to pay significant attention to pricing 
to recover rising costs. On efficiency, engaging our people and risk
management, I have been very encouraged by the first steps and
expect further ideas for improvement to arise as our management
teams develop their work in these areas.
Our people
DS Smith employs dedicated, skilled, hard-working people and 
I have been delighted with the effort and commitment shown in 
the past year by our employees. We have put in place this year 
a number of programmes to support the development of our people 
to fulfil their potential, such as appraisal and talent management
programmes. We have undertaken an extensive two-way
communication programme to explain our goals and to listen to 
the issues faced by our employees in delivering to our customers.
The feedback from this has been very constructive. I would like 
to thank them all for their efforts.
Outlook
The strong momentum in the business seen at the end of the prior
year is continuing into the current financial year, where trading has
started very well. The Group expects to continue to make further
significant progress towards its financial objectives in the financial
year 2011/12, with our confidence in the future reflected in the
decision of the Board to increase the dividend by 41.3%. This
progress is driven by the successful integration of Otor combined
with the continued implementation of our proven strategy.

Packaging
The market for corrugated packaging in Europe grew 3% year-on-
year (Source: FEFCO (European Federation of Corrugated Board
Manufacturers), year to 31 March 2011) with growth in the UK
market being 1% for the same period. We have been able to grow
ahead of the market due to our strategy of focusing on recycled
packaging for FMCG customers.
Volume growth of 8% across the packaging businesses (excluding
the impact of Otor) was achieved through our approach to winning
and retaining business by delivering high levels of customer service,
quality and innovation which enabled us to gain new customers and
expand our position with existing customers. 
Increases in input costs have been substantial, with, for example, 
the market price of recovered fibre rising year-on-year by 75%. 
Our total input costs in the Packaging business have increased 
26% year-on-year, and we have raised prices to recover these 
costs. Our profit performance, with improved return on sales margins,
demonstrates the discipline that has been employed in cost recovery
and the mix benefit from the higher proportion of FMCG business.
We have been successful in recovering our costs due to the
constructive commercial relationships we have with our customers,
where our ability to meet their high standards has been instrumental
in differentiating our packaging offering. 
UK Packaging
Our UK Packaging operations, which include our recycling business,
UK paper manufacturing and our UK corrugated packaging
businesses, have delivered revenue growth of 22.3%, driven by
volume growth as well as pricing to recover rising costs. The resilience
and growth demonstrated by our FMCG customers has provided an
attractive market, which we have targeted with our focus on service,
quality and innovation.

Award Winning
Packaging
Cadbury Nibbles
DS Smith together with customer Cadbury won 
the Retail-Ready Packaging award at the UK
Packaging Awards in November 2010 for the
Cadbury Nibbles box. The judging panel said 
it was “a perfect example of how retail-ready
packaging benefits the brand, supermarket 
and, importantly, the consumer”.
For example, this year has seen the successful commercialisation 
of the innovative R-Flute® design, offering our customers optimised
performance whilst minimising material content and thickness, with
commensurate savings in transportation and storage costs. Some 
of our major customers have converted entirely to R-Flute®. The UK
corrugated packaging business has maintained its high levels of
customer service, which has enabled us to expand our position 
with key customers. 
In the recycling business, annual sales volumes grew 5.5% on the
previous year. During 2010/11, we gained additional business 
from an existing large retail customer such that we are now their sole
collector of fibre in the UK; this position was won due to our service
and our carbon impact analysis tool. We are currently working with 
a number of our large retail customers to deliver front-of-store recycling
collection services; again, we won this business due to our
commitment to high standards of service. 
The UK paper business has given significant attention to improving 
its service levels, with their OTIF performance increasing substantially
over the course of the year. The business has also invested in
improving its customer management procedures. The paper
business has seen good year-on-year progression, particularly 
at our major plant at Kemsley. 
The UK Packaging business has undergone structural change in the
year with the recycling, paper and corrugated packaging businesses
now all managed as a single enterprise in order to support the
corrugated packaging activities. The recycling business is now
rebranded as DS Smith Recycling (formerly Severnside Recycling) 
and the paper business is now DS Smith Paper (formerly St Regis). 
The UK Packaging business is run by a new Divisional Chief Executive
who is leading a programme to make the UK operations more
effective and cost efficient, with a target to achieve £10 million 
annual savings from improved effectiveness by April 2014.
Adjusted operating profit margin in the UK Packaging business
increased 100bps to 5.9% (2009/10: 4.9%) and adjusted operating
profit increased 46.5% to £54.2 million (2009/10: £37.0 million).
ROACE improved to 10.3% (2009/10: 6.9%) reflecting both
improved profitability and a reduction in working capital. 
Looking ahead to 2011/12, we are confident that our chosen target
market of FMCG customers will remain resilient. Collaborative action
within our business will deliver further innovation, closely aligned to
our customers’ needs. For example, adaptation of Otor’s extensive
range of design and technology will offer valuable new options for
UK customers. Our recycling business expects to expand further
overseas and we expect to extend our coverage to customers in
France, Hungary and Poland over the course of the financial year.
51271_p16-22_vAW.qxp_Layout 1  04/07/2011  22:26  Page 19 20 www.dssmith.uk.com DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2011
Revenue for the period was up 68.7% (up 13.2% excluding the 
eight months’ contribution from Otor), and volumes were up 8.7%
year-on-year, excluding the contribution from Otor. Pricing increased
to recover rising input costs. Our service levels remained consistently
high, facilitating our ability to recover costs promptly. 
Otor was acquired on 1 September 2010 and the two principal 
DS Smith corrugated packaging sites previously owned in France 
are now combined with the six principal sites from Otor, run as one
business under the name DS Smith Packaging France. In the eight
months of ownership, Otor delivered an adjusted operating profit
margin of 9.4% and an annualised return on invested capital 
(being the return on the consideration paid plus debt assumed on
acquisition) of 13.6%. The integration is now expected to deliver 
cost savings of €13.0 million (estimated at €9.3 million at the time 
of acquisition) by April 2013 (currently equivalent to £11.6 million
and £8.3 million respectively). €3 million (£2.7 million equivalent)
has been delivered in the financial year 2010/11 and we are
confident of delivering the targeted savings in full.
Whilst the acquisition due diligence had led us to expect some
commercial synergies, we have been very pleased by the 
commercial response and pace of synergies, with existing 
Otor customers now buying from the wider DS Smith network, and
with DS Smith customers expanding their position with us in France. 
In Poland and Italy we have invested in printing machinery to deliver
higher value-added products, and these businesses have continued to
deliver strong returns in the year. In Ukraine, where we operate as
part of a joint venture, volume and revenue growth has been good
with effective cost recovery, due to a mix of improved performance
from local customers and from servicing international customers. 
Adjusted operating profit margin of the division is up 10bps 
due to the mix benefit of Otor, partially offset by the usual c. three
month delay in cost recovery in some parts of the business. Adjusted
operating profit increased 72.3% and ROACE is up 50bps to
12.5% due to the mix benefit of Otor.
Looking ahead to 2011/12, we expect to see continued pressure
on costs and consequently will continue to seek to recover these,
securing our position with customers by the excellent service and
innovative solutions that we offer. We will also be rolling out further
innovation with corrugators in France now equipped to make 
R-Flute® and there are plans to extend this capacity to our
operations in Poland.

Revenue grew 4.7% and adjusted operating profits increased by
1.8% year-on-year. Excluding the disposal of the Demes business in
January 2010, revenue grew 11.0% and adjusted operating profit
grew 8.6%. Revenue growth was driven by volume growth of 9.4%,
and price increases to cover rising input costs. The business has grown
its volumes through a focus on commercialising its innovative products,
marketed at the retail, FMCG and fast-food sectors. For example,
the LP&D business has brought out a number of new products, such
as bag and tap solutions for serving beverages, which has driven
sales to existing key customers. The returnable transit packaging
business has continued to make consistent progress, benefiting from
prior year cost reductions and commercialisation of a new innovative
mobile pallet solution for retailers. The adjusted operating profit
margin remained high at 7.0% and ROACE is excellent at 14.9%

Financial Review
Overview
The Group has achieved a strong financial performance despite 
an environment of significant input cost pressures. The results reflect
the success of our pricing strategy to recover increased input costs
faster and incorporate the eight months’ results from the acquisition
of Otor. Excluding Otor, our underlying adjusted operating profit
(excluding amortisation and exceptional items) increased by £19.5
million compared to 2009/10. Otor generated adjusted operating
profit of €21.7 million with a return on sales of 9.4% and an
annualised return on invested capital of 13.6%. Free cash flow was
higher than in 2009/10 due to improved management of working
capital despite the impact of price increases and higher volumes.
Trading results
The Group’s trading results for the year to 30 April 2011 are
summarised in Table 1.
The major drivers of the 2010/11 results were: improved
performance in our UK Packaging businesses, the acquisition of
Otor in September 2010, and an improvement in performance 
from the Office Products Wholesaling segment.
Revenue for the financial year ended 30 April 2011 increased by
19.5% compared with the prior year; it was 15.3% higher in the first
half of the year and 23.5% higher in the second half. Excluding the
effect of the acquisition of Otor, revenue was up 10.0% on 2009/10.
Adjusted Group operating profit in 2010/11 increased by £38.0
million. UK Packaging was up by £17.2 million at £54.2 million,
whilst Continental European Corrugated Packaging increased 
by £16.7 million to £39.8 million, of which Otor accounted for
£18.5 million offset by the loss of profit from the disposal of the
Group’s business in Turkey. This performance was supported by
Plastic Packaging which increased operating profit by £0.3 million
to £16.9 million, and Office Products Wholesaling which was 
£3.8 million ahead of last year at £25.2 million. The Group’s
adjusted return on sales increased by 80 basis points to 5.5%. 
We have delivered strong volume growth,
despite increasing prices to recover rising input
costs. Our returns are improving and Otor is
performing well.
The Group’s adjusted pre-tax return on capital employed (which is
defined as the adjusted operating profit divided by the average capital
employed) increased from 10.1% in 2009/10 to 12.7% in 2010/11,
above the Group’s estimated pre-tax cost of capital of 11.0%. The
increase in the Group’s return on capital employed reflected higher
returns in 2010/11 across all of our business segments.
Exceptional items
The Group recorded net exceptional gains before tax of £1.2 million
during the year (2009/10: charge of £13.3 million). A curtailment
gain primarily arising from the closure of the UK defined benefit
pension scheme of £35.3 million has been recorded as 
exceptional income.
Restructuring costs were £8.4 million. Impairments included the
impairment of the carrying value of fixed and intangible assets within
UK Packaging of £14.3 million on certain under-performing assets
and the impairment of intangible assets within Plastic Packaging 
of £1.6 million. 
Costs related to the acquisition of Otor were treated as exceptional
items amounted to £7.2 million. The disposal of the Group’s business
in Turkey and the sale of certain small packaging businesses in the
UK resulted in a net loss of £2.6 million.
Operating profit after exceptional items was £129.4 million
(2009/10: £80.7 million).
Interest, tax and earnings per share 
Net interest expense increased from £14.4 million in 2009/10 
to £19.8 million in 2010/11, mainly reflecting increased net debt
following the Otor acquisition. The employment benefit net finance
expense, which is a non-cash item, was £7.4 million (2009/10:
£11.5 million), reflecting a lower opening deficit on the defined
benefit schemes. For 2011/12, due to the reduction in liabilities
following the closure of the UK pension scheme to future accrual, 
it is anticipated that there will be a further decrease in the
employment benefit finance charge to c. £3.0 million. 
In 2008/09 the Group took the decision to impair fully its
investment in Rubezhansk, the Group’s associate business in
Ukraine. Consequently, the Group has not recorded any income 
in respect of profit achieved by the business. Negotiations are
continuing between Rubezhansk and lenders regarding the
restructuring of Rubezhansk’s US$80 million loan. There is 
no recourse to the Group for the loan held by Rubezhansk. 
Adjusted profit before tax (excluding amortisation and exceptional
items) was £108.9 million (2009/10: £72.4 million). Profit before
tax after amortisation and exceptional items was £102.2 million
(2009/10: £55.0 million). 
The Group’s effective tax rate, excluding exceptional items and
associates, at 28.2%, was higher than the previous year’s rate of
26.1% mainly as a result of higher profits arising in France. A tax
credit on exceptional items of £2.7 million resulted from tax
allowances for restructuring costs, and a tax credit of £4.1 million
for asset impairment. The curtailment gain on the closure of the
pension scheme gave rise to a £9.8 million exceptional tax charge. 
Adjusted basic earnings per share were 18.9 pence (2009/10:
13.9 pence). Basic earnings per share were 16.6 pence 
(2009/10: 9.7 pence).

Dividend
The proposed final dividend is 4.5 pence (2009/10: 3.1 pence),
giving a total dividend for the year of 6.5 pence (2009/10: 4.6
pence). Dividend cover before amortisation and exceptional items
was 2.9 times in 2010/11 (2009/10: 3.0 times). After amortisation
and exceptional items, the dividend was covered 2.6 times
(2009/10: 2.1 times). 
Cash flow 
The Group generated free cash flow of £100.7 million (2009/10:
£76.8 million). Adjusted EBITDA rose by £40.8 million to £206.8
million. Despite the increases in prices of paper, energy and boxes,
our tight control of working capital resulted in a working capital
cash inflow of £7.6 million (2009/10: outflow of £2.4 million).
Given the increase in revenue of £207 million, excluding
acquisitions and disposals, the expected working capital impact
would have been, at an average working capital to revenue of 
8%, an outflow of £16.6 million. Therefore, the working capital
inflow represents a productivity improvement of £24.2 million. 
Cash generated from operations (before exceptional items) 
was £191.4 million (2009/10: £153.9 million). 
Capital expenditure payments were £66.6 million (2009/10:
£52.6 million). Net interest paid at £15.6 million was £0.6 million
lower than 2009/10, mainly due to timing of interest payments. 
Tax payments were £18.6 million (2009/10: £21.3 million).
Acquisitions included the acquisition of the Otor Group for 
£203.2 million (including net debt acquired). Also during the year
the Group disposed of its subsidiary Çopikas in Turkey, and a small
UK packaging business. 
Cash dividend cover, defined as free cash flow divided by dividends
declared for the year, was 3.6 times, down from 4.3 times in
2009/10. 
The cash outflow in respect of exceptional costs was £17.0 million
(including cash outflows related to exceptional charges made 
in 2009/10), compared with a cash outflow of £18.4 million 
in 2009/10. 
In respect of pension payments, the contributions into the UK
Group pension scheme were £30.1 million in 2010/11
(2009/10: £15.6 million) comprising £15.6 million in respect 
of the historical agreed annual contributions, and an additional
one-off payment of £14.5 million, in respect of the agreed new
contribution to the pension scheme deficit, following agreement
with the trustees to close the UK Group pension scheme and for
the future financing of the pension scheme. 
Overall, the Group had an increase in net debt of £111.5 million
compared to a reduction in net debt of £52.0 million in 2009/10.
Financial position 
Shareholders’ funds totalled £586.3 million at 30 April 2011, 
up from £474.8 million at 30 April 2010, due to the increase in
share capital and profit for the year in excess of dividends. Net
assets per share were 138.3 pence (30 April 2010: 121.0 pence).
The profit attributable to the shareholders was £70.1 million
(2009/10: £37.9 million) and dividends of £22.6 million
(2009/10: £12.9 million) were paid during the year. In addition,
actuarial gains of £14.4 million on the Group’s defined benefit
pension schemes were credited to reserves through the

exceptional items) was 1.6 times (2009/10: 1.4 times). This
includes a full year for EBITDA from Otor, as specified in the
Group’s borrowing agreements.
The Group’s banking covenants for the syndicated loan and the
private placements specify an Adjusted Interest Cover of not less
than 3.0 times, a maximum ratio of net debt to EBITDA of 3.25
times and net assets to be in excess of £360 million. The covenant
calculations exclude from the income statement exceptional items
and the net interest income/charge arising from the defined benefit
pension schemes. The calculation of net assets excludes the net asset
or liability arising from the defined benefit pension schemes. As at
30 April 2011, the most sensitive covenant is the Adjusted Interest
Cover and this had an Adjusted Profit headroom of £84.0 million
(30 April 2010: £56.6 million). 
Energy costs 
The high level of energy costs continued to be a significant factor for
the Group in 2010/11. The Group’s total costs for gas, electricity
and diesel fuel increased from c. £109 million in 2009/10 to 
c. £126 million in 2010/11. The Group continued with its strategy 
of hedging energy costs with suppliers and financial institutions, 
the purpose of which is to reduce the volatility of energy costs and
provide the Group with a degree of certainty over future energy costs.
Capital structure and treasury management 
The Group funds its operations from the following sources of cash:
operating cash flow, borrowing, shareholders’ equity and disposals
of peripheral businesses where appropriate. The Group’s objective
is to achieve a capital structure that results in an appropriate cost 
of capital whilst providing flexibility in immediate and medium-term
funding so as to accommodate material investments or acquisitions.
The Group also aims to maintain a strong balance sheet and to
provide continuity of financing by having a range of maturities 
and borrowing from a variety of sources. 
The Group’s overall treasury objectives are to ensure sufficient funds
are available for the Group to carry out its strategy and to manage
financial risks. The Group’s treasury strategy is controlled through
the Treasury Committee, which meets regularly and includes the
Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director, the Group
Financial Controller and the Group Treasurer. The Group Treasury
function operates in accordance with policies and procedures
approved by the Board and controlled by the Group Treasurer. 
The function arranges funding for the Group, provides a service 
to operations and implements strategies for interest rate, foreign
exchange and energy exposure management. 
The Group’s main borrowing facilities are shown in Table 3. At 
30 April 2011, the Group’s total committed borrowing facilities
were £727.4 million. The total gross borrowings (including the
impact of cross-currency swaps) drawn under all these facilities at
the year end was £422.1 million. At 30 April 2011, the Group’s
borrowing facilities had a weighted-average maturity of four years
and two months.

The major treasury risks to which the Group is exposed relate to
movements in interest and foreign exchange rates and volatility 
of market prices for energy. The overall objective of the Treasury
function is to control these exposures whilst striking an appropriate
balance between mitigating risks and controlling costs. Financial
instruments, including derivatives, may be used in implementing
hedging strategies but the speculative use of financial instruments,
including derivatives, is not permitted.
The Group manages the risks associated with its purchases of energy
in the UK through its Energy Procurement Group, which operates

Financial Review continued
under the oversight of the Treasury Committee. UK purchases of
energy represent the significant majority of the Group’s overall
energy costs.
The Treasury Committee regularly reviews the Group’s exposure to
interest rates and considers whether to borrow on fixed or floating
terms. Fixed-rate borrowing, taking into account the effect of related
swaps, comprised 58% of total borrowing at 30 April 2011 
(30 April 2010: 44%). 
The Group has a net investment in major overseas subsidiary
companies’ foreign currency assets and liabilities, in particular 
those whose functional currency is the euro. The Group’s policy is 
to hedge a large part of the resulting exposure to movements in
foreign currency rates, by means of debt in the same currency, to 
a level determined by the Treasury Committee. The overseas net
assets hedged through euro borrowing increased from 76% at 
30 April 2010 to 87% at 30 April 2011, as a proportion of 
the Group’s euro net investment. 
The Group’s foreign currency debt may be put in place either 
in the currency itself or through the use of cross-currency swaps 
on differently denominated borrowing. The Group applies hedge
accounting under IAS 39, ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and
Measurement’, to its hedges of its net investment of foreign currency
subsidiaries and records exchange differences arising on the net
investments and the related foreign currency borrowing directly 
in equity. In addition, the Group’s operations make product sales
and purchases of raw materials in foreign currencies; here, cash
flow hedges are taken out to reduce the risk associated with 
these transactions.
Impairment 
When applying IAS 36, ‘Impairment of Assets’, the Group
compares the carrying amounts of goodwill and intangible assets
with the higher of their net realisable value and their value in 
use to determine whether an impairment exists. The value in 
use is calculated by discounting the future cash flows expected 
to be generated by the assets or group of assets being tested for
impairment. At the year-end, a series of tests were undertaken to
determine whether there had been any impairment to the balance
sheet carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets. The
key assumptions behind the calculations can be found in note 10 
to the financial statements. In summary, the tests indicated that the
goodwill and other intangible assets of certain small packaging
businesses within the UK Packaging and Plastic Packaging segments
required impairment by £2.2 million. A further impairment of 
£1.2 million against research and development assets was 
recorded within Plastic Packaging. 
An impairment of £10.8 million has been made to the fixed assets
of certain under-performing paper-making facilities in order to reflect
the estimated reduction in the useful economic life of these assets.
Additionally, an impairment of £1.7 million has been made to the
fixed assets of a small under-performing packaging business in the UK.
These costs were recorded as exceptional items and in total
comprised impairments against intangible assets of £3.4 million 
and £12.5 million charged to property, plant and equipment. Whilst
the Board considers that its assumptions are realistic, it is possible
that impairment would be identified if any of the key assumptions
were changed significantly. The net book value of goodwill and
other intangibles at 30 April 2011 was £344.8 million (30 April
2010: £221.2 million). 
Approximately 45% of the carrying value of the Group’s goodwill 
is allocated to UK Packaging, and 39% to Continental European
Corrugated Packaging.
Note 10 to the financial statements sets out additional information
regarding the Group’s annual impairment exercise including the
details of the carrying value headroom for the key cash-generating
units that hold goodwill, together with sensitivity analysis. 
Pensions
IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’, requires the Group to make assumptions
including, but not limited to, future asset returns, rates of inflation,
discount rates and current and future life expectancies. The use of
different assumptions could have a material effect on the accounting
values of the relevant assets and liabilities, which in turn could 
result in a change to the cost of such liabilities as recognised in 
the income statement over time. The assumptions involved are
subject to periodic review. 
The Group operates one defined benefit pension scheme in the UK,
and also has some small overseas arrangements. The aggregate
gross assets of the schemes at 30 April 2011 were £731.5 million
and the gross liabilities at 30 April 2011, calculated under IAS 19,
were £879.0 million, resulting in the recognition of a gross balance
sheet deficit of £147.5 million (30 April 2010: £203.1 million), 
a net deficit of £111.8 million (30 April 2010: £146.1 million) 
after the establishment of a deferred tax asset of £35.7 million 
(30 April 2010: £57.0 million). The decrease in the gross balance
sheet deficit of £55.6 million was principally due the curtailment
gain of £35.3 million arising from the closure of the UK scheme 
to future accrual, and the actuarial gain of £40.0 million from 
the change of indexation for future pensions from using the retail
price index to using the consumer price index.
In order to better control the future financial obligations of these
schemes, the Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme was
closed to future accrual on 30 April 2011. The current service cost
in 2010/11, amounted to £7.6 million compared with £6.7 million
in 2009/10. The Group’s annual cash contributions to the main UK
scheme were £30.1 million including the service cost of £7.6 million
(2009/10: £15.6 million). A triennial valuation of the main UK
scheme was carried out as at 30 April 2010. The Group has
agreed that cash contributions will in future be £14.8 million per
annum, rising by 2% per annum for the remaining 10 years, with 
a view to closing the deficit within a 10 year recovery period.
Note 25 to the financial statements sets out additional information
regarding the Group’s pension and post-retirement benefits.

Risk Management
The Group has various risks, both external and internal, which could
have a material impact on its performance. The Group’s exposure is
mitigated to some extent by the range of geographies and markets
served that constitute the business of the Group, and by the broad
customer base. The principal Group-wide risks, their impact on the
Group and how we mitigate those risks, are set out below. 
There are further references to risks faced by the Group, in the
Financial Review, Corporate Governance section and in the Notes
to the Consolidated Financial Statements of this report. The Group
seeks to mitigate insurable risks through an insurance programme
that covers property and liability risks where it is relevant and cost-
effective to do so. 
In 2010/11 the Group spent c. £925 million on purchasing paper, plastics
and other raw materials. The Group also spent c. £126 million on energy.
These costs have increased substantially over the prior year, and to date the
Group has largely recovered these costs in pricing, typically with the usual
three to six month delay depending on the business. However, in the event
that, due to competitor behaviour or other factors, DS Smith were unable to
recover further price increases on a similar time-scale, the profitability of the
Group would be substantially reduced.
The Group is seeking to improve the speed with which we are contractually
able to recover input costs, by bringing the UK contract structures, typically
with six month price-review periods, in line with our continental European
operations which operate on a three month price-review structure. We also
seek to differentiate our packaging through a focus on adding value to our
customers’ supply chains by focusing on service, quality and innovation. A
description of our exposure to energy costs specifically is given later in this
Risk Management section. 
The Group aims to grow through a combination of organic investment and
acquisition. Were the Group not to be able to find suitable acquisition targets
available at prices that enable the Group to achieve its strategic return on
capital targets, or were the Group unable to integrate the acquired
businesses effectively, this could curtail the growth of the Group. 
The management team of DS Smith is being developed with additional
resource, both from within the Group and externally, dedicated to acquisition
and integration activities. There is considerable experience of this work
within the senior team, gained both within the Group and from their 
previous roles.
Acquisition risk 
The Group has committed facilities of £727 million (30 April 2010: 
£566.5 million) of which, as at 30 April 2011, £422 million was drawn
down. The average interest rate paid in 2010/11 was 5.1%. Were events,
either specific to DS Smith, or to the financial systems externally, to mean that
capital was not available at competitive rates, this could have a material
impact on the profitability of the Group. A one percentage point change 
in the interest rate paid by the Group would increase interest costs by 
c. £4 million. 
The average term of the facilities committed is 4.2 years and 58% of the
Group’s debt is at fixed rates for a period of 12 months or more. The 
Group sources its debt finance from a mixture of private placements with
institutional investors and bank debt from a syndicate of seven institutions.
The counterparty risk is carefully monitored such that the failure of one lender
would not materially impact on the Group’s access to capital. Cash deposits
are placed with institutions with credit rating A or above. In countries where
this is not possible, deposits are held with strong local banks.

Availability and volatile pricing of raw materials
The Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme is sensitive to a number of
key factors: the value of the assets, the discount rate used to calculate the
scheme’s liabilities (based on corporate bond yields) and the mortality
assumptions for the members of the scheme. The tri-ennial valuation of the
Group’s various pension schemes as at 30 April 2010, of which the UK
scheme makes up the largest proportion, estimated the deficit of the schemes
to be £147.5 million. While the UK scheme is now closed to future accrual,
changes in these assumptions could mean that the deficit increases further.
On 30 April 2011 the Group’s UK defined benefit pension scheme closed to
future accrual. This decision was taken by the trustees in light of the growing
deficit of the scheme and the trustees’ responsibility to safeguard the accrued
benefits to existing members. The Group also reached agreement with the
trustees for a profile of future payments to repay the deficit, being annual
payments of £14.8 million starting in 2011/12, increasing by 2% per
annum, for ten years plus an initial payment of £14.5 million in 2010/11 
in addition to a pre-agreed top-up payment of £8.0 million.

Risk Management continued
The Group’s exposure to energy costs is set out in the Financial Review in this
Annual Report. The most significant energy risk relates to the purchase of gas
in the UK, where a 10 pence per therm increase represents an increase in
operating costs of £10 million.
The Group aims to mitigate its exposure to energy costs by a combination of
diversifying away from fossil fuels and, where this is not possible, through
long-term purchasing strategies. 
The Group is looking to maximise in-house energy generation from its
combined heat and power (CHP) plants in the UK and France. We are 
also taking steps, in partnership with E.ON and Wheelebrator, to develop 
a waste-to-energy plant on the site of our paper mill at Kemsley. This is going
through the planning processes at present. The Group has a range of energy
efficiency programmes in place. 
The Group operates a centralised approach to purchasing energy in the 
UK and France. The impact of energy costs is managed through the use 
of long-term contracts and through hedging techniques. The Group monitors
its hedging instruments to ensure that it is not overly reliant upon any 
single counterparty. 
Energy costs
Were a material environmental incident to occur at a DS Smith site, this could
result in material financial costs and reputational damage that could
undermine our commercial position as a provider of environmental solutions.
As set out in the Corporate Responsibility Review section of this Annual Report,
the Group has detailed processes in place at all sites to ensure that, as a
minimum, we comply with all relevant environmental rules and regulations. 
Environmental risks
The profitability of the Group is sensitive to the volume, the mix of sales and
product pricing. Over the last three years, the market has proved volatile,
and visibility at some points has been limited. A 5% reduction in corrugated
packaging volumes across the Group would theoretically result in a fall in
Group operating profit by around £25 million, to the extent not mitigated by
cost control.
In the event of falling demand, the Group would take prompt action to
address its cost base. Further, the strategy of the Group is to focus on
developing packaging for fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) as this
sector has historically shown substantially less volatility in demand during
periods of economic downturn, than industrial users of packaging. 
Fall in demand
Approximately 50% of the Group’s revenue and 30% of the Group’s
operating profit is derived from its operations in the UK. Were the economy
in the UK to return to recession, the profitability of the Group could be
adversely impacted.
The Group is expanding in continental Europe, notably with the acquisition
of Otor on 1 September 2010, which substantially strengthens the Group in
France. As set out above, the Group is also focused on FMCG customers,
who have historically experienced less volatility in demand for their products
than some other industry sectors. 
UK concentration
DS Smith is the largest producer of corrugated case material (CCM) in 
the UK, and also the largest producer of corrugated packaging. In the event
of material new paper production capacity being installed by our competitors,
this could impact the market for CCM, which is largely a commoditised product,
which could in turn influence pricing in the corrugated packaging market. 
We aim to develop long-standing relationships with our customers based on
the value that we add to their supply chain, and to differentiate DS Smith by
the service, quality and innovation that we offer. DS Smith has also expanded
its business in continental Europe by the acquisition of Otor in France and
has a strategy to expand further in continental Europe, therefore diluting our
exposure to the UK market. We are also implementing plans to reduce our
costs in the UK Packaging division and to improve procurement.

While the Group has a broad base of customers, the loss of, or financial
failure of, one or more of the Group’s key customers may have a material
impact on the results in a particular segment and result in a significant loss 
of future business.
We closely monitor credit risk across our customer base. The potential impact
of the loss of a customer or their financial failure is limited as no single customer
represents more than 2% of the Group’s revenue. 
Like most businesses, the Group depends on its IT systems and controls for
the management of its operations. Were these to fail for a material length 
of time, this could disrupt the Group from transacting its business. We operate
128 sites, ranging in size from 5 to c. 600 employees. Were an incident
such as a fire to happen at a major site, this could impact on the operations
and financial performance of the Group.
The Group manages its IT through a combination of experienced staff and
contracted-out teams. The Group has back-up arrangements in place at all 
its major sites. The Group operates to the highest standards of safety at 
its facilities. The Group is also insured against losses arising from certain
incidents that might impact on the operations of our facilities.
IT systems and controls or facilities failure
The Group operates in a market controlled by laws governing competitive
behaviour. Penalties for breaching competition laws could result in 
substantial fines.
The Group has a rigorous programme of training for all relevant employees,
to ensure that they fully understand the applicable laws and the high standards
to which they are expected to operate. Furthermore, the Group operates a
Workplace Malpractice helpline in those jurisdictions where this is permissible,
providing a confidential route for employees to report perceived malpractice
of any type.
Competition
The Group employs over 12,000 people. Were an issue to arise that caused
a material breakdown in industrial relations, such that there was a prolonged
strike or other industrial action within a part of the business, this could have a
material impact on the financial performance of the Group.
The Group maintains good relationships with all significant organisations that
seek to represent its employees. Furthermore, the Group aims to provide
employees with a safe working environment and a culture that fosters excellent
performance and encourages self-development. Through being an employer
of choice, we aim to avoid material industrial relations issues arising.

Employee safety is the Group’s top priority. Were an incident to arise where
unsafe practice was found to be taking place, this could potentially result in
the interruption of some of our operations for a period of time and the Group
could incur financial penalties and reputational damage. 
The Group has a very detailed and extensive health and safety programme,
which is embedded in all its operations. Further details of this programme
are set out in the section on Corporate Responsibility in this Annual Report. 
Employee safety
The amount of taxation paid by the Group is dependent on the applicable
tax law in the jurisdictions in which we operate and on the geographic mix
of the business. Were the tax rate to be increased in those jurisdictions, or
the geographic mix of the business to change to be skewed towards higher
tax jurisdictions, then the overall tax rate of the Group may rise, impacting
on the profits that may be distributed to shareholders. 
The Group actively manages its tax affairs in order to minimise the tax paid,
within the scope of the tax laws where we operate.

The Group has two businesses that are not wholly owned and two joint
ventures, where shares in those companies are also held by third parties. 
In these companies, the Group does not have complete control and 
therefore there is greater potential for financial returns not to be consistent
from these businesses.
These non-wholly owned businesses are insignificant in respect of the Group
operating profit. 
Associates/minorities
Approximately 50% of the Group’s revenues and 70% of the Group’s
operating profit are derived from non sterling currencies. The Group does 
not hedge for currency translation effects on revenue or operating profit. As
described in the Financial Review section of the Annual Report the Group’s
debt is mainly denominated in euros and this acts as a net investment hedge
of the Group’s euro net assets.
In relation to currency translation, the conversion rate which is material 
to the Group is sterling to the euro. A decrease in the value of the euro by 
10 cents would reduce operating profit by £3.8 million and, after a benefit
to the interest cost of £1.2 million, pre-tax profit by £2.6 million.

Corporate Responsibility Review continued
Environment
Our principles and approach to corporate responsibility 
DS Smith aims to deliver attractive and sustainable returns to its
shareholders. Our business is the production and supply of recycled
packaging – an essential part of the supply chain for many goods.
We are also the largest collector of used cardboard and paper in
the UK. Our customers look to DS Smith to provide solutions – to
reduce both their costs and their carbon footprint – by ensuring
optimum performance of the packaging they need. As we help 
our customers in their businesses reach their environmental targets,
we also seek to set high standards within our own business. 
Our corporate responsibility (CR) approach covers health and
safety, the environment, our employees, and our communities. 
The Board considers risks to the Group’s short and long-term value
arising from CR matters as part of its regular review of the key risks
to the Group’s operations. It ensures that the Group has in place
effective policies and systems for managing any significant CR risks
and it receives regular reports on performance. The Group Chief
Executive is the Director responsible for CR matters and he reports 
to the Board on these. It is the responsibility of the Divisional Chief
Executives and general managers of the individual businesses to
communicate and to apply the policies, to ensure compliance and 
to review procedures, taking account of local legislation and
potential risks. 
The Group has a Workplace Malpractice Policy, under which
employees may report in confidence any perceived wrongdoing
within the Group on matters relating to safety, the environment,
unethical business conduct or breaches of Group policies, the 
law or other regulations. This policy is reinforced by a confidential
Employee Concern Helpline and e-mail facility which we aim 
to make available to our employees worldwide as local legal 
and regulatory issues are resolved; to date, it has been extended 
to employees in nine countries. Any concerns reported 
are appropriately investigated. 
DS Smith continues to be selected as a constituent of the FTSE4Good
UK Index of companies deemed to meet globally recognised
corporate responsibility standards. 
DS Smith’s business model is built on
sustainability – by providing corrugated
packaging that is largely made of recycled
material, and that is fully recyclable. Our
plastics products, such as bag-in-box, also 
offer signiﬁcant environmental beneﬁts over
alternative packaging materials. Therefore 
for DS Smith, sustainability is part of our
business model. 
External recognition for DS Smith in the field 
of sustainability: 
Green Apple Awards 2010: 
DS Smith Recycling received the Green
Apple Award for Environmental Best 
Practice “Champion of Champion” prize, in
partnership with customer Marks & Spencer,
in November 2010. DS Smith Recycling has
been working with Marks & Spencer to
deliver their “Plan A” environmental initiative.
Financial Times PLC awards 2010: 
DS Smith Plc received the award 
for Achievements in Sustainability 
at the PLC awards 2010, presented 
at an awards ceremony in March

How packaging helps a sustainable society
Packaging is often perceived as a negative part of our economy –
filling up our bins, and in turn landfill sites and consuming valuable
natural resources. What is less well understood is the role packaging
plays in reducing waste, by ensuring that products – for example
food, household products or electrical goods – reach us in good
condition. For example, it is estimated that in some developing
countries 30 – 50% of food does not reach consumers due to
wastage, while in the UK less than 3% of food goes to waste between
production and retail depot (Source: Industry Council for Packaging
and the Environment – INCPEN). In the UK, taking food as an
example, the energy used in packaging, on average, is 10% of 
the total energy input, compared to the energy used in production 
of the food of over 50% (Source: INCPEN). Therefore it makes sense
to use packaging appropriate to the product, in order not to waste
the materials and carbon already invested in it. 
Packaging is designed to be eye-catching and therefore is something
we tend to notice. However, of the average weekly load of household
waste in the UK, 18% is used packaging, while waste food comprises
25%. Of that packaging, 85% of it is commonly recyclable 
(Source: INCPEN). 
With the cost of raw materials rising, there are strong commercial
pressures to reduce the amount of material in packaging while still
delivering the functionality it is designed for. Looking at the UK, 
the amount of packaging used per person has stayed the same 
in weight since 1998, despite the increase in consumption since
then (source: INCPEN). 
Appropriate packaging, therefore, plays its part in a sustainable
society by protecting our goods and reducing waste – particularly
when that packaging is made from recycled material, and can be
fully recycled itself. 
How DS Smith plays its part in a sustainable economy
Corrugated packaging produced by DS Smith has attractive
environmental characteristics, being both made from recycled 
raw material and recyclable.
We work closely with our customers to reduce the carbon footprint
of the packaging they require – and at the same time, to save costs.
We look at the cost and carbon impact of the whole supply chain,
taking into consideration the transportation, wastage on the packing
line, and the materials used in the packaging. For example, 
DS Smith has been developing light-weight solutions for some time.
Our latest innovation in corrugated board, R-Flute®, significantly
improves the carbon footprint in the supply chain. While it has
similar strength properties to alternative types of corrugated board, 
it is 20% thinner. That means that 20% more boxes can be fitted 
in one lorry from our factory to that of our customer, so fewer 
lorry journeys are needed. This is a simple example of saving 
our customers cash and carbon in their supply chain. We have a 
range of products under our “PackRight” tools that help the design 
of optimal packaging to help our customers realise these savings. 
DS Smith Recycling is the largest collector and recycler of used
paper and cardboard in the UK. DS Smith Recycling also collects
other types of waste and works with commercial partners to recycle
it. We are different from our main competitors in the UK as, unlike
them, we do not own landfill sites. Therefore customers of our recycling
services know that our commitment lies in landfill diversion.
Corrugated packaging has good environmental characteristics and
we see substantial opportunities to continue the expansion of its use
as a substitute for other forms of packaging material.
For example, our bag-in-box technology is used for a wide range of
products in substitution for rigid plastic containers, bottles, or other
packaging formats. The cardboard box is readily recyclable, while
the plastic content in the bag and tap is often significantly less than
the amount of material used in the production of an alternative
plastic bottle. The benefits continue through the supply chain as
boxes of liquids can be packed in a more space-efficient manner
and the weight of the packaging is less – often making it cheaper
and less energy intensive to transport. These benefits of bag-in-box
packaging have been independently verified by PIRA (the Paper 
and Board, Printing and Packaging Association) and are promoted
to customers by our Plastic Packaging business.
Environmental management and regulation 
The environmental performance and activities of the divisions are
reviewed at the Group Environment Committee, which is chaired 
by the Group Chief Executive. 
Each of our sites is required to implement an environmental
management system (EMS) which is appropriate to its activity. 
DS Smith has 64 sites accredited under the ISO 14001 standard
and 45 that have in place a simplified EMS, appropriate to their
lower level of potential environmental impact. As part of their EMS,
many Group businesses have procedures in place for assessing 
their suppliers’ environmental policies and management systems, 
as appropriate.
The Group had a number of minor environmental incidents during
the year, following which prompt corrective action and steps to
prevent any recurrence were taken. As previously reported, in 2010
the Environment Agency brought a case against DS Smith Paper
Limited (formerly St Regis Paper Company Limited) in relation to
alleged breaches of the Higher Kings Mill’s Pollution Prevention and
Control (PPC) permit that occurred between December 2005 and
March 2008. The charges primarily related to the training of staff,
record keeping and the operation of the mill’s effluent treatment
plant. A detailed environmental survey has indicated that these
breaches did not result in any significant environmental impact. 
At the court hearing in October 2010, DS Smith Paper Limited
pleaded guilty to a number of the offences, generally relating to
record keeping, and pleaded not guilty to charges of intentionally
making false entry in a required Environmental Agency record. 
DS Smith Paper Limited was found guilty on all charges. It is
appealing against three of the 19 charges, being those charges
51271_p31-39_vAW.qxp_Layout 1  04/07/2011  22:33  Page 33 34 www.dssmith.uk.com DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2011
(and related fines) of intentionally making false entries in a required
Environmental Agency record. The appeal is expected to be heard
at the Court of Appeal later in 2011. In relation to this incident, 
DS Smith Paper Limited has received fines totalling £387,100, 
of which £120,000 relate to the charges being appealed.
In accordance with our general practice relating to any regulatory
breaches, at the time of the incident a full investigation was promptly
undertaken of all our UK paper mills to ensure that nothing similar
arose. As a result we implemented a range of actions to strengthen
our systems including increasing the scope and frequency of our
internal audits.
The Group’s paper manufacturing operations account for c. 75% 
of the Group’s environmental impact, particularly because their
manufacturing process uses large quantities of energy and water.
The UK paper mills are regulated through PPC permits under which
they each have specific improvement programmes and targets. 
DS Smith Paper’s overall compliance with its environmental permits
rose to 99% in 2010/11 (2009/10: 94%) principally due to better
performance of the effluent treatment plants at both Kemsley and
Higher Kings Mills. DS Smith Paper is a key participant in the UK
paper sector Climate Change Levy (CCL) Agreement with the
Department of Environment, Food and Rural Affairs under which the
industry has undertaken to achieve energy consumption reduction
targets. DS Smith Paper met the final target of the existing scheme
with future targets yet to be identified awaiting Government revision 
of the scheme.
The Group’s UK and French paper operations are subject to the terms
of their respective national schemes for implementing the EU Emissions
Trading Directive. We expect the Group’s emissions to be slightly
below our emissions allocations during EU ETS Phase 2. The effects
of subsequent phases from 2013 onwards are likely to be more
onerous, being dependent upon the details of the emissions allocations
and the market price of carbon under future phases of the scheme. 
Environmental performance
DS Smith this year has set a target of a 20% reduction in carbon
dioxide (CO
2
) emissions, water use and of waste to landfill, relative
to the activity level of the business, over the next 10 years. Given the
businesses activities carried on within the Group the activity metric
employed by each part of the business has been chosen to be that
which is the most relevant to them. For example, for the corrugated
packaging businesses, the relative metric is the quantity of corrugated
board produced, in m
2
.
Our businesses include their environmental impact in their budgeting
plans in order to track their progress against their targets.
During the year, we again employed independent consultants, Bureau
Veritas, to review our environmental data collection and reporting
process in order to ensure the robustness and accuracy of the Group’s
environmental performance indicators. This review concluded that
overall there was a good level of process control and reporting at
the sites but identified some areas for improvement which are being
considered and, as appropriate, implemented.
On 1 September 2010 the Group acquired the French corrugated
packaging business, Otor. Accordingly, the environmental
performance figures for the Group in 2010/11 include Otor’s
operations from that date. This approach has been adopted in order
to be consistent with the consolidation of the financial returns from
Otor. This is necessary as our relative financial performance measure
is revenue, the one common metric across our diverse business.
The Group consumed 9% more energy in 2010/11 compared 
with the previous year. This increase was almost entirely due to the
inclusion of Otor in the business. On a per £’000s revenue basis,
energy usage fell 9%, reflecting the change in mix of the business
away from energy intensive paper manufacture to less energy
intensive corrugated packaging manufacturing, plus the effect of
price inflation on revenue. The Group’s paper mills reduced their
energy usage per tonne of paper produced by 3%, due to improved
operational efficiencies at our Wansborough Mill in the UK and
increased use of our combined heat and power (CHP) plant at
Kemsley. The Group’s total water usage was 3% higher than in
2009/10, principally as a result of the inclusion of Otor, but lower
relative to revenue by 14%, also reflecting mix and price inflation.
The proportion of waste generated by the Group which was sent 
to landfill fell from 14% to 13%. 
Energy efficiency 
Our two largest paper mills, at Kemsley in the UK and Kaysersberg in
France have on-site CHP plants. These CHP facilities provide energy
more efficiently, with lower CO
2
emissions and at significantly lower
cost than if it were to be sourced from the external grid. In addition,
Kemsley Mill recycles, in the form of energy recovery, a substantial
proportion of the reject material, such as plastic and polystyrene,
which enters its process mixed in with the waste paper and is
separated out during paper manufacture. The mill’s own waste-to-
energy plant efficiently recovers the energy to produce steam for 
use in the mill’s operations. Further, we applied in April 2010 for
planning permission for a sustainable energy plant at Kemsley to
reduce the mill’s reliance on fossil fuels. The proposed fuel for this
plant is hard-to-recycle materials, sourced and pre-treated offsite,
which might otherwise go to landfill. The power plant would be built
by energy company E.ON and by waste specialist Wheelebrator,
with DS Smith providing the site. Kent County Council gave their
agreement for this plant in April 2011. The project is now subject to
other consents, principally in relation to environmental permitting by
the Environment Agency. If the necessary consents and permits are
obtained, it is expected that the plant may be operational by 2016.

Methodology: The Group aims to collect and report its environmental data in accordance
with the guidelines specified by the Global Reporting Initiative and the Greenhouse Gas
Protocol (GHGP), to the extent that this is currently practicable. The figures reported
above include data from all of the Group’s wholly-owned or majority-owned operations
and sites worldwide. The methodology used is consistent for 2009/10 and 2010/11. 
1 The energy figures relate to the usage of all fuels used in fixed installations on the
Group’s sites plus the diesel fuel used for freight transport. 
2 The CO
2
emissions have been calculated using the energy data, as defined above.
The factors used for converting gas, coal, fuel oil and diesel usage into CO
2
emissions
are the latest factors for each year as published by the UK Department for the
Environment and Rural Affairs (DEFRA) in the Guidelines to DEFRA’s GHG Conversion
Factors. The factors used for converting electricity usage are the national figures for
each country in which the Group operates, also sourced from DEFRA; these factors
therefore reflect the mix of fuels used for electricity generation in each country. As
required by the GHGP , Scope 1 and Scope 2 CO
2
emissions are reported separately.
Scope 1 (direct) emissions are those arising from combustion of fuel in installations or
vehicles owned by the Group; Scope 2 (indirect) emissions are those arising from
bought-in energy (i.e. electricity or steam) where the combustion has been carried 
out by another company. The 2010/11 Scope 1 emissions included 60,000 tonnes
(2009/10: 57,000 tonnes) of CO
2
which were associated with the production of
electricity which was sold to the grid from one of our CHP plants. Scope 3 emissions
from sources external to DS Smith but involved in the supply chains for the Group’s
products and services are not included. 
3 The waste figures relate to waste generated by our operations; they do not include
waste that is collected from external sources for recycling within our paper and plastic
packaging operations. 
Verification Statement from Bureau Veritas UK Ltd
For the third year we have worked with DS Smith Plc to provide an
independent opinion on the Environmental Performance Indicators
presented on this page of its 2011 Annual Report. Having completed
a process incorporating site visits, document review and interrogation
of associated management and reporting systems, it is our opinion
that the presented performance indicators provide a fair and
accurate representation of DS Smith Plc’s performance.
DS Smith Plc should be commended on their approach to data
collection, which continues to remain consistent across the divisions
with a clear understanding of required processes demonstrated by
those with responsibilities in this regard at both divisional and site
level. It is clear that DS Smith Plc is constantly looking to improve
these processes; both via internal mechanisms, and as demonstrated
in the proactive manner in which the company has continued to
engage Bureau Veritas on this project.
As with last year Bureau Veritas encourages DS Smith Plc to continue
to improve the monitoring of its performance by initiating a half-
yearly review of consolidated performance data. 
A full verification statement including our methodology, basis for 
our opinion, additional recommendations, limitations and a
statement of Bureau Veritas independence can be found on the

Health and safety
It was also encouraging that 84% of respondents felt empowered 
to raise concerns about unsafe practices. The Group’s safety
communications programme, operating under the slogan ‘Think
Safe, Be Safe’, aims to raise awareness of key issues, to challenge
unsafe attitudes and behaviour and to promote a collective
responsibility for maintaining a safe working environment. 
The Group has a well established safety audit programme
conducted by internal specialists and external consultants. 
These audits are used to ensure sites’ consistent adherence to 
safety standards and to investigate possible areas of concern. The
resulting action plans set a clear pathway for improvement. Further
progress in spreading best practice across the Group has been
made by integrating safety into the new operational improvement
forum. Through this forum, the Group is raising awareness around
issues such as re-engineering processes to improve safety, and the
safety aspects of procurement decisions.
All accidents and situations that might have resulted in an accident
are investigated to ensure we learn from these incidents and take
steps to prevent a recurrence. In addition to focusing on specific
risks, through techniques of risk assessment and root cause analysis,
the Group also undertakes extensive safety training programmes at
all levels of the organisation.
In 2011/12 the major challenge in health and safety will be the
integration of the former Otor businesses. The Otor sites have an
AFR over four times higher than the Group average. This represents
a very significant challenge, but a comprehensive audit of the Otor
sites has been completed and detailed action plans have been
developed and are being implemented to transform the safety
performance over the coming years.
The safety of our staff and those affected by our operations is our
highest priority. In 2010/11 the Group continued to improve its safety
performance. Our businesses benchmark their safety performance
internally and through the use of external data. Information on safety
performance, including statistics related to our key performance
indicators (KPIs), is reported to the Board quarterly. The overall goal is
to achieve zero accidents and our divisions set interim targets against
their KPIs, which reflect the nature of their business and their previous
performance. In 2010/11, our continuing emphasis on safety was
reflected in a 9% reduction in Lost Time Accidents (LTAs); these are
accidents that resulted in one shift or more of working time being lost.
There was a 7% reduction in the accident frequency rate (AFR), which
measures LTAs in proportion to the number of hours worked. There
was an 8% improvement in the accident severity rate, which measures
the hours lost as a result of accidents as a percentage of the total
hours worked. The improvements in the Group’s safety record reflect
the leadership shown by the Group’s managers and the ongoing
commitment of our employees to working safely. As a Group we
remain resolute in our determination to realise a zero accident culture
and to continue to build on the progress we have made to date. 
The Group’s progress towards a zero accident culture is evidenced
by 62 of the Group’s 128 sites having no LTAs in 2010/11. In 
the Group’s engagement survey, 84% of respondents agreed 
that health and safety was taken seriously at their workplace.

Employees Community involvement
Employee engagement is central to the delivery of the Group’s
strategy. In 2010/11, DS Smith completed its first Group wide
engagement survey with 79% of employees taking the time to
participate. This is a very high level of participation for a first 
survey which reflects the dedication and commitment of the Group’s
employees. The engagement survey is an opportunity to listen to the
structured feedback and views of our employees. The results have
been analysed and communicated, and priorities for improvement
have been identified by management teams with action plans
developed for the coming year. A further survey will be completed in
2012 to monitor the progress made against these plans. The Group
has also embarked on a programme to communicate and engage
all its employees with the new corporate strategy. This programme
will ensure that all employees know the Group’s vision and values,
its strategic goals and the role they can play.
A new Sharesave Plan for UK employees was rolled out in 2011
with the aim of promoting ownership of DS Smith shares amongst
employees. There are plans to extend similar schemes to employees
in other regions.
Training programmes are carried out by the Group’s businesses in
response to their specific operational performance requirements. 
The individual training and development needs of employees 
are met through a variety of schemes including: management
development programmes, which in some cases involve external
accreditation; support for studying external vocational and
professional qualifications; and schemes for coaching and
mentoring managers, using both external and internal resources.
New recruitment and development initiatives, designed to ensure 
the Company has the skills available to meet its growth targets, 
are being implemented. In 2009, DS Smith initiated a two year
development programme for c. 70 of its senior business leaders. 
The programme has been designed and run in partnership with
Warwick Business School with bespoke content combining 
the latest academic thinking with practical application to 
the Group’s businesses. 
The Group is committed to ensuring equal opportunities in all
recruitment and employment practices. It is also committed, as a
minimum, to meeting the labour rights and legislation requirements
in each of the countries in which it operates; in practice the Group
often exceeds the local and international requirements. As 
DS Smith’s operations are almost entirely located in member
countries of the OECD, human rights matters are not perceived 
as a significant Group risk.
We seek to develop and maintain good relations in the local
communities in which we operate; this is particularly important 
as in many of the locations where we operate we are one of the
largest employers. As well as providing significant employment
opportunities, we aim to make positive contributions to our
communities and build a reputation as a good neighbour and
employer. Our businesses work closely with local schools and
colleges providing training, mentoring, work experience placements
and other opportunities for pupils to learn about industry and
business. The Group is involved in a wide range of other local
community activities including sponsorship of community projects 
or sports teams and provision of adult skills training. Our businesses
participate in liaison groups with local residents, particularly at
locations where there is a need to review ways in which we can
reduce any inconvenience to neighbours from our operations as 
a result of traffic movements, odour or noise. Some sites hold open
days to foster relationships with their local communities. The Group
supports charitable fundraising activities through modest cash
contributions or staff time. The majority of the money donated 
by the Group is given by individual business units, principally 
to good causes in their local communities. 
DS Smith employees are skilled, dedicated
and hardworking. We are engaging with 
our employees to deliver the Group strategy.
DS Smith actively works with local communities,
recognising the position we have in the locations
where we operate.

Corporate Governance
The Company is committed to the principle and application of 
sound corporate governance. This report explains the key features 
of the Group’s governance structure, how it applies the principles 
set out in the Code of Best Practice set out in Section 1 of the FRC
Combined Code on Corporate Governance issued in June 2008
(the ‘Combined Code’) and the extent to which the Company has
complied with the provisions of the Combined Code. The UK
Corporate Governance Code was published in May 2010 and 
will apply to the Company for the financial year 2011/12. The
Company expects to be broadly in compliance with the Code.
Having considered the recommendations of the UK Corporate
Governance Code, the Board has resolved that the Chairman and
non-Executive Directors will retire and stand for re-election at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting on 6 September 2011 
and currently intends to repeat this process annually thereafter. 
The Board has resolved, however, that the Executive Directors who
have already been elected by the Company in general meeting will
continue to retire from office at least once every three years, and
offer themselves for re-election, in accordance with the Company’s
Articles of Association. This practice will be kept under review. 
The Board considers that the Chairman and non-Executive 
Directors are accountable to shareholders for the performance 
of the Executive Directors and that it is in the best interests of the
Company for any change to the Executive Directors to be part 
of a controlled succession planning process. 
The Company has complied throughout the financial year with 
all the provisions of the Combined Code, except in respect of 
Mr R G Beeston’s membership of various Board committees for 
the period from 1 May 2010 to the end of June 2010, as disclosed
below. The Board has an ongoing review of its corporate governance
policy. Further explanation of how the principles and supporting
principles have been applied is set out below and in the Directors’
Remuneration Report. The Company’s Auditors have reviewed the
compliance with those provisions of the Combined Code specified
for their review.
Board and Board Committees
The role of the Board
The Board is collectively responsible for promoting the success of 
the Company by directing and supervising the Company’s affairs.
The Board’s role is to provide leadership of the Company within 
a framework of prudent and effective controls which enable risk 
to be assessed and managed.
The Board sets the Company’s strategic aims, ensures that the
necessary financial and human resources are in place for the
Company to meet its objectives, and reviews management
performance.
In addition, the Board sets the Company’s values and standards 
and ensures that its obligations to its shareholders and others are
understood and met.
The Board currently comprises the Chairman, two Executive and 
four non-Executive Directors. The offices of Chairman and Group
Chief Executive are held separately. During the year, each of the
non-Executive Directors has at all times acted independently of
management and has no relationships which would materially
interfere with the exercise of their independent judgement and
decision-making.
It is recognised that Mr Beeston was not considered a fully
independent non-Executive Director after 5 December 2009
because of his length of service. Mr Beeston retired as a non-
Executive Director of the Company on 8 December 2010.
The Board meets a minimum of eight times per year. During the year
under review it met eight times. All Board members attend all Board
and relevant Committee meetings unless exceptional circumstances
prevent them from attending. During the year, Mr S W Dryden did
not attend the September 2010 Board meeting and the Annual
General Meeting due to a bereavement of a close family friend; 
Mr G Davis did not attend the Board meeting and the Audit and
Nomination Committee meetings held in December 2010 due to
Month Change
May 2010 Mr M W Roberts was appointed to the Board as Group Chief Executive and as a member of the Nomination
Committee. Mr A D Thorne retired as Group Chief Executive and from the Board and Nomination Committee.
June 2010 Mr G Davis was appointed as a non-Executive Director and became a member of the Remuneration, Audit
and Nomination Committees.
Mr Davis became Chairman of the Remuneration Committee at the end of June 2010.
Mr J C Nicholls became Chairman of the Audit Committee at the end of June 2010.
Mr R G Beeston stepped down from his membership of the Remuneration, Nomination and Audit Committees.
December 2010 Mr Beeston retired as a non-Executive Director.

OF MEETING FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
previous commitments. Mr P J-C Mellier did not attend the December
2010 Board meeting due to ill health or the additional April 2011
Remuneration Committee meeting due to previous commitments. For
these meetings these Directors gave full consideration to the matters
being discussed and provided their input to the Chairman. There
were no other absences from any Board or Committee meetings by
any Director. In addition to formal Board meetings, the Chairman
and Group Chief Executive maintain regular contact with all Directors
and hold informal meetings with non-Executive Directors to discuss
issues affecting the Company. Individual Directors are encouraged
to make site visits during the year. The Board reviews the performance
of the Group and undertakes a strategic review on an annual basis.
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for consideration and
approval by the Board. These include the annual budget, substantial
acquisitions and disposals, the approval of the full-year and half-
year results and a review of the overall system of internal control
and risk management.
The Board and its Committees, as detailed below, receive timely
information of a quality that enables them to carry out their roles
effectively. All Directors have access to the advice and services of
the Company Secretary. A procedure is in place for any Director to
take independent professional advice in the furtherance of his duties
at the Company’s expense. No such advice was sought by any
Director during the year. The Directors are provided with opportunities
for training to ensure that they are kept up to date on relevant 
new legislation and regulation changes, corporate governance
developments and changing commercial risks. On appointment,
new Directors are given appropriate induction training, tailored to
their specific needs, taking into account their individual qualifications
and experience, which includes individual time with the Chairman,
Group Chief Executive and Group Finance Director and site visits 
to major business units.
The Board carried out a comprehensive appraisal of its performance
and that of the Committees and the individual Directors in February
2011 which was led by the Chairman and the Senior Independent
Director. It was decided to conduct the review internally as there had
been an independent review in 2009. The review comprised
feedback from a questionnaire and individual discussions. All
Directors and the Company Secretary participated in the exercise.
The results were discussed by the Board at its meeting in March 2011.
The review concluded that the main purpose of the Board over 
the next few years is to ensure that the agreed strategy is fully
implemented. Action points from Board meetings should focus on
strategy delivery. The strategy away day had been a success. Future
strategy meetings should be around a more granular strategic plan
with more detail on action and resources. 
The Board is well balanced with good diversity of experience and
perspective. This must be maintained with future Board appointments. If
an appropriate candidate were able to be identified a female director
would be welcomed, and more overseas experience is essential.
Non-Executive Directors need more contact with the senior
management team, in a relaxed as well as formal environment. 
The Board will ideally hold one meeting each year at a UK site 
and one overseas.
The Board should address environmental matters as a strategic and
not solely a compliance issue. 
The Executive Directors are open and honest in their dealings with
the Board and generally respect its views and listen to its concerns.
Non-Executive Directors address the right issues and are both
challenging and supportive. The Group Chief Executive and all 
non-Executive Directors should ensure they maintain a dialogue
outside meetings.
The responsibilities of the Audit Committee and Board are
appropriately drawn. The Remuneration Committee will focus on
ensuring the remuneration policy consistently reflects the business
strategy and goals. The Nomination Committee has handled Board
succession effectively, and should continue its focus on both this 
and on the calibre of the management team. 
In addition, the Senior Independent Director conducted a review of
the performance of the Chairman which concluded that the Chairman
had led the Board effectively. The non-Executive Directors met
separately with the Chairman in March and all the non-Executive
Directors and the Executive Directors met in March to give them 
the opportunity to discuss any matters they wished to raise in the
absence of the Chairman. 
Following this evaluation the Board recommends the re-election 
of those Directors who are standing for re-election at the 2011
Annual General Meeting. 
Board Committees
The principal Committees of the Board are the Audit, Remuneration
and Nomination Committees. All Board Committees have written
terms of reference agreed by the Board. These are available on 
the Company’s website at http://www.dssmith.uk.com/about-
us/corporate-governance or are available on request to the Company
Secretary. The Audit Committee is chaired by Mr J C Nicholls (and
was previously chaired by Mr C J Bunker). The Remuneration
Committee is chaired by Mr Davis (and was previously chaired by
Mr Beeston). The Nomination Committee is chaired by Mr P M
Johnson. The membership of each Committee and the experience 
of its members can be seen on page 38. The Audit and
Remuneration Committees comprised independent non-Executive
Directors for the majority of the year. However, Mr Beeston was not
considered an independent non-Executive Director from December
2009 by reason of his length of service (Combined Code C.3.1
and B.2.1). The Nomination Committee comprised a majority of
independent non-Executive Directors for most of the year. According
to Combined Code A.4.1, Mr Beeston was not considered an
independent non-Executive Director since December 2009 by
reason of his length of service. As mentioned in the Chairman’s
Statement on page 15, Mr Beeston retired from the Board on 8
December 2010.
Audit Committee 
In addition to the Committee members listed on page 38, the
Chairman, the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance Director,
representatives from Internal Audit and the Group Financial Controller
attend parts of these meetings by invitation. Mr Beeston ceased 
to be a member of the Committee on 30 June 2010. The Board 
is satisfied that Mr Nicholls has both current and relevant 
financial experience.
The terms of reference of the Audit Committee, which meets at least
three times a year, include all the matters indicated by the Combined
Code except the oversight of business risks which is the direct
51271_p40-44_vAW.qxp_Layout 1  04/07/2011  22:35  Page 41 42 www.dssmith.uk.com DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2011
responsibility of the Board. The primary objective of the Audit
Committee is to assist the Board in fulfilling its responsibilities
relating to:
• the accounting principles, policies and practices adopted in the
Group’s accounts;
• external financial reporting and associated announcements;
• the appointment, independence, effectiveness and remuneration
of the Group’s Auditors;
• the resourcing, plans and effectiveness of the Internal Audit
performed on behalf of the Company by a major accountancy
firm, independent from the Group’s Auditors;
• the adequacy and effectiveness of the financial control
environment; and
• the Group’s compliance with the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance.
The Committee receives and reviews regular reports from the external
Auditors, Internal Audit and the Group Finance Director. Under its
terms of reference the Committee is empowered to seek independent
external advice but did not do so during the year. 
The Committee meets with the external Auditors to determine annually
their qualifications, expertise, resources, independence, objectivity,
and effectiveness. The Audit Committee receives written confirmation
from the external Auditors as to any relationships that might have a
bearing on their independence, whether they consider themselves
independent within the meaning of the UK regulatory and professional
requirements, their quality control processes and ethical standards.
In order to ensure the independence and objectivity of the Auditors,
the Committee maintains and regularly reviews the Auditor
Independence Policy which covers services which may be provided
by, and fees paid to, auditors. Audit fees are negotiated with the
Group Finance Director and approved by the Audit Committee. The
policy on the supply of non-audit services by external auditors is as
follows. The Group should not employ the Auditors to provide non-
audit services where either the nature of the work or the extent of
such services might impair the Auditors’ independence or objectivity.
The external Auditors are permitted to undertake some non-audit
services, providing they have the skill, competence and integrity 
to carry out the work in the best interests of the Group, on, for
example, advisory services and due diligence activities associated
with potential acquisitions and disposals and major changes in
accounting regulations. Non-audit services and fees are reported to
the Audit Committee twice a year. For guidance, annual non-audit
fees payable to the external Auditors should not exceed 75% of 
the annual Group audit fee without prior formal approval of the
Committee. During 2010/11, total non-audit fees were 107% of the
annual Group audit fee. The most significant element related to the
acquisition of Otor; the use of external auditors in relation to the
acquisition of Otor having been approved by the Audit Committee.
Approval for permitted non-audit services is sought as required by
this Policy which specifies that individual projects which would cost
over £100,000 must be referred to the Chairman of the Committee
for prior approval. The outcome of these reviews was not only that
performance of the relevant non-audit work by the Auditors was the
most cost-effective way of conducting business but also that no
conflicts of interest existed between such audit and non-audit work.
In addition £2.4 million was paid to other accounting firms for non-
audit work, including £0.9 million for work relating to Internal Audit.
Deloitte LLP , a leading international audit partnership, was first
appointed as Auditor to the Group companies in 2006 and its fees
are regularly compared with peer companies by the Committee.
There are no contractual restrictions on the Group with regard to its
appointment. In accordance with professional standards, the partner
responsible for the audit is changed every five years.
During the year, the Committee met on four occasions. Mr Davis 
was unable at attend the meeting December 2010 due to previous
commitments, but otherwise there were no absences. On each of these
occasions the Committee also met privately with the external Auditors.
The Chairman of the Audit Committee also held separate private
meetings during the year with the external Auditors, representatives
from Internal Audit and the Group Finance Director. The Committee
received sufficient, reliable and timely information from management 
to enable it to fulfil its responsibilities. The Committee is satisfied that
the Group’s executive compensation arrangements do not prejudice
robust controls and good stewardship.
At its meeting in June 2010, the Committee reviewed the annual
financial statements of the Company and received reports from
Group Operational Audit on internal control matters and from the
external Auditors on the conduct of their audit, their review of
accounting policies, areas of judgement and the financial statements
and their comments on statements concerning risk and internal
control. A similar review was undertaken in December 2010 when
the half-year results were considered. At these meetings and the
meeting in April 2011, the Committee dealt with the following
particular matters:
• at the year-end a series of tests were undertaken to determine
whether there had been any impairment to the balance sheet
carrying values of goodwill and other intangible assets. The 
key assumptions behind these calculations can be found in 
note 10 to the financial statements;
• at the meeting in June it received a report from Internal Audit
covering, amongst other things, the work undertaken by the
Internal Audit function and management responses to proposals
made in the audit reports issued by the function during the year;
• it considered the effectiveness of systems for monitoring and
reporting on risks faced by the Group;
• it carried out an appraisal of the effectiveness of the Audit
Committee (as part of the Board evaluation process referred to
on page 41), the external Auditors and Group Operational Audit,
the results of which were reported to the Board. The Committee
concluded that each area operated satisfactorily during the year;
• at the meeting in December 2010 the Committee was consulted
on plans to outsource the Group Operational Audit function; and
• it oversaw the continuing development and the operation of the
Group’s Workplace Malpractice Policy.
Nomination Committee
Mr Roberts became a member of the Committee in May 2010 and
Mr Davis became a member in June 2010. Mr Thorne ceased to be
a member of the Committee when he resigned from the Board on 
4 May 2010 and Mr Beeston ceased to be a member on 30 June
2010. The Nomination Committee evaluates the balance of skills,
knowledge and experience (including the length of service of each
Director) of the Board, develops role specifications, considers the
appointment of Directors, reviews succession planning and diversity

at Board level, identifies the skills required of future directors and
makes recommendations to the Board as a whole. A rigorous process
is in place for the appointment of new Directors, involving the use of
external recruitment consultants followed by meetings both with the
Committee and then with the Board. The Committee met four times
during the year and, apart from Mr Davis’ absence from the
December meeting noted above, there were no absences.
The performance of the Committee was evaluated as part of the
Board performance evaluation process described above.
Remuneration Committee
The Chairman and the Group Chief Executive attend these meetings
by invitation, except when their remuneration is being discussed.
The Remuneration Committee is responsible for determining the
remuneration of the Executive Directors, the Chairman and the
Company Secretary and for advising on the remuneration of senior
management. The Remuneration Report is set out on pages 45 to 53.
During the year, the Committee met five times. Mr Mellier did not
attend the additional meeting in April 2011 due to previous
commitments, but otherwise there were no absences.
The performance of the Committee was evaluated as part of the
Board performance evaluation process described above.
Other Board Committees
The Board has delegated certain powers, mainly of a routine nature,
to the General Purposes Committee, which comprises the Group
Chief Executive and the Group Finance Director under the
chairmanship of the Group Chief Executive.
Conflicts of interest
The Company’s Articles of Association permit the Board of Directors
to authorise a conflict of interest or potential conflict of interest
notified by a Director provided that the Board considers this to 
be in the best interests of the Company. 
Each of the Directors in office review their individual positions
regularly and new Directors review their individual position prior 
to joining the Board. Directors are reminded from time to time of
their obligations. The Company has put procedures in place via 
the Company Secretary whereby the Directors can notify any future
conflicts or potential conflicts of interest that may arise so that the
Board can consider whether authorisation is appropriate. Any
notifications are considered at the next Board meeting and, if
considered appropriate, authorised. Directors do not participate 
in the discussion, or vote regarding their own conflicts. If 
authorised, any conflicts are entered in the Conflicts Register. 
An annual review of conflicts is carried out and this is incorporated
into the year-end process of verifying Directors’ interests. The
procedures continue to operate effectively.
Relations with shareholders
The Company has a programme of regular meetings (which
sometimes includes the Chairman and the Senior Independent
Director), site visits and results briefings with its major institutional
shareholders, which provides opportunities to discuss the progress 
of the business. Presentations are conducted in accordance with the
Financial Services Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules on
the dissemination of inside information to ensure the protection of
such information that has not already been made available
generally to the Company’s shareholders. The Board also receives
feedback from major shareholders in the form of independently
prepared reports. Together, the Chairman, Group Chief Executive,
Group Finance Director, and Head of Investor Relations ensure the
Board is fully briefed on shareholders’ views such that any issues or
concerns are fully understood and considered by the Board. The
Senior Independent Director is available to discuss with shareholders
any major issues that cannot be resolved through normal channels.
The Annual General Meeting is used as an opportunity to communicate
with private shareholders, including a short presentation on the
business and current trading position as well as an opportunity 
for questions from investors to the Chairman of the Board and the
chairmen of the Audit and Remuneration Committees. All Directors
who attend the Annual General Meeting make themselves available
to meet shareholders after the formal business of the meeting. To
ensure compliance with the Code, separate resolutions are proposed
on each discrete subject. The Directors have resolved that the
Chairman and non-Executive Directors will retire and stand for re-
election at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting and currently
intend to repeat this process annually thereafter. The number of
proxy votes for, against and withheld for each resolution are
displayed at the Meeting after a vote on a show of hands has 
been taken. The final results are published through a Regulatory
Information Service and on the website following the Meeting.
Regular communication with shareholders also takes place through
the full-year and half-year reports and via the Company’s website,
www.dssmith.uk.com. In addition, the Company provides Interim
Management Statements and Trading Updates.
Internal control
The Board has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of
internal control, including financial, operational and compliance
controls, and risk management systems, and for reviewing its
effectiveness. Such a system, however, can only be designed to
manage rather than to eliminate risk and therefore can provide 
only reasonable and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss. In accordance with the Turnbull guidance, the
Company has in place the procedures necessary to ensure that there
is an ongoing process for identifying, evaluating and managing the
significant risks to the Group. These procedures have been in place
for the whole of the financial year ended 30 April 2011 and up to
the date of the approval of these financial statements and have been
reviewed by the Board during the year. A Group Risk Committee,
comprising the Group Steering Team (the Group Chief Executive, 
the Group Finance Director, Company Secretary, Group Human
Resources Director, Chief Procurement Officer and Divisional Chief
Executives) meets regularly. The Group Risk Committee discusses the
key risks facing the Group and whether there are any material new
risks, and the adequacy and suitability of the mitigation
arrangements in place to manage those risks. 
The Board determines the objectives and broad policies of the
Group. It meets regularly and there is a schedule of matters which
are required to be brought to it for decision. The Board has
delegated to management the responsibility for establishing a system
of internal control appropriate to the business environments in which
the Group operates. Key elements of this system include:
• a clearly defined divisionalised organisation structure for
monitoring the conduct and operations of individual 
business units; 
• clear delegation of authority throughout the Group, starting with
the matters reserved for the Board;
51271_p40-44_vAW.qxp_Layout 1  04/07/2011  22:35  Page 43 44 www.dssmith.uk.com DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2011
• a formal process for ensuring that key risks affecting all the
Group’s operations are identified and assessed on a regular
basis, together with the controls in place to mitigate these risks.
Risk consideration is embedded in decision-making processes.
The most significant risks are periodically reported to the Board
and considered by it; 
• the preparation and review of comprehensive annual divisional
and Group budgets and an annual review and approval by the
Board of the corporate strategy;
• the monthly reporting of actual results and their review 
against budget, forecasts (including bank covenant headroom)
and the previous year, with explanations obtained for all
significant variances;
• clearly defined policies for capital expenditure and investment,
including appropriate authorisation levels, with larger capital
projects, acquisitions and disposals requiring Board approval; 
• procedures manuals laying down common control procedures
and policies to apply throughout the Group;
• formal monthly meetings between the Group Chief Executive, 
the Group Finance Director and divisional management to
discuss strategic, operational and financial issues; and
•Key Corporate Values have been communicated to all employees.
The Group’s Internal Audit function undertakes regular reviews of 
the individual businesses’ operations and their systems of internal
control, makes recommendations to improve controls and follows up
to ensure that management implement the recommendations made.
The Internal Audit plan is determined on a risk assessment basis and
is reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee. Internal Audit’s
findings are reported to Group and business area management as
well as to the Audit Committee. 
The Board can confirm that it has carried out an annual review of
the overall effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management procedures, during the year and up to the
date of approval of this annual report. This included a process of
self-certification by senior divisional management in which they 
were asked to confirm that their divisions have complied with 
Group policies and procedures and to report any significant control
weaknesses identified during the past year. In addition, it involved
reviewing the results of the work of the Group’s Internal Audit
function and the risk identification and management processes
identified above.
Going concern
A review of the Group’s business activities, together with the factors
likely to affect its future development, performance and position are
set out on pages 18 and 22 in the Group Chief Executive’s review of
the year. The financial position of the Group, its cash flows, liquidity
position and borrowing facilities are shown in the Consolidated
Statement of Financial Position, Consolidated Statement of Cash
Flows, the accompanying Notes to the Consolidated Financial
Statements on pages 60 to 110 and in the Financial Review on
pages 23 to 26. Further information concerning the Group’s
objectives, policies and process for managing its capital, its
financial risk management objectives, details of its financial
instruments and hedging activities, and its exposure to credit risk
and liquidity risk can be found in the section covering risk
management on pages 27 to 30.
Management’s review of liquidity and the adherence to banking
covenants takes into account the Group’s budget and forecasts for
the next two financial years. Furthermore, the forecasts have been
subjected to a number of ‘downside’ and mitigation scenarios in
order to evaluate the impact on liquidity and adherence to banking
covenants if the Group’s plans are not achieved. A summary of the
outcome of this evaluation by management has been provided to,
and discussed with, the Board.
In arriving at their opinion, the Directors have taken into account 
the risks and uncertainties which arise as a result of the current
economic environment. These risks are described in the section
covering risk management (pages 27 to 30). The planning
assumptions and sensitivities of these risks are covered on 
pages 27 to 30. The principal risks and uncertainties which 
would have a direct impact on liquidity and banking covenants 
are summarised below:
• changes in the demand for, or pricing of, the Group’s products
and services as a result of general economic conditions or
market-specific factors;
• volatility of pricing and availability of globally-traded 
raw materials;
• volatile energy prices;
• movements in foreign exchange rates and interest rates;
• the funding position of the Group’s UK defined benefit 
pension scheme;
• the continuing availability of banking facilities, including
compliance with borrowing covenants; and
• customer credit risk.
The Directors consider that the Group has the flexibility to react to
changing market conditions.
The Board has considered the risks and uncertainties as summarised
above and, after making enquiries, including a review of recent
performance, the Directors have formed a judgement at the time 
of approving the Consolidated Financial Statements, that there is 
a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. For
this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in

DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2011 www.dssmith.uk.com
Remuneration Report 
 
 
In accordance with section 439 of the Companies Act 2006, 
shareholders’ approval of the Remuneration Report will be  
sought at the forthcoming Annual General Meeting (AGM). The 
Remuneration Report has been approved by the Board of Directors. 
This report has been prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006, Schedule 8 of the Large and Medium sized Companies 
and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008 (Schedule 8) 
and the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority. 
(A) Composition and role of the Remuneration 
Committee (the ‘Committee’) 
The members of the Committee during the year under review  
were Mr G Davis (Chairman), Mr C J Bunker, Mr P J-C Mellier  
and Mr R G Beeston (until 30 June 2010).  
With the exception of Mr Beeston, all the members are considered 
independent. Mr Beeston was no longer considered independent 
because of his length of service (Combined Code B.2.1). 
The members of the Committee have no personal financial interest, 
other than as shareholders of the Company, in the matters to be 
decided by the Committee, no potential conflicts of interest arising 
from cross-directorships and no day-to-day involvement in running 
the business.  
The Committee operates under written terms of reference agreed 
by the Board which are available on the Company’s website, 
http://devdssmith.chalkward.co.uk/sites/default/files/ 
RemunerationCommittee.pdf. The Committee is responsible for 
determining the remuneration of Executive Directors, the Chairman 
of the Company and the Company Secretary. It also considers the 
remuneration of senior executives reporting to the Group Chief 
Executive (taking into account recommendations from him). 
(B) Compliance 
The Board, in conjunction with the Committee, has taken the 
necessary steps to ensure that the Company complies with the 
provisions of the Combined Code, except in relation to the 
independence of Mr Beeston as explained above, which relate  
to Directors’ remuneration. Certain disclosures in this Report fall 
within the scope of matters for review by the Auditors. 
(C) Advisers to the Committee 
Hewitt New Bridge Street (a brand of Aon Hewitt Limited) has 
been appointed by the Committee to provide advice on the 
remuneration of Executive Directors and other senior executives. 
Hewitt New Bridge Street also provides advice to the Company  
in connection with the operation of the Company’s share-based 
incentive schemes. The Committee consults with the Chairman  
of the Company and with the Group Chief Executive, who may 
attend meetings of the Committee, although they are not involved 
in deciding their own remuneration. The Committee is assisted by 
the Company Secretary and the Group Human Resources Director, 
and also receives advice from Mercer Limited, the Actuary to the 
Company’s pension scheme, in relation to Executive Directors’ 
pensions. Hewitt New Bridge Street is a signatory to the Code of 
Conduct for Remuneration Advisers. Neither Hewitt New Bridge 
Street nor any other part of Aon Hewitt provided any other 
services to the Company during the year.  
(D) General policy on remuneration 
The Committee’s overall policy is to ensure that the remuneration 
packages enable the Company to attract, retain and motivate 
Executive Directors and other senior managers of sufficient calibre 
to meet the Company’s needs. In addition, the remuneration 
packages are designed to align the interests of executives and 
shareholders and to link a significant proportion of executives’ 
remuneration to performance. To achieve this, the Company 
operates cash and share-based incentive schemes which are linked 
to the achievement of short-term and long-term performance targets. 
As in previous years, the main elements of the remuneration policy 
in 2011/12 will be as follows: 
• basic salary; 
• pension provision; 
• annual bonus scheme; and 
• long-term incentives, comprising the Performance Share Plan. 
Basic salaries and pension provision are not linked to performance 
(except when basic salaries are reviewed), whilst payments under 
the annual bonus scheme and any long-term incentive scheme 
operated by the Company are wholly dependent upon performance 
against agreed targets. Only basic salary is pensionable. 
Variable performance-related remuneration for Mr M W Roberts 
and Mr S W Dryden for 2011/12 will account for approximately 
57% of total target remuneration (excluding pensions and benefits). 
In addition, it is proposed to introduce a Share Matching Plan for 
senior executives, including the Executive Directors, and the first 
award of matching shares will occur in 2012/13. The adoption  
of this Plan is subject to the approval of shareholders at the Annual 
General Meeting and details about the Plan are set out in the 
Notice of Meeting. 
The Board is ultimately accountable for executive remuneration 
but delegates responsibility to the Committee. The Committee 
addressed the following main issues during the year: 
• the annual review of the Chairman’s and Executive Directors’ 
remuneration for 2010; 
• the executive bonus arrangements and targets for 2010; 
• long-term incentive award levels and targets for 2010 awards; 
• oversight of remuneration policy for senior management and 
employees; 
• policy changes for 2011/12 including the proposal to adopt a 
Share Matching Plan; and 
• the disclosures in this Report. 
When setting Executive Directors’ remuneration, the Committee 
looks at the pay and conditions in the rest of the workforce.  
The Group Finance Director’s basic salary was increased by  
2% on 1 August 2010 and other senior executives’ basic salaries  
were increased by an average of 2% from 1 August 2010. This 
compares to an average increase of 2.5% for the rest of the 
workforce. The Group Chief Executive’s basic salary was agreed 
on appointment and was not subject to review on 1 August 2010. 
Whilst there is no overall policy on the relationship between 
Executive Directors’ pay and that of the workforce, the Company 
aims to pay fairly across the business. 
During 2010, following the recruitment of the Group Chief 
Executive, the Company undertook a major review of strategy.  
The primary objective of the new strategy is to create a growing 
business that is more focused, generating higher margins and 
returns and with reduced cyclicality. As well as delivering strong 
performance in the past 12 months, going forward the strategy  46 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2011 www.dssmith.uk.com
Remuneration Report continued 
 
leads the Company to have ambitious objectives which will be 
reflected further in strong growth in earnings, return on capital  
and superior shareholder returns. 
Against this background, the Remuneration Committee has been 
considering how to ensure that key management performance  
and remuneration is aligned with the interests of our investors.  
The Remuneration Committee believe this can best be achieved  
by having key management well rewarded for achieving truly 
stretching objectives, and furthermore that the shape of this  
reward should emphasise the development of a significant 
shareholding in the Company by those key managers. 
To deliver this objective the Remuneration Committee is proposing 
four changes to the current remuneration policy: 
• increase in the amount of bonus deferred into shares; 
• introduction of a Share Matching Plan; 
• strengthening the existing share ownership guidelines; and 
• introduction of claw back provisions into all management 
incentive plans. 
The Company consulted with its major shareholders, the 
Association of British Insurers and RREV prior to finalising  
the proposals. 
(E) Basic salaries 
The basic salaries of Executive Directors are reviewed annually  
on 1 August, in conjunction with other aspects of remuneration. 
The basic salary for each Executive Director is targeted at the  
rates of salary for similar roles within a selected group of UK 
businesses of similar size with substantial overseas operations. 
When determining the level of salary, the Committee takes into 
account market salary levels, the relative performance of the 
Group and of the individual Director, together with his experience 
in the particular job. The Committee also considers relevant 
information on the remuneration of other senior executives  
and the pay of employees elsewhere in the Group and,  
where appropriate, communicates its views on the levels  
of such remuneration to the Group Chief Executive. During its 
deliberations, the Committee has regard to salary levels in other 
countries where this is relevant for any non-UK based senior 
executive. The table of emoluments of the Directors is set out on 
page 49. The current basic salaries of Mr Roberts and Mr Dryden 
are £535,000 and £336,600 respectively. These were fixed on 
appointment on 4 May 2010 and following a review on 1 August 
2010 respectively. The Executive Directors’ base salaries have 
been reviewed recently and, from 1 August 2011, will be 
increased by 6.5% to £570,000 for Mr Roberts (his first review 
since his appointment) and by 6.0% to £357,000 for Mr Dryden. 
In making these changes the Committee carefully considered the 
excellent achievement of each Director as well as the Company’s 
strong performance. It also noted that the new base salaries will 
position both Directors around the mid-market. Other senior 
executives’ basic salaries will be increased by typically no  
more than 3% from 1 August 2011. 
(F) Annual bonus 
The Executive Directors participate in an annual bonus scheme 
which has been approved by the Committee. Following discussions 
with investors in 2010, for the financial year 2010/11 the 
maximum bonus payable was 100% of basic salary. 
For 2010/11 the first 25% of annual basic salary is payable in 
cash and with the excess bonus split equally between cash and 
deferred shares. The deferred shares vest three years after they  
are awarded and are held pursuant to the Deferred Share Bonus  
Plan. At that point, the Director receives the shares and a payment 
equal to the value of dividends payable on the vested shares during 
the deferral period. If the Director ceases employment with the 
Group during the deferral period, he will lose his right to the shares 
unless he is a defined ‘good leaver’ or the Committee considers that 
vesting is appropriate in the circumstances. The shares will vest in 
the event of a change of control or voluntary winding-up. 
The annual bonus payable to Mr Roberts and Mr Dryden for the 
financial year 2010/11 was 50% based on profit before tax with 
the other 50% based on return on capital employed. The outcome of 
the results for the financial year 2010/11 means that Mr Roberts 
earned a bonus of 100% of salary (£535,000) and Mr Dryden 
earned a bonus of 100% of salary (£336,600). Full bonus was 
achieved for the profit before tax and return on capital employed 
targets and this required the Executive Directors to exceed the top 
end of the range of financial targets, a financial performance 
significantly ahead of what was anticipated at the start of the year 
and a very significant improvement on the results for 2009/10. 
The Committee has reviewed the maximum potential bonus for 
2011/12, and the maximum bonus potential for 2011/12 for  
the Executive Directors remains 100% of basic annual salary. 
However, going forward the deferred element will be increased 
to 50% of the entire bonus earned. The bonus will continue to  
be based on the Group profit before tax and return on capital 
employed. The Committee has set a range of demanding targets. 
The threshold above which payment starts to be made will  
be significantly above 2010/11 actual performance and  
target performance will be significantly ahead of the Group’s 
historic best performance. Full bonus will require performance  
significantly ahead of target. At target, 50% of the maximum 
bonus will be payable. 
For 2010/11, the annual bonus maximum for the other most 
senior executives was either 60% or 70% of basic salary and the 
bonus metrics were based on a mix of Group profit before tax, 
return on capital employed and Business Segment operating profit, 
subject to the achievement of a cash flow hurdle, as relevant to 
each individual’s job. This policy will be continued in 2011/12 
and, as will be the case for the Executive Directors, 50% of the 
entire bonus will be subject to deferral. 
The annual bonus schemes are not contractual and bonuses under 
the schemes are not eligible for inclusion in the calculation of the 
participating executives’ pension scheme benefits. It is proposed  
to introduce claw back provisions into the Annual Bonus Plan  
and the Deferred Share Bonus Plan so that individuals are liable  
to repay/forfeit some or all of their bonus if there is a material 
misstatement of results or if there is serious misconduct. 
(G) Share awards 
The Company operates a Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) which 
was approved by shareholders in 2008. The individual grant limit 
under this Plan is 150% of basic salary per annum. In exceptional 
circumstances this may be increased to 200% of basic salary. 
  
 
 
 
(G) Share awards continued 
The 2010 award to Executive Directors was 150% of salary. Award levels for the other most senior executives were generally at the 
100% of salary level. It is intended to award at the same levels in 2011. 
Under the PSP, the Committee has the power to vary the metrics used each year and their relative weightings. It also has the power to 
review the specific targets for each award to ensure that they remain appropriate, but the new targets must be at least as challenging 
in the circumstances as the original targets were when they were set. 
It is proposed that for the 2011 awards the same balance of metrics as for the 2010 awards will be used. The total shareholder return 
(‘TSR’) targets will remain the same and these, together with the revised average adjusted earnings per share (‘EPS’) and average 
adjusted return on average capital employed (‘ROACE’) targets, are set out in the table below:

1 The Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within the FTSE 250 currently contains over 50 companies and is considered to provide a better basis for comparison than 
the FTSE 250 as a whole. The Committee considers there are too few publicly quoted competitors to DS Smith to form a more bespoke group. 
2 Average adjusted EPS as disclosed in the Annual Report except that the Committee may adjust this figure in exceptional circumstances. 
3 Average adjusted Group operating profit divided by the monthly average of capital employed in each year. The ROACE calculation will be based on the average ROACE 
for the forthcoming three financial years, commencing with the financial year starting immediately prior to the award. 
Each element operates independently and is capable of vesting regardless of the Company’s performance in respect of the other 
elements. The Committee considers that the targets are significantly more demanding than those set in previous years and achieving 
significant vesting will require performance which is better than anything achieved previously. 
As previously disclosed, to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Dryden and Mr Roberts in 2008 and 2010 respectively, they were granted 
conditional share awards under plans which were formed specifically for this purpose and were granted under Listing Rule 9.4.2R(2). 
Full details of the share awards are set out in sections (P) and (Q) below. 
Currently, senior executives are expected to retain in shares half of the after-tax gains on the vesting of long-term incentive plan awards 
until they have built up a holding of 100% of base salary in the case of the Executive Directors and 50% of base salary for others. 
Going forwards, it is proposed to increase this to 150% of base salary for the Group Chief Executive, 100% for the Group Finance 
Director and 75% for the rest of the Group Steering Team. There will also be a 50% of base salary target for other senior executives. 
In addition, and as a new requirement, irrespective of the retention of shares, the Committee expects that these levels of share 
ownership should normally be achieved within the next four years. If these levels are not achieved, the Committee reserves the  
right not to make, or to scale back, further awards. 
It is proposed to introduce claw back provisions into the PSP and the Share Matching Plan so that individuals are liable to repay/forfeit 
some or all of their awards if there is a material misstatement of results or if there is serious misconduct. 
The interests of the Directors in the share capital of the Company and awards made under the PSP (last award 2010) and Deferred 
Share Bonus Plan (last award 2010) are shown on pages 49 to 50. 
(H) Benefits in kind 
Benefits in kind include provision of a company car, free fuel, permanent health insurance, life cover and private medical cover. 
(I) Pensions 
Mr Roberts receives a pension allowance of 30% of salary per annum plus death in service cover equal to four times basic salary. 
Mr Dryden participates in the Company’s Registered Defined Contribution Scheme with death in service cover equal to four times basic 
salary. Members of this scheme are required to contribute a minimum of 3% of their basic salary to qualify for matching Company 
contributions, with higher levels of Company contributions payable (up to a maximum of 6%) if the members pay a higher contribution. 
Mr Dryden has elected to pay contributions at a level that qualifies for the maximum Company contribution. Mr Dryden also receives  
a cash supplement of £65,000 per annum. This payment is not pensionable and is not considered to be salary for the purpose of 
calculating any bonus payment. 
During his employment Mr Thorne participated in a funded contributory defined benefit pension scheme with death in service.  
As disclosed in last year’s report, Mr Thorne began to take his pension from 31 March 2010. Accordingly, no additional pension 
accrued to Mr Thorne in 2010/11.  
(J) Service contracts and compensation 
The Committee’s general policy is that the notice periods for Executive Directors appointed in future will not exceed one year,  
although on appointment it may be necessary in exceptional cases to offer a longer initial period which reduces to one year  
or less after a specific date.  47

The service contracts for Mr Roberts and Mr Dryden are dated 4 May 2010 and 1 April 2008 respectively. The service contracts may 
be terminated by 12 months’ notice by the Company, and by the Executive Director. The Company may terminate the contract with 
immediate effect by making a payment equal, in Mr Roberts’ case, to basic salary and pensions allowance for any unexpired period 
of notice and, in Mr Dryden’s case, to basic salary for any unexpired period of notice. The Company may make such payment in  
a lump sum or in monthly instalments from the termination date. These monthly payments will be reduced to take account of any 
alternative employment or consultancy income during the period over which such instalments are payable. 
As set out in last year’s report, Mr Thorne was given 12 months notice under his service contract on 30 October 2009 and his 
employment was terminated on 18 May 2010. The compensation payable to Mr Thorne in connection with the termination of his 
employment in lieu of notice is set out in section (M). 
(K) Policy on external appointments 
Executive Directors are allowed to accept external appointments as a non-Executive Director of up to two other companies provided 
that these are not with competing companies and are not likely to lead to conflicts of interest. In normal circumstances, the Group Chief 
Executive may not accept more than one external appointment. Executive Directors are normally allowed to retain the fees paid from 
these appointments. 
Mr Roberts has no external appointments. Mr Dryden is a non-Executive Director of Fiberweb plc and received fees of £38,000 for the 
year to 30 April 2011 (from date of appointment on 1 June 2009 – 30 April 2010: £34,833). 
(L) Fees for non-Executive Directors and the Chairman 
The remuneration for non-Executive Directors consists of annual fees for their services as members of the Board and, where relevant,  
for their work on selected Committees. Non-Executive Directors have letters of appointment for a term of three years whereupon they 
are normally renewed but generally for no more than three terms in aggregate.  
The Chairman’s remuneration consists of an annual fee for his service as Chairman of the Board and his letter of appointment is  
for a term of three years. His appointment may be terminated by three months’ notice by the Company and by the Chairman. 
As noted in the Corporate Governance report on page 40, having considered the recommendations of the UK Corporate Governance 
Code, the Board has resolved that the Chairman and non-Executive Directors will retire and stand for re-election at the forthcoming 
AGM on 6 September 2011 and currently intend to repeat this process annually thereafter. Their appointment may be terminated 
immediately if not re-elected to the Board. Their respective dates of appointment are shown on page 38. 
The letters of appointment detail the time commitment expected of each non-Executive Director and are available for viewing  
at the registered office during normal business hours and prior to and at the AGM. 
The rates for the Chairman’s and non-Executive Directors’ fees will be as follows from 1 August 2011:

The fees for the Chairman and the non-Executive Directors were increased modestly with effect from 1 August 2010 and, following  
a comprehensive review, will be increased again as set out in the table above. The review took into account market practice with 
reference to the comparator group. The total amounts in the table include the following changes from 1 August 2011: the Chairman’s 
fees will be increased by £18,500 and the non-Executive Directors’ base fees will be increased by £1,500. The fee for the Senior 
Independent Director will rise from £2,500 to £7,500. Mr Mellier’s base fee will reduce to the same level as the other non-Executive 
Directors following his move to London this summer. 
Neither the non-Executive Directors nor the Chairman are eligible for pension scheme membership and they do not participate in any 
of the Group’s annual bonus or other incentive arrangements. 
The Company’s Articles of Association enable the Board to set the remuneration of Directors within the limits set by shareholders.  
The current aggregate limit is £750,000 and the aggregate amount paid in the financial year to the non-Executive Directors was 
£229,595. Executive Directors are remunerated in respect of their executive appointments, under the terms of their service contracts, 
and receive no additional fees for serving as Directors. 
Non-Executive Directors are expected to build up and then maintain a shareholding that is equivalent to 50% of their annual fee from 
the Company within two years of their date of appointment. The Directors’ interests in shares can be seen on page 53.

Mr Thorne stepped down as Group Chief Executive on 4 May 2010 and his employment was terminated on 18 May 2010. Mr Thorne 
received a maximum of £498,800 in connection with the termination of his employment in lieu of notice, determined by reference to the 
terms of his service contract, paid in instalments, and subject to a reduction for certain other earnings for the period prior to 30 October 
2010. The Company also procured that the car which was made available for Mr Thorne’s use was transferred to him following his 
termination at no cost.  
Mr Roberts was paid a Substitute Cash Bonus Award as compensation for loss of his cash bonus entitlement with his previous employer 
for the year 2009/10 as a result of his recruitment by the Company. He received a cash sum of £187,500 paid on 2 September 
2010. The sum of £187,500 was calculated to reflect the proportion of the period of 12 calendar months beginning on 1 July 2009 
during which Mr Roberts was actively employed by McBride plc and was based on an assessment of the likely bonus which would 
have become payable to him had he remained employed by McBride plc. 
Mr Dryden received a non-pensionable cash supplement during the year. The total emoluments, excluding the deferred bonus, of  
Mr Roberts for 2010/11 were £1,234,000 (2009/10: £nil). The total emoluments, excluding the deferred bonus, of Mr Dryden  
were £639,000 (2009/10: £588,000).

The vesting of each award granted in 2008 is split into equal thirds, based on the Company’s TSR compared to the constituents of  
the FTSE 250 Industrial Goods and Services Supersector, average adjusted EPS and average ROACE. 25% of the TSR part vests if  
the Company is ranked median, rising until 100% vests if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile. The threshold (at which 25% 
vests) and maximum targets are 16.5p and 19.0p for EPS and 11.5% and 12.5% for ROACE. 
The vesting of each award granted in 2009 is split 80% based on the Company’s TSR compared to the constituents of the FTSE 250 
Industrial Goods and Services Supersector, and 20% based on the average ROACE. 25% of the TSR part vests if the Company is 
ranked median, rising until 100% vests if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile. The threshold (at which 25% vests) and 
maximum targets are 10.3% and 11.5% for ROACE. 
The vesting of each award granted in 2010 is split 50% based on the Company’s TSR compared to the constituents of the FTSE 250

Mr Thorne stepped down from the Board on 4 May 2010 and his employment terminated on 18 May 2010. The performance conditions 
attached to the award granted in 2008 were not met as at 18 May 2010. Accordingly the award lapsed. The performance conditions 
for the 2009 award (awarded on 22 July 2009) were tested by reference to 18 May 2010. 100% of the TSR element vested on 24 
June 2010, subject to a time pro-rata reduction to reflect the unexpired portion of the performance period at cessation. Accordingly, 
216,753 shares were released to Mr Thorne on 24 June 2010 (share price on 24 June 2010 was 121.2p). The remaining shares 
lapsed. In accordance with the rules of the PSP £7,152.84 was paid on 24 June 2010 in respect of the time pro-rated dividends  
earned since the award was made.

In recognition of the loss of his entitlement to deferred share bonus awards relating to his previous employment, Mr Dryden was made 
an award of 143,404 shares (which is neither pensionable nor transferable) on 1 April 2008, the date on which he joined DS Smith 
Plc. The Committee made this award, in exceptional circumstances, to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Dryden as the new Group 
Finance Director. The number of shares awarded was determined by reference to the value of the entitlement to shares he forfeited 
under his previous arrangements. 
The first two tranches vested on 1 March 2009 and 1 March 2010, as reported in the 2009 and 2010 accounts respectively, and the 
final tranche vested on 1 March 2011 and 74,674 shares were transferred to Mr Dryden on 14 March 2011 (allowing time for the 
market to assimilate the Interim Management Statement). At the same time, Mr Dryden sold 38,161 of the acquired shares at a price 
of 204.5p per share in order to pay the income tax, NIC and dealing expenses due following the vesting.

As disclosed last year, in order to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Roberts in unusual circumstances, and to ensure that his interests were 
directly and immediately aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders, the Company granted several conditional share awards 
as detailed below principally as compensation for lost entitlements to bonus, deferred share awards and long-term share incentive 
awards relating to his previous employer, McBride plc.  
The awards made to him were as follows: 
• Substitute Share Bonus Award as compensation for loss of his share bonus entitlement with his previous employer for the year 
2009/10 as a result of his recruitment by the Company. The value of shares awarded reflects the proportion of the period of  
12 calendar months beginning on 1 July 2009 during which Mr Roberts was actively employed by McBride plc and was based  
on an assessment of the likely bonus which would have become payable to him had he remained employed by McBride plc; 
• Replacement Deferred Shares Award. This award reflects the value of shares as at October 2009 which Mr Roberts forfeited as a 
result of his recruitment by the Company. As this award replaces an award with vesting dependent only on continued employment, 
the vesting of the Replacement Deferred Shares Award is not subject to performance conditions; 
• The Replacement 2007 LTIP and Replacement 2008 LTIP (the latter being subject to performance conditions as detailed below) were 
awarded in respect of awards that were made by his previous employer and were forfeited as a result of his recruitment. The value of 
these awards was based on the value of shares under award at October 2009 and in the case of the Replacement 2007 LTIP adjusted 
for the likelihood of achieving the attached performance conditions which were near vesting at this date. The Replacement 2008 LTIP 
award is subject to a performance condition measuring the TSR of McBride plc up to the date Mr Roberts joined the Company and 
thereafter the Company’s TSR against a comparator group of companies comprising the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) 
constituted as at the date of grant of the award over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 July 2008. The award will vest 
in full if the TSR is ranked in the upper quartile of the comparator group and on a straight-line basis if the TSR is ranked between median 
and upper quartile. This performance condition reflects the primary features of the performance condition applying to the original award 
it replaces, to the extent those features can be measured in relation to the Company as well as McBride plc; and 
• The Recruitment Award (subject to the 2010 PSP performance conditions as described in section (G) of this report) was made to 
facilitate his recruitment and in lieu of the 2009 LTIP award which he would have been granted at McBride plc if he had remained 
in employment. The value of an award was based on the normal grant policy of 150% of his basic salary.  51

Remuneration Report continued 
 
The vesting of each award granted in 2008 is split into equal thirds, based on the Company’s TSR compared to the constituents of  
the FTSE 250 Industrial Goods and Services Supersector, average adjusted EPS and average ROACE. 25% of the TSR part vests if  
the Company is ranked median, rising until 100% vests if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile. The threshold (at which 25% 
vests) and maximum targets are 16.5p and 19.0p for EPS and 11.5% and 12.5% for ROACE. 
The vesting of each award granted in 2009 is split 80% based on the Company’s TSR compared to the constituents of the FTSE 250 
Industrial Goods and Services Supersector, and 20% based on the average ROACE. 25% of the TSR part vests if the Company is 
ranked median, rising until 100% vests if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile. The threshold (at which 25% vests) and 
maximum targets are 10.3% and 11.5% for ROACE. 
The vesting of each award granted in 2010 is split 50% based on the Company’s TSR compared to the constituents of the FTSE 250 
Industrial Goods and Services Supersector, 25% based on average adjusted EPS and 25% based on the average ROACE. 25% of the 
TSR part vests if the Company is ranked median, rising until 100% vests if the Company is ranked in the upper quartile. The threshold 
(at which 25% vests) and maximum targets are 14.8p and 17.6p for EPS and 11.1% and 12.2% for ROACE. 
Mr Thorne stepped down from the Board on 4 May 2010 and his employment terminated on 18 May 2010. The performance conditions 
attached to the award granted in 2008 were not met as at 18 May 2010. Accordingly the award lapsed. The performance conditions 
for the 2009 award (awarded on 22 July 2009) were tested by reference to 18 May 2010. 100% of the TSR element vested on 24 
June 2010, subject to a time pro-rata reduction to reflect the unexpired portion of the performance period at cessation. Accordingly, 
216,753 shares were released to Mr Thorne on 24 June 2010 (share price on 24 June 2010 was 121.2p). The remaining shares 
lapsed. In accordance with the rules of the PSP £7,152.84 was paid on 24 June 2010 in respect of the time pro-rated dividends  
earned since the award was made.

S W Dryden 74,674 – 74,674 1 Apr 08 156.5 204.5 – 1 Mar 11
In recognition of the loss of his entitlement to deferred share bonus awards relating to his previous employment, Mr Dryden was made 
an award of 143,404 shares (which is neither pensionable nor transferable) on 1 April 2008, the date on which he joined DS Smith 
Plc. The Committee made this award, in exceptional circumstances, to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Dryden as the new Group 
Finance Director. The number of shares awarded was determined by reference to the value of the entitlement to shares he forfeited 
under his previous arrangements. 
The first two tranches vested on 1 March 2009 and 1 March 2010, as reported in the 2009 and 2010 accounts respectively, and the 
final tranche vested on 1 March 2011 and 74,674 shares were transferred to Mr Dryden on 14 March 2011 (allowing time for the 
market to assimilate the Interim Management Statement). At the same time, Mr Dryden sold 38,161 of the acquired shares at a price 
of 204.5p per share in order to pay the income tax, NIC and dealing expenses due following the vesting.

As disclosed last year, in order to facilitate the recruitment of Mr Roberts in unusual circumstances, and to ensure that his interests were 
directly and immediately aligned with those of the Company’s shareholders, the Company granted several conditional share awards 
as detailed below principally as compensation for lost entitlements to bonus, deferred share awards and long-term share incentive 
awards relating to his previous employer, McBride plc.  
The awards made to him were as follows: 
• Substitute Share Bonus Award as compensation for loss of his share bonus entitlement with his previous employer for the year 
2009/10 as a result of his recruitment by the Company. The value of shares awarded reflects the proportion of the period of  
12 calendar months beginning on 1 July 2009 during which Mr Roberts was actively employed by McBride plc and was based  
on an assessment of the likely bonus which would have become payable to him had he remained employed by McBride plc; 
• Replacement Deferred Shares Award. This award reflects the value of shares as at October 2009 which Mr Roberts forfeited as a 
result of his recruitment by the Company. As this award replaces an award with vesting dependent only on continued employment, 
the vesting of the Replacement Deferred Shares Award is not subject to performance conditions; 
• The Replacement 2007 LTIP and Replacement 2008 LTIP (the latter being subject to performance conditions as detailed below) were 
awarded in respect of awards that were made by his previous employer and were forfeited as a result of his recruitment. The value of 
these awards was based on the value of shares under award at October 2009 and in the case of the Replacement 2007 LTIP adjusted 
for the likelihood of achieving the attached performance conditions which were near vesting at this date. The Replacement 2008 LTIP 
award is subject to a performance condition measuring the TSR of McBride plc up to the date Mr Roberts joined the Company and 
thereafter the Company’s TSR against a comparator group of companies comprising the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) 
constituted as at the date of grant of the award over a three-year performance period commencing on 1 July 2008. The award will vest 
in full if the TSR is ranked in the upper quartile of the comparator group and on a straight-line basis if the TSR is ranked between median 
and upper quartile. This performance condition reflects the primary features of the performance condition applying to the original award 
it replaces, to the extent those features can be measured in relation to the Company as well as McBride plc; and 
• The Recruitment Award (subject to the 2010 PSP performance conditions as described in section (G) of this report) was made to 
facilitate his recruitment and in lieu of the 2009 LTIP award which he would have been granted at McBride plc if he had remained 
in employment. The value of an award was based on the normal grant policy of 150% of his basic salary.  52 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2011 www.dssmith.uk.com

(R) Directors’ interests in share options (auditable)

award having been made in 2007. Directors’ interests in share options over ordinary shares are as follows:

 155,600 – – – 155,600 240.00 31 Jul 10 30 Jul 17
All of the above options were granted for £nil consideration. The market price of the ordinary shares at 30 April 2011 was 216.9p 
and the range during the year was 108p to 226p. Aggregate gains made by Directors on exercise of share options in the year were 
£123,599.42 (2009/10: £nil).  
Following Mr Thorne’s termination of employment on 18 May 2010, options granted in 2002, 2003, 2005 and 2006, having 
satisfied the requirement of real growth in EPS of 2% per annum in 2008 or 2009, were capable of exercise until 18 November 
2010. Mr Thorne exercised these options on 13 October 2010 when the share price was 161.5p. The options granted in 2007  
failed their performance conditions and therefore lapsed.

The vesting of awards made under the LTIP was based on the Company’s TSR compared to the TSR of the constituents of the FTSE 250 
Index (excluding investment trusts). If the Company’s TSR was ranked at the upper quartile of the group or higher, the full award would 
have vested reducing on a straight-line basis to 30% of the award vesting for median performance. None of the award would vest for 
below median performance. TSR performance is measured over a single period of three financial years starting with the year in which 
the award is made. 
In addition to the TSR condition, no awards would vest, irrespective of TSR performance, unless the Company’s EPS growth matches  
or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the three-year period. 
The awards made under the LTIP in 2007 lapsed during the year as the performance conditions were not met. 
(T) All-employee share schemes 
In the UK a Sharesave Plan was introduced in January 2011. Executive Directors are eligible (along with all UK employees of the 
Company and participating subsidiaries of the Group) to participate in this Plan. Under this HMRC approved Plan options are granted 
to participants who have contracted to save up to £250 per month over a period of three years at a discount of up of 20% to the 
average closing mid-market price of a DS Smith Plc ordinary share on the three dealing days prior to invitation. Options cannot  
normally be exercised until a minimum of three years has elapsed. In common with most plans of this type there are no performance 
conditions applicable to options granted under this Plan. A similar Plan is planned to be rolled out to other regions.

There have been no changes to the shareholdings set out above between the financial year end and the date of the Report. It is 
currently intended that any ordinary shares required to fulfil entitlements under the Performance Share Plan, the Deferred Share Bonus 
Plan, the Substitute Share Bonus Award, the Replacement Deferred Share Award, the Replacement 2007 LTIP, the Replacement 2008 
LTIP, the Recruitment Award and the Replacement Deferred Share Bonus Plan will be provided by the David S Smith Group General 
Employee Benefit Trust (the ‘Trust’), which buys shares on the market to do so. The Trust will also be used to fulfil certain entitlements 
under the Executive Share Option Scheme and the new Sharesave Plan (along with new issue shares for other entitlements). 
(V) Total shareholder return performance 
The following graph illustrates the Company’s total shareholder return performance since 1 May 2006, in accordance with paragraph  
4 of the Directors’ Remuneration Report Regulations 2002, relative to the FTSE 250 Index. 
The Company is a member of the FTSE 250 Index and, accordingly, this index is considered to be the most appropriate comparator 
group for this purpose.

attached to the shares, together with details of movements in the 
Company’s issued share capital during the year are shown in  
note 24. Following the Placing announced on 7 July 2010, 
39,296,253 new ordinary shares were issued at a price of 
£1.20 per share, resulting in total proceeds on issue of 
approximately £47.2 million. These new shares ranked equally  
in all respects with the existing ordinary shares. Pursuant to the 
Company’s employee share option schemes, 2,929,144 ordinary 
shares of 10p each were issued during the year. No shares 
pursuant to the Company’s employee share option schemes were 
issued between 30 April 2011 and 22 June 2011 inclusive. The 
Company has not utilised its authority to make market purchases 
of shares granted to it at the 2010 Annual General Meeting but 
will be seeking to renew such authority at this year’s Meeting. 
Substantial shareholders 
At 22 June 2011, the Company has been informed of the 
following notifiable interests in its issued ordinary share capital in 
accordance with the Disclosure and Transparency Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority: 
 Ordinary shares held %
Standard Life Investments Ltd 65,240,234 14.98%
Schroder Investment Management Ltd 32,798,847 7.53%
Lloyds Banking Group plc 26,147,491 6.00%
Legal & General Group plc 15,712,580 3.61%
Acquisitions and disposals 
Otor 
On 1 September 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the voting 
share capital of Otor Finance S.A., a holding company which 
owns and controls 80% of Otor S.A. On this date and as part  
of the same acquisition, the Group acquired an additional 15%  
of the voting share capital of Otor S.A.. Otor S.A. is a leading  
fast moving consumer goods focused corrugated packaging 
company in France. As a result, the Group’s total voting and 
ownership interest in Otor S.A. at acquisition date was 95%. 
Total consideration transferred comprised cash of £156.6 million.  
As noted below, in October 2010 the Group increased its 
ownership interest to 100%. 
Acquisition of non-controlling interests 
In October 2010, the Group acquired an additional 5% interest  
in Otor S.A. for £8.5 million in cash, increasing its ownership  
in the Otor Group from 95% to 100%. The Group recognised  
a decrease in non-controlling interests of £3.3 million and 
a decrease in retained earnings of £5.2 million, to reflect  
this transaction. 
Disposals 
On 1 October 2010, the Group sold its subsidiary in Turkey,  
DS Smith Çopikas A.S., for a consideration of £4.8 million. 
On 30 April 2011 the Group sold its business in the UK,  
DS Smith Sacks, for a consideration of £1.1 million. 
Research and development 
One of the key ways in which the Group seeks to differentiate 
itself with customers is the quality of its innovation and how that 
can be reflected in the packaging designs offered. Research is 
conducted into new types of corrugated packaging and 
innovative applications of it, such as R-Flute®, which is then  
  
 
 
 
rolled out through the organisation. The acquisition of Otor has 
increased the quality of innovation in the Group as this business 
had a number of patented designs that are now offered to 
customers across the business.  
Directors 
The biographies of the present Directors are on page 38.  
All the Directors served throughout the year except as follows.  
Mr M W Roberts joined the Board as Group Chief Executive  
on 4 May 2010 and Mr A D Thorne retired from the Board on  
the same date. Mr G Davis joined the Board as a non-Executive 
Director on 1 June 2010. Mr Beeston retired from the Board on  
8 December 2010. Other than as previously disclosed in this 
Report and in respect of existing service agreements, no Director, 
either during or at the end of the financial year, has been 
materially interested in any significant contract or arrangement  
in relation to the Group’s business. 
In accordance with Schedule 7 of the Large and Medium-sized 
Companies and Groups (Accounts and Reports) Regulations 2008, 
the Directors disclose that the rules regarding the appointment and 
replacement of Directors are contained in the Company’s Articles  
of Association (Articles), which may only be amended with 
shareholder approval in accordance with relevant legislation.  
The powers of the Directors are contained in the Company’s 
Memorandum of Association and Articles. The Articles give the 
Directors powers, subject to relevant legislation, to authorise the 
issue and buy-back of the Company’s shares by the Company, 
subject to authority being given to the Directors by shareholders in 
general meeting. The Company annually seeks the authority of 
shareholders to authorise the exercise by Directors of these powers. 
Re-election of Directors 
The Articles require that all Directors who have either been 
appointed by the Board since the last Annual General Meeting,  
or for whom the forthcoming Annual General Meeting is the third 
Annual General Meeting since they were elected or last re-elected 
by the Company in general meeting, retire from office but they are 
eligible to submit themselves for re-election by the shareholders. 
However, following the publication of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code, which recommends that all directors of FTSE 
350 companies be subject to annual re-election, the Directors 
have resolved that the Chairman and non-Executive Directors will 
retire and stand for re-election at the forthcoming Annual General 
Meeting on 6 September 2011 and annually thereafter. The 
Board has resolved, however, that the Executive Directors will 
remain subject to the three year rotation under the Articles of 
Association. The Board considers that the Chairman and non-
Executive Directors are accountable to shareholders for the 
performance of the Executive Directors and that it is in the best 
interests of the Company for any change to the Executive Directors 
to be part of a controlled succession planning process. Mr Dryden 
is therefore retiring at this year’s Annual General Meeting, as it is 
the third Annual General Meeting since he was elected, and will 
offer himself for re-election. 
Formal performance evaluation has confirmed that the individual 
performance of the Directors offering themselves for re-election 
has been effective and they have demonstrated commitment to  
the role. 
Directors’ interests in shares 
The interests of the Directors and their immediate families in the 
ordinary shares of 10 pence each of the Company, (in terms of 
shares, options and conditional share awards) were as shown in 
the tables on pages 49 to 53. 
Directors’ indemnities 
The Company has entered into qualifying third-party indemnity 
arrangements for the benefit of its Directors in a form and scope 
which comply with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006. 
Employee involvement and communications 
The Group is committed to frequent and effective employee 
communications to promote the understanding and involvement  
of all its employees in the Group’s business objectives and 
performance. Communications and personnel policies have been 
developed to reflect the philosophy of operating management. 
Information is regularly communicated by briefings and 
newsletters. The Group operates a European Works Council,  
with representatives drawn from across the entire workforce in  
the EU countries in which the Group operates. Meetings are  
held to provide an exchange of information of transnational 
importance and to consult with employees on the strategy and 
direction of the Company. At each meeting, presentations are 
made on the Group’s business strategy, financial results, health 
and safety and environmental performance. The Group also has a 
number of divisional national Consultation Forums which promote 
information exchange, consultation and representation between 
the Group and its employees. Business decisions concerning 
capital investment, employment and training take into account the 
Group’s public and local responsibilities. The Group supports the 
involvement of its operations in local community activities. 
Equal opportunities 
DS Smith is an equal opportunities employer. The Group  
is firmly committed to both the principle and realisation of  
equal opportunities and its policies are designed to provide  
such equality irrespective of age, disability, sex, sexual 
orientation, race, religion or nationality. Every possible step is 
taken to ensure that individuals are treated equally and fairly.  
The Group applies the same criteria to people with disabilities  
as it does to other employees. Where appropriate, facilities  
are adapted and retraining is offered to any employee who 
develops a disability during their employment. 
Pension fund 
The Group had, in the year under review, four UK pension 
arrangements: one defined benefit scheme (which is closed to 
new employees), one defined contribution scheme, which was 
introduced for new employees joining the Group on or after  
1 May 2005, one Group personal pension plan and a statutory 
Stakeholder arrangement. The defined benefit scheme is a trust-
based arrangement and the investments of the assets are 
managed on a discretionary basis by a number of Investment 
Managers, either in segregated or pooled arrangements.  
The defined contribution scheme is a trust-based arrangement 
offering members a range of investments. In September 2010, 
Resolution Life completed the acquisition of Axa Sun Life plc, 
which was merged with Friends Provident and rebranded as 
Friends Life. Thereafter, the trustees of the defined contribution 
scheme undertook a market and terms review of providers and 
following that review, selected Friends Life as the preferred 
provider. The Group personal pension plan is a contract-based 
arrangement offering members a range of investments with 
Norwich Union Life and other external investment fund managers, 
and the Stakeholder arrangement is provided through Investment 
Solutions Limited. All such assets are held independently from the  55

Equal opportunities

equal opportunities and its policies are designed to provide  
such equality irrespective of age, disability, sex, sexual 
orientation, race, religion or nationality. Every possible step is

The Group applies the same criteria to people with disabilities  
as it does to other employees. Where appropriate, facilities  
are adapted and retraining is offered to any employee who 
develops a disability during their employment. 
Pension fund 
The Group had, in the year under review, four UK pension 
arrangements: one defined benefit scheme (which is closed to 
new employees), one defined contribution scheme, which was 
introduced for new employees joining the Group on or after  
1 May 2005, one Group personal pension plan and a statutory 
Stakeholder arrangement. The defined benefit scheme is a trust-
based arrangement and the investments of the assets are 
managed on a discretionary basis by a number of Investment 
Managers, either in segregated or pooled arrangements.  
The defined contribution scheme is a trust-based arrangement 
offering members a range of investments. In September 2010, 
Resolution Life completed the acquisition of Axa Sun Life plc, 
which was merged with Friends Provident and rebranded as 
Friends Life. Thereafter, the trustees of the defined contribution 
scheme undertook a market and terms review of providers and 
following that review, selected Friends Life as the preferred 
provider. The Group personal pension plan is a contract-based 
arrangement offering members a range of investments with 
Norwich Union Life and other external investment fund managers, 
and the Stakeholder arrangement is provided through Investment 
Solutions Limited. All such assets are held independently from the  56 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2011 www.dssmith.uk.com
Directors’ Report continued 
 
Group. The trustees of the defined benefit scheme and the defined 
contribution scheme send an Annual Report to all members of the 
respective schemes. The Trustee Company of the defined benefit 
scheme has an Investment Sub-Committee, established in line with 
the recommended guidelines of the Myners Report. Peter Murray 
of Allenbridge Investment Consultants is appointed as an 
independent adviser to the Investment Sub-Committee of the 
defined benefit scheme. 
In August 2010, the Group commenced a consultation process 
with its employees, proposing to close the defined benefit scheme 
to future accrual with effect from 30 April 2011. The proposal 
was around concerns of the sizable shortfall in the defined benefit 
scheme in terms of the money needed to pay for future pension 
benefits and to secure the benefits already earned. Affected 
members of the defined benefit scheme were offered membership 
of the Group’s defined contribution scheme for future service. 
In December 2010, the Trustee agreed in principle to consent to 
the closure of the defined benefit scheme. As part of the decision, 
the Group agreed to provide some additional security for members 
of the defined benefit scheme. The Group and Trustee agreed 
how to work towards eliminating the deficit over 10 years and  
to move toward self-sufficiency. 
In April 2011, the Group and Trustee documented their agreement 
to the defined benefit scheme closure and the terms of the 
additional security and self sufficiency. This included an additional 
£14.5 million employer contribution, which was paid into the 
defined benefit scheme in April 2011. 
Health and safety 
The Group recognises its responsibilities and continues to promote 
all aspects of health and safety in the interests of its employees 
and members of the public. A Health and Safety Policy Statement 
has been approved by the Board. 
Significant agreements 
The Company is required to disclose any significant agreements 
that take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control of the 
Company. The Company has a number of borrowing and related 
derivative facilities provided by various lenders. These facilities 
agreements generally include change of control provisions which, 
in the event of a change of ownership of the Company, could 
result in renegotiation or withdrawal of these facilities. These 
significant agreements are as set out in note 20. 
On 3 March 2005, the Company, DS Smith Paper Limited  
and BPB United Kingdom Limited (now part of the Saint-Gobain 
Group) (Saint-Gobain) entered into a supply agreement for  
the manufacture and supply of plasterboard liner paper to Saint-
Gobain. Saint-Gobain may terminate the agreement if there  
is a change of control in the Company. 
There are a number of other agreements that take effect, alter  
or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following 
a takeover bid, such as commercial contracts and joint venture 
agreements. None is considered to be significant in terms of  
their potential impact on the business of the Group as a whole. 
Payment to suppliers 
Although the Company does not follow any formal code or 
standard on payment practice, the Company agrees terms and 
conditions in the UK with each supplier, which include terms of 
payment. The Company pays each supplier accordingly, subject 
to all the terms and conditions of the order being satisfied by  
such supplier. As DS Smith Plc is a holding company, whose 
principal business is to hold shares in Group companies, it has  
no trade creditors. 
Charitable and political donations 
The Group contributed £76,000 (2009/10: £72,000)  
to charities. No payments were made to political parties. 
Donations were made by operating divisions to support their  
local communities. The Group also supported a number of  
other charities across a range of causes. 
Annual General Meeting 
The notice of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to  
be held on 6 September 2011, together with explanations of the 
Resolutions to be proposed and details of the proxy appointment 
deadline and voting record date, appears at the back of this 
Annual Report. 
Auditors 
Each Director confirms that: 
(a) so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information  
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
(b) he has taken all the steps he ought to have taken as a Director 
in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.  
Resolutions to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as auditors of the Company 
and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will 
be put to the Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or  
loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors: 
• properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• present information including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and 
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of  
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement  
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair  
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit  
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
• the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
Report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

Group. The trustees of the defined benefit scheme and the defined 
contribution scheme send an Annual Report to all members of the 
respective schemes. The Trustee Company of the defined benefit 
scheme has an Investment Sub-Committee, established in line with 
the recommended guidelines of the Myners Report. Peter Murray 
of Allenbridge Investment Consultants is appointed as an 
independent adviser to the Investment Sub-Committee of the 
defined benefit scheme. 
In August 2010, the Group commenced a consultation process 
with its employees, proposing to close the defined benefit scheme 
to future accrual with effect from 30 April 2011. The proposal 
was around concerns of the sizable shortfall in the defined benefit 
scheme in terms of the money needed to pay for future pension 
benefits and to secure the benefits already earned. Affected 
members of the defined benefit scheme were offered membership 
of the Group’s defined contribution scheme for future service. 
In December 2010, the Trustee agreed in principle to consent to 
the closure of the defined benefit scheme. As part of the decision, 
the Group agreed to provide some additional security for members 
of the defined benefit scheme. The Group and Trustee agreed 
how to work towards eliminating the deficit over 10 years and  
to move toward self-sufficiency. 
In April 2011, the Group and Trustee documented their agreement 
to the defined benefit scheme closure and the terms of the 
additional security and self sufficiency. This included an additional 
£14.5 million employer contribution, which was paid into the 
defined benefit scheme in April 2011. 
Health and safety 
The Group recognises its responsibilities and continues to promote 
all aspects of health and safety in the interests of its employees 
and members of the public. A Health and Safety Policy Statement 
has been approved by the Board. 
Significant agreements 
The Company is required to disclose any significant agreements 
that take effect, alter or terminate on a change of control of the 
Company. The Company has a number of borrowing and related 
derivative facilities provided by various lenders. These facilities 
agreements generally include change of control provisions which, 
in the event of a change of ownership of the Company, could 
result in renegotiation or withdrawal of these facilities. These 
significant agreements are as set out in note 20. 
On 3 March 2005, the Company, DS Smith Paper Limited  
and BPB United Kingdom Limited (now part of the Saint-Gobain 
Group) (Saint-Gobain) entered into a supply agreement for  
the manufacture and supply of plasterboard liner paper to Saint-
Gobain. Saint-Gobain may terminate the agreement if there  
is a change of control in the Company. 
There are a number of other agreements that take effect, alter  
or terminate upon a change of control of the Company following 
a takeover bid, such as commercial contracts and joint venture 
agreements. None is considered to be significant in terms of  
their potential impact on the business of the Group as a whole. 
Payment to suppliers 
Although the Company does not follow any formal code or 
standard on payment practice, the Company agrees terms and 
conditions in the UK with each supplier, which include terms of 
payment. The Company pays each supplier accordingly, subject 
to all the terms and conditions of the order being satisfied by  
such supplier. As DS Smith Plc is a holding company, whose 
principal business is to hold shares in Group companies, it has  
no trade creditors. 
Charitable and political donations 
The Group contributed £76,000 (2009/10: £72,000)  
to charities. No payments were made to political parties. 
Donations were made by operating divisions to support their  
local communities. The Group also supported a number of  
other charities across a range of causes. 
Annual General Meeting 
The notice of the Annual General Meeting of the Company to  
be held on 6 September 2011, together with explanations of the 
Resolutions to be proposed and details of the proxy appointment 
deadline and voting record date, appears at the back of this 
Annual Report. 
Auditors 
Each Director confirms that: 
(a) so far as he is aware, there is no relevant audit information  
of which the Company’s auditors are unaware; and 
(b) he has taken all the steps he ought to have taken as a Director 
in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.  
Resolutions to re-appoint Deloitte LLP as auditors of the Company 
and to authorise the Directors to determine their remuneration will 
be put to the Annual General Meeting.

Directors’ responsibilities statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report  
and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law 
and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements 
for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required 
to prepare the Group financial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by 
the European Union and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have 
chosen to prepare the parent company financial statements in 
accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable 
law). Under company law the Directors must not approve the 
accounts unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair 
view of the state of affairs of the Company and of the profit or  
loss of the Company for that period. 
In preparing the parent company financial statements, the 
Directors are required to: 
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently; 
• make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent; 
• state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the financial statements; 
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis 
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will 
continue in business. 
In preparing the Group financial statements, International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that Directors: 
• properly select and apply accounting policies; 
• present information including accounting policies, in a manner 
that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and 
understandable information; 
• provide additional disclosures when compliance with the 
specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users  
to understand the impact of particular transactions, other events 
and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial 
performance; and 
• make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a 
going concern. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of  
the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the 
prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities. 
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity  
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may 
differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Responsibility statement  
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge: 
• the financial statements, prepared in accordance with the 
relevant financial reporting framework, give a true and fair  
view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit  
or loss of the Company and the undertakings included in the 
consolidation taken as a whole; and 
• the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
Report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company 
and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a 
whole, together with a description of the principal risks and 
uncertainties that they face.

117 Five-Year Financial Summary 
  Independent Auditor’s Report to the members of DS Smith Plc 
 
 
 
We have audited the financial statements of DS Smith Plc for the  
year ended 30 April 2011 which comprise the Consolidated Income 
Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the 
Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the Consolidated Statement 
of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows,  
the Parent Company Balance Sheet, the related notes 1 to 34 to the 
Consolidated Financial Statements and the related notes 1 to 12 to the 
parent Company Balance Sheet. The financial reporting framework  
that has been applied in the preparation of the Consolidated Financial 
Statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting 
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The financial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the 
parent Company financial statements is applicable law and United 
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice). 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in 
accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006.  
Our audit work has been undertaken so that we might state to the 
Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them  
in an auditors’ report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent 
permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone 
other than the Company and the Company’s members as a body,  
for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed. 
Respective Responsibilities of Directors and Auditor 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement,  
the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial 
statements and for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view.  
Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial 
statements in accordance with applicable law and International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to 
comply with the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
Scope of the audit of the financial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures 
in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused 
by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of significant accounting estimates made  
by the Directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. 
In addition, we read all the financial and non-financial information in the 
annual report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial 
statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements 
or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report. 
Opinion on financial statements 
In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the 
Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at 30 April 2011  
and of the Group’s profit for the year then ended; 
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and 
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group 
financial statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
Separate opinion in relation to IFRSs as issued  
by the IASB 
As explained in note 1(a) to the Group financial statements, the Group in 
addition to complying with its legal obligation to apply IFRSs as adopted 
by the European Union, has also applied IFRSs as issued by the 
International Standards Board (IASB). 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 2006; and 
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the financial year  
for which the financial statements are prepared is consistent with the 
financial statements.  
Matters on which we are required to report  
by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if,  
in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
Company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent Company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement with the 
accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by law are  
not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we require 
for our audit. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement contained within Corporate Governance  
in relation to going concern; and 
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code specified for our review; and 
• certain elements of the report to shareholders by the Board on 
directors’ remuneration.

Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements 
 
 
 
1. Significant accounting policies 
(a) Basis of preparation 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved 
by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting 
Standards as adopted by the EU (‘adopted IFRSs’), and has also applied 
IFRSs as issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB). 
The Company has elected to prepare its parent Company financial 
statements in accordance with UK GAAP; these are presented on  
pages 111 to 116. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in sterling millions, 
rounded to one decimal place, unless otherwise indicated. They are 
prepared on the historical cost basis except that assets and liabilities  
of certain financial instruments, defined benefit pension plans and  
share-based payments are stated at their fair value. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared on  
a going concern basis as set out on page 44 of the Corporate 
Governance section. 
The preparation of consolidated financial statements requires management to 
make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect whether and how 
policies are applied and affect the reported amounts of assets and liabilities, 
income and expenses. Judgements made by management in the application 
of adopted IFRSs that have a significant effect on the financial statements 
and estimates with a significant risk of material adjustment in the next 
year are discussed in accounting policy (w). 
No changes have been made to the Group’s accounting policies in the 
year to 30 April 2011 other than the adoption of IFRS 3 (revised) Business 
Combinations and IAS 27 (revised) Consolidated and Separate  
Financial Statements. 
The main impact of these revised standards on the consolidated financial 
statements for the year ended 30 April 2011 was as follows: 
• In the year to 30 April 2011, acquisition-related costs have been 
recognised as an operating cost in the income statement whereas 
previously they were capitalised. Prior periods have not been restated 
as this change in accounting is required to be applied prospectively 
from 1 May 2010; 
• The term ‘‘minority interest’’ has been changed to ‘‘non-controlling 
interest’’; 
• Equity interests held prior to control being obtained are re-measured  
to fair value at the acquisition date, with any resulting gain or loss 
recognised in the income statement; 
• Changes in ownership interest in a subsidiary that does not result in  
a change of control are treated as transactions among equity holders 
and are reported within equity shareholders’ funds. No gain or loss is 
recognised on such transactions and goodwill is not re-measured; and 
• Cash consideration for non-controlling interests is classified as a 
financing activity rather than an investing activity in the cash flow 
statement.  
• The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently  
to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements.  
The accounting policies have been applied consistently by all  
Group entities. 
(b) Basis of consolidation 
(i) Subsidiaries 
The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated 
financial statements from the date that control commences until the date 
that control ceases. Control is achieved where the Company has the 
power to govern the financial and operating policies of an investee entity 
so as to obtain benefits from its activities. The results of subsidiaries 
acquired or disposed of during the year are included in the consolidated 
income statement from the effective date of acquisition or up to the effective 
date of disposal, as appropriate. Intra-group balances and any 
unrealised gains and losses or income and expenses arising from intra-group 
transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated financial 
statements. 
(ii) Associates 
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence 
and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint venture. Significant 
influence is the power to participate in the financial and operating policy 
decisions of the investee but is not control or joint control over those policies. 
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s share of the 
total recognised gains and losses of associates on an equity accounted 
basis, from the date that significant influence commences until the date 
that significant influence ceases.  
(iii) Joint ventures 
The consolidated financial statements include the Group’s proportionate 
share of its joint ventures’ assets, liabilities, revenue and expenses with 
items of a similar nature on a line-by-line basis, from the date that joint 
control commences until the date that joint control ceases. 
(iv) Non-controlling interests 
The share of profit attributable to non-controlling interests is shown  
as a component of profit for the period in the income statement.  
Non-controlling interests are shown as a component of equity in the 
statement of financial position net of the value of options over interests 
held by minorities in the Group’s subsidiaries. 
(c) Revenue 
Revenue comprises the fair value of the sale of goods and services, net of 
value added tax, rebates and discounts and after eliminating sales within 
the Group. Revenue from the sale of goods is recognised in the income 
statement when the significant risks and rewards of ownership have been 
transferred to the buyer.  
(d) Government grants 
(i) Emission quotas 
The Group participates in Phase II of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme. 
Emission quotas received in a period are initially recognised at a nominal 
value of nil. As a result, no asset or liability is recognised on the statement  
of financial position at initial recognition. A provision is recognised if there is 
any anticipated shortfall in the level of quotas received or purchased when 
compared with actual emissions in any given period, measured at the  
market price of such quotas at the statement of financial position date.  
Excess emission quotas acquired as part of a business combination are 
recognised as an intangible asset at their fair value on the date of acquisition. 
(ii) Other 
Other government grants are recognised in the statement of financial 
position initially as deferred income when there is reasonable assurance 
that they will be received and that the Group will comply with the conditions 
attaching to them. Grants that compensate the Group for expenses incurred 
are offset against the expenses in the same periods in which the expenses 
are incurred.  
(e) Dividends 
Dividends attributable to the equity holders of the Company paid during 
the year are recognised directly in equity.

translation of monetary assets and liabilities are recognised in the income 
statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of 
historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange 
rates at the dates of the transactions. 
The assets and liabilities of all the Group entities that have a functional 
currency other than sterling are translated at the closing exchange rate at 
the date of the statement of financial position. Income and expenses for 
each income statement are translated at average exchange rates (unless 
this average is not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of 
the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case income and 
expenses are translated at the date of the transactions). On consolidation, 
exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment  
in foreign entities, and of borrowings, and other financial instruments 
designated as hedges of such investments, are recognised in the 
translation reserve. On the disposal of foreign currency entities, the 
cumulative exchange difference recorded in the translation reserve is 
taken to the income statement as part of the gain or loss on disposal. 
(g) Intangible assets 
(i) Goodwill 
All business combinations are accounted for by applying the acquisition 
method. Goodwill (positive and negative) arising on the acquisition of 
subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures, represents the difference 
between the cost of the acquisition and the fair value of the net 
identifiable assets acquired.  
Goodwill is stated at cost less accumulated impairment losses (refer to 
accounting policy (i)). The useful life of goodwill is considered to be 
indefinite. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is tested 
annually for impairment. Negative goodwill arising on an acquisition  
is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
(ii) Research and development 
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of 
gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding,  
is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred. 
Expenditure on development activities, whereby research findings are 
applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially 
improved products and processes, is capitalised if the product or process 
is technically and commercially feasible and the Group has sufficient 
resources to complete development. The expenditure capitalised includes 
the cost of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion  
of overheads. Other development expenditure is recognised in the  
income statement as an expense as incurred. Capitalised development 
expenditure is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) 
and impairment losses (refer to accounting policy (i)). 
(iii) Computer software 
Computer software that is integral to a related item of hardware is 
included within tangible fixed assets. All other computer software is 
treated as an intangible asset. 
(iv) Intellectual property 
Intellectual property is stated at cost less accumulated amortisation  
(see below) and impairment losses (refer to accounting policy (i)). 
 
(v) Other intangible assets 
Other intangible assets that are acquired by the Group are stated at  
cost less accumulated amortisation (see below) and impairment losses 
(refer to accounting policy (i)).  
(vi) Amortisation 
Amortisation of intangible assets (excluding goodwill) is charged to the 
income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives  
of intangible assets unless such lives are indefinite. Intangible assets  
(other than goodwill) are amortised from the date they are available  
for use. The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Intellectual property Up to 20 years 
Customer relationships 10 years 
Computer software 3 – 5 years 
Goodwill is systematically tested for impairment at each statement of 
financial position date, and when there is an indication of impairment. 
(h) Property, plant and equipment and other investments 
Items of property, plant and equipment are stated at cost less 
accumulated depreciation (see below) and impairment losses (refer to 
accounting policy (i)). The cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost 
of materials, direct labour and an appropriate proportion of production 
overheads. Where an item of property, plant and equipment comprises 
major components having different useful lives, they are accounted for as 
separate items of property, plant and equipment. 
The Group recognises in the carrying amount of an item of property, 
plant and equipment the cost of replacing part of such an item when that 
cost is incurred if it is probable that the future economic benefits 
embodied within the item will flow to the Group and the cost of the item 
can be measured reliably. All other costs are recognised in the income 
statement as an expense as incurred. 
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis 
over the estimated useful lives of each item of property, plant and equipment, 
and major components that are accounted for separately (or in the case 
of leased assets, the lease period, if shorter). Land is not depreciated.  
The estimated useful lives are as follows: 
Freehold and long leasehold properties 10 – 50 years 
Plant and equipment, fixtures and fittings  
(including IT hardware) 
3 – 20 years 
Motor vehicles 3 – 5 years 
Other investments consist of available for sale investments in unquoted 
equity and debt securities and are carried at cost, less any impairment. 
(i) Impairment 
The carrying amounts of the Group’s assets, including tangible and intangible 
non-current assets, other than inventories (refer to accounting policy (l)) and 
deferred tax assets (refer to accounting policy (t)), are reviewed at each 
reporting date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If 
any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. An 
impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or  
its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. Impairment losses  
are recognised in the income statement.  
 
 
 
 
 
1. Significant accounting policies continued 
(i) Impairment continued 
(i) Calculation of recoverable amount 
The recoverable amount of the Group’s assets is calculated as the value  
in use, being the present value of expected future cash flows, using a pre-
tax discount rate that reflects the current assessment of the time value of 
money, or the net selling price, if greater. For an asset that does not 
generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is 
determined for the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
(ii) Reversals of impairment 
Impairment losses in respect of goodwill are not reversed. In respect of 
other assets, an impairment loss is reversed if there has been a change in 
the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount. An impairment 
loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does  
not exceed the carrying amount that would have been determined, net of 
depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised. 
(j) Derivative financial instruments  
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, 
currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and 
commodity risks associated with the Group’s underlying business activities 
and the financing of these activities. The Group has a policy not to,  
and does not; undertake any speculative activity in these instruments.  
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair  
value on the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and  
are subsequently remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as  
assets when the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair  
value is negative.  
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for as hedges when 
designated as hedges at the inception of the contract and when the 
financial instruments provide an effective hedge of the underlying risk. 
Any gains or losses arising from the hedging instruments are offset  
against the hedged items.  
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as: 
• fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair 
value of a recognised asset or liability; 
• cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash flows 
that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with either  
a statement of financial position item or a highly probable forecast 
transaction; or 
• hedges of the net investment in a foreign entity. 
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of all other 
derivatives are taken to the income statement. These may arise from 
derivatives for which hedge accounting is not applied because they  
are not effective as hedging instruments. 
The treatment of gains and losses arising from revaluing derivatives 
designated as hedging instruments depends on the nature of the hedging 
relationship as follows: 
Fair value hedges: the carrying amount of the hedged item is adjusted  
for gains or losses attributable to the risk being hedged; the derivative is 
remeasured at fair value and gains and losses from both are taken to the 
income statement. The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting  
if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised,  
the hedge no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting or the  
Group revokes the designation. 
Cash flow hedges: the effective portion of the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument is recognised directly in equity, while the ineffective portion  
is recognised in the income statement. Amounts taken to equity are 
transferred to the income statement when the hedged transaction affects 
profit or loss, such as when a forecast sale or purchase occurs. Where  
the hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the amounts 
taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying amount of the non-
financial asset or liability.  
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or exercised 
without replacement or roll-over, the hedged transaction ceases to be 
highly probable, or if its designation as a hedge is revoked, amounts 
previously recognised in equity remain in equity until the forecast 
transaction occurs and are transferred to the income statement or to  
the initial carrying amount of a non-financial asset liability as above.  
If a forecast transaction is no longer expected to occur, amounts 
previously recognised in equity are transferred to the income statement. 
Hedges of net investment in a foreign entity: the effective portion of the 
gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, 
while the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. Amounts 
taken to equity are transferred to the income statement when the foreign 
entity is sold. 
The net present value of the expected future payments under options over 
interests held by minorities in the Group’s subsidiaries are shown as a 
financial liability. At the end of each period, the valuation of the liability 
is reassessed with any changes recognised in the profit or loss for  
the period. 
(k) Trade and other receivables 
Trade and other receivables are stated at their cost less impairment 
provisions (refer to accounting policy (i)). 
(l) Inventories 
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Net 
realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary course  
of business, less the estimated costs of completion and selling expenses. 
The cost of inventories is based on the first-in first-out principle and 
includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing 
them to their existing location and condition. 
In the case of manufactured inventories and work in progress, cost 
includes an appropriate share of overheads based on normal  
operating capacity.

Transactions in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the 
foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Monetary

1. Significant accounting policies continued 
(m) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part 
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash 
and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. 
(n) Treasury shares 
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of 
the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised 
as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury 
shares and presented as a deduction from total equity. 
(o) Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost with borrowing costs being 
accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the 
effective interest method.  
At the reporting date, accrued interest is recorded separately from the 
associated borrowings within current liabilities. 
(p) Employee benefits 
(i) Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as 
an employee benefit expense within personnel expenses in the income 
statement, as incurred. 
(ii) Defined benefit schemes 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes 
is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of 
future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the 
current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to its present value 
amount and recognised in the income statement as personnel expense;  
a corresponding liability for all future benefits is established on the 
statement of financial position and the fair value of any schemes’  
assets is deducted.  
The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated 
bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the duration of the 
schemes’ obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified  
actuary using the projected unit method.  
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement  
of comprehensive income. 
(iii) Long-term service benefits 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other 
than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.  
(iv) Share-based payment transactions 
The Group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.  
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the  
grant of the options is recognised as an employee expense, with a 
corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees 
unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The fair value of the 
options granted is measured using a stochastic model, taking into  
account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined  
by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the  
impact of any non-market vesting conditions.  
For options remaining outstanding under the Executive Share Option 
Scheme (1999), which ceased to be operated from September 2008  
(see note 26), non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.  
At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact 
of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and  
a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs 
are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when 
the options are exercised. It is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and are discounted to 
present value where the effect is material. 
(q) Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation, 
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required  
to settle the obligation and are discounted to present value where the 
effect is material. 
(r) Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are stated at their cost. 
(s) Leases 
Property, plant and equipment acquired under a lease that transfers 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are 
capitalised as tangible fixed assets. Lease payments are apportioned 
between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.  
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so 
as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability.  
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
(t) Taxation 
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred 
tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case, it is 
recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the 
year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position date, 
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided for using the statement of financial position method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not 
provided for: goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that 
affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse 
in the foreseeable future and the Group is able to control the reversal of 
such temporary differences. The amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the statement of financial position date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can  
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Significant accounting policies continued 
(u) Assets held for sale  
Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, 
that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than 
through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. Immediately before 
classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal 
group, are remeasured in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policies. Thereafter, generally the assets, or disposal group, are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost to 
sell.  
Any impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to goodwill, 
and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except  
that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax  
assets and employee benefit assets, which continue to be measured in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Impairment losses on 
initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on 
remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised 
in excess of any cumulative impairment loss. 
(v) Critical accounting policies  
The application of the Group’s accounting policies requires management 
to make estimates and assumptions; these estimates and assumptions 
affect the reported assets and liabilities and financial results of the Group. 
Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. 
The Group’s accounting policies that are most critical to an understanding 
of the results and position of the Group, and the judgements involved in 
their application, are as follows: 
(i) Impairments 
When applying IAS 36, ‘Impairment of Assets’, the Group compares  
the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with the higher of 
their net realisable value and value in use to determine whether an 
impairment exists. 
Value in use is calculated by discounting the cash flows expected to be 
generated by the asset/group of assets being tested for evidence of 
impairment. The use of different estimates, assumptions and judgements, 
in particular those involved in (a) determining a value based on our 
current expectations of future conditions and the associated cash flows 
from the Group’s operations, (b) our determination of the level at which 
groups of assets can be reasonably tested for impairment separately from 
other parts of the business and (c) our treatment of centrally held assets, 
could each result in materially different carrying values of assets and 
assessments of impairment. See note 10 for additional information. 
(ii) Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’, requires the Group to make assumptions 
including, but not limited to, future asset returns, rates of inflation, 
discount rates and life expectancies. The use of different assumptions, in 
any of the above calculations, could have a material effect on the 
accounting values of the relevant statement of financial position assets 
and liabilities which could also result in a change to the cost of such 
liabilities as recognised in the income statement over time. These 
assumptions are subject to periodic review. See note 25 for additional 
information. 
(iii) Accounting for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 
There are currently no accounting standards that specifically address 
accounting for emission allowances. The Group has applied a ‘net liability’ 
approach. Under a ‘net liability’ approach, no assets or government grants 
are recognised when allowances are initially received. This is because they 
are ascribed a nominal value of nil. As allowances granted to the Group are 
used to offset the liability from CO 2 emissions, no accounting entries are 
required so long as the related emissions generated are within the allowance 
received from the government. If such emissions are in excess of the 
allowance received (known as a shortfall position) a provision is made at the 
current market price for carbon credits. In the case where emission quotas are 
acquired through an acquisition, any surplus emission quotas are fair  
valued in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations.’

(m) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances and call deposits. 
Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and form an integral part 
of the Group’s cash management are included as a component of cash 
and cash equivalents for the purpose of the statement of cash flows. 
(n) Treasury shares 
When share capital recognised as equity is repurchased, the amount of 
the consideration paid, including directly attributable costs, is recognised 
as a change in equity. Repurchased shares are classified as treasury 
shares and presented as a deduction from total equity. 
(o) Borrowings 
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, less attributable 
transaction costs. Subsequent to initial recognition, interest-bearing 
borrowings are stated at amortised cost with borrowing costs being 
accounted for on an accruals basis in the income statement using the 
effective interest method.  
At the reporting date, accrued interest is recorded separately from the 
associated borrowings within current liabilities. 
(p) Employee benefits 
(i) Defined contribution schemes 
Contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as 
an employee benefit expense within personnel expenses in the income 
statement, as incurred. 
(ii) Defined benefit schemes 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of defined benefit pension schemes 
is calculated separately for each scheme by estimating the amount of 
future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the 
current and prior periods; that benefit is discounted to its present value 
amount and recognised in the income statement as personnel expense;  
a corresponding liability for all future benefits is established on the 
statement of financial position and the fair value of any schemes’  
assets is deducted.  
The discount rate is the yield at the reporting date on AA credit rated 
bonds that have maturity dates approximating to the duration of the 
schemes’ obligations. The calculation is performed by a qualified  
actuary using the projected unit method.  
Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in the statement  
of comprehensive income. 
(iii) Long-term service benefits 
The Group’s net obligation in respect of long-term service benefits, other 
than pension plans, is the amount of future benefit that employees have 
earned in return for their service in the current and prior periods.  
(iv) Share-based payment transactions 
The Group operates equity-settled, share-based compensation plans.  
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the  
grant of the options is recognised as an employee expense, with a 
corresponding increase in equity, over the period that the employees 
unconditionally become entitled to the awards. The fair value of the 
options granted is measured using a stochastic model, taking into  
account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. 
The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined  
by reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the  
impact of any non-market vesting conditions.  
For options remaining outstanding under the Executive Share Option 
Scheme (1999), which ceased to be operated from September 2008  
(see note 26), non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions 
about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable.  
At each reporting date, the entity revises its estimates of the number of 
options that are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact 
of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and  
a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs 
are credited to share capital (nominal value) and share premium when 
the options are exercised. It is probable that an outflow of economic 
benefits will be required to settle the obligation and are discounted to 
present value where the effect is material. 
(q) Provisions 
A provision is recognised in the statement of financial position when the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of a past 
event, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation, 
and it is probable that an outflow of economic benefits will be required  
to settle the obligation and are discounted to present value where the 
effect is material. 
(r) Trade and other payables 
Trade and other payables are stated at their cost. 
(s) Leases 
Property, plant and equipment acquired under a lease that transfers 
substantially all of the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group are 
capitalised as tangible fixed assets. Lease payments are apportioned 
between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability.  
The finance charge is allocated to each period during the lease term so 
as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining 
balance of the liability.  
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income 
statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. 
(t) Taxation 
Income tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred 
tax. Income tax is recognised in the income statement except to the extent 
that it relates to items recognised directly to equity, in which case, it is 
recognised in equity. 
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the 
year, using tax rates enacted at the statement of financial position date, 
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years. 
Deferred tax is provided for using the statement of financial position method, 
providing for temporary differences between the carrying amounts of 
assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts 
used for taxation purposes. The following temporary differences are not 
provided for: goodwill, the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that 
affect neither accounting nor taxable profit and differences relating to 
investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse 
in the foreseeable future and the Group is able to control the reversal of 
such temporary differences. The amount of deferred tax provided is 
based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying 
amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively 
enacted at the statement of financial position date. 
A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable profits will be available against which the asset can  
be utilised. Deferred tax assets are reduced to the extent that it is no 
longer probable that the related tax benefit will be realised. 
 
 
 
 
 
1. Significant accounting policies continued 
(u) Assets held for sale  
Non-current assets, or disposal groups comprising assets and liabilities, 
that are expected to be recovered primarily through sale rather than 
through continuing use, are classified as held for sale. Immediately before 
classification as held for sale, the assets, or components of a disposal 
group, are remeasured in accordance with the Group’s accounting 
policies. Thereafter, generally the assets, or disposal group, are 
measured at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less cost  
to sell.  
Any impairment loss on a disposal group first is allocated to goodwill, 
and then to remaining assets and liabilities on pro rata basis, except  
that no loss is allocated to inventories, financial assets, deferred tax  
assets and employee benefit assets, which continue to be measured in 
accordance with the Group’s accounting policies. Impairment losses on 
initial classification as held for sale and subsequent gains or losses on 
remeasurement are recognised in profit or loss. Gains are not recognised 
in excess of any cumulative impairment loss. 
(v) Critical accounting policies  
The application of the Group’s accounting policies requires management 
to make estimates and assumptions; these estimates and assumptions 
affect the reported assets and liabilities and financial results of the Group. 
Actual outcomes could differ from the estimates and assumptions used. 
The Group’s accounting policies that are most critical to an understanding 
of the results and position of the Group, and the judgements involved in 
their application, are as follows: 
(i) Impairments 
When applying IAS 36, ‘Impairment of Assets’, the Group compares  
the carrying value of goodwill and intangible assets with the higher of 
their net realisable value and value in use to determine whether an 
impairment exists. 
Value in use is calculated by discounting the cash flows expected to be 
generated by the asset/group of assets being tested for evidence of 
impairment. The use of different estimates, assumptions and judgements, 
in particular those involved in (a) determining a value based on our 
current expectations of future conditions and the associated cash flows 
from the Group’s operations, (b) our determination of the level at which 
groups of assets can be reasonably tested for impairment separately from 
other parts of the business and (c) our treatment of centrally held assets, 
could each result in materially different carrying values of assets and 
assessments of impairment. See note 10 for additional information. 
(ii) Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
IAS 19, ‘Employee Benefits’, requires the Group to make assumptions 
including, but not limited to, future asset returns, rates of inflation, 
discount rates and life expectancies. The use of different assumptions, in 
any of the above calculations, could have a material effect on the 
accounting values of the relevant statement of financial position assets 
and liabilities which could also result in a change to the cost of such 
liabilities as recognised in the income statement over time. These 
assumptions are subject to periodic review. See note 25 for additional 
information. 
(iii) Accounting for carbon dioxide (CO2) emissions 
There are currently no accounting standards that specifically address 
accounting for emission allowances. The Group has applied a ‘net liability’ 
approach. Under a ‘net liability’ approach, no assets or government grants 
are recognised when allowances are initially received. This is because they 
are ascribed a nominal value of nil. As allowances granted to the Group are 
used to offset the liability from CO 2 emissions, no accounting entries are 
required so long as the related emissions generated are within the allowance 
received from the government. If such emissions are in excess of the 
allowance received (known as a shortfall position) a provision is made at the 
current market price for carbon credits. In the case where emission quotas are 
acquired through an acquisition, any surplus emission quotas are fair  
valued in accordance with IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations.’

2. Segment reporting continued 
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, requires operating segments to be identified on the same basis as is used internally for the review of performance and 
allocation of resources by the Group Chief Executive (who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8). Further details of these 
business segments are given in the Business Review on pages 2 to 30. Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those 
that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Central administration costs are allocated to the individual segments on a consistent basis year-on-year. 
Assets and liabilities have been analysed by segment at a capital employed level. Capital employed excludes items of a financing nature, taxation 
balances, post-retirement benefit liabilities and non-current asset investments; segmental capital employed comprises identifiable segment assets less 
segmental liabilities. Average capital employed is the average monthly capital employed. The adjusted return on average capital employed is defined 
as operating profit before exceptional items divided by average capital employed. Debt and associated interest is managed at a Group level and 
therefore has not been allocated across the business areas. 
In presenting information by geographical area, external revenue is based on geographical location of customers. Non-current assets exclude investments 
and derivative financial instruments and are based on the geographical location of the assets.

2. Segment reporting continued 
IFRS 8 ‘Operating Segments’, requires operating segments to be identified on the same basis as is used internally for the review of performance and 
allocation of resources by the Group Chief Executive (who is the Chief Operating Decision Maker as defined by IFRS 8). Further details of these 
business segments are given in the Business Review on pages 2 to 30. Segment results include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those 
that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. Central administration costs are allocated to the individual segments on a consistent basis year-on-year. 
Assets and liabilities have been analysed by segment at a capital employed level. Capital employed excludes items of a financing nature, taxation 
balances, post-retirement benefit liabilities and non-current asset investments; segmental capital employed comprises identifiable segment assets less 
segmental liabilities. Average capital employed is the average monthly capital employed. The adjusted return on average capital employed is defined 
as operating profit before exceptional items divided by average capital employed. Debt and associated interest is managed at a Group level and 
therefore has not been allocated across the business areas. 
In presenting information by geographical area, external revenue is based on geographical location of customers. Non-current assets exclude investments 
and derivative financial instruments and are based on the geographical location of the assets.

The Emergency Budget on 22 June 2010 announced that the UK current tax rate will reduce from 28% to 24% over a period of four years from 2011. 
The first reduction from 28% to 26% was substantively enacted by 30 April 2010 and is effective from 1 April 2011. Accordingly the rate applying to 
UK assets and liabilities has also been reduced from 28% to 26%, creating a rate adjustment, which is partly reflected in the consolidated income 
statement, and partly in the consolidated statement of comprehensive income or equity. 
The reduction in rate from 26% to 24% has not yet been substantively enacted; had it been, the effect would have been to reduce the net deferred tax 
liability by £0.2m, of which it is estimated that £4.6m would have been credited to the consolidated income statement and £4.4m would have been 
charged to the statement of comprehensive income.

Basic earnings per share 
The calculation of basic earnings per share at 30 April 2011 is based on the profit attributable to ordinary shareholders of £70.1m (2009/10: £37.9m) 
and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 30 April 2011 of 422.4m (2009/10: 391.0m). The number 
of shares excludes the weighted average number of the Company’s own shares held as treasury shares during the year of 3.4m (2009/10: 2.4m).

and the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding during the year ended 30 April 2011, as adjusted for potentially issuable ordinary 
shares, of 431.0m (2009/10: 399.5m), calculated as follows:

Weighted average number of ordinary shares (diluted) at 30 April  431.0 399.5
Diluted earnings per share  16.3p 9.5p
Adjusted earnings per share 
The Directors believe that the presentation of an adjusted earnings per share amount, being the basic earnings per share adjusted for exceptional items, 
the exceptional tax charge and amortisation of intangible assets, helps to explain the underlying performance of the Group. A reconciliation of basic to

£3.4m (2009/10: £4.3m) is included within exceptional items. The other items above mainly relate to customer relationship. Also within other items 
are acquired emissions quotas which are capitalised as an asset when granted to the Group and treated as a disposal when used to satisfy the Group’s 
obligations or sold, as explained in note 1. 
Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill 
The following segments have cash generating units (CGUs) containing significant carrying amounts of goodwill: 
 2011
£m
2010
£m
UK Packaging 137.3 140.2
Continental European Corrugated Packaging 110.2 7.2
Plastic Packaging 40.3 40.8
 287.8 188.2
Segments with no CGUs containing individually significant goodwill 7.3 8.9
Total goodwill 295.1 197.1
Goodwill of £95.9m arose on the acquisition of Otor on 1 September 2010 and was allocated to the Continental European Corrugated Packaging 
operating segment. 
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired. The recoverable amounts 
of the CGUs are determined from value in use calculations.  
 
 
 
 
 
10. Intangible assets continued 
Impairment tests for cash-generating units containing goodwill continued 
The key assumptions in the value in use calculation were: 
• cash forecasts derived from the latest budgets and forecasts for the two years ending 30 April 2013 as approved by the Directors. Cash flows for the 
following three years were extrapolated assuming an inflationary growth rate of 3% (2009/10: 3%); and 
• the pre-tax discount rate for the Group is 11.0% (2009/10: 11.8%). The Group believes that the risk profiles across the significant markets in which 
it operates are not significantly different, hence the same discount rate is universally applied across all CGUs. 
The headroom for the impairment tests for the CGUs containing significant carrying amounts of goodwill is summarised as follows: 
Headroom 
2011
£m
2010
£m 
UK Packaging 257.2 114.5
Continental European Corrugated Packaging 217.9 1.5
Plastic Packaging 110.5 68.9
The headroom represents the difference between the calculated value in use and the net asset carrying value of the CGU. 
Although management believe the assumptions are realistic, it is possible further impairment would be identified if any of the above key assumptions 
were changed significantly. For instance, factors which could cause impairment are: 
• significant underperformance relative to the forecast results; 
• changes to the way the assets are used or our strategy for the business;  
• a further deterioration in the industry or the wider economy; and 
• an increase in the Group’s pre-tax discount rate. 
The value in use is based upon anticipated discounted future cash flows. The Directors believe the assumptions used are appropriate, but in addition 
have conducted sensitivity analysis to determine the changes in assumptions that would result. 
A one percentage point increase in the pre-tax discount rate to 12% would result in a reduction in the headroom for the CGUs containing significant 
carrying amounts of goodwill within UK Packaging, Continental European Corrugated Packaging, and Plastic Packaging to £175.0m, £168.1m, and 
£91.7m respectively.  
Impairment – goodwill 
The majority of the £2.2m impairment charge in goodwill in the year relates to Multigraphics, a UK business which provides printing services and 
display material for the retail sector. The slow recovery of the non food retail sector in the UK from the recession has resulted in the continuing under 
performance of this business below the Group’s expectations. The carrying amount of Multigraphics CGU was determined to be higher than its 
recoverable amount, which was based on its value in use. This resulted in a full impairment of its goodwill of £1.8m which is recognised in exceptional 
items within the UK Packaging operating segment. 
In order for there to be no further impairments within UK Packaging, adjusted operating profits will need to achieve circa £58m in 2016/17; this 
compares to £54.2m in 2010/11 and £35.4m in 2009/10. The assumptions underpinning UK Packaging adjusted operating profits reflect 
management’s expectations of continuing improvements in levels of margins and profitability by 2016/17. 
Impairment – other intangibles 
The current and expected returns from a product in the Plastic Packaging segment indicate that no future economic benefits are expected to be 
generated. This results in a full impairment of the intangible asset relating to its research and development costs of £1.2m.

Rubezhansk is accounted for using the equity method within these financial statements. 
In 2008/09, the Group fully impaired the carrying value of its investment in Rubezhansk and recognised an exceptional loss of £5.1m, being the 
Group’s share of the after-tax net loss at Rubezhansk incurred in the second half of 2008/09. This was as a result of foreign exchange losses on a 
US$87m loan, following the significant decline in the Ukrainian Hryvnia against the US dollar. Exchange rate movements resulted in Rubezhansk 
breaching its banking covenants. 
In 2009/10 and 2010/11, negotiations have continued with Rubezhank’s bankers following the breaching of the banking covenants. Whilst the 
uncertainty of the financial position continues at Rubezhansk, the Group has not recognised any profits in respect of its investment in the associate.

The Çopikas business, a corrugated packaging business in Turkey, within the Continental European Corrugated Packaging segment, is presented  
as a disposal group held for sale following the commitment of the Board, on 27 April 2010, to a plan to sell the business to focus on growing core 
businesses of scale within its portfolio. The sale of Çopikas for a cash consideration of £4.7m (payable on completion), which was agreed on  
28 May 2010 with Olmuksa International Paper-Sabanci Ambalaj Sanayi Ve Ticaret A.S., is subject to the Turkish Competition Board’s approval  
that is anticipated will take around six weeks. At 30 April 2010, the disposal group comprised assets of £7.4m, less liabilities of £5.7m.  
An exceptional impairment loss of £5.9m on the remeasurement of the disposal group to the lower of its carrying amount and its fair value less costs  
to sell has been recognised in exceptional items, of which £4.7m has been allocated against property, plant and equipment and the remainder  
against inventories. 
Additionally, assets of £0.7m less liabilities of £0.4m of a small packaging business within the UK Packaging segment were presented as assets and 
liabilities held for sale following the commitment of the Board, on 27 April 2010, to dispose of the business.

At 30 April 2011, 85% (30 April 2010: 66%) of the Group’s net borrowings, after taking into account the effect of cross-currency swaps, were 
denominated in euros in order to hedge the underlying assets of the Group’s relevant continental European operations. Interest rates on floating-rate 
borrowings are based on London Interbank Offered Rate (LIBOR), Euro Interbank Offered Rate (EURIBOR) or base rates. 
Bank loan facilities 
In August 2008, the Group entered into a syndicated revolving credit facility of £287.5m, which expires on 29 August 2013. Advances drawn down 
under the facility bear interest at a margin over LIBOR or EURIBOR. 
In August 2010, the Group entered into a term loan facility of €81m with three banks, which will mature on 29 August 2013. Advances drawn down 
bear interest at a margin over EURIBOR. 
Note purchase agreements 
In November 2002, the Group entered into a note purchase agreement with a number of institutions that purchased US$105m of DS Smith Plc’s 6.24% 
senior notes and £25m of 6.85% senior notes, which will mature on 14 November 2012. The Group entered into a swap transaction with a bank 
counterparty under which it made a payment of US$80m in return for €81.6m. The swap counterparty also agreed to pay fixed-rate dollar interest of 
6.24% per annum in exchange for floating euro rate interest at rates linked to EURIBOR. In addition, swap counterparties also agreed to pay fixed-rate 
dollar interest of 6.24% per annum on a principal amount of US$25m in exchange for floating dollar interest linked to dollar LIBOR and fixed-rate 
sterling interest of 6.85% per annum on a principal of £25m in exchange for floating sterling interest linked to sterling LIBOR.

entered into swap transactions with a bank counterparty under which it made payments of US$105m and US$20m in return for €86.5m and €16.5m, 
respectively, and a payment of US$75m in return for £40.8m. The swap counterparty agreed to pay fixed-rate dollar interest of 5.66% per annum and 
5.80% per annum, respectively, in exchange for floating euro rate interest at rates linked to EURIBOR and fixed-rate dollar interest of 5.80% per annum 
in exchange for fixed-rate sterling interest at rates of 6.21% per annum.

Total financial liabilities (1,026.8) (1,045.8) (753.4) (761.8)
The fair value is the amount for which an asset or liability could be exchanged or settled on an arm’s-length basis. For financial instruments carried at 
fair value, market prices or rates are used to determine fair value where an active market exists. The Group uses forward prices for valuing forward 
foreign exchange and commodity contracts and uses valuation models with present value calculations based on market yield curves to value note 
purchase agreements, cross-currency swaps and interest rate swaps. All derivative financial assets and liabilities are shown at fair value on the 
statement of financial position. Under IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’, hedge accounting rules, only portions of the note 
purchase agreements which form part of an effective fair value hedge are carried at fair value in the statement of financial position. The fair value of 
financial assets and liabilities which bear floating rates of interest is estimated to be equivalent to book value. 
IFRS 7 ‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’ requires the classification of fair value measurements using the following fair value hierarchy that reflects the 
significance of the inputs used in making the assessments: 
• Level 1 – quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets and liabilities; 
• Level 2 – inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for the asset or liability, either directly (i.e. as prices) or 
indirectly (i.e. derived from prices); and 
• Level 3 – inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs). 
All of the Group’s financial instruments are Level 2 financial instruments. The Group does not hold any Level 1 or Level 3 financial instruments.

(b) Derivative financial instruments 
The Group enters into derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and 
commodity risks associated with the Group’s underlying business activities and the financing of these activities. All derivatives have been designated  
as effective hedging instruments and are carried at their fair value.

(ii) Fair value hedges 
At 30 April 2011, the Group held interest rate and currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt 
payable by the Group. The receive leg of the swap contracts is largely identical for all critical aspects to the terms of the underlying debt and thus the 
hedging is highly effective. The pre-tax loss on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in the year was £13.5m (2009/10: 
loss of £6.2m) offset by a pre-tax gain on the fair value of the debt of £12.6m (2009/10: gain of £6.1m). 
(iii) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
The Group holds currency swap contracts as hedges of long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries. The pre-tax loss on the hedges recognised in 
equity in the year was £4.7m (2009/10: gain of £5.7m). The loss is matched by a similar gain in equity on the retranslation of the hedged foreign 
subsidiary’s net assets. During the year, hedge ineffectiveness arising from hedges of net investments resulted in a loss of £0.3m recognised in the 
income statement (2009/10: gain of £0.7m). 
(d) Risk identification and risk management 
(i) Capital risk 
The Group funds its operations from the following sources of cash: operating cash flow, borrowings, shareholders’ equity and disposals of peripheral 
businesses, where appropriate. The Group’s objective is to achieve a capital structure that results in an appropriate cost of capital whilst providing 
flexibility in immediate and medium-term funding so as to accommodate material investments or acquisitions. The Group also aims to maintain a strong 
statement of financial position and to provide continuity of financing by having a range of maturities and borrowings from a variety of sources. 
The Group’s overall treasury objectives are to ensure sufficient funds are available to carry out its strategy and to manage financial risks. The Group’s 
treasury strategy is controlled through the Treasury Committee, which meets regularly and includes the Group Chief Executive, the Group Finance 
Director and the Group Treasurer. The Group Treasury Function operates in accordance with policies and procedures approved by the Board and 
controlled by the Group Treasurer. The function arranges funding for the Group, provides a service to operations and implements strategies for interest 
rate, foreign exchange rate and energy exposure management. 
(ii) Market risk 
Market risk is the risk that the fair value or future cash flows of a financial instrument fluctuate because of a change in market prices. The Group is 
exposed to changes in interest rates, foreign currency exchange rates and commodity prices. 
Interest rate risk 
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk as entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed by the 
Group maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings and by the use of interest rate swap contracts. Hedging activities  
are evaluated regularly to align with expectations of changes in interest rates; ensuring optimal hedging strategies are applied, by either positioning the 
statement of financial position or protecting interest rate expense through interest rate cycles. The Group’s exposures to interest rates on financial assets 
and financial liabilities are detailed in the liquidity risk management section of this note. 
At 30 April 2011, 58% (30 April 2010: 44%) of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings were fixed for a period of at least one year. The 
sensitivity analysis below shows the impact on profit and total equity of a 100 basis points rise in market interest rates (representing management’s 
assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates) in all currencies in which the Group had variable rate borrowings at 30 April. 
To calculate the impact on the income statement for the year, the interest rates on all external interest-bearing loans and cash deposits have been 
increased by 100 basis points, and the resulting increase in the net interest charge has been adjusted for the effect of the Group’s interest rate 
derivatives. The effect on equity includes the above impact on the income statement and the impact of a 100 basis points increase in interest rates  
on the market values of the Group’s interest rate derivatives.  
The results are presented before non-controlling interests and tax.

Under interest rate swap contracts the Group agrees to exchange the difference between fixed and floating interest rate amounts calculated on agreed 
notional principal amounts. At 30 April 2011, losses of £0.9m (30 April 2010: losses of £3.5m) (net of tax) are deferred in equity in respect of cash 
flow hedges of interest rate risk. This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement,  
which will occur over time to 2016. During the year, losses of £1.9m deferred in equity were transferred to the income statement (2009/10: £nil).

Foreign exchange risk 
Foreign exchange risk on investments 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from net investments in Group entities, the functional currencies of which differ from the Group’s 
presentational currency. The Group hedges this exposure through borrowings denominated in foreign currencies and through cross-currency swaps. 
Gains and losses for hedges of net investments are recognised in reserves. 
Foreign exchange risk on borrowings 
The Group is exposed to foreign exchange risk on borrowings denominated in foreign currencies. The Group hedges this exposure through cross-
currency swaps designated as either cash flow or fair value hedges.  
Foreign exchange risk on transactions 
Foreign currency transaction risk arises where a business unit makes product sales and material purchases in a currency other than its functional 
currency. Part of this risk is hedged using foreign exchange contracts which are designated as cash flow hedges.  
At 30 April 2011, losses of £0.6m (30 April 2010: gains of £1.8m) (net of tax) are deferred in equity in respect of cash flow hedges. This will be 
recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged item also affects the income statement, which occurs within two years. During the 
year, £1.0m of gains deferred in equity were transferred to the income statement (2009/10: gains of £1.4m). 
The Group’s main currency exposures are from the Euro and US dollar. The following significant exchange rates applied during the year: 
 2011 2010 
 Average Closing Average Closing
US Dollar 1.565 1.668 1.602 1.531
Euro 1.176 1.124 1.132 1.151
The following sensitivity analysis shows the impact on the Group’s results of a 10% change in the year-end exchange rate of sterling against all other 
currencies. 10% represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in foreign exchange rates. The analysis is only on financial 
instruments denominated in a foreign currency and excludes the impact of financial instruments designated as net investment hedges. Loans that are 
treated as net investment hedges are not recorded within the impact on the Group’s profit as the impact of foreign exchange movements on these are 
offset by equal and opposite movements in the foreign assets that the instruments hedge. 
The results are presented before non-controlling interests and tax.

Commodity risk 
The Group’s main commodity exposures are to changes in UK gas and UK electricity prices. Part of this commodity price risk is managed by a combination 
of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments. At 30 April 2011, gains of £4.5m (30 April 2010: losses of £5.7m) (net of tax) is deferred 
in equity in respect of cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39. This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged 
item also affects the income statement, which occurs within two years. During the year, gains of £3.2m deferred in equity were transferred to the 
income statement (2009/10: gains of £6.0m). 
The following table details the Group’s sensitivity to a 10% increase in these prices, which is management’s assessment of the reasonably possible 
approximation of how much markets can move on average, over any given year. In some years prices will be less volatile and in others they may be 
more volatile. A decrease of 10% in these prices would produce an opposite effect on equity. As all of the Group’s commodity financial instruments 
achieve hedge accounting under IAS 39, there is no impact on profit for either financial year.

(ii) Fair value hedges 
At 30 April 2011, the Group held interest rate and currency swap contracts as fair value hedges of the interest rate and currency risk on fixed rate debt 
payable by the Group. The receive leg of the swap contracts is largely identical for all critical aspects to the terms of the underlying debt and thus the 
hedging is highly effective. The pre-tax loss on the hedging derivative instruments taken to the income statement in the year was £13.5m (2009/10: 
loss of £6.2m) offset by a pre-tax gain on the fair value of the debt of £12.6m (2009/10: gain of £6.1m). 
(iii) Hedges of net investments in foreign operations 
The Group holds currency swap contracts as hedges of long-term investments in foreign subsidiaries. The pre-tax loss on the hedges recognised in 
equity in the year was £4.7m (2009/10: gain of £5.7m). The loss is matched by a similar gain in equity on the retranslation of the hedged foreign 
subsidiary’s net assets. During the year, hedge ineffectiveness arising from hedges of net investments resulted in a loss of £0.3m recognised in the 
income statement (2009/10: gain of £0.7m). 
(d) Risk identification and risk management 
(i) Capital risk 
The Group funds its operations from the following sources of cash: operating cash flow, borrowings, shareholders’ equity and disposals of peripheral 
businesses, where appropriate. The Group’s objective is to achieve a capital structure that results in an appropriate cost of capital whilst providing 
flexibility in immediate and medium-term funding so as to accommodate material investments or acquisitions. The Group also aims to maintain a strong

The Group’s main commodity exposures are to changes in UK gas and UK electricity prices. Part of this commodity price risk is managed by a combination 
of physical supply agreements and derivative instruments. At 30 April 2011, gains of £4.5m (30 April 2010: losses of £5.7m) (net of tax) is deferred 
in equity in respect of cash flow hedges in accordance with IAS 39. This will be recycled to the income statement in the period in which the hedged

(iii) Credit risk 
Credit risk is the risk that a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument will fail to perform or fail to pay amounts due, causing financial loss to the 
Group. In the current economic environment, the Group has placed increased emphasis on the management of credit risk. The carrying amount of financial 
assets at 30 April 2011 was £590.7m (30 April 2010: £455.6m) and is analysed in note 21(a). This represents the maximum credit exposure.  
The majority of the Group’s trade receivables are due for maturity within 90 days. Concentrations of credit risk with respect to trade receivables are 
limited due to the Group’s customer base being large and diverse. Management believes there is no further credit risk provision required in excess  
of the normal provision for bad and doubtful debts (see note 15).

• except on initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination and, at the time of the transaction, affects 
neither the accounting profit nor the taxable profit or loss; and 
• in respect of taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, except where the timing of the reversal of the 
temporary differences can be controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary differences will not reverse in the foreseeable future.

The provision for employee benefits mainly represents that for long-service awards. The restructuring provision includes amounts associated with the 
closures and restructuring costs described in note 4. Other provisions mainly relate to an acquired onerous service contract and to provisions for vacant 
leaseholds and various legal claims. The timing of the utilisation of these provisions is uncertain, except where the associated costs are contractual,  
in which case the provision is utilised over the time period specified in the contract.

Issued, allotted, called up and fully paid 435.6 393.4 43.6 39.3
During the year, the Company issued 39,296,253 ordinary shares of 10p at an issue price of £1.20 per share. The gross proceeds of the placing 
shares were £47.2m. A further 2,924,144 ordinary shares of 10p each were issued via a placing in respect of employee share options. The net 
movement in share capital and share premium are disclosed in the Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity on page 63. 
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings  
of the Company. In respect of the Company’s shares that are held by the Group (see below), all rights are suspended until those shares are reissued.  
Translation reserve 
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations, as well  
as from the translation of liabilities that hedge the Company’s net investment in a foreign subsidiary.  
Hedging reserve 
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments related to hedged 
transactions that have not yet occurred.  
Share premium 
The share premium account represents the difference between the issue price and the nominal value of shares issued.  
Own shares  
The reserve for the Company’s own shares comprises the cost of the Company’s shares held by the Group. The Group operates a General Employee 
Benefit Trust, which acquires shares in the Company that can be used to satisfy the requirements of the Executive Share Option Scheme, Performance 
Share Plan (PSP), Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP), Replacement Deferred Share Bonus Plan (RDSBP). At 30 April 2011, the Trust held 5.2m shares 
(30 April 2010: 2.4m shares). The market value of the shares at 30 April 2011 was £11.3m (30 April 2010: £3.2m). Dividends receivable on the 
shares owned by the Trust have been waived. 
Non-controlling interests 
At the beginning of the year, the Group had a liability of £3.5m and a corresponding entry against non-controlling interests in respect of the non-
controlling shareholders’ put option in Toscana Ondulati SpA. This amount was calculated with reference to the recent profitability of the company  
using a multiple based formula. The fair value of the put options increased during the year by £0.4m (2009/10: £0.4m). This charge was recorded 
within finance costs through the income statement and then transferred out of retained earnings into non-controlling interests.  
 
 
 
 
 
25. Post-retirement benefits  
Liability for defined benefit obligations 
The Group operates a funded, defined benefit scheme in the UK, the DS Smith Group Pension scheme (‘the Group scheme’). On 30 April 2011,  
the Group scheme was closed for future accrual. The Group made an agreed contribution of £30.1m to the Group scheme in 2010/11 (2009/10: 
£15.6m). The Group operates various local pension arrangements for overseas operations and unfunded arrangements for senior executives; these are, 
in aggregate, not significant to the Group. The following financial information includes amounts related to these other arrangements, where 
appropriate. A charge over certain assets of the Group has been made as security for certain of the unfunded arrangements. The most recent full 
actuarial valuation of the Group scheme was as at 30 April 2010. All UK valuations used the projected unit method.  
As a result of the closure of the Group scheme to future accrual, a curtailment gain of £35.3m was recorded. This has been treated as an exceptional 
item (see note 4). 
Liability for defined benefit obligations 
Principal actuarial assumptions are as follows:

Expected return on plan assets 5.8% 6.5% 6.7% 6.7% 6.6%
The sensitivity of the liabilities in the main UK scheme to the key assumptions above is summarised below: 
 Increase in 
pension liability 
£m 
0.5% decrease in discount rate (75.0)
0.5% increase in inflation (65.0)

Pensioner currently aged 65 21.0 23.2 19.5 22.4
Member currently aged 45 22.4 24.8 21.3 24.1
A change in the statutory revaluation of deferred pension increases, which will be based on the Consumer Prices Index (CPI) (previously indexation was 
referenced to the Retail Prices Index (RPI)) has been reflected in the actuarial assumptions for the Group scheme. A similar change in assumptions has 
been made for future pension increases, but it should be noted that the Trustee of the Group scheme will keep this indexation under review. 
The amounts recognised in the statement of financial position in respect of post-retirement benefits and the expected long-term rates of return applied  
to the schemes’ assets in the relevant financial period, are as follows:

The actual return on scheme assets was £56.8m (2009/10: £156.2m). The Group expects to pay approximately £15m in contributions to the Group 
defined benefit pension schemes in the year ending 30 April 2012. 
26. Share-based payment expense  
The Group’s share-based payment arrangements are as follows: 
(i) A Performance Share Plan (PSP). Awards under the PSP normally vest after three years subject to remaining in service and the satisfaction of 
performance conditions measured over the three financial years commencing with the year of grant. Awards have been made under the PSP in 
2008, 2009 and 2010. The performance conditions are as detailed below (see the Remuneration Report on pages 46 and 47). 
• The 2008 award is subject to three equally-weighted performance measures: 
(i) the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) compared to the constituents of the Industrial Goods and Services Supersector within  
the FTSE 250; 
(ii) average adjusted earnings per share (EPS); and 
(iii) average adjusted return on average capital employed (ROACE). 
For those senior executives working in one of the four Business Segments, the three measures (equally weighted) are TSR (as above), average 
adjusted operating profit and average adjusted ROACE for the relevant segment. 
• The 2009 award is subject to two performance measures: 
(i) 80% of each award based on a TSR component as per above; and 
(ii) 20% of each award based on average adjusted ROACE. 
For those senior executives working in one of the four Business Segments, the two measures are TSR and ROACE for the relevant segment. 
• The 2010 award is subject to three performance measures: 
(i) 50% of each award based on a TSR component as per above;  
(ii) 25% of each award based on average adjusted EPS; and 
(iii) 25% of each award based on average adjusted ROACE.

(ii) Replacement 2007 and 2008 Long Term Incentive Plans for Mr M W Roberts. The Replacement 2007 LTIP vested on 10 October 2010 and the 
Replacement 2008 LTIP is due to vest on 17 October 2011. The Replacement 2008 LTIP award is subject to a performance condition measuring 
the TSR of McBride plc up to the date Mr Roberts joined the Company and thereafter the Company’s TSR against a comparator group  
of companies comprising the FTSE 250 Index (excluding investment trusts) constituted as at the date of grant of the award over a three-year 
performance period commencing on 1 July 2008. The award will vest in full if the TSR is ranked in the upper quartile of the comparator group  
and on a straight-line basis if the TSR is ranked between median and upper quartile. There were no performance conditions governing the vesting 
of the Replacement 2007 LTIP award. The Replacement 2007 LTIP was fully exercised in October 2010. 
(iii) The Replacement Deferred Shares Award and the Substitute Share Bonus Award are subject to substantially the same terms as the Company’s 
Deferred Share Bonus Plan, except that they will vest on 1 September 2012 and 1 September 2013 respectively. Mr Roberts will be entitled to  
a cash payment on vesting, representing a value equivalent to the dividends which would have been paid on his vested shares while they were 
subject to his awards. There are no performance conditions governing the vesting of the Replacement Deferred Shares Award and the Substitute 
Share Bonus Award because the awards they replicate had no performance conditions attaching to them. 
(iv) The Recruitment Award is subject to substantially the same terms as the awards made under the Company’s PSP in 2009. The award is due to vest 
on 19 October 2012.  
(v) A Deferred Share Bonus Plan (DSBP) is operated for Executive Directors. Shares awarded to Directors under the Plan will vest automatically if the 
Director is still employed by the Company three years after the grant of the award. 
(vi) An Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS). This scheme ceased to be operated from September 2008. In normal circumstances, the vesting of any 
options granted under the ESOS is subject to remaining in service and that the growth in the Company’s normalised earnings per share equals or 
exceeds the growth in the UK Retail Prices Index plus an average of 3% per annum over the three financial years commencing with the year of grant. 
(vii) A Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). This scheme ceased to be operated from September 2008. In normal circumstances LTIP awards vest on the third 
anniversary of grant subject to satisfaction of performance conditions and remaining in service. Performance is measured over a single period of 
three financial years (commencing with the year in which the award is made) and is based on the Company’s total shareholder return 
performance relative to the constituents of the FTSE Mid 250 Index (excluding investment trusts). Full vesting occurs for a ranking of upper quartile 
or higher reducing on a straight-line basis to 30% of the award vesting for median performance. None of the award vests for below median 
performance. No awards will vest, irrespective of total shareholder return performance, unless the Company’s earnings per share growth matches 
or exceeds the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the three-year period.  
Full details of the awards described in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 49 to 52.

or higher reducing on a straight-line basis to 30% of the award vesting for median performance. None of the award vests for below median 
performance. No awards will vest, irrespective of total shareholder return performance, unless the Company’s earnings per share growth matches 
or exceeds  
the growth in the Retail Prices Index over the three-year period.  
Full details of the awards described in (i), (ii), (iii), (iv) and (v) are set out in the Remuneration Report on pages 49 to 52.

falls within one year; £0.6m (30 April 2010: £0.9m) between one and five years; and £nil (30 April 2010: £nil) after five years. 
30. Capital commitments  
As at 30 April 2011, the Group had committed to incur capital expenditure of £25.4m (30 April 2010: £5.3m). 
 
 
 
 
 
31. Acquisitions and divestments 
(a) Otor Group 
On 1 September 2010, the Group acquired 100% of the voting share capital of Otor Finance S.A., a holding company which owns and controls 80% 
of Otor S.A. On this date and as part of the same acquisition, the Group acquired an additional 15% of the voting share capital of Otor S.A. Otor S.A. 
is a leading fast moving consumer goods (FMCG) focused corrugated packaging company in France. As a result, the Group’s total voting and ownership 
interest in Otor S.A. at acquisition date was 95%. Total consideration transferred comprised cash of £156.6m. As noted below, in October 2010 the 
Group increased its ownership interest to 100%. 
Taking control of the Otor Group satisfies a number of the Group’s key strategic objectives, in particular the development of a strong continental European 
Corrugated Packaging business focused on the FMCG sector and strengthening significantly the Group’s French presence. The Group expects the 
acquisition will have enhanced long-term growth potential through the Otor Group’s strong business across France and from increased exposure to the 
more resilient FMCG markets. Combining the Otor Group’s successful and well-established Corrugated Packaging business with the Group’s existing 
French operations has created a platform with significantly enhanced capabilities to address the needs of key corrugated packaging customers both in 
France and more broadly in continental Europe. 
In the period 1 September 2010 to 30 April 2011, the Otor Group contributed revenue of £197.1m and profit after tax of £9.1m to the Group’s 
results. In these eight months, Otor generated adjusted operating profits of €21.7m, with a return on sales of 9.4%, and an annualised return on 
invested capital of 13.6%. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 May 2010, management estimates for the twelve months to 30 April 2011, that the 
Group consolidated revenue would have been £2,566.0m, and consolidated profit after tax would have been £76.1m.

Corrugated Packaging business focused on the FMCG sector and strengthening significantly the Group’s French presence. The Group expects the 
acquisition will have enhanced long-term growth potential through the Otor Group’s strong business across France and from increased exposure to the 
more resilient FMCG markets. Combining the Otor Group’s successful and well-established Corrugated Packaging business with the Group’s existing 
French operations has created a platform with significantly enhanced capabilities to address the needs of key corrugated packaging customers both in 
France and more broadly in continental Europe. 
In the period 1 September 2010 to 30 April 2011, the Otor Group contributed revenue of £197.1m and profit after tax of £9.1m to the Group’s 
results. In these eight months, Otor generated adjusted operating profits of €21.7m, with a return on sales of 9.4%, and an annualised return on 
invested capital of 13.6%. If the acquisition had occurred on 1 May 2010, management estimates for the twelve months to 30 April 2011, that the 
Group consolidated revenue would have been £2,566.0m, and consolidated profit after tax would have been £76.1m.

DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2011 www.dssmith.uk.com FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
Notes to the Consolidated Financial Statements continued 
 
 
31. Acquisitions and divestments continued 
(a) Otor Group continued 
The fair value adjustments relate to the valuation of land and buildings included within property, plant and equipment, and identified intangible assets  
as determined by external valuation firms. The intangible assets acquired as part of the acquisition relate to customer relationships (£19.1m), patented 
technology (£4.1m), software (£2.5m), and research and development (£0.8m). 
Deferred tax is recognised on the temporary timing differences created by the fair value adjustments. 
The trade receivables comprise gross contractual amounts due of £52.9m. At the acquisition date, it is estimated that contractual cash flows of £1.8m 
will not be collected.  
The goodwill arising on the acquisition of Otor amounting to £95.9m (which is not expected to be tax deductible) consists of anticipated synergies from 
integrating Otor into the Group’s existing Continental European Corrugated Packaging operations and the skills and technical talent of Otor’s 
workforce.  
Acquisition related costs 
The Group incurred acquisition related costs of £7.2m on professional advisory fees and due diligence costs. These fees have been included in 
administrative expenses in the Group’s condensed consolidated income statement. Due to the nature of these costs, they have been reported as 
exceptional costs. 
Acquisition of non-controlling interests 
In October 2010, the Group acquired an additional 5% interest in Otor S.A. for £8.5m in cash, increasing its ownership in the Otor Group from  
95% to 100%. The Group recognised a decrease in non-controlling interests of £3.3m and a decrease in retained earnings of £5.2m, to reflect this 
transaction.  
(b) Divestments 
On 1 October 2010, the Group sold its subsidiary in Turkey, DS Smith Çopikas A.S., for a consideration of £4.8m. 
On 30 April 2011, the Group sold its business in the UK, DS Smith Sacks, for a cash consideration of £1.1m.

OF MEETING
DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2011 www.dssmith.uk.com Notes to the Company Balance Sheet Prepared in Accordance 
with UK GAAP 
 
  
1. Significant accounting policies 
A summary of the significant accounting policies, which have been 
applied consistently, is set out below:  
(a) Accounting basis  
The financial statements of DS Smith Plc (the Company) have been 
prepared on a going concern basis and under the historical cost 
convention and have been prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 2006 and UK Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (GAAP). 
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt 
from the requirement to present its own profit and loss account.  
Under FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow Statements’, the Company is exempt from the 
requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that the 
parent undertaking includes the Company in its own consolidated 
financial statements. 
The Company has also taken advantage of the exemption in FRS 29 
‘Financial Instruments: Disclosures’, not to present Company only 
information as the disclosures provided in the notes to the consolidated 
financial statements comply with the requirements of this standard. 
(b) Income recognition 
Dividend income from subsidiary undertakings is recognised in the  
profit and loss account when declared by the subsidiary undertaking. 
(c) Tangible fixed assets  
Tangible fixed assets are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation. 
Depreciation is calculated to write off the cost or valuation less the 
estimated residual value of all tangible fixed assets in equal annual 
instalments over their estimated useful lives at the following rates:  
Plant and equipment  3 – 5 years 
Leasehold improvements  over the period of the lease 
Land is not depreciated.  
(d) Fixed asset investments  
Fixed asset investments are valued at cost less provisions for impairment. 
(e) Deferred taxation  
In accordance with FRS 19, deferred tax is provided in full on timing 
differences that result in an obligation at the balance sheet date to pay 
more tax, or a right to pay less tax, at a future date, at rates expected to 
apply when they crystallise, provided at current tax rates and based on 
current legislation. Timing differences arise from the inclusion of items  
of income and expenditure in taxation computations in periods different  
from those in which they are included in the financial statements.  
Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is regarded  
as more likely than not that they will be recovered. Deferred tax assets  
and liabilities are not discounted.  
(f) Foreign currencies  
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are 
translated at the rates of exchange ruling at the financial year end. 
Exchange differences arising on translation are taken to the profit  
and loss account. 
(g) Pension contributions  
The amounts charged to operating profit in respect of defined benefit 
arrangements are the current service costs and gains and losses on 
settlements and curtailments. They are included as part of staff costs.  
Past service costs are recognised immediately in the profit and loss 
account if the benefits have vested. If the benefits have not vested 
immediately, the costs are recognised over the period until vesting  
occurs. Actuarial gains and losses are recognised immediately in  
the statement of total recognised gains and losses. 
Pension scheme assets are measured at fair value and liabilities are 
measured on an actuarial basis using the projected unit method and 
discounted at a rate equivalent to the current rate of return on a high 
quality corporate bond of equivalent currency and duration to the  
scheme liabilities. The resulting defined benefit net asset or liability,  
net of the related deferred tax, is presented. 
(h) Financial instruments  
Financial instruments are reported in accordance with FRS 26 ‘Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’. 
The Group uses derivative financial instruments, primarily interest rate, 
currency and commodity swaps, to manage interest rate, currency and 
commodity risks associated with the Group’s underlying business activities 
and the financing of these activities. The Group has a policy not to, and 
does not undertake any speculative activity in these instruments.  
Such derivative financial instruments are initially recognised at fair value on  
the date on which a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at fair value. Derivatives are carried as assets when the fair  
value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is negative.  
Derivative financial instruments are accounted for as hedges when 
designated as hedges at the inception of the contract and when the 
financial instruments provide an effective hedge of the underlying risk.  
Any gains or losses arising from the hedging instruments are offset against 
the hedged items.  
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classified as:  
• fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes in the fair 
value of a recognised asset or liability; and 
• cash flow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in cash  
flows that is either attributable to a particular risk associated with a 
recognised asset or liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. 
(i) Share options  
The Company operates an equity-settled, share-based compensation plan. 
The fair value of the employee services received in exchange for the grant 
of the options is recognised as an expense. The fair value of the options 
granted is measured using a stochastic model, taking into account the 
terms and conditions upon which the options were granted. The total 
amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference 
to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-
market vesting conditions. Non-market vesting conditions are included in 
assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become 
exercisable. At each balance sheet date, the entity revises its estimates  
of the numbers of options that are expected to become exercisable.  
It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any,  
in the income statement, and a corresponding adjustment to equity. 
The proceeds received as a result of such options being exercised, net of 
any directly attributable transaction costs, are credited to share capital 
(nominal value) and share premium when the options are exercised. 
Where applicable, the fair value of employee services received by subsidiary 
undertakings within the DS Smith Plc Group in exchange for options granted 
by the Company is recognised as an expense in the financial statements of the 
subsidiary by means of a recharge from the Company.

NOTES 
(i) Only those Members registered in the Register of Members 
of the Company as at 6pm on 4 September 2011 shall be 
entitled to attend and vote at the Meeting in respect of the 
number of shares registered in their names at that time. 
(ii) Members are entitled to appoint a proxy to exercise all or any 
of their rights to attend and speak and vote on their behalf at 
the Meeting. A shareholder may appoint more than one proxy 
in relation to the Annual General Meeting provided that each 
proxy is appointed to exercise the rights attached to a different 
share or shares held by that shareholder. A proxy need not be 
a shareholder of the Company. 
(iii) A proxy may be appointed by any of the following 
methods: 
• completing and returning the enclosed Form of Proxy; or 
• by logging onto the Registrars’ website 
www.sharevote.co.uk using the Voting ID, Task ID and 
Shareholder Reference Number printed on the Form of 
Proxy enclosed. Shareholders who have already registered 
with the Registrars’ online portfolio service Shareview 
can submit a proxy by logging into their profile at 
www.shareview.co.uk and clicking on the link to vote 
under “Your DS Smith Plc holding details”; or 
• members of CREST should use the CREST electronic 
appointment service (see (vii) below). 
 If two or more valid but differing appointments of a proxy 
are received in respect of the same share for use at the 
same meeting, the one which is last received (regardless 
of its date or the date of its signature) shall be treated as 
replacing and revoking the others as regards that share; if 
the Company is unable to determine which was received 
last, none of them shall be treated as valid in respect of 
that share. To be effective, Forms of Proxy must reach the 
Registrars at the address shown on the Form not later than 
48 hours before the time of the Meeting. Completion and 
return of the Form will not, however, prevent a Member from 
attending and voting at the Meeting. A Member must inform 
the Registrars in writing of any termination of the authority 
of a proxy. 
(iv) Any person to whom this notice is sent who is a person 
nominated under Section 146 of the Companies Act 2006 
to enjoy information rights (a ‘Nominated Person’) may, 
under an agreement between them and the shareholder by 
whom they were nominated, have a right to be appointed 
(or to have someone else appointed) as a proxy for the 
Annual General Meeting. If a Nominated Person has no 
such proxy appointment right or does not wish to exercise  
it, they may, under any such agreement, have a right to  
give instructions to the shareholder as to the exercise of 
voting rights. 
 
 
 
 
(v) The statement of rights of shareholders in relation to the 
appointment of proxies in Notes (ii) and (iii) above does  
not apply to Nominated Persons. The rights described in 
these paragraphs can only be exercised by shareholders  
of the Company. 
(vi) Nominated persons are reminded that they should contact 
the registered holder of their shares (and not the Company) 
on matters relating to their investments in the Company. 
(vii) CREST Members who wish to appoint a proxy or proxies 
through the CREST electronic proxy appointment service 
may do so for the Meeting to be held on 6 September 2011 
and any adjournment(s) thereof by using the procedures 
described in the CREST Manual. CREST personal Members 
or other CREST sponsored Members, and those CREST 
Members who have appointed a voting service provider(s), 
should refer to their CREST sponsor or voting service 
provider(s), who will be able to take the appropriate action 
on their behalf. 
 In order for a proxy appointment or instruction made using 
the CREST service to be valid, the appropriate CREST 
message (a ‘CREST Proxy Instruction’) must be properly 
authenticated in accordance with Euroclear’s specifications 
and must contain the information required for such 
instructions, as described in the CREST Manual. The 
message, regardless of whether it constitutes the appointment 
of a proxy or an amendment to the instruction given to a 
previously appointed proxy must, in order to be valid,  
be transmitted so as to be received by the issuer’s agent  
(ID RA19) by the latest time for receipt of proxy appointments 
specified in (iii) above. For this purpose, the time of receipt 
will be taken to be the time (as determined by the timestamp 
applied to the message by the CREST Applications Host) 
from which the issuer’s agent is able to retrieve the message 
by enquiry to CREST in the manner prescribed by CREST. 
After this time any change of instructions to proxies 
appointed through CREST should be communicated to the 
appointee through other means. 
 CREST Members and, where applicable, their CREST 
sponsors or voting service providers should note that 
Euroclear does not make available special procedures in 
CREST for any particular messages. Normal system timings 
and limitations will therefore apply in relation to the input of 
CREST Proxy Instructions. It is the responsibility of the CREST 
Member concerned to take (or, if the CREST Member is 
a CREST personal Member or sponsored Member or has 
appointed a voting service provider(s), to procure that his 
CREST sponsor or voting service provider(s) take(s)) such 
action as shall be necessary to ensure that a message is 
transmitted by means of the CREST system by any particular 
time. In this connection, CREST Members and, where 
applicable, their CREST sponsors or voting service providers 
are referred, in particular, to those sections of the CREST 
Manual concerning practical limitations of the CREST system 
and timings.  
 The Company may treat as invalid a CREST Proxy Instruction 
in the circumstances set out in Regulation 35(5)(a) of the 
Uncertificated Securities Regulations 2001. The CREST 
Manual can be reviewed at www.euroclear.com/CREST. 
(viii) As at 22 June 2011 (being the latest practicable date prior 
to publication of this document), the Company’s issued 
share capital consists of 435,581,290 ordinary shares, 
carrying one vote each. Therefore, the total voting rights in 
the Company as at 22 June 2011 are 435,581,290. 
(ix) A member of the Comp-any which is a corporation may 
authorise a person or persons to act as its representative(s) 
at the Annual General Meeting. In accordance with the 
provisions of the Companies Act 2006 (as amended by  
the Companies (Shareholders’ Rights) Regulations 2009),  
each such representative may exercise (on behalf of the 
corporation) the same powers as the corporation could 
exercise if it were an individual member of the Company, 
provided that they do not do so in relation to the same 
shares. It is therefore no longer necessary to nominate a 
designated corporate representative. 
(x) Under section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 members 
meeting the threshold requirements set out in that section 
have the right to require the Company to publish on a 
website a statement setting out any matter relating to: (i) the 
audit of the Company’s accounts (including the auditor’s 
report and the conduct of the audit) that are to be laid 
before the Annual General Meeting; or (ii) any circumstance 
connected with an auditor of the Company ceasing to hold 
office since the previous meeting at which annual accounts 
and reports were laid in accordance with section 437 of the 
Companies Act 2006. The Company may not require the 
shareholders requesting any such website publication to  
pay its expenses in complying with sections 527 or 528 of 
the Companies Act 2006. Where the Company is required 
to place a statement on a website under section 527 of the 
Companies Act 2006, it must forward the statement to the 
Company’s auditor not later than the time when it makes  
the statement available on the website. The business which 
may be dealt with at the Annual General Meeting includes 
any statement that the Company has been required under 
section 527 of the Companies Act 2006 to publish on  
a website. 
(xi) Any member attending the Meeting has the right to ask 
questions. The Company must cause to be answered any 
such question relating to the business being dealt with at the 
Meeting but no such answer need be given if (a) to do so 
would interfere unduly with the preparation for the Meeting 
or involve the disclosure of confidential information, (b) the 
answer has already been given on a website in the form  
of an answer to a question, or (c) it is undesirable in the 
interests of the Company or the good order of the Meeting 
that the question be answered.  121

Explanatory notes on the resolutions 
Resolution 1: 
Report and financial statements 
The Directors present to shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting the Reports of the Directors and Auditors and the 
financial statements of the Company for the year ended 30 April 
2011. These are contained in the Annual Report. 
Resolution 2: 
Declaration of a final dividend 
Final dividends declared by shareholders must not exceed the 
amount recommended by the Directors. By passing Resolution 2, 
shareholders will declare a final dividend. The amount of the final 
dividend recommended by the Directors is 4.5 Pence Net Per 
ordinary share.  
Resolution 3: 
Approval of Report on Remuneration 
As required by section 439 of the Companies Act 2006, 
shareholder approval is sought for the Remuneration Report set out 
on pages 45 to 53. 
Resolution 4-9: 
Re-election of Directors 
The Articles of Association of the Company require that all 
Directors retire from office at least once every three years but if 
eligible can submit themselves for re-election by shareholders. 
However, following the publication of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code by the FRC in June 2010 which recommends 
that directors of companies in the FTSE 350 be subject to annual 
re-election, the Directors have resolved that the Chairman and non-
Executive Directors will retire and stand for re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting and currently intend to 
repeat this process annually thereafter. The Directors have 
resolved, however, that the Executive Directors will remain subject 
to the three year rotation cycle in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association and their performance will be subject to the 
existing succession planning process.  
Mr Dryden will retire, as he would otherwise have served for  
over three years without re-election by the date of the next Annual 
General Meeting, and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election 
at this year’s Annual General Meeting. Mr Dryden is the  
Group Finance Director and a member of the General Purposes 
Committee. Messrs Johnson, Bunker, Davis, Mellier and Nicholls 
will retire and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election at 
this year’s Annual General Meeting. Mr Johnson is the Chairman 
of the Board and of the Nomination Committee. Mr Bunker is  
the Senior Independent Director, and a member of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees. Mr Davis is Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee and a member of the Audit  
and Nomination Committees. Mr Mellier is a member of the 
Remuneration Committee. Mr Nicholls is Chairman of the Audit 
Committee and a member of the Nomination Committee. 
Having considered the performance of and contribution made  
by each of the Directors and following formal performance 
evaluation, the Board remains satisfied that and the Chairman 
confirms that the performance of each Director standing for re-
election continues to be effective and to demonstrate commitment 
to the role and as such the Board recommends their re-election.  
A biography of each Director appears on page 38 of the  
 
 
 
 
Annual Report and appears on the Company’s website at 
www.dssmith.uk.com. 
Resolutions 10-11: 
Re-appointment of Auditors and Auditors’ remuneration 
The auditors of a company must be re-appointed at each general 
meeting at which accounts are presented. Resolution 10 proposes 
the re-appointment of the Company’s existing auditors, Deloitte LLP, 
until the next Annual General Meeting and Resolution 11 gives 
authority to the Directors to determine the auditors’ remuneration. 
Resolution 12: 
Approval of new Sharesave Plan 
It is proposed in Resolution 12 that shareholders approve both the 
existing rules and amendments to the rules of the DS Smith 2011 
Sharesave Plan (the ‘Sharesave Plan’) so as to allow the Company 
to satisfy Sharesave options with new issue and treasury shares, 
as well as existing shares purchased in the market. 
The Sharesave Plan is an all-employee plan approved by HM 
Revenue & Customs (HMRC) so that UK tax-advantaged options 
may be granted to UK employees. The use of Sharesave plans to 
encourage wider employee share ownership is well established  
in the UK and the Company previously offered Sharesave to its 
employees until 1999. The Sharesave Plan was adopted by the 
Company on 26 November 2010 and an initial offer of three year 
options under the Sharesave Plan was made to UK employees in 
January 2011. The Company’s current intention is to make offers  
of three year options under the Sharesave Plan every three years 
and to make similar offers to certain overseas employees. 
A summary of the principal terms of the Sharesave Plan is set out 
below. This summary describes the existing terms of the Sharesave 
Plan as well as the amendments proposed in Resolution 13. 
(a) Operation 
The operation of the Sharesave Plan is supervised by the Share 
Scheme Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company  
(the ‘Committee’). 
(b) Eligibility 
Employees and full-time Directors of the Company and any 
designated participating subsidiary who are UK resident tax-
payers are eligible to participate. The Committee may require 
employees to have completed a qualifying period of employment 
of up to five years before the grant of options. The Committee  
may also allow other employees to participate. 
(c) Grant of options 
Options can only be granted to employees who enter into HMRC 
approved savings contracts, under which monthly savings are 
normally made over a period of three or five years. Options must 
be granted within 30 days (or 42 days if applications are scaled 
back) of the first day by reference to which the option price is set. 
The number of shares over which an option is granted will be such 
that the total option price payable for those shares will correspond 
to the proceeds on maturity of the related savings contract. 
An option may not be granted more than 10 years after 
Committee approval of the Sharesave Plan, that is, 26 November 
2020. Options are not transferable, except on death. Options are 
not pensionable. 
(d) Individual participation 
Monthly savings by an employee under all savings contracts linked 
to options granted under any sharesave scheme may not exceed 
the statutory maximum (currently £250). The Committee may set a 
lower limit in relation to any particular grant. 
(e) Option price 
The price per share payable upon the exercise of an option will  
not be less than 80% of the average middle-market quotation of a 
share on the London Stock Exchange over the three days, or one 
day, preceding either the date of issue of invitations to participate 
in the Sharesave Plan or a date specified in an invitation (or such 
other day or days as may be agreed with HMRC). If an option 
relates only to new issue shares, then the price per share payable 
on exercise must also not be less than the nominal value of a share. 
The option price will be determined by reference to dealing days 
which fall within six weeks of the announcement by the Company 
of its results for any period, the announcement or introduction of a 
new Sharesave Savings Prospectus or at any other time when the 
Committee considers there to be exceptional circumstances which 
justify offering options under the Sharesave Plan.  
(f) Exercise of options 
Options will normally be exercisable for a six month period from 
the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the commencement of the 
related savings contracts. Earlier exercise is permitted, however,  
in the following circumstances: 
• following cessation of employment by reason of death, injury, 
disability, redundancy, retirement on reaching age 60 (or any 
other age at which the employee is bound to retire under his 
terms of employment) or the business or company that the 
employee works for ceasing to be part of the Company’s group; 
• when an employee reaches 60; 
• where employment ceases more than three years from grant 
for any reason other than dismissal for misconduct; and  
• in the event of a takeover, amalgamation, reconstruction or 
winding-up of the Company, except in the case of an internal 
corporate re-organisation where the participants are offered 
the opportunity to exchange existing options for equivalent 
new options over shares in a new holding company. 
Except where stated above, options will lapse on cessation of 
employment or directorship with the Company’s group. 
Shares will be allotted or transferred to participants within  
30 days of exercise. 
(g) Overall Sharesave Plan limits 
The Sharesave Plan may operate over new issue shares, treasury 
shares or shares purchased in the market. In any ten calendar 
year period, the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) 
more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company under the Sharesave Plan and any other employee 
share plan adopted by the Company. 
Treasury shares will count as new issue shares for the purposes of 
these limits unless the institutional investors decide that they need 
not count.  123

Explanatory notes on the resolutions 
Resolution 1: 
Report and financial statements 
The Directors present to shareholders at the Annual General 
Meeting the Reports of the Directors and Auditors and the 
financial statements of the Company for the year ended 30 April 
2011. These are contained in the Annual Report. 
Resolution 2: 
Declaration of a final dividend 
Final dividends declared by shareholders must not exceed the 
amount recommended by the Directors. By passing Resolution 2, 
shareholders will declare a final dividend. The amount of the final 
dividend recommended by the Directors is 4.5 Pence Net Per 
ordinary share.  
Resolution 3: 
Approval of Report on Remuneration 
As required by section 439 of the Companies Act 2006, 
shareholder approval is sought for the Remuneration Report set out 
on pages 45 to 53. 
Resolution 4-9: 
Re-election of Directors 
The Articles of Association of the Company require that all 
Directors retire from office at least once every three years but if 
eligible can submit themselves for re-election by shareholders. 
However, following the publication of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code by the FRC in June 2010 which recommends 
that directors of companies in the FTSE 350 be subject to annual 
re-election, the Directors have resolved that the Chairman and non-
Executive Directors will retire and stand for re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting and currently intend to 
repeat this process annually thereafter. The Directors have 
resolved, however, that the Executive Directors will remain subject 
to the three year rotation cycle in accordance with the Company’s 
Articles of Association and their performance will be subject to the 
existing succession planning process.  
Mr Dryden will retire, as he would otherwise have served for  
over three years without re-election by the date of the next Annual 
General Meeting, and, being eligible, offers himself for re-election 
at this year’s Annual General Meeting. Mr Dryden is the  
Group Finance Director and a member of the General Purposes 
Committee. Messrs Johnson, Bunker, Davis, Mellier and Nicholls 
will retire and, being eligible, offer themselves for re-election at 
this year’s Annual General Meeting. Mr Johnson is the Chairman 
of the Board and of the Nomination Committee. Mr Bunker is  
the Senior Independent Director, and a member of the Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination Committees. Mr Davis is Chairman 
of the Remuneration Committee and a member of the Audit  
and Nomination Committees. Mr Mellier is a member of the 
Remuneration Committee. Mr Nicholls is Chairman of the Audit 
Committee and a member of the Nomination Committee. 
Having considered the performance of and contribution made  
by each of the Directors and following formal performance 
evaluation, the Board remains satisfied that and the Chairman 
confirms that the performance of each Director standing for re-
election continues to be effective and to demonstrate commitment 
to the role and as such the Board recommends their re-election.  
A biography of each Director appears on page 38 of the  
 
 
 
 
Annual Report and appears on the Company’s website at 
www.dssmith.uk.com. 
Resolutions 10-11: 
Re-appointment of Auditors and Auditors’ remuneration 
The auditors of a company must be re-appointed at each general 
meeting at which accounts are presented. Resolution 10 proposes 
the re-appointment of the Company’s existing auditors, Deloitte LLP, 
until the next Annual General Meeting and Resolution 11 gives 
authority to the Directors to determine the auditors’ remuneration. 
Resolution 12: 
Approval of new Sharesave Plan 
It is proposed in Resolution 12 that shareholders approve both the 
existing rules and amendments to the rules of the DS Smith 2011 
Sharesave Plan (the ‘Sharesave Plan’) so as to allow the Company 
to satisfy Sharesave options with new issue and treasury shares, 
as well as existing shares purchased in the market. 
The Sharesave Plan is an all-employee plan approved by HM 
Revenue & Customs (HMRC) so that UK tax-advantaged options 
may be granted to UK employees. The use of Sharesave plans to 
encourage wider employee share ownership is well established  
in the UK and the Company previously offered Sharesave to its 
employees until 1999. The Sharesave Plan was adopted by the 
Company on 26 November 2010 and an initial offer of three year 
options under the Sharesave Plan was made to UK employees in 
January 2011. The Company’s current intention is to make offers  
of three year options under the Sharesave Plan every three years 
and to make similar offers to certain overseas employees. 
A summary of the principal terms of the Sharesave Plan is set out 
below. This summary describes the existing terms of the Sharesave 
Plan as well as the amendments proposed in Resolution 13. 
(a) Operation 
The operation of the Sharesave Plan is supervised by the Share 
Scheme Committee of the Board of Directors of the Company  
(the ‘Committee’). 
(b) Eligibility 
Employees and full-time Directors of the Company and any 
designated participating subsidiary who are UK resident tax-
payers are eligible to participate. The Committee may require 
employees to have completed a qualifying period of employment 
of up to five years before the grant of options. The Committee  
may also allow other employees to participate. 
(c) Grant of options 
Options can only be granted to employees who enter into HMRC 
approved savings contracts, under which monthly savings are 
normally made over a period of three or five years. Options must 
be granted within 30 days (or 42 days if applications are scaled 
back) of the first day by reference to which the option price is set. 
The number of shares over which an option is granted will be such 
that the total option price payable for those shares will correspond 
to the proceeds on maturity of the related savings contract. 
An option may not be granted more than 10 years after 
Committee approval of the Sharesave Plan, that is, 26 November 
2020. Options are not transferable, except on death. Options are 
not pensionable. 
(d) Individual participation 
Monthly savings by an employee under all savings contracts linked 
to options granted under any sharesave scheme may not exceed 
the statutory maximum (currently £250). The Committee may set a 
lower limit in relation to any particular grant. 
(e) Option price 
The price per share payable upon the exercise of an option will  
not be less than 80% of the average middle-market quotation of a 
share on the London Stock Exchange over the three days, or one 
day, preceding either the date of issue of invitations to participate 
in the Sharesave Plan or a date specified in an invitation (or such 
other day or days as may be agreed with HMRC). If an option 
relates only to new issue shares, then the price per share payable 
on exercise must also not be less than the nominal value of a share. 
The option price will be determined by reference to dealing days 
which fall within six weeks of the announcement by the Company 
of its results for any period, the announcement or introduction of a 
new Sharesave Savings Prospectus or at any other time when the 
Committee considers there to be exceptional circumstances which 
justify offering options under the Sharesave Plan.  
(f) Exercise of options 
Options will normally be exercisable for a six month period from 
the third, fifth or seventh anniversary of the commencement of the 
related savings contracts. Earlier exercise is permitted, however,  
in the following circumstances: 
• following cessation of employment by reason of death, injury, 
disability, redundancy, retirement on reaching age 60 (or any 
other age at which the employee is bound to retire under his 
terms of employment) or the business or company that the 
employee works for ceasing to be part of the Company’s group; 
• when an employee reaches 60; 
• where employment ceases more than three years from grant 
for any reason other than dismissal for misconduct; and  
• in the event of a takeover, amalgamation, reconstruction or 
winding-up of the Company, except in the case of an internal 
corporate re-organisation where the participants are offered 
the opportunity to exchange existing options for equivalent 
new options over shares in a new holding company. 
Except where stated above, options will lapse on cessation of 
employment or directorship with the Company’s group. 
Shares will be allotted or transferred to participants within  
30 days of exercise. 
(g) Overall Sharesave Plan limits 
The Sharesave Plan may operate over new issue shares, treasury 
shares or shares purchased in the market. In any ten calendar 
year period, the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) 
more than 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company under the Sharesave Plan and any other employee 
share plan adopted by the Company. 
Treasury shares will count as new issue shares for the purposes of 
these limits unless the institutional investors decide that they need 
not count.  124 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2011 www.dssmith.uk.com
Notice of Annual General Meeting 2011 continued 
 
 
(h) Variation of capital 
If there is a variation in the Company’s share capital then the 
Committee may, subject to HMRC approval, make such adjustment 
as it considers appropriate to the number of shares under option 
and the option price. 
(i) Rights attaching to shares 
Any shares allotted when an option is exercised under the 
Sharesave Plan will rank equally with shares then in issue  
(except for rights arising by reference to a record date prior to 
their allotment). 
(j) Alterations to the Sharesave Plan 
The Committee may amend the provisions of the Sharesave Plan  
in any respect, provided that the prior approval of shareholders 
is obtained for any amendments that are to the advantage of 
participants in respect of the rules governing eligibility, limits  
on participation, the overall limits on the issue of shares or  
the transfer of treasury shares, the basis for determining a 
participant's entitlement to, and the terms of, the shares to  
be acquired and the adjustment of options. 
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of shareholders will 
not, however, apply to any minor alteration made to benefit the 
administration of the Sharesave Plan, to take account of a change 
in legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange 
control or regulatory treatment for participants or for any company 
in the Company's group. 
(k) Overseas Sharesave Plans 
The shareholder resolution to approve the Sharesave Plan will 
allow the Committee, without further shareholder approval, to 
establish further plans for overseas territories, any such plans to be 
similar to the Sharesave Plan, but modified to take account of local 
tax, exchange control or securities laws, provided that any shares 
made available under such further plans are treated as counting 
against the limits on individual and overall participation in the 
Sharesave Plan. 
Resolution 13: 
Approval of new Share Matching Plan 
It is proposed in Resolution 13 that shareholders approve the 
adoption of the DS Smith 2011 Share Matching Plan (the ‘SMP’). 
It is intended that the SMP will be used to grant awards of shares 
to Executive Directors and other members of senior management 
in order to match shares deferred by those individuals under the 
Company’s deferred share bonus plan. The rationale for the 
introduction of the SMP is set out in the Remuneration Report  
on page 45. A summary of the principal terms of the SMP  
is set out below. 
(a) Operation 
The Remuneration Committee of the Board of Directors of the 
Company (the ‘Committee’) will supervise the operation of the SMP. 
(b) Eligibility 
Any employee (including an Executive Director) of the Company 
and its subsidiaries will be eligible to participate in the SMP at the 
discretion of the Committee. 
(c) Grant of matching awards  
The Committee may grant matching awards to acquire ordinary 
shares in the Company within six weeks following the Company’s 
announcement of its results for any period or at any other time 
when the Committee considers there are exceptional circumstances 
which justify the granting of awards. The grants will only be made 
in conjunction with the grant of deferred share bonus awards  
(DSB Awards) under the Company’s Deferred Share Bonus Plan 
(DSBP). It is intended that the first awards will be made in  
2012 when DSBP Awards, representing the bonus deferral for 
2011/12, are made. 
The Committee may grant matching awards as conditional shares 
which will normally vest on their third anniversary subject to the 
satisfaction of performance conditions, the retention of the DSB 
Awards and the continued employment of the participant within 
the Company’s group. The Committee may also decide to grant 
cash-based matching awards of an equivalent value to share-
based matching awards or to satisfy share-based matching 
awards in cash, although it does not currently intend to do so. 
A matching award will be made in conjunction with the deferral  
of part of an individual’s discretionary bonus into a DSB Award. 
The number of shares in a matching award will be based on the 
number of shares in the related DSB Award. The maximum match 
for the Executive Directors will be 1.5:1 (based on the gross 
investment) for a stretch level of performance and the maximum 
will be 1:1 for other participants. 25% of the maximum match  
(i.e. 0.375:1 for Executive Directors, 0.25 for others) will be 
available for achieving a threshold level of performance. 
A matching award may not be granted more than 10 years after 
shareholder approval of the SMP. 
No payment is required for the grant of a matching award. 
Matching awards are not transferable, except on death. Matching 
awards are not pensionable. 
(d) Performance conditions 
The vesting of matching awards will be subject to performance 
conditions set by the Committee. 
It is intended that the performance conditions applying to the 
initial matching awards will be based 50% on group earnings  
per share (EPS) and 50% on group average adjusted return  
on average capital employed (ROACE), and that the EPS and 
ROACE targets will be the same as those set for the 2012 awards 
to be made under the Company’s Performance Share Plan. The 
actual targets set will be reported in the following Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. 
The Committee may set different performance conditions from 
those described above for future matching awards provided that, 
in the reasonable opinion of the Committee, the new targets are 
not materially less challenging in the circumstances than those 
described above. 
 
 
 
 
The Committee may also vary the performance conditions 
applying to existing matching awards if an event or events  
occur which causes the Committee to consider that it would be 
appropriate to amend the performance conditions, provided the 
Committee considers the varied conditions are fair and reasonable 
and not materially less challenging than the original conditions 
would have been but for the event or events in question. It is 
expected that this power to vary the performance conditions  
is most likely to be used to reflect technical events such as a  
variation in share capital or a change in accounting standards. 
If the Committee wanted to use the power to take account of a 
significant acquisition or disposal then it would first consult with 
the Company's major shareholders. 
(e) Vesting of matching awards 
Matching awards normally vest three years after grant to the 
extent that the applicable performance conditions (see above) 
have been satisfied, the related DSB Award has not lapsed and 
provided the participant is still employed in the Company’s group. 
If a DSB Award lapses before the vesting of the related matching 
award then that matching award will lapse at the same time. 
(f) Dividend equivalents 
The Committee may decide that participants will receive a 
payment (in cash and/or shares) on or shortly following the 
vesting of their matching awards, of an amount based on the 
dividends that would have been paid on those shares between  
the time when the matching awards were granted and the time 
when shares are transferred to them. This amount may assume the 
reinvestment of notional dividends. Alternatively, participants may 
have their matching awards increased as if dividends were paid 
on the shares subject to their matching award and then reinvested 
in further shares. 
(g) Leaving employment 
As a general rule, a matching award will lapse upon a participant 
ceasing to hold employment or be a Director within the Company’s 
group. However, if a participant ceases to be an employee or 
a Director because of his death, injury, disability, retirement, 
redundancy, his employing company or the business for which 
he works being sold out of the Company’s group or in other 
circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, then his matching 
award will normally vest on the normal vesting date. The extent to 
which a matching award will vest in these situations will depend 
upon: (i) the extent to which the performance conditions have been 
satisfied over the normal performance period; and (ii) the pro-rating 
of the matching award to reflect any reduced period of time 
between the first day of the performance period and the date of 
cessation, although the Committee can decide not to pro-rate a 
matching award if it regards it as inappropriate to do so in the 
particular circumstances.  
If a participant ceases to be an employee or Director in the 
Company’s group for one of the ‘good leaver’ reasons specified 
above, the Committee can decide, in exceptional circumstances, 
that his matching award will vest on the date of cessation, subject 
to: (i) the extent to which the performance conditions are, in the 
opinion of the Committee, satisfied after it has taken into account 
past performance and, where appropriate, expected future 
performance over the remainder of the relevant performance 
period; and (ii) pro-rating by reference to the time of cessation  
as described above. 
(h) Corporate events 
In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or winding up  
of the Company (not being an internal corporate reorganisation)  
all matching awards will vest early subject to: (i) the extent that  
the performance conditions are, in the opinion of the Committee, 
satisfied after it has taken into account past performance and, 
where appropriate, expected future performance over the remainder 
of the relevant performance period; and (ii) the pro-rating of the 
matching awards to reflect any reduced period of time between the 
first day of the performance period and their vesting, although the 
Committee can decide not to pro-rate an award if it regards it as 
inappropriate to do so in the particular circumstances.  
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, matching 
awards will be replaced by equivalent new matching awards over 
shares in a new holding company unless the Committee decides 
that matching awards should vest on the basis which would apply 
in the case of a takeover. 
(i) Clawback 
If there is a material misstatement of the Company's results which 
results in matching awards vesting to a greater extent than they 
should have, the Committee may require a participant to pay  
back the overpaid amount. The clawback may be effected by a 
reduction in cash bonus or other incentive awards, or by way of 
a cash repayment. Similar clawback provisions also apply in the 
case of serious misconduct. 
(j) Participants’ rights  
Matching awards will not confer any shareholder rights until the 
matching awards have vested and the participants have received 
their Shares. 
(k) Rights attaching to shares 
Any shares allotted when a matching award vests will rank 
equally with shares then in issue (except for rights arising by 
reference to a record date prior to their allotment). 
(l) Variation of capital 
In the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital or in 
the event of a demerger, payment of a special dividend or similar 
event which materially affects the market price of the shares, the 
Committee may make such adjustment as it considers appropriate 
to the number of shares subject to a matching award. 
(m) Overall SMP limits 
The SMP may operate over new issue shares, treasury shares or 
shares purchased in the market. In any ten calendar year period, 
the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than: 
(i) 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
under the SMP and any other employee share plan adopted 
by the Company; and 
(ii) 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
under the SMP and any other executive share plan adopted 
by the Company. 
Treasury shares will count as new issue shares for the purposes  
of these limits unless institutional investors decide that they need 
not count. 
(n) Alterations to the Plan 
The Committee may, at any time, amend the SMP in any respect, 
provided that the prior approval of shareholders is obtained for  125

ROACE targets will be the same as those set for the 2012 awards 
to be made under the Company’s Performance Share Plan. The 
actual targets set will be reported in the following Directors’ 
Remuneration Report. 
The Committee may set different performance conditions from 
those described above for future matching awards provided that, 
in the reasonable opinion of the Committee, the new targets are 
not materially less challenging in the circumstances than those 
described above. 
 
 
 
 
The Committee may also vary the performance conditions 
applying to existing matching awards if an event or events  
occur which causes the Committee to consider that it would be 
appropriate to amend the performance conditions, provided the 
Committee considers the varied conditions are fair and reasonable 
and not materially less challenging than the original conditions 
would have been but for the event or events in question. It is 
expected that this power to vary the performance conditions  
is most likely to be used to reflect technical events such as a  
variation in share capital or a change in accounting standards. 
If the Committee wanted to use the power to take account of a 
significant acquisition or disposal then it would first consult with 
the Company's major shareholders. 
(e) Vesting of matching awards 
Matching awards normally vest three years after grant to the 
extent that the applicable performance conditions (see above) 
have been satisfied, the related DSB Award has not lapsed and 
provided the participant is still employed in the Company’s group. 
If a DSB Award lapses before the vesting of the related matching 
award then that matching award will lapse at the same time. 
(f) Dividend equivalents 
The Committee may decide that participants will receive a 
payment (in cash and/or shares) on or shortly following the 
vesting of their matching awards, of an amount based on the 
dividends that would have been paid on those shares between  
the time when the matching awards were granted and the time 
when shares are transferred to them. This amount may assume the 
reinvestment of notional dividends. Alternatively, participants may 
have their matching awards increased as if dividends were paid 
on the shares subject to their matching award and then reinvested 
in further shares. 
(g) Leaving employment 
As a general rule, a matching award will lapse upon a participant 
ceasing to hold employment or be a Director within the Company’s 
group. However, if a participant ceases to be an employee or 
a Director because of his death, injury, disability, retirement, 
redundancy, his employing company or the business for which 
he works being sold out of the Company’s group or in other 
circumstances at the discretion of the Committee, then his matching 
award will normally vest on the normal vesting date. The extent to 
which a matching award will vest in these situations will depend 
upon: (i) the extent to which the performance conditions have been 
satisfied over the normal performance period; and (ii) the pro-rating 
of the matching award to reflect any reduced period of time 
between the first day of the performance period and the date of 
cessation, although the Committee can decide not to pro-rate a 
matching award if it regards it as inappropriate to do so in the 
particular circumstances.  
If a participant ceases to be an employee or Director in the 
Company’s group for one of the ‘good leaver’ reasons specified 
above, the Committee can decide, in exceptional circumstances, 
that his matching award will vest on the date of cessation, subject 
to: (i) the extent to which the performance conditions are, in the 
opinion of the Committee, satisfied after it has taken into account 
past performance and, where appropriate, expected future 
performance over the remainder of the relevant performance 
period; and (ii) pro-rating by reference to the time of cessation  
as described above. 
(h) Corporate events 
In the event of a takeover, scheme of arrangement or winding up  
of the Company (not being an internal corporate reorganisation)  
all matching awards will vest early subject to: (i) the extent that  
the performance conditions are, in the opinion of the Committee, 
satisfied after it has taken into account past performance and, 
where appropriate, expected future performance over the remainder 
of the relevant performance period; and (ii) the pro-rating of the 
matching awards to reflect any reduced period of time between the 
first day of the performance period and their vesting, although the 
Committee can decide not to pro-rate an award if it regards it as 
inappropriate to do so in the particular circumstances.  
In the event of an internal corporate reorganisation, matching 
awards will be replaced by equivalent new matching awards over 
shares in a new holding company unless the Committee decides 
that matching awards should vest on the basis which would apply 
in the case of a takeover. 
(i) Clawback 
If there is a material misstatement of the Company's results which 
results in matching awards vesting to a greater extent than they 
should have, the Committee may require a participant to pay  
back the overpaid amount. The clawback may be effected by a 
reduction in cash bonus or other incentive awards, or by way of 
a cash repayment. Similar clawback provisions also apply in the 
case of serious misconduct. 
(j) Participants’ rights  
Matching awards will not confer any shareholder rights until the 
matching awards have vested and the participants have received 
their Shares. 
(k) Rights attaching to shares 
Any shares allotted when a matching award vests will rank 
equally with shares then in issue (except for rights arising by 
reference to a record date prior to their allotment). 
(l) Variation of capital 
In the event of any variation of the Company’s share capital or in 
the event of a demerger, payment of a special dividend or similar 
event which materially affects the market price of the shares, the 
Committee may make such adjustment as it considers appropriate 
to the number of shares subject to a matching award. 
(m) Overall SMP limits 
The SMP may operate over new issue shares, treasury shares or 
shares purchased in the market. In any ten calendar year period, 
the Company may not issue (or grant rights to issue) more than: 
(i) 10% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
under the SMP and any other employee share plan adopted 
by the Company; and 
(ii) 5% of the issued ordinary share capital of the Company 
under the SMP and any other executive share plan adopted 
by the Company. 
Treasury shares will count as new issue shares for the purposes  
of these limits unless institutional investors decide that they need 
not count. 
(n) Alterations to the Plan 
The Committee may, at any time, amend the SMP in any respect, 
provided that the prior approval of shareholders is obtained for  126 DS Smith Plc Annual Report 2011 www.dssmith.uk.com
Notice of Annual General Meeting 2011 continued 
 
 
  
any amendments that are to the advantage of participants in 
respect of the rules governing eligibility, limits on participation, 
 the overall limits on the issue of shares or the transfer of treasury 
shares, the basis for determining a participant's entitlement to, and 
the terms of, the shares or cash to be acquired and the adjustment 
of matching awards. 
The requirement to obtain the prior approval of shareholders  
will not, however, apply to any minor alteration made to benefit 
the administration of the SMP, to take account of a change in 
legislation or to obtain or maintain favourable tax, exchange 
control or regulatory treatment for participants or for any company 
in the Company's group. Shareholder approval will also not be 
required for any amendments to any performance condition 
applying to a matching award. 
(o) Overseas Plans 
The resolution to approve the SMP will allow the Committee to 
establish further plans for overseas territories, any such plan to  
be similar to the SMP, but modified to take account of local tax, 
exchange control or securities laws, provided that any shares made 
available under such further plans are treated as counting against 
the limits on individual and overall participation in the SMP. 
Resolution 14: 
Authority to allot shares 
At the Annual General Meeting held on 7 September 2010, 
shareholders authorised the Directors, under section 551 of the 
Companies Act 2006, to allot shares without the prior consent of 
shareholders for a period expiring at the conclusion of the Annual 
General Meeting to be held in 2011 or, if earlier, on 1 November 
2011. It is proposed to renew this authority and to authorise the 
Directors under section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 to allot 
ordinary shares or grant rights to subscribe for or convert any 
security into shares in the Company for a period expiring no later 
than 1 November 2012. 
Paragraph (a)(i) of Resolution 14 will allow the Directors to  
allot ordinary shares up to a maximum nominal amount of 
£14,519,376.33 representing approximately one third (33.33%) 
of the Company’s existing issued share capital and calculated as 
at 22 June 2011 (being the latest practicable date prior to 
publication of this circular). In accordance with the latest 
institutional guidelines issued by the Association of British Insurers, 
paragraph (a)(ii) of Resolution 14 will allow Directors to allot, 
including the ordinary shares referred to in paragraph (a)(i) of 
Resolution 14, further of the Company’s ordinary shares in 
connection with a pre-emptive offer by way of a rights issue  
to ordinary shareholders up to a maximum nominal amount  
of £29,038,752.67, representing approximately two thirds 
(66.67%) of the Company’s existing issued share capital and 
calculated as at 22 June 2011 (being the latest practicable date 
prior to publication of this circular). The Directors have no present 
intention of exercising this authority. However, if they do exercise 
the authority, the Directors intend to follow emerging best practice 
as regards its use (including as regards the Directors standing for 
re-election in certain cases), as recommended by the Association 
of British Insurers. 
Resolution 14 will be proposed as an ordinary resolution to renew 
this authority until the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting or, if earlier, the close of business on 1 November 2012.  
Resolution 15: 
Directors’ powers to disapply pre-emption rights 
Also at last year’s meeting, a special resolution was passed, under 
sections 570 to 573 of the Companies Act 2006, empowering the 
Directors to allot equity securities for cash without first being 
required to offer such shares to existing shareholders. It is proposed 
that this authority also be renewed. If approved, the Resolution will 
authorise the Directors to issue shares in connection with a rights 
issue and otherwise to issue shares for cash up to a maximum 
nominal amount of £2,177,906.45 which includes the sale on  
a non pre-emptive basis of any shares the Company may hold in 
treasury for cash. The maximum nominal amount of equity securities 
to which this authority relates represents approximately 5% of the 
issued share capital of the Company as at 22 June 2011 (being 
the latest practicable date prior to publication of this circular). 
The Directors do not intend to issue more than 7.5% of the issued 
share capital of the Company for cash on a non pre-emptive basis 
in any rolling three year period without prior consultation with the 
shareholders and the Investment Committees of the Association  
of British Insurers and the National Association of Pension Funds. 
Resolution 15 will be proposed as a special resolution to renew 
this authority until the conclusion of the next Annual General 
Meeting or, if earlier, the close of business on 1 November 2012. 
Resolution 16: 
Company’s authority to purchase shares  
This Resolution, which will be proposed as a special resolution, 
seeks to renew the existing authority for the Company to purchase 
its own shares in the market. This authority gives the Company 
greater flexibility in managing its capital resources. The Directors 
have no specific intention of using this authority and would do so 
only when, in the light of market conditions, they believed that the 
effect of such purchases would be to increase earnings per share, 
and that the purchases were in the interests of shareholders 
generally. The Directors would also give careful consideration to 
gearing levels of the Company and its general financial position. 
The purchase price would be paid out of distributable profits. 
Resolution 16 specifies the maximum number of shares which may 
be purchased (representing approximately 10% of the Company’s 
issued share capital at 22 June 2011, being the latest practicable 
date prior to publication of this document), the minimum and 
maximum prices at which they may be bought and when the 
authority will expire, reflecting the requirements of the Companies 
Act 2006 and the Listing Rules of the FSA. The minimum price at 
which the shares may be purchased is their nominal value and the 
maximum price is the higher of 5% above the average of the 
middle market values of those shares for the five business days 
before the purchase is made and the amount stipulated by Article 
5(1) of the Buy-back and Stabilisation Regulation 2003. The 
Companies Act 2006 enables certain listed companies to hold 
shares in treasury, as an alternative to cancelling them, following 
a purchase of own shares by the Company. Shares held in 
treasury may subsequently be cancelled, sold for cash or used  
to satisfy share options and share awards under the Company’s 
share schemes. Once held in treasury, the Company is not entitled 
to exercise any rights, including the right to attend and vote at 
meetings, in respect of those shares. Further, no dividend or 
distribution of the Company’s assets may be made to the 
Company in respect of those shares whilst held in treasury. 
Accordingly, if the Directors exercise the authority conferred by 
 
 
 
 
Resolution 16, the Company will have the option of holding those 
shares in treasury rather than cancelling them. The total number of 
ordinary shares that are under option through the Company’s 
share option schemes at 22 June 2011 (being the latest 
practicable date prior to publication of this notice) is 6,512,335 
of which 1,040,689 are options over unissued ordinary shares. 
The proportion of issued ordinary share capital that the options 
over unissued ordinary shares represented on this date was 
0.24% and the proportion of issued ordinary share capital that 
they will represent if the full authority to purchase shares (existing 
and being sought) is used is 0.22%. The authority will expire  
on 1 November 2012 or at the conclusion of the next Annual 
General Meeting (whichever is the earlier). It is the present 
intention of the Directors to seek a similar authority annually. 
Resolution 17: 
Notice of general meetings 
The notice period required by the Companies Act 2006 for 
general meetings of the Company is 21 days unless shareholders 
approve a shorter notice period, which cannot however be less 
than 14 clear days. (Annual General Meetings must always be 
held on at least 21 clear days’ notice.) 
At last year’s Annual General Meeting, shareholders authorised 
the calling of general meetings other than an Annual General 
Meeting on not less than 14 clear days’ notice and it is proposed 
that this authority be renewed. The authority granted by this 
resolution, if passed, will be effective until the Company’s next 
Annual General Meeting, when it is intended that a similar 
resolution will be proposed. 
Note that if a general meeting is called on less than 21 clear 
days’ notice, the Company will make a means of electronic  
voting available to all shareholders for that meeting. The flexibility 
offered by this resolution will be used where, taking into account 
the circumstances, the Directors consider this appropriate in 
relation to the business of the meeting and in the interests of  
the Company and shareholders as a whole. 
Recommendation 
Your Directors believe that all the proposals in the resolutions to be 
considered at the Annual General Meeting are in the best interests 
of the Company and its shareholders and recommend shareholders 
to vote in favour of the resolutions. The Directors will be voting in 
favour of the resolutions in respect of their own shareholdings.

the UK, from waste paper collection, through
the manufacture of recycled paper, to the

extruded sheet, and bottle crates;
• Liquid packaging and dispensing (LP&D),
being the bags and taps for bag-in-box
packaging systems.

ofﬁce products, with leading market positions 
in the UK, France, Ireland and the Benelux
region, and with developing businesses in
Germany, Spain and Italy. Spicers provides 
a wholesaling service to its customer base 
of ofﬁce products dealers and re-sellers, who

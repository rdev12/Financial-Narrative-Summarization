1  Adjusted PBT comprises loss before tax of £15.6m 
(2008: profi t of £37.8m), adjusted for exceptional 
items of nil (2008: £4.1m), IDC charge of £74.2m 
(2008: £5.7m), IDC fi nance income of £0.8m 
(2008: £2.0m) and amortisation of intangible assets 
of £2.9m (2008: £2.7m).
2  Adjusted operating profi t margin is calculated as 
adjusted operating profi t (before share from joint 
ventures) of £70.6m (2008: £65.0m) divided by 
revenue of £655.1m (2008: £622.7m).
3  Adjusted diluted earnings per share is calculated by 
dividing adjusted operating profi t, net of tax, by the 
weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue 
during the period adjusted to assume conversion of 
all potentially dilutive ordinary shares.
4  Free cash fl ow is defi ned as cash generated from 
operations adjusted for the impact of industrial 
disease costs, interest, tax, net capital expenditure, 
amortisation of bank fee and exceptional costs paid.
5  Operating cash conversion is defi ned as cash 
generated from operating activities of £84.4m 
(2008: £70.9m) divided by adjusted EBITDA

(8)
 
of £88.0m (2008: £80.8m).
8  Adjusted EBITDA is calculated by adding back 
depreciation of £15.8m (2008: £15.3m) to adjusted 
operating profi t of £72.2m (2008: £65.5m).

Build
Cape provides access, insulation, refractory 
services, ﬁ reprooﬁ ng and coatings during 
the initial build phase. In recent years, Cape 
has established an unrivalled reputation in 
the construction of Liquiﬁ ed Natural Gas 
(LNG) facilities. This is supported by the fact 
that Cape has been involved in the build 
and maintenance of 70% of the world’s LNG 
exporting facilities.
Maintenance
Following the construction phase, Cape is 
often retained by plant operators to maintain 
the asset. Cape provides a wide range 
of essential non-mechanical services to 
support client maintenance and shutdown 
programmes on typically 3-7 year contracts.
Extension of life
As an industrial asset gets older, 
Cape will work closely with the client 
on rejuvenation projects, to devise a 
strategy to extend its useful life.
Decommissioning
Cape’s expertise and broad range of 
services makes Cape the contractor of 
choice to support decommissioning 
and asset abandonment activities.

Strategic update
Since 2006, Cape has pursued a 
strategy of value creation through 
growth. This strategy has focused on:
capturing increasing levels of 
maintenance and capital spending to 
maintain and extend the life of ageing 
energy infrastructure in the UK (eg 
British Energy fl eet-wide maintenance 
contract signed in Q1 2009);
building strong positions in high growth 
international markets such as Gulf/
Middle East and Far East/Pacifi c Rim 
(eg Pluto module access and hook up 
in Thailand and Karratha, Western 
Australia in Q3 2008 and Q3 2009);
  capitalising on the increasing 
industry trend towards sourcing 
cost effective bundled multi-
disciplinary services from a single 
source provider (eg BP Federal 
Contract UKCS in Q1 2010); 
maintaining our uncompromising 
safety proposition with an ambition 
to provide injury free project 
execution; and
Chairman’s 
statement
Cape’s businesses delivered a 
robust operating and fi nancial 
performance in 2009.
Sean O’Connor – Chairman
Cape’s businesses delivered a robust 
operating and fi nancial performance 
in 2009 with record revenue of 
£655.1 million (2008: £622.7 million) and 
record adjusted PBT
(1)
 of £60.7 million 
(2008: £48.3 million). Adjusted diluted 
earnings per share
(3)
 increased by 25% to 
37.5 pence (2008: 30.0 pence). With fi ve 
consecutive years of growth, the Group 
has delivered compound annual growth 
in adjusted diluted earnings per share
(3)
 
of 41%.
The cash generative qualities of the 
business were again evident in the 
Group’s performance with strong 
operating cash fl ows of £84.4 million 
(2008: £70.9 million). This solid result was 
achieved despite some intense pricing 
pressures in more mature markets and 
refl ects the rapid and decisive actions 
taken by our business unit heads in 
response to the downturn.
Gearing
(12)
 at 31 December 2009 reduced 
to 42.4% compared to 67.2% at the end 
of 2008, with a further 31% reduction 
in net debt
(6)
 to £113.6 million (2008: 
£165.5 million). This reduces the Group’s 
ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA
(8)
 
to 1.3 times
(7)
 (2008: 2.1 times) and 
represents signifi cant progress towards 
the Board’s current target range of up to 
one times adjusted EBITDA
(8)
.
Market view
Cape largely serves downstream 
energy and resources related markets 
whose longer-term growth prospects 
are robust. We won some important 
milestone contracts with International Oil 
Companies (IOCs), power generators and 
global mining customers last year which 
again showed the compelling nature of 
Cape’s intelligent bundled service 
solution, tailored to meet the needs 
of our clients.
Whilst the Gulf/Middle East market 
remained particularly strong, the 
slowdown in the global economy 
clearly delayed the pace of new orders 
in certain of our markets. However, the 
fundamentals of Cape’s business remain 
strong. The defensive nature of the 
maintenance business, some 48% of 
revenues (2008: 48%), combined with 
the longevity of the typical large industrial 
projects we work on provides excellent 
revenue visibility. 
Rapid response to downturn
Although strong trading continued in 
certain markets, a range of short-term 
initiatives were implemented to conserve 
cash and ensure that all Cape’s 
operations remained profi table and 
robust, even in a prolonged downturn. 
The peripheral Hire and Sales operations 
in the UK together with certain marginal 
operations in Australia and Malta were 
closed, capital expenditure was tightly 
controlled and overhead cost savings 
initiatives were implemented across 
the Group. 
The devolved nature of Cape’s business 
model emphasises accountability and 
responsibility at the local level and 
encourages an entrepreneurial approach 
to running operations. Nowhere is this 
approach more apparent than in the 
timely and decisive actions taken and 
innovative responses to conserving 
cash and cutting cost without impairing 
safety performance, operational integrity, 
or future growth opportunities.
06 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
Annual Report 2009 Notes 1-16 are detailed on the inside front cover.
building on Cape’ s world class 
reputation and track record for 
consistent project execution and 
delivery on time and on budget.
In 2006 and 2007, Cape’s strategy was 
delivered through a combination of both 
organic and acquisition-led growth to 
build a portfolio diversifi ed by geographic 
region and service offering and with 
the scale, capacity and capability to 
compete for large-scale, new projects. 
This transformational period was 
completed in 2007 with the three 
acquisitions in Australia. These 
acquisitions were supplemented by the 
targeted bolt-on acquisitions of specialist 
cleaning businesses DBI and Endecon 
and further broadened Cape’s service 
offering. The transformation of acquired 
operations and the development of an 
integrated, international business under 
the Cape brand is now well advanced 
across our existing footprint. 
The successful delivery of this strategy 
to date has created an international 
industrial services group, focused on 
the energy and mining services sectors 
with a strong track record and reputation 
for successful project execution, and 
winning awards for innovation and 
safety from major international clients.
Delivering future growth
The ongoing focus on ROMA
(13)
 
enhancement and operational excellence 
will continue to play a signifi cant role in 
Cape’s strategy. 
Overseas, a number of substantial 
announced projects are now reaching 
the fi nal approval and construction 
stage in the Far East/Pacifi c Rim, Gulf/
Middle East and North Africa and should 
provide Cape with real organic growth 
opportunities over the medium term.
Whilst we see few opportunities for 
substantial growth in the UK in the short 
to medium term, we have reinforced our 
positions both onshore and offshore in 
the mature maintenance led UK market 
and are increasingly well placed to 
benefi t from the onshore new build 
power generation opportunities 
and North Sea asset abandonment 
programmes that are likely to come 
through towards the end of the decade.
With the de-gearing of the Group 
nearing the Board’s (1x adjusted 
EBITDA
(8)
) target, selective bolt on 
acquisitions in international markets 
will be considered.
Industrial Disease Claims (IDC) 
Scheme and provision for 
future claims
Following further work from independent 
actuaries in the fi nal quarter of last year, 
the Board considers that the value of the 
total future asbestos-related liabilities 
can be estimated with suffi cient reliability 
to enable a provision to be recorded. 
The Group has previously provided for 
the estimated costs of notifi ed claims 
only and disclosed by way of note 
details of actuarial assessments of 
the total discounted aggregate liability. 
The recent actuarial work conducted 
by the Scheme’s independent actuaries 
concluded that a reasonable estimate 
of the net discounted reserve would lie 
in the range of £60 million to £100 million 
with a central estimate of £79 million. 
Further detail is provided in note 26 to 
the Group fi nancial statements. With 
the increased confi dence this study 
provided, the Board has recognised an 
additional provision of £70.5 million and 
considers that in making this change to 
the Group’s fi nancial statements they are 
now more informative and meaningful. 
It should be noted that whilst we are 
making full provision, on the basis of the 
information currently available Scheme 
funds currently equate to eleven years 
of anticipated claims.
In addition, the Emphasis of Matter 
paragraph with regards to the 
fundamental uncertainty of IDCs is 
not required in respect of the 2009 
fi nancial statements. The total provision 
for Industrial Disease related liabilities 
at 31 December 2009 is £80.2 million 
and includes estimated costs of 
£9.7 million (2008: £9.7 million) in 
respect of notifi ed claims.
Board
With the increasing international focus 
of the business, we recognise it would 
be benefi cial to broaden the Board. 
A process has therefore commenced, 
overseen by the Nomination Committee, 
to appoint two additional Non-Executive 
Directors to assist the Group’s objectives 
of growing its international business and 
also of returning to the Full List. Although 
I shall be remaining on the Board, it is 
my intention to step down as Chairman 
later this year.
People
Cape now has over 17,000 people and 
again delivered in excess of 41 million 
man hours in 2009. I would like to thank 
them all for their continuing dedication 
and commitment and also the Executive 
Board and regional management teams 
whose leadership once again delivered 
a record fi nancial performance.
Outlook and prospects
The ongoing investment in large 
industrial projects in the Gulf/Middle East 
combined with our rapid but measured 
response to the downturn in other 
regions in the early part of the year 
delivered a creditable result in 2009. 
Whilst we continue to be suitably 
cautious about growth in 2010, we 
believe the swift resumption of E&C 
contract awards and investment in key 
growth projects offers a more favourable 
environment to drive sustainable organic 
growth in 2011 and beyond.
Cape’s investments over the last three 
years have delivered a focused business 
with real scale and internationally 
recognised capability and the Board is 
confi dent the Group is ideally positioned 
to benefi t from the increasing capex 
spend of our energy and resources 
sector clients.
Our increased confi dence in the medium-
term outlook and Cape’s encouraging 
prospects and fi nancial position, have 
enabled the Board to signal a fi rm intent 
to reinstate dividend payments later 
this year. Cape last paid a dividend to 
shareholders ten years ago, and it would 
be particularly pleasing to mark another 
step in Cape’s rejuvenation and recovery 
with a return to the dividend list.

Cape delivered on its promises 
in 2009 with another solid year 
of progress, winning high quality 
contracts right across its footprint 
and delivering real value for its 
customers and shareholders. 
Martin K May – Chief Executive
Introduction
Cape delivered on its promises in 2009 
with another solid year of progress, 
winning high quality contracts right 
across our footprint and delivering real 
value for our customers. This focus on 
operational excellence has been 
achieved at the same time as exceeding 
our targets for both cost savings and 
debt reduction. 
Adjusted profi t before tax
(1)
 increased 
by 25.7% to £60.7 million (2008: 
£48.3 million) refl ecting a £5.7 million 
reduction in fi nance costs to £12.3 million 
(2008: £18.0 million) and £8.1 million 
benefi t from favourable foreign exchange 
movements.
Cape has again continued to deliver 
margin progression, demonstrating the 
resilience of our business model. The 
Group’s revenues are largely derived 
from maintenance works and large 
scale Engineering and Construction 
(E&C) projects in the Oil Field Services 
(OFS) and mining services sectors. 
Maintenance spending is an essential 
operating expense of plant operators and 
therefore impacted less by short-term 
changes in the macro environment. 
Developing people and 
organisational capability
Strong progress was made in 2009 in 
driving through initiatives to strengthen 
senior operational and functional 
management across the Group.
We have strengthened the Key 
Management Group with the 
appointment of a number of Regional 
Operations Directors, CFOs and HR 
professionals during the year. Cape’s 
Key Management Group now comprises 
36 executives across the business. In 
addition, the rolling out of structured 
Performance Development Review 
processes and other HR process 
improvements have greatly added to 
the assessment and development of 
the Cape management pool.
During the course of 2009, we continued 
to review and make changes to the 
Group’s operating business unit structure 
to ensure all business units remained 
appropriately sized and resourced to 
achieve success in the current market 
conditions.
Also throughout 2009 steps were taken 
to create stronger linkage between the 
Group’s commercial and fi nancial 
processes and improve the internal 
control and reporting environment. 
Greater rigour has been introduced to 
fi nancial review processes across the 
Group under the direct control of the 
Group CFO. In Australia, we have 
carried out a major Enterprise Resource 
Planning (ERP) systems implementation 
creating a common platform across the 
acquired businesses. 
Finally, we have made progress with 
building a more structured Business 
Development capability within the 
Group and I expect further developments 
in this area in 2010.

Regional overview
The Group continues to manage its 
business on a geographical basis with 
12 business units reporting into four 
geographic regions. See fi gure 1.
As reported at the half year, the 
proportion of Group profi ts generated 
from outside the UK continued to grow 
and now represents 68% of adjusted 
EBITA
(11)
 before central costs (2008: 
63%). The Gulf/Middle East was the key 
growth region in the year, driven by 
signifi cant maintenance shutdown and 
project E&C activity particularly in Qatar.
Our results in the Far East/Pacifi c Rim, 
principally Australia, were adversely 
impacted by the Group’s exposure to the 
weak commercial and residential scaffold 
hire markets, the deferral of projects in 
the mining services sector and delays to 
Pluto LNG, the one large scale oil and 
gas project currently in progress.
The performance of each of the four 
regions is discussed further in the 
Operating Review.
Safety fi rst and last
Safety is a way of life at Cape. No matter 
how hazardous the environments in 
which we work, we believe that every 
accident is preventable. We have 
in place a world-class sustainable 
safety framework which governs every 
managed operation and project. Total 
recordable lost time injury frequency 
rates have been reduced by 35% since 
2007 or an average reduction of around 
18% each year, including dramatic 
improvements at acquired operations. 
This is very pleasing and an indication 
of our businesses’ success in prioritising 
safety resources at the site level and in 
encouraging a strong safety culture.
Outlook and prospects
Our clients have sought to reduce costs 
whilst maintaining productivity and safety 
performance. Cape will continue to assist 
them to achieve these objectives by 
specifi cally tailoring the scope of the 
services provided and adopting more 
fl exible pricing mechanisms.
Looking ahead, we do not expect to 
see a signifi cant change in the Group’s 
overall activity levels this year. We will aim 
to continue to improve customer service 
and lay the foundations for a return to 
higher growth levels in 2011 and beyond.

Market environment
More positive signs in project markets:
industry analysts expect global oil 
industry capex levels to increase in 
2010 and 2011 driven by onshore 
Australia and Gulf/Middle East 
segments (and offshore Latin 
America);
increased tendering activity across 
our growth regions, building stronger 
relationships in the Gulf/Middle East 
and Far East/Pacifi c Rim; and
 growing maintenance markets 
driven by ageing infrastructure 
(UK) and new build plant coming 
on stream (Gulf/Middle East).

The UK Region delivered a solid result 
in 2009 given the impact of pricing 
pressures and the global fi nancial crisis 
on a number of the Group’s clients and 
markets. Revenues declined by 1.4% 
to £304.7 million (2008: £309.0 million) 
with an adjusted operating profi t of 
£25.4 million (2008: £27.0 million). 
The region’s safety performance was 
again world class evidenced by a 
48% improvement in the Lost Time 
Incident (LTI) frequency rate and an 
improvement of 19% in the all injury

Annual Report 2009 4.  completion of the strategic exit from 
the commercial Hire and Sale business 
with reduced revenues of £3.9 million 
in 2009 (2008: £8.7 million).
In the power generation sector, the 
cyclical nature of the outage/shutdown 
programmes produce annual fl uctuations 
as specifi c sites target expansive pieces 
of work to meet legislative requirements. 
However, increases in gas and coal 
prices linked with a falling megawatt price 
clearly resulted in the deferral of some 
discretionary investment last year.
Cape currently maintains 70% of the UK’s 
coal and oil-fi red power generation capacity 
and 87% of the current nuclear generation 
capacity. Together these provide nearly half 
of the country’s total generating capacity.
With the fl eet-wide British Energy 
contract secured early in the year, Cape 
consolidated its position as the largest 
onshore provider of specialist non-
mechanical industrial services in the UK 
with an estimated 25% of the overall 
UK onshore market and 46% of the UK 
power generation market. In addition 
to the British Energy contract, our 
UK onshore business secured several 
signifi cant contract awards at UK 
power stations including:
–  renewal of our contract with Scottish 
& Southern for the supply of access, 
insulation and painting services at the 
Ferrybridge coal-fi red power station in 
North Yorkshire;
–  two-year extensions of our long-
standing relationship with EDF Energy 
for services at Cottam and West 
Burton coal-fi red power stations in 
Nottinghamshire and Eggborough 
power station in North Yorkshire; 
–  a four-year contract at Rugeley power 
station with International Power; and
–  the three-year contract renewal, with 
a further two-year option, at Fawley 
power station from RWE nPower.
In addition to the power generation sector, 
Cape also continued to win high quality 
long-term industrial contracts. These 
included the renewal of a contract with 
SABIC for the supply of safety critical 
maintenance services at the Wilton and 
North Tees industrial plants, a three-year 
term maintenance contract with Novartis 
at its Grimsby facility and with BAE 
Systems Surface Ships Ltd for the Royal 
Navy’s new generation aircraft carriers 
through Cape’s joint venture company, 
Ship Support Services Limited.
Maintenance revenues now account 
for 87% of total onshore revenues and 
we do not anticipate signifi cant change 
to the business in the medium term or 
until the UK government’s nuclear 
decommissioning and new build 
programmes commence later this 
decade. All ten of the announced new 
nuclear power stations are to be built 
at or near existing nuclear sites.
Offshore industrial services
Despite a diffi cult and demanding 
trading year for service companies in 
the UK North Sea, Cape’s UK offshore 
revenues grew by 26.6% to £112.2 million 
(2008: £88.6 million) benefi ting from:
–  signifi cant work on the BG 
Armada Platform on a Field Life 
Extension Integrity upgrade;
–  increased activity at BP 
Schiehallion; and
–  additional works on Shell’s Northern 
Gas plants rejuvenation project.

 21 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
2009 operations Governance Financial statements The key contract win, announced on 
20 January 2010, was the fi ve-year BP 
Federal Contract for the provision of 
fabric maintenance support and deck 
operations at all BP’s nine North Sea 
assets incorporating three additional 
assets for Cape: ETAP, Andrew and Clair 
in addition to the Dimlington gas terminal.
In common with all North Sea 
contractors, Cape has been subject to 
considerable pressure from operators 
to reduce costs and non-essential 
spends. All expenditure is focused 
around production and safety critical 
operations only and we continue to work 
with our clients to provide enhanced 
value through innovation and effi ciency 
improvements.
Other notable contract awards in the 
year included a contract for provision of 
multi-disciplinary services for the Aurora 
Project at the BP operated Sullom Voe 
Terminal in the Shetland Isles and Phase 
1 of the decommissioning project for 
the Norwegian Ekofi sk 1 platforms with 
Heerema.
The offshore business is currently 
experiencing increased tendering activity 
with an upturn in the quantum of fabric 
maintenance work available from both 
smaller operators in the UK sector 
and in the wider North West European 
Continental Shelf (NWECS) including 
the Norwegian and Dutch sectors.
Environmental services
The environmental services business 
(Cape DBI) delivered a creditable result 
in challenging circumstances with 
revenues down 11.5% at £23.2 million 
(2008: £26.2 million). 
The continued resilience of our integrated 
technical service offerings for the power 
industry pre-commissioning market and 
oil and gas installations (both onshore 
and offshore) helped mitigate the 
deferred or cancelled works in the steel 
and petrochemical sectors.
Notable contract awards and renewals 
during the period included:
–  a three-year contract renewal from 
BP at the Sullom Voe Terminal in 
the Shetland Islands for waste 
management services, industrial 
cleaning (including crude oil storage 
tanks) and drain management;
–  pre-commissioning hydro-testing and 
chemical cleaning at the Staythorpe 
Combined Cycle Gas Turbine (CCGT) 
power station in Newark with Alstom;
–  a one-year extension to our existing 
contract with Dow Corning for 
specialist cleaning services at its 
plant in Barry, South Wales;
–  a 12 month contract from Nexen for 
‘On-line’ sand separator cleaning 
support in the North Sea; and
–  the two-year renewal of our industrial 
cleaning contract with Huntsman 
Tioxide at their Seal Sands complex 
on Teesside.
Whilst we have seen a downturn in 
environmental services work on 
Teesside, we continue to see higher 
activity levels in the oil and gas and 
power generation sectors although 
a return to growth is unlikely in the 
short term.

Annual Report 2009 Some 87% (2008: 97%) of the region’s 
2009 revenues were from the oil and 
gas and petrochemical sectors and the 
key drivers of our success have been 
our growing reputation for providing a 
cost effective bundled service offering 
combined with our excellent safety 
track record. 
Employee numbers in the region peaked 
at over 7,500 and we delivered more than 
24 million man hours (2008: 19 million) 
with an excellent safety performance. 
Our clients recognised this achievement 
with a number of awards:
 
–  RasGas in recognition of Cape’s 
contribution towards 10 million man 
hours without a LTI across their LNG 
trains at Ras Laffan;
–  BAPCO in Bahrain with ‘Safety 
Contractor of the Year – category 2’;
–  Abu Dhabi Gas Liquefaction Company 
Ltd (ADGAS) in recognition of Cape’s 
contribution towards ten million man 
hours worked without a LTI over the 
last three years on the ADGAS annual 
turnaround; and
–  in Saudi Arabia, a certifi cate of 
excellence was received from 
Samsung for Cape’s access and 
insulation work on the Saudi Kayan 
PP/PH project.
The region’s order book has remained 
broadly fl at since the beginning of 2009 
and this refl ects the slow-down in new 
oil, gas and petrochem projects 
nonetheless about 60% of budgeted 
2010 revenue is now secured.
Qatar
Our Qatar business has enjoyed 
particularly favourable trading conditions 
in 2009. Project revenues remained 
strong throughout the year with some 
69% of revenues project-related as 
clients utilised Cape to complete major 
projects in Ras Laffan and Mesaaied 
including the Pearl Gas to Liquids (GTL) 
project, RasGas Train 7, Al-Khaleej Gas 
Phase-2, the Ras Girtas Power and 
Desalination plant and the Q-CHEM 2 
project.
Cape also won new long-term 
maintenance contracts at Qatargas’ 
onshore and offshore facilities and at 
the ORYX Gas to Liquids (GTL) plant. 
We continue to benefi t from the growing 
maintenance market in Qatar with 
substantial shutdown contracts with 
Dopet, Qatar Petroleum, Dolphin LNG 
and RasGas.
With the completion or near completion 
of numerous major projects, we expect 
activity levels in Qatar to reduce 
signifi cantly in 2010.
Northern Gulf
In the Northern Gulf (Kingdom of Saudi 
Arabia, Bahrain and Kuwait) we undertook 
extensive work on the Yanbu National 
Petrochemical Company (Yansab) Olefi ns 
project, the Khurais Oilfi eld Development 
project and the Rabigh Petrochemical 
Complex. Our work on the Saudi Kayan 
project is progressing well and we fi nished 
the year at peak manning levels. 
A number of high profi le projects in 
our Northern Gulf area were delayed to 
benefi t from the reduction in raw material 
prices and this will impact on activity 
levels this year. New project awards 
in the second half of the year included 
packages on the National Chevron 
Phillips (NCP) Olefi ns project at Al-Jubail 
and the Ma’aden Aluminium Refi nery at 
Ras Al Zawr.
In addition to project work, we have 
secured further maintenance contracts 
with both SABIC, for the provision of 
insulation and refractory services, and 
with Saudi Aramco for access services 
during the year.
In Bahrain we have completed a major 
refractory and insulation project at the 
Gulf Industrial Investment Co (GIIC) 
aluminium plant for Kobe Steel and 
were awarded a four-year maintenance 
contract by BAPCO at their Bahrain 
refi nery.
Southern Gulf
Our project work in the Southern Gulf 
(UAE and Oman) continued to increase 
throughout the year with project starts 
in Abu Dhabi unaffected by the fi nancial 
crisis. We fi nished the year with record 
levels of employees in Abu Dhabi with 
major projects being the GASCO third 
Natural Gas Liquid (NGL 3) plant in 
Ruwais, IGD Habshan 5 and Borouge II. 
Shutdowns accounted for 30% of the full 
year revenue with these being carried out 
at the Ruwais Fertiliser plant, Borouge, 
Ruwais and the Takreer refi nery.
Whilst we see activity levels in the 
Southern Gulf area continuing to 
increase, we also see an increase 
in competition with new contractors 
entering the market, particularly from 
Korea and China.

–  Karachaganak (Aksai) – 4th Train 
expansion project with Petrofac 
and KPO (Karachaganak Petroleum 
Operating B.V.).
During the year Cape successfully 
completed extensive works at our 
onshore facilities at Aktau for ERSAI 
Caspian Contractor LLC. Operating 
from our three bases in Kazakhstan 
and with our regional management 
team based locally in Atyrau, Cape’s 
long-term commitment to the region 
continues with further increases in 
resources and equipment made in 
the year.
In Russia, we continued to win work 
on Sakhalin Island with project works 
at Odoptu and the Chayvo Onshore 
Processing Facility, in addition to the 
Sakhalin 2 maintenance contract. 
Cape repeated the excellent safety 
performance on the KPO site in Aksai 
and has again won the General Directors’ 
Annual award as ‘Best Contractor 
HSSE Practice’ for a million hours 
achieved without a LTI. SGS ISO 
certifi cation is confi rmed and extended 
for Kazakhstan operations. 
The market for Cape’s services in 
the CIS countries will remain stable in 
2010. Current projects are coming to 
completion phase with major new 
projects planned to commence early 
next year. The emphasis will be on 
securing these works and continuing 
to develop our capability and resources 
for growth in 2011.
Mediterranean & North Africa
In 2009 Cape’s operations in the 
Mediterranean and North Africa 
generated revenues of only £2.4 million 
(2008: £8.1 million). The only major 
contract in the year was for the 
construction phase of the ExxonMobil 
Adriatic LNG receiving terminal with Aker 
Solutions which was successfully carried 
out by our Cape-Resa joint venture. The 
Cape-Resa JV, together with its new 
Italian partner, has also successfully won 
a fi ve-year multi-discipline maintenance 
contract for Adriatic LNG. 
In North Africa, our target projects 
in Algeria and Libya continue to be 
suspended or delayed and we do not 
expect contracts to be awarded until 
the fi nal quarter of this year or 2011. 
In any event North Africa will not have 
a material impact on this year’s results. 
As highlighted at the half year, we have 
opened a small facility in Arzew, Algeria 
adjacent to the industrial zone where 
the Sonatrach LNG facility is to be built. 
Cape also secured the fi rst expansion 
project for the Mejillones LNG receiving 
and re-gasifi cation terminal in Chile.

2009 revenue
2009 Performance
Revenue was down 11% with 
cancellation/deferral of industrial projects 
and non-essential maintenance.
Major project work included the Pluto 
LNG project (Australia and Thailand), 
the Goro Nickel project (New Caledonia) 
and the Shell MEG plant (Singapore).
Growing offshore revenue.
Revenue in the region reduced by 
£16.0 million to £131.3 million (2008: 
£147.3 million) with adjusted operating 
profi ts reducing to £7.9 million (2008: 
£16.1 million). As explained at the interim 
stage, our business in this region 
operates in a number of sectors which 
have been less resilient to the prevailing 
economic conditions than the energy 
sector. These include commercial and 
residential construction and mining 
services.
In many respects last year was a 
challenging year for Cape in the region 
and required a degree of restructuring 
including depot rationalisation, 
management de-layering and overhead 
reduction measures. These were 
undertaken at a time when key post 
acquisition integration projects were 
still ongoing. We are seeing signs of 
confi dence returning to our markets 
and believe our business is well 
positioned to benefi t from the expected 
increase in activity levels in 2010.
Safety performance also continued to 
improve as Cape systems were rolled 
out across the acquired businesses. 
Notable safety achievements included 
the milestone two million man hours 
worked on the Pluto LNG project in 
Thailand without a LTI, a signifi cant 
contribution to the project’s 29 million 
safe working hours and awards from 
Esso in respect of its Sriracha Refi nery 
in Thailand and Foster Wheeler/Shell on 
the Shell Monoethylene Glycol (MEG) 
plant in Singapore.
The region’s order book has continued 
to grow and has increased over year 
end 2008 levels. Pleasingly, secured 
revenues now represent some 48% of 
2010 budgeted revenues. The secured 
revenue is lower than other regions, 
refl ecting the different nature of the 
business.
Onshore industrial services
Revenues in our onshore industrial 
services business in the region fell 9.8% 
to £102.8 million (2008: £114.0 million) 
refl ecting both the cancellation or deferral 
of both project works and non-essential 
maintenance works by plant operators. 
Maintenance activities represented 
29.9% of onshore industrial services 
revenues (2008: 28.8%) with the mining 
services sector remaining dominant. We 
have continued to work with our major 
operator clients to signifi cantly reduce 
maintenance costs at their sites by 
adopting a more innovative approach to 
service delivery. Principal maintenance 
sites last year again included Alcoa’s 
three refi neries in Western Australia

Signifi cant maintenance contract awards 
or renewals in the year included a 
three-year multi-disciplinary maintenance 
contract at the Minara Resources/
Glencore owned Murrin Murrin Nickel 
refi nery in WA.
Onshore major project work in the 
region included:
–  packages on the Woodside 
Petroleum Pluto LNG project 
both in Thailand and Australia;
–  access services on the Vale Inco 
Goro Nickel project on the South 
Pacifi c Island of New Caledonia;
–  the Shell Monoethylene Glycol 
(MEG) plant in Singapore; and
–  protective coatings at the 
Boddington Gold Mine, WA.
Our major project awards in the year 
included access, insulation, fi re proofi ng 
and coatings services at the ExxonMobil 
Singapore Parallel Train (SPT) project at 
Jurong Island, Singapore with Shaw 
Stone & Webster and access services 
at Woodside’s Pluto LNG project in 
Karratha, Western Australia.
As we fully mobilise on existing contracts 
throughout the year and with the visible 
uptick in tendering activity now being 
seen across the region, we anticipate a 
return to growth in activity levels both in 
2010 and beyond.
Offshore industrial services
Our offshore revenues in the region 
increased by 26.9% to £6.6 million (2008: 
£5.2 million) with continuing activity on 
our two principal maintenance contracts 
with ConocoPhillips Bayu-Undan in the 
Timor Sea and the Shell Malampaya 
platform in the South China Sea.
Our regional offshore management 
team will relocate from the Philippines 
to Australia in the fi rst half of this year 
given the more extensive offshore 
opportunities in Australia.
Access solutions
Our access solutions business, which 
is entirely focused on commercial and 
residential construction markets in 
Australia, has been the most impacted 
by the adverse economic conditions 
with revenue reducing by 22% to 
£21.9 million (2008: £28.1 million). 
Steps have been taken to reduce fi xed 
costs and rationalise yards in the face 
of intense competition. Our three major 
depots are based at Malaga, Perth WA, 
Springvale, Victoria and Beenleigh, 
Queensland and all service local 
markets.
We expect the commercial and 
residential construction markets to 
remain soft in Australia with no expected 
pick up until the fourth quarter of this 
year at the earliest.

Annual Report 2009 FINANCIAL REVIEW
Revenue for the year increased 5.2% 
to £655.1 million (2008: £622.7 million) with 
total adjusted operating profi t (EBITA
(11)
) 
increasing by 10.2% to £72.2 million 
(2008: £65.5 million). 
The strong performance during the year 
resulted in growth of 25.0% in adjusted 
diluted earnings per share
(3)
 to 37 .5p 
(2008: 30.0p). Basic earnings per share 
decreased by 113.1% to a 3.5p loss 
(2008: earnings per share of 26.7p).
As reported at the half year, the Group’s 
headline results have materially benefi ted 
from favourable exchange movements, 
the Group’s results being retranslated at 
different average rates from year to year. 
In 2009, the headline results benefi ted 
from the weakness in GB pounds against 
the US dollar relative to last year particularly 
in the fi rst half. Figure 1 sets out the impact 
on 2009 revenues and adjusted EBITA 
had 2008 average exchange rates applied.
The overall foreign exchange impact has 
been to increase revenues by £49.4 million 
or 8.2% and adjusted operating profi ts by 
£8.3 million, equivalent to 5.4p per share.
Operating and free cash fl ow
The Group’s strong operating cash 
generation continued throughout the 
year with a full year operating cash fl ow 
of £84.4 million (2008: £70.9 million) 
representing an operating cash conversion 
rate
(5)
 of 95.9% (2008: 87 .7%). After 
servicing of debt the Group’s free cash 
fl ow was £39.1 million (2008: £3.7 million).
This result was driven by the increased 
EBITDA as well as continued tight controls 
on capital expenditure and working capital.
Capital structure and debt reduction
The Group’s year end net debt excluding 
the ring fenced Industrial Disease Claims 
(IDC) Scheme funds amounted to 
£113.6 million (2008: £165.5 million) 
including fi nance lease obligations of 
£14.6 million (2008: £20.7 million). The 
Group’s fi ve-year syndicated senior credit 
facility (with expiry on 3 September 2012) 
reduced by £15.0 million (2008: 
£20.0 million) to £185.0 million (2008: 
£200.0 million). 
The Group’s balance sheet gearing
(12)
 
reduced to 42.4% (2008: 67 .2%) and the 
ratio of net debt to adjusted EBITDA has 
fallen to 1.3 times (2008: 2.1 times) and 
close to the Board’s target of up to 1 times.
Return on Managed Assets (ROMA)
(13)
 
increased to 32.0% (2008: 29.4%) with 
the Group’s investment in receivables 
and work in progress reducing to 96 days 
(2008: 118 days).
Debt fi nancing costs
The net fi nance charge (excluding Scheme 
interest) amounted to £11.5 million (2008: 
£17 .2 million) and included fi nance lease 
interest of £1.7 million (2008: £1.7 million) 
and amortisation of loan issue costs of 
£0.7 million (2008: £0.7 million) in respect 
of commitment and ancillary fees under the 
Group’s Senior debt facility. The Group’s 
effective interest rate fell to 7 .3% (2008: 
8.1%) with interest cover
(15)
 increasing to 
5.7 times (2008: 3.6 times).

£90.0 million) of its GB pound denominated 
debt from a fl oating LIBOR rate to a fi xed 
interest rate of 5.145%. In addition the

IDC and provision for estimated 
future asbestos related liabilities
Scheme funds reduced by £3.7 million 
(2008: £1.6 million) to £33.8 million 
(2008: £37 .5 million). The reduction largely 
refl ects the reduced interest received of 
£0.5 million (2008: £2.0 million) in the 
year. During the year a total of £4.1 million 
(2008: £3.6 million) was paid to asbestos 
related claimants.
The net charge to the income statement 
for industrial disease claims lodged and 
outstanding reduced to £3.7 million 
(2008: £5.7 million).
With fi ve years having now elapsed since 
the fi rst independent actuarial assessment 
of the Group’s unpaid and uninsured UK 
asbestos related claims in 2004, the 
Directors considered it appropriate to 
review the accounting treatment whereby 
the Group provides in the income 
statement for the estimated liability in 
respect of claims lodged and outstanding 
but not for an estimate of the total 
aggregate discounted value of unpaid 
UK asbestos-related liabilities. To assist 
in this review, the independent actuaries 
quantifi ed a reasonable range of reserve 
estimates as between £60 million and 
£100 million with a central estimate of 
£79 million. Following consideration of 
this report, the Directors consider that 
making an additional provision for the 
total aggregate discounted value of unpaid 
UK asbestos-related liabilities is both 
appropriate and more meaningful to the 
users of the Group’s fi nancial statements. 
Consequently an additional provision of 
£70.5 million has been recognised in the 
Group’s fi nancial statements with an 
additional charge to the income statement 
net of deferred tax of £50.8 million (2008: 
£nil). Further detail is provided in note 26 
to the Group fi nancial statements. 
Following the booking of this provision, 
the Group’s auditors have confi rmed 
that the Emphasis of Matter paragraph 
concerning the fundamental uncertainty 
of future IDC liabilities is not required in 
respect of the 2009 fi nancial statements.
Tax charge and effective tax rate
The tax charge in the period before other 
items increased to £13.9 million (2008: 
£12.2 million) with an effective tax rate 
of 23.7% (2008: 25.3%). Tax paid in the 
period increased to £7 .6 million (2008: 
£4.8 million) this increase predominantly 
relates to the Gulf/Middle East and 
Far East regions where there has been 
the introduction of payment on account 
systems in certain jurisdictions along 
with the overall increase in profi ts in the 
Gulf/Middle East. 
The Group’s total tax credit for the 
year of £14.1 million (2008: £5.9 million), 
comprises a current tax charge of 
£9.9 million (2008: £7 .1 million) and a 
deferred tax credit of £24.0 million 
(2008: £1.2 million).

Annual Report 2009 The deferred tax credit relates 
predominantly to the recognition of a 
deferred tax asset on the provision raised 
for future asbestos related liabilities and a 
further Australian tax benefi t from the 
acquisition of PCH. 
Balance sheet
Shareholders’ equity at 31 December 
2009 increased to £264.7 million (2008: 
£245.5 million) and refl ects both the 
retained profi ts for the year and the 
change in accounting treatment relating 
to the provision for future industrial (largely 
asbestos related) disease claims in the UK.
The Group’s intangible assets, which had 
a year end book value of £210.5 million 
(2008: £188.0 million), comprised acquired 
customer contracts and goodwill that 
arose on acquisitions predominantly in 
Australia and the increase in value of the 
assets during the year was due to changes 
in foreign exchange rates. The Group 
completed a goodwill impairment test 
based on value in use calculations which 
estimate the recoverable amounts of the 
Group’s Cash Generating Units. The test 
demonstrated that no impairment was 
necessary.
The Group had a year end property, plant 
and equipment balance of £142.9 million 
(2008: £152.3 million). Additions of 
£11.6 million (2008: £26.2 million) were 
made during the year and the depreciation 
charge for the year was £15.8 million 
(2008: £15.3 million). The most signifi cant 
proportion some £117 .7 million (2008: 
£128.2 million) relates to access and 
scaffolding equipment. The Group’s real 
property assets totalled £17 .0 million (2008: 
£17 .7 million) and includes £2.0 million in 
respect of 130 acres of land adjacent to 
the M25 in Uxbridge, UK.
Current trade and other receivables 
decreased by £28.7 million to 
£156.0 million (2008: £184.7 million). 
Trade receivables have decreased by 
£12.7 million to £112.6 million (2008: 
£125.3 million) refl ecting further improved 
credit control procedures across the 
Group. At the year end trade receivables 
represented 62.7 days (2008: 73.4 days) 
of invoicing. 
Non current provisions for other liabilities 
and charges of £85.6 million (2008: 
£14.4 million) primarily relate to industrial 
disease liabilities comprising £9.7 million 
(2008: £9.7 million) in respect of the 
estimated costs of settling notifi ed claims 
and £70.5 million (2008: £nil) in respect 
of the additional provision recognised for 
the estimated future liability.
Pensions
The Group Defi ned Benefi t Pension 
Scheme had a net surplus of £10.5 million as 
at 31 December 2009 (2008: £10. 1 million), 
this continues to be restricted to £nil in the 
accounts under IFRIC 14.

 29 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
2009 operations Governance Financial statements In 2009, Cape again demonstrated an 
excellent health and safety performance 
across the Group and in particular we 
are pleased to report that our health, 
safety and environmental performance 
continues to improve within our 
international operations across a range 
of key performance indicators.
The level of Lost Time Incidents (LTI) 
performance, the primary international 
benchmark to measure our safety 
performance, this year has signifi cantly 
reduced by 19% on 2008 fi gures. The 
Group achieved an LTI frequency rate of 
0.065 per 100,000 hours worked which 
has exceeded our internal target and is 
truly world class within our industry 
sector. We continue to steer the business 
on its journey to the ultimate goal of 
zero injuries/accidents and no harm to 
the environment.
In 2009 we consolidated the initiatives 
introduced in 2008. We also introduced 
new initiatives designed to help Cape 
continue to improve its health, safety and 
environmental performance, the most 
notable being:
Monitoring the performance of our 
company wide Golden Rules
Our Golden Rules are essential to ensure 
the health and safety of our people and 
members of the public who could be 
affected by our operations. These are now 
fully embedded in everything we do and 
we have been monitoring performance to 
ensure all of our operations abide by these 
set of expectations.
An additional health, safety and 
quality accreditation for our 
operations in Kuwait
Cape actively seeks external verifi cation 
of our health, safety, environment and 
technical performance by utilising 
external accreditors certifi ed by the 
UKAS accreditation authority. This 
year we again increased the number of 
international health, safety and quality 
accreditations. Coverage now includes 
our operations in Kuwait, bringing the 
total number of certifi cates of conformity 
for ISO 9001 (quality systems), 14001 
(environmental) and OSHAS 18001 
(health and safety) to 24. 
The update of our internationally 
recognised OSHAS 18001 health 
and safety accreditation to the 
latest 2007 version
This was a considerable achievement as 
it involved reviewing all relevant legislation 
impacting health and safety in the 
countries in which we operate and 
positively demonstrating that our 
processes and systems were fully 
compliant with the local laws and 
regulations.
CapeSafe our branded health 
and safety campaign vehicle was 
reinforced throughout 2009 with 
a number of initiatives such as:
–  high quality poster campaign 
designed to make our employees 
think about health and safety and 
continue to make it their fi rst priority;
–  introduction of articles and 
information on our intranet systems 
available to all employees with web 
access; and
–  marking work wear with CapeSafe 
references. In countries such as 
Australia work wear is an important 
focal point. All of our equipment and 
clothing was therefore marked with 
CapeSafe references to help remind 
our people of the importance of health 
and safety to themselves, colleagues 
and members of the public.
Training
It is vital that we learn from every 
opportunity to improve our health 
and safety performance. To aid in this 
process, during the next 12 months over 
50 health and safety managers will be 
fully trained in incident investigation and 
root cause analysis. We have selected 
the internationally recognised TapRoot
®
 
system to assist us solve problems 
by fi nding and fi xing root causes that 
when corrected, stop problems from 
happening over and over again. It is 
our ultimate goal for all of our dedicated 
health and safety practitioners to be 
fully trained in the TapRoot
® 
system.

Ensuring that our people are effectively 
trained to undertake their duties is 
fundamental to our excellent health and 
safety performance. To this end Cape 
prides itself on the investment we make 
in this area. Throughout 2009 we have 
continued to invest in the future. This 
included the relocation and extension 
of our comprehensive training facilities 
in Manila, the Philippines. We also 
increased the number of courses and 
competency assessment activities 
offered to our people and our 
clients there.
Asbestos management
Cape prides itself on working to the 
highest standards possible. This means 
not only meeting legislative requirements 
in the countries we work in, but setting 
aspirational goals far exceeding those 
simply required by law. Throughout 
2009 we undertook a fundamental 
review of our systems and procedures 
and have identifi ed 14 separate 
standards to which we aspire. We are 
now ready to roll these out across all of 
our operations. Every manager and 
employee linked directly to asbestos 
operations, and those who will be 
responsible for setting the tone of how 
we do business, will undergo thorough 
training during 2010 to ensure that 
everyone knows the standards to which 
we expect the Company to operate.
Health and Safety awards
Cape’s health, safety and environmental 
performance is internationally 
recognised as being of the highest 
standard. This recognition has been 
offi cially endorsed by a number of 
awards, prizes and certifi cations. During 
2009 all our regional businesses were 
recognised by our clients for their 
excellent health and safety performance 
and over 25 separate awards have been 
granted with examples being:
–  SABIC global safety award 
(fi rst place);
–  Award from Amec for nine years 
without a Lost Time Accident on 
its Malampaya CMB Project – 
the Philippines;
–  QAPCO Best Contractor Safety

32 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
Annual Report 2009 Risks and 
uncertainties
Potential impact
External
Operating activities may be affected 
by factors outside our control. These 
include climatic conditions, unusual or 
unexpected geological occurrences, 
environmental hazards, industrial 
conditions, technical failures, labour 
disputes, governmental actions or 
inactions, delays in construction, 
availability of materials or parts and 
shipping, import or customs delays.
Changes in the political environment in 
certain regions may result in Cape, or 
its clients, losing commercial or legal 
protections or being less able to control 
their operations.
Mitigation
These external factors are normally likely to affect a specifi c location, customer 
relationship or a single contract. Cape’s business is diverse by geography, number 
of clients, range of services and exposure to industries or sectors. This portfolio 
diversifi cation reduces the impact of Cape’s overall exposure to individual risks.
Cape’s policy is to avoid markets/regions which it assesses as high risk.
Cape maintains a broad geographic footprint and has sought to acquire businesses 
in safe and politically stable countries.
Risk is mitigated by a strong senior management presence in each region and 
particularly where risks are identifi ed, regions operate in close communication with 
central management. 
Local legal counsel are regularly engaged to ensure compliance with local legislation 
and to update and advise managers on actual or potential changes in legal or 
regulatory framework.
Risk is an unavoidable facet of any business activity. Cape faces a number 
of risks in undertaking its operations around the world. We are alive to the 
issue of risk, work tirelessly to identify and evaluate risks associated with our 
business and to plan measures to mitigate known risks. Identifi ed risks and 
agreed mitigation are recorded in an active risks register.
No such review of risks and uncertainties can be exhaustive and risks might 
exist which have not been identifi ed by the Directors. New risks might also 
emerge and the likelihood of known risks occurring and the impact they 
might have upon the Group may change from time to time.

2009 operations Governance Financial statements Risks and uncertainties
continued
Potential impact
Competition 
Losing certain key customers could 
have an adverse effect on Cape’s 
revenues, particularly where these 
customers have several contracts 
with Cape.
In certain markets the Group has a 
signifi cant market share such that 
applicable competition law might 
restrict the Group from making material 
acquisitions.
The majority of Cape’s customers are 
either in, or are dependent upon, the 
energy and natural resources sectors. 
Cape’s earnings therefore depend on 
long-term energy demand particularly 
for oil, gas and electricity.
Cyclical downturns could lead to declines 
in demand for Cape’s services.
Potential impact
Operational
A failure to maintain the highest Health, 
Safety and Environmental (HSE) 
standards could result in injury to our 
employees or others involved in our 
operations. Failure to deliver HSE 
excellence could result in a material 
loss of customers and/or damage to 
Cape’s reputation and the environment.
The loss of key senior management 
or employees, may adversely affect 
Cape’s business.
Cape’s ability to successfully operate 
and grow the business is largely 
dependent on its ability to attract 
and retain high-quality personnel. 
An inability to attract and retain well-
qualifi ed personnel could materially 
adversely affect Cape’s business, 
operating results or fi nancial condition. 
Mitigation
Cape’s top 10 customers accounted for 31% of Group revenues in 2009, with the 
largest customer accounting for 8% of Group revenues. Cape has a broad customer 
base and seeks to maintain a balanced customer profi le.
Cape has developed long-standing relationships with customers based on service 
quality, reliability, reputation and safety. These relationships are at a variety of layers 
from site level to senior management. Strong relationships support revenue retention 
and growth through ongoing contract award and renewal.
In most existing markets Cape has a very small market share.
Cape has a broad customer base and geographic footprint and has avoided marginal 
markets with high production costs, such as Canada.
Most contracts cover a multi-year engagement and are for work of a long-term 
nature. Cape therefore has limited exposure to fl uctuations in the spot price of any 
one energy product, or its short-term demand.
Cape is fi rmly positioned in the downstream energy infrastructure, power generation 
and later cycle production markets. These markets are less impacted by cyclical 
downturns than upstream, exploration segments.
Cape’s wide range of essential services ensures it can serve customers’ needs 
through the lifecycle of the asset, whether related to installation, maintenance 
or decommissioning.
Mitigation
Cape values its excellent reputation for safety and HSE related matters around the 
world. Cape’s investments in systems and resources, with around 425 people in 
full-time HSE roles across the Group, continues to deliver signifi cant reductions in 
accidents, working days lost and environmental incidents.
Occupational health and safety performance continues to be in the upper quartile 
of comparable companies, with a Lost Time Incident (LTI) frequency rate of 0.065 
per 100,000 hours worked for the Group as a whole.
Cape’s regionalised organisational structure provides considerable management 
autonomy and opportunity for senior personnel to develop within the business.
Annual performance appraisals are conducted to assess executives’ performance 
and to discuss career goals and succession planning.
Senior executive remuneration is reviewed against market data provided by specialist 
remuneration consultants to ensure awards are competitive.
Long-term incentive plans are in place to encourage the retention of the key 
management group. 
34 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
Annual Report 2009 Potential impact
Financial
Failure to achieve satisfactory returns 
on investments.
Inadequate fi nancial controls leading to 
lack of integrity or loss of fi nancial data.
Other fi nancial risks including foreign 
exchange and interest rate exposure are 
described further in note 23 to the Group 
fi nancial statements.
The eventual value of contracts may be 
lower than expected. Many of Cape’s 
contracts are term maintenance 
contracts and do not guarantee 
revenue levels.
Fixed price contracts expose Cape 
to potential cost overruns. 
Potential impact
Asbestos
A number of Cape’s subsidiary 
companies used asbestos in their 
manufacturing activities until the 1970’s 
and continue to receive claims mainly 
from former employees who have 
contracted various diseases as a 
result of exposure to asbestos. Future 
asbestos-related liabilities are estimated 
and provided for. However the level of 
claims arising in the future is inherently 
uncertain. Further detail is provided 
in note 26 to the Group fi nancial 
statements.
External factors (e.g. legislation changes, 
new types of claims) could result in a 
requirement for Cape to make an annual 
top-up payment to fund the Scheme. 
Mitigation
Cape carries out detailed assessments and reviews of existing and potential 
investments including external legal and fi nancial diligence where appropriate.
Cape has high quality and experienced fi nance, internal audit, tax and treasury 
teams that operate at the head offi ce and across the regions. 
Cape operates a stringent contract review process with clear authority limits 
governing the acceptance of contracts. Contracts values are often signifi cantly 
different from initial estimates or from prior year amounts. However across many 
contracts, increases and reductions tend to offset.
Cape seeks to avoid large fi xed price contracts, with the majority of its contracts 
being cost reimbursable or at scheduled rates.
Mitigation
Employee claims were mostly insured from the mid 1970’s and fully insured from 
1981 onwards.
A Scheme of Arrangement was implemented in 2006 to provide both claimants 
and Cape and its shareholders greater certainty over the funding of future 
asbestos claims and related cash fl ows.
An independent actuary estimates the number and value of unpaid and future 
claims on a triennial basis. In addition, Cape closely monitors claims levels, 
which are currently in line with projections.
Any annual top up payment required is restricted to a proportion of Cape’s free 
cash fl ow.
The Board considers that the value of the total future asbestos liabilities can be 
estimated with suffi cient reliability to enable a provision to be made.

2009 operations Governance Financial statements
No other Directors have been granted options or awards over 
shares in the Company or other Group entities. None of the 
terms and conditions of the share options or awards were 
varied during the year. All options and awards were granted 
in respect of qualifying services.
On 17 March 2010, Martin K May and Richard Bingham were 
awarded 243,455 and 123,691 Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) 
awards respectively, which will vest (subject to meeting certain 
performance conditions) on 17 March 2013.
The PSP awards are conditional awards granted at no cost to 
the Directors. Vesting of these shares is subject to Cape plc 
adjusted diluted Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) meeting the 
specifi ed performance criteria over a three-year vesting period. 
The performance criteria is adjusted diluted EPS growth of the 
Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) plus 3% for the minimum of 30% of the 
shares awarded to vest, and EPS growth of RPI plus 10% for all 
of the shares awarded to vest. 
The Employee Incentive Plan (‘EIP’) options were granted at the 
option prices detailed above and are subject to the condition 
that they will not be exercisable unless the performance of the 
Company’s adjusted EPS over a set three-year period exceeds 
the growth in the Consumer Price Index over the same period 
by 3% per annum.
Gains made by Directors on Share Options
None of the Directors exercised any share options during 
the year.
Employee Benefi t Trust (‘EBT’)
The Company has established an Employee Benefi t Trust 
(‘EBT’) to satisfy the awards granted under the Performance 
Share Plan. The trustees of the EBT are Sanne Trust Company 
Limited which is resident in Jersey. The EBT currently holds no 
Ordinary Shares.
Treasury shares
The Company currently holds no Ordinary Shares in treasury.
Directors’ indemnities
As permitted by the Companies Act 2006, the Company has 
indemnifi ed the directors and offi cers in respect of proceedings 
which may be brought by third parties and such indemnifi cation 
was in place throughout the year. Neither the Company’s 
indemnity nor insurance provides cover in the event that a 
director or offi cer, is proved to have acted fraudulently or 
dishonestly.
A qualifying indemnity provision has also been made by the 
Company and was in force throughout the fi nancial year for 
the benefi t of the directors of the Company’s subsidiaries.
Supplier payment policy
The supplier payment policy for Group companies is to agree 
terms and conditions for business transactions with suppliers. 
Suppliers are made aware of the Group’s terms of payment. 
Payment is then made subject to these terms and conditions 
being met. The Company did not have any amounts owed to 
trade creditors at the end of the year (2008: nil). The Group had 
£30.0 million of trade payables at the end of the year (2008: 
£43.4 million) which represented 43 payable days (2008: 60).
Treasury policy
The Group’s policy on treasury and fi nancial risk (see note 23) is 
set by the Board and is subject to regular reporting and review. 
The main risks faced by the Group relate to foreign currency 
risk and liquidity risk.
A signifi cant proportion of the Group’s business is conducted 
overseas. The Group is therefore subject to exchange rate 
risk when translating the results and assets of its overseas 
subsidiaries into GB pounds. Where signifi cant transactional 
exchange rate risks are identifi ed, then appropriate currency 
contracts are used to hedge these transactions.

Directors’ report
continued
The Group’s committed facilities all carry interest rates based 
on LIBOR and therefore the Group is exposed to interest rate 
movements. As at 31 December 2009, 56% of the Group 
borrowings were hedged.
Employment policies
The companies in the Group operate within broadly prescribed 
personnel and employment policies. Each company develops 
procedures which are most appropriate to the circumstances 
within which it operates. The Group’s training, career 
development and promotion policies provide equal 
opportunities for all employees.
Employment of disabled persons
It is Group policy to permit, wherever practicable, the 
employment of disabled persons and to provide appropriate 
opportunities for their training, career development and 
promotion. Where employees have become disabled in the 
service of the Group, every effort is made to rehabilitate them 
in their former occupation or in some suitable alternative.
Employee involvement
The Group continues its practice of keeping all employees 
informed on matters affecting them and the Group, so that a 
common awareness amongst all employees is developed in 
relation to the fi nancial and economic factors that affect the 
performance of the Group. Where applicable, the Group 
consults employees or their representatives on a regular basis 
so that the views of employees can be taken into account in 
making decisions that are likely to affect their interests.
Senior management is kept abreast of developments in 
fi nancial, commercial and personnel matters and this enables 
them to ensure that employees at the operational level are kept 
informed. The Group operates pension schemes for the benefi t 
of eligible employees in the UK and overseas. The funds of the 
pension schemes are administered by Trustees and they are 
held separately from Group funds.
In 2006, the Group introduced a Save As You Earn scheme 
(the Sharesave Plan) for eligible employees. The Directors 
believe that share ownership among employees encourages 
team effort and will contribute to the ultimate success of 
the Group.
Health and safety policy
The Group has issued a policy statement on its commitment 
to a safe working environment for all employees which is detailed 
on pages 30 to 32. The Chief Executive is responsible for the 
implementation of the Group policy on health and safety within 
his area of responsibility. During the year, Group operations 
throughout the UK and the rest of the world, were subjected 
to internal and third party audits to monitor compliance with 
Company procedures and statutory requirements.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Parent Company fi nancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare fi nancial 
statements for each fi nancial year. Under that law the Directors 
have prepared the Group fi nancial statements in accordance 
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union, and the Parent Company 
fi nancial statements in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice). The Group and 
Parent Company fi nancial statements are required by law 
to give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the 
Company and the Group and of the profi t or loss of the 
Group for that period.
In preparing those fi nancial statements, the Directors are 
required to:
–  select suitable accounting policies and then apply them 
consistently;
–  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable 
and prudent;
–  state that the Group fi nancial statements comply with 
IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, and with 
regard to the Parent Company fi nancial statements 
that applicable UK Accounting Standards have been 
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed 
and explained in the fi nancial statements; and
–  prepare the Group and Parent Company fi nancial 
statements on the going concern basis unless it is 
inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue 
in business, in which case there should be supporting 
assumptions or qualifi cations as necessary. 
The Directors confi rm that they have complied with the 
above requirements in preparing the fi nancial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
fi nancial position of the Company and the Group and to enable 
them to ensure that the Group and Parent Company fi nancial 
statements comply with the Companies Act 2006 and, as 
regards the Group fi nancial statements, Article 4 of the IAS 
Regulation. They are also responsible for safeguarding the 
assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking 
reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.  41 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
2009 operations Governance Financial statements
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Company’s website. Legislation in the United Kingdom 
governing the preparation and dissemination of fi nancial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions. 
Each of the Directors, whose names and functions are listed 
on page 36, confi rm that, to the best of their knowledge:
–  the Group fi nancial statements, which have been prepared 
in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true 
and fair view of the assets, liabilities, fi nancial position and 
profi t of the Group; and
–  the Directors’ report includes a fair review of the 
development and performance of the business and the 
position of the Group, together with a description of the 
risks and uncertainties that it faces, set out in the risks 
and uncertainties review on pages 33 to 35.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the Group website www.capeplc.com. Legislation in the 
UK governing the preparation and dissemination of fi nancial 
statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of disclosure of information to auditors
So far as each Director is aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the Company’s auditors are unaware. 
Relevant information is defi ned as information needed by 
the Company’s auditors in connection with preparing their 
report. Each Director has taken all the steps (such as making 
enquiries of other Directors and the auditors and any other 
steps required by the Director’s duty to exercise due care, 
skill and diligence) that he ought to have taken in his duty as 
a Director in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are 
aware of that information.

The Directors have been advised that as at 1 April 2010 the 
following have interests of 3% or more in the issued ordinary 
share capital of the Company:

Annual Report 2009
Compliance with Combined Code
Cape is committed to achieving high standards of business 
integrity, ethics and professionalism across its worldwide 
operations.
As a company whose shares are traded on AIM, the Company 
is not required to comply with the full requirements of the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance revised in June 
2008. However, the Board continues to implement policies 
and procedures designed to comply with the Combined Code 
as far as reasonably practicable and appropriate for a public 
company of its size and complexity.
The Board is accountable to the Company’s Shareholders for 
good governance and the statements set out below describe 
how the principles identifi ed in the Combined Code are applied 
by the Group.
The Board
The Board has responsibility for the overall management and 
performance of the Group and is responsible for formulating, 
reviewing and approving the Company’s long-term objectives, 
budgets and commercial strategy. 
The Company has established properly constituted Audit, 
Remuneration and Nomination committees of the Board 
with formally delegated duties and responsibilities. Decisions 
concerning the direction and control of the business are made 
by the Board, and a formal schedule of matters specifi cally 
reserved for the Board is in place.
Throughout the year, the Board comprised an independent 
Non-Executive Chairman (Sean O’Connor), two Executive 
Directors (Martin K May, Chief Executive and Richard Bingham, 
Chief Financial Offi cer) and two other Non-Executive Directors 
(David Robins and David McManus). 
An agreed procedure exists for Directors in the furtherance 
of their duties to take independent professional advice. Newly 
appointed Directors are made aware of their responsibilities 
through the Company Secretary. The Company carries out 
for new Directors a detailed induction process which includes 
discussions with senior managers and familiarisation visits to 
the Company’s operations. 
No individual or group of Directors dominates the Board’s 
decision making. Each of the Non-Executive Directors is 
independent of management and has no cross-directorships 
or other signifi cant links which could materially interfere with 
the exercise of his independent judgement. Collectively, the 
Non-Executive Directors bring a valuable range of expertise 
in assisting the Company to achieve its strategic aims. 
All Directors are subject to election by the shareholders at the 
fi rst opportunity after their initial appointment to the Board and 
to re-election thereafter at intervals of not more than three years. 
Biographical details of the Directors are set out on page 36.
The Company has a separate Chairman and Chief Executive 
each with their own responsibilities. The Chairman is 
responsible for the effective running of the Board and the 
Chief Executive is ultimately responsible for all operational 
matters and the fi nancial performance of the Company. 
Meetings with Non-Executive Directors
The Chairman holds meetings as required with the 
Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors 
being present.
Matters reserved for the Board
The Board has a formal schedule of matters reserved for 
its decision which includes:
– Group strategy and policy;
– Group corporate and capital structure;
– fi nancial reporting and controls;
– communication with shareholders;
–  Board membership and other senior management 
appointments; and
– material transactions.
Other matters are delegated to Board Committees, individual 
Directors or senior management where appropriate. In addition, 
the Board receives reports and recommendations from time to 
time on any matter which it considers signifi cant to the Group.
Board meetings
The Board is supplied in a timely manner with information in a 
form and of a quality appropriate to enable it to discharge its 
duties. This includes detailed monthly management accounts 
and an analysis of the Group’s actual performance against 
budget and the previous year.
The Board usually meets formally not fewer than eight times 
a year. Informally, Board members meet more often.

Board committees
The Board delegates certain powers to designated 
committees. The terms of reference for the principal 
Committees can be obtained by contacting the Group 
Company Secretary at the Company’s registered offi ce or 
viewed on the Company’s website at www.capeplc.com.
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has formal Terms of Reference which are 
approved by the Board. The Audit Committee is responsible 
for exercising the full powers and authority of the Board in 
accounting matters, fi nancial reporting and internal controls. 
Its primary responsibilities are to monitor the quality of internal 
controls and ensure that the fi nancial performance of the 
Company is properly measured and reported on. It receives 
and reviews reports from the Company’s management and 
auditors relating to the interim and annual accounts and the 
accounting and internal control systems in use throughout the 
Company. The Audit Committee meets at least twice a year 
and has unrestricted access to the Company’s auditors. 
The Committee consists solely of Non-Executive Directors, 
each of whom has fi nancial experience in a large organisation. 
During the year, the Audit Committee comprised David Robins 
(Chairman) and David McManus. At the invitation of the 
Committee, the Chairman, the Chief Executive, Chief Financial 
Offi cer, Group Company Secretary, Group Financial Controller, 
Director of Internal Audit and the Company’s external auditor 
may attend meetings.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee has formal Terms of Reference 
which are approved by the Board. Its principal responsibility is 
to determine the framework or broad policy for the remuneration 
of the Chairman and the Executive Directors, to consider and 
determine all elements of the remuneration of those Directors 
and to review Board performance. No Director takes part in any 
discussion concerning his own position. The Committee also 
determines and recommends the grant of share options under 
the Company’s Performance Share Plan.
The Committee consists solely of Non-Executive Directors 
and, during the year, comprised David McManus (Chairman), 
David Robins and Sean O’Connor. 
At the invitation of the Committee, the Chief Executive, 
Chief Financial Offi cer, Group HR Director, Group Company 
Secretary and external advisers may attend meetings.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee has formal Terms of Reference 
which are approved by the Board. It is responsible for monitoring 
and formally reviewing the performance, composition, balance 
and expertise of the Board as a whole and making an appraisal 
of the contribution of individual Directors, including a review of 
their time commitment and attendance records. The Committee 
also considers succession planning for the Board and Group 
senior management. When necessary, the Committee prepares 
a description of the role to be fi lled and engages external 
consultants to administer a detailed search and the generation 
of a shortlist of suitable candidates. Any recommendations for 
appointments or replacements are brought before the Board 
and in exercising this role, the Directors have regard to the 
recommendations put forward in the Combined Code.
The Committee consists solely of Non-Executive Directors 
and, during the year, comprised Sean O’Connor (Chairman), 
David McManus and David Robins. At the invitation of the 
Committee, the Chief Executive, Chief Financial Offi cer, Group 
HR Director, Group Company Secretary and external advisers 
may attend meetings.
Relations with shareholders
The Company values the views of all its shareholders and 
recognises their interests in the Company’s strategy and 
performance. The Chief Executive has the responsibility for 
ensuring effective communication with shareholders and that 
the Board is fully aware of major shareholders’ views and 
opinions. The Chief Executive, along with the Chairman and 
Chief Financial Offi cer are available to meet shareholders for 
this purpose.

The Annual and Interim Reports are mailed to all shareholders. 
These reports, together with regular trading updates, signifi cant 
contract wins and health and safety achievements are published 
via the Regulatory Information Services and on the Company’s 
website at www.capeplc.com. 
All shareholders are encouraged to attend the Company’s 
Annual General Meeting at which the Chairman and Chief 
Executive give an account of the progress of the business over 
the year and provide an opportunity for shareholders to ask any 
questions they may have. The Board attends this meeting and is 
available to answer questions from those shareholders present. 
Senior Independent Director
David Robins is Cape’s Senior Independent Director (‘SID’). 
The role of the SID is to be available to shareholders if they 
have concerns which contact through the normal channels 
of Chairman, Chief Executive or Chief Financial Offi cer has 
failed to resolve, or for which such contact is inappropriate, 
to attend suffi cient meetings with a range of major shareholders 
and fi nancial analysts to obtain a balanced understanding of 
the issues and concerns of such shareholders, to chair the 
Nomination Committee when it is considering succession 
to the role of Chairman of the Board and to meet with the 
Non-Executive Directors, at least annually and on such 
other occasions as are deemed appropriate, to appraise 
the Chairman’s performance, without the Chairman 
present. This evaluation takes into account the views 
of the Executive Directors.
Audit, internal control and risk management
The respective responsibilities of the Directors in connection 
with the Annual Report and Accounts are explained on 
page 40.
Following the publication of guidance for Directors, Internal 
Control: Guidance for Directors on the Combined Code, the 
Board confi rms that there is an ongoing process for identifying, 
evaluating and managing any signifi cant risks faced by the 
Group. A formal process is now in place and is regularly 
reviewed by the Board in the light of the Turnbull Guidance 
and the subsequent Flint Report. The Directors are responsible 
for the Group’s system of internal control and for reviewing its 
effectiveness. However, such a system can only provide 
reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives.
The Directors consider proper risk management to be crucial 
to the Group’s ongoing success. They give a high priority to 
ensuring that adequate systems and structures are in place to 
measure, analyse and limit exposure to risk. The Directors have 
established key procedures to ensure that internal controls are 
effective and are commensurate with a group of this size. A key 
control procedure is the day-to-day supervision of the business 
by the Directors. Other internal control procedures and reviews 
for effectiveness by the Board continue to be developed.
The Director of Internal Audit reports directly to the Audit 
Committee and will meet regularly with the Audit Committee 
in the absence of management. In addition, a procedure has 
been introduced by which employees may, in confi dence, raise 
concerns about possible improprieties in matters of fi nancial 
reporting or other matters.
Audit and auditor independence
An additional responsibility of the Audit Committee is to 
keep under review the scope and cost effectiveness of the 
external audit. This includes recommending to the Board the 
appointment of the external auditors and for reviewing the scope 
of the audit, approving the audit fee and, on an annual basis, 
satisfying the Committee that the auditors are independent. 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP are retained to perform 
audit and audit-related work on the Group, the Company 
and the majority of Group companies. 
Deloitte LLP are retained to provide UK and overseas 
tax-related advice.
The Audit Committee monitors the nature and extent of non-
audit work undertaken by the auditors. It is satisfi ed that there 
are adequate controls in place to ensure auditor independence 
and objectivity. The matter is kept under review and is a standing 
item on the agenda for the Audit Committee reports. Periodically, 
the Audit Committee monitors the cost of non-audit work 
undertaken by the auditors. The Audit Committee considers 
that it is in a position to take action if at any time it believes that 
there is a risk of the auditors’ independence being undermined 
through the award of this work.
The split between audit and non-audit fees for the year under 
review appears in note 9 on page 62.   45 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
2009 operations Governance Financial statements
Independent auditors’ report 
to the members of Cape plc 
We have audited the Group and Parent Company fi nancial 
statements (the ‘fi nancial statements’) of Cape plc for the year 
ended 31 December 2009 which comprise the Consolidated 
balance sheet, the Parent Company balance sheet, the 
Consolidated income statement, the Consolidated statement 
of comprehensive income, the Consolidated statement of cash 
fl ows, the Consolidated statement of changes in equity, and the 
related notes. The fi nancial reporting framework that has been 
applied in the preparation of the Group fi nancial statements is 
applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The fi nancial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation 
of the Parent Company fi nancial statements is applicable law 
and United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ 
responsibilities set out on page 40, the directors are 
responsible for the preparation of the fi nancial statements 
and for being satisfi ed that they give a true and fair view. Our 
responsibility is to audit the fi nancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with 
the Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and 
only for the company’s members as a body in accordance with 
Sections 495 and 496 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no 
other purpose. We do not, in giving these opinions, accept 
or assume responsibility for any other purpose or to any other 
person to whom this report is shown or into whose hands it 
may come save where expressly agreed by our prior consent 
in writing.
Scope of the audit of the fi nancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts 
and disclosures in the fi nancial statements suffi cient to give 
reasonable assurance that the fi nancial statements are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or 
error. This includes an assessment of whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Parent Company’s 
circumstances and have been consistently applied and 
adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of signifi cant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall 
presentation of the fi nancial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:
–  the Group fi nancial statements give a true and fair view of 
the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2009 
and of its loss and cash fl ows for the year then ended;
–  the Parent Company fi nancial statements give a true and 
fair view of the state of the Parent Company’s affairs as at 
31 December 2009;
–  the Group fi nancial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the 
European Union;
–  the Parent Company fi nancial statements have been 
properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice; and
–  the fi nancial statements have been prepared in accordance 
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the 
Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report 
for the fi nancial year for which the fi nancial statements are 
prepared is consistent with the fi nancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters 
where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
–  adequate accounting records have not been kept by the 
Parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have 
not been received from branches not visited by us; or 
–  the Parent Company fi nancial statements are not in 
agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
–  certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration specifi ed 
by law are not made; or 
–  we have not received all the information and explanations 
we require for our audit.

1. Basis of preparation
The consolidated fi nancial statements have been prepared 
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) and International Financial Reporting Interpretations 
Committee (IFRIC) Interpretations as adopted by the European 
Union and in accordance with the provisions of the Companies 
Act 2006. The consolidated fi nancial statements have been 
prepared under the historic cost convention and on a going 
concern basis. 
The accounts for the Parent Company, Cape plc, have 
been prepared in accordance with UK GAAP. The Company 
accounts are presented in separate fi nancial statements on 
pages 88 to 93. 
Changes in accounting policies and disclosures
(a) New and amended standards adopted by the Group
The Group has adopted the following new and amended 
IFRSs as of 1 January 2009:
–  IAS 1 (Revised), Presentation of fi nancial statements 
– effective 1 January 2009. The revised standard prohibits 
the presentation of items of income and expenses (that is, 
‘non-owner changes in equity’) in the statement of changes 
in equity, requiring ‘non-owner changes in equity’ to be 
presented separately from owner changes in equity in 
a statement of comprehensive income. As a result, the 
Group presents in the consolidated statement of changes 
in equity all owner changes in equity, whereas all non-
owner changes in equity are presented in the consolidated 
statement of comprehensive income. Comparative 
information has been re-presented so that it also is in 
conformity with the revised standard. As the change in 
accounting policy only impacts presentation aspects, 
there is no impact on earnings per share;
–  IFRS 8, Operating segments – effective 1 January 2009. 
IFRS 8 replaces IAS 14, Segment reporting. The new 
standard requires a ‘management approach’, under which 
segment information is presented on the same basis as 
that used for internal reporting purposes; and 
–  IFRS 7, Financial instruments – Disclosures (Amendment) 
– effective 1 January 2009. The amendment requires 
enhanced disclosures about fair value measurement 
and liquidity risk. In particular, the amendment requires 
disclosure of fair value measurements by level of a fair 
value measurement hierarchy.
The following amendments to existing standards and 
interpretations were also effective for the current period, but 
the adoption of these amendments to existing standards and 
interpretations did not have a material impact on the Financial 
Statements of the Group:
–  IAS 32 (Amendment), Financial Instruments: Presentation, 
and IAS 1 (Amendment), Presentation of Financial 
Statements – Puttable fi nancial instruments and obligations 
arising on liquidation;
–  IAS 27, Consolidated and separate fi nancial statements 
– Amendment relating to cost of investment on fi rst 
time adoption;
–  IAS 39 (Amendment), Reclassifi cation of Financial Assets: 
Effective Date and Transition; 
–  IFRS 2 (Amendment), Share-based Payment (effective 
1 January 2009) deals with vesting conditions and 
cancellations;
–  IFRIC 16, Hedges of a Net Investment in a Foreign 
Operation; and
–  IFRIC 9 (Amendment), Re-assessment of Embedded 
Derivatives, and IAS 39 (Amendment), Financial 
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement.
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations to existing 
standards that are not yet effective and have not been 
early adopted by the Group.
The following standards and amendments to existing standards 
have been published and are mandatory for the Group’s 
accounting periods beginning on or after 1 January 2010 
or later periods, but the Group has not early adopted them:
 
–  IFRS 3 (Revised), Business combinations (effective from 
1 July 2009). The revised standard continues to apply 
the acquisition method to business combinations, with 
some signifi cant changes. The Group will apply IFRS 3 
(Revised) prospectively to all business combinations from 
1 January 2010;
–  IAS 38 (Amendment), Intangible Assets. The Group will 
apply IAS 38 (Amendment) from the date IFRS 3 (Revised) is 
adopted. The amendment will not result in a material impact 
on the Group’s fi nancial statements;
–  IAS 1 (Amendment), Presentation of fi nancial statements. 
The amendment provides clarifi cation that the potential 
settlement of a liability by the issue of equity is not relevant 
to its classifi cation as current or non current. The Group 
will apply IAS 1 (Amendment) from 1 January 2010. It is 
not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s 
fi nancial statements;

–  IFRS 2 (Amendments), Group cash-settled share-based 
payment transaction (effective from 1 January 2010). 
The new guidance is not expected to have a material 
impact on the Group’s fi nancial statements; and
–  IAS 27 (Revised), Consolidated and separate fi nancial 
statements, (effective from 1 July 2009). The Group will 
apply IAS 27 (Revised) prospectively to transactions with 
non-controlling interests from 1 January 2010.
(c) Accounting standards, interpretations and amendments 
that are not yet effective and not relevant to the Group.
The following interpretations and amendments to existing 
standards have been published by the IASB will become 
effective for future fi nancial reporting periods but are not 
relevant for the Group’s operations: 
–  IAS 28 – Investments in associates – consequential 
amendments arising from amendments to IFRS 3 
(effective from: 1 July 2009);
–  IAS 31 – Investments in joint ventures – consequential 
amendments arising from amendments to IFRS 3

Adopters, effective for annual periods commencing on 
or after 1 January 2010, subject to EU endorsement;
–  IFRS 1 (Amendment), Limited Exemption from Comparative 
IFRS 7 disclosures for First-time Adopters, effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2010, subject

(effective on or after 1 July 2009);
–  IFRIC 19, Extinguishing Financial Liabilities with Equity 
Instruments, effective for annual periods beginning on 
or after 1 July 2010, subject to EU endorsement.
2. Accounting policies
The Group’s key accounting policies are set out below. 
These policies have been prepared on a historic cost basis 
and under recognition and measurement requirements of IFRS 
standards in effect that apply to accounting periods beginning 
on or after 1 January 2009.
Basis of consolidation
(a)  A business combination is recognised where separate 
legal entities or businesses have been brought together 
within the Group.
 
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power 
to govern the fi nancial and operating policies. This is generally 
accompanying a shareholding of more than 50% of the voting 
rights, except in certain countries where legal restrictions over 
ownership of shares by non-domicile entities exist. In such 
situations management consolidate entities as subsidiaries 
where the Group has effective control over the fi nancial 
and operating policies. Subsidiaries are fully consolidated 
from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. 
They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases.
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for 
business combinations made by the Group. The cost of a 
business combination is measured as the fair value of the 
assets acquired, equity instruments issued and liabilities 
incurred or assumed at the date of exchange, plus costs 
directly attributable to the business combination.
Contingent consideration is included in the cost of a business 
at the acquisition date only if the consideration is probable 
and can be reliably measured, and is discounted using an 
appropriate discount rate. If the future events upon which the 
contingent consideration is based do not occur or the estimate 
needs to be revised or if contingent consideration, which has 
not been initially included, does become probable and can be 
reliably measured, the cost of the business combination, and 
any associated goodwill, is adjusted accordingly.
 
Identifi able assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities acquired 
in the business combination are measured initially at their 
fair value at the acquisition date. The excess of the cost of 
acquisition over the fair value of the Group’s share of the 
identifi able net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill. If the 
cost of acquisition is less than the fair value of the net assets 
acquired, the difference is credited to the income statement 
in the period of acquisition.
(b)  The Group’s interest in joint ventures is accounted for 
under the equity method. The consolidated fi nancial statements 
include the Group’s share of the profi ts or losses of joint 
ventures and the consolidated balance sheet includes the 
investments in joint ventures at cost, including attributable 
goodwill, plus the Group’s share of post-acquisition reserves 
and after dividends received.  53 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
2009 operations Governance Financial statements
(c)  Minority interests in subsidiaries consolidated by the Group 
are disclosed separately from the Group’s equity and income. 
Losses attributable to a minority in excess of the minority’s 
interest in net assets of the subsidiary are adjusted against the 
interest of the Group unless there is a binding obligation on 
the part of the minority to contribute additional investment in 
the subsidiary.
(d)  Inter-company income, expenses, balances and unrealised 
gains and losses on transactions between Group companies 
are eliminated on consolidation.
(e)  All subsidiary undertakings have year end dates of 
31 December except Cape Industrial Services Group Limited 
which prepares accounts to 31 March and last prepared 
annual accounts to 31 March 2009. 
Foreign currencies
(a)  Functional and presentational currency
Items included in the fi nancial statements of each of the 
Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary 
economic environment in which the entity operates (‘functional 
currency’). The consolidated fi nancial statements are presented 
in GB pounds, which is the Company’s functional and 
presentational currency.
(b)  Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional 
currency using exchange rates prevailing at the date of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from 
the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at 
period end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income 
statement, except when deferred in equity as qualifying cash 
fl ow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
(c)  Group companies
The results and fi nancial position of all Group entities that have 
a functional currency different from the presentation currency 
are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
–  assets and liabilities for each balance sheet presented are 
translated at the closing exchange rate at the date of the 
balance sheet;
–  income and expenses for each income statement are 
translated at average exchange rates (unless this average is 
not a reasonable approximation of the cumulative effect of 
the rates prevailing on the transaction dates, in which case 
the income and expenses are translated at the rate on the 
dates of the transaction); and
–  all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a 
separate component of equity.
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the 
translation of the net investment in foreign operations, and 
of borrowings and other currency instruments designated 
as hedges of such investments, are taken to shareholders’ 
equity. When a foreign operation is partially disposed of or 
sold, exchange differences that were recognised in equity 
are recognised in the income statement as part of the gain 
or loss on sale.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on the acquisition 
of a foreign entity are treated as assets and liabilities of the 
foreign entity and translated at the closing exchange rate.
Goodwill
Goodwill represents the excess of the cost of an acquisition 
over the fair value of the Group’s share of the identifi able net 
assets acquired. Goodwill is tested annually for impairment 
and carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses. 
Goodwill is allocated to the appropriate cash generating 
unit for the purpose of impairment testing. Any impairment is 
recognised immediately through the income statement and 
is not subsequently reversed.
Intangible assets
Intangible assets are recognised if it is probable that there will 
be future economic benefi ts attributable to the asset, the cost 
of the asset can be measured reliably, the asset is separately 
identifi able and there is control over the use of the asset. The 
assets are amortised on a straight line basis over the period 
over which the Group expects to benefi t from these assets, 
ranging from three to fi ve years.
Property, plant and equipment
Property, plant and equipment is stated at cost net of 
accumulated depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Cost comprises purchase cost together with any incidental 
costs of acquisition. Certain land and buildings are held at 
previous revalued amounts less accumulated depreciation as 
these amounts have been taken as their deemed cost at the 
date of transition to IFRS in accordance with the exemption 
under IFRS 1 ‘First-time Adoption of IFRS’.
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost less the estimated 
residual value of tangible fi xed assets by equal instalments over 
their estimated useful economic lives with the exception that no 
depreciation is provided on freehold land. The asset’s residual 
values and useful economic lives are reviewed, and adjusted as 
appropriate, at each balance sheet date. The following rates are 
applied:
– freehold buildings – 2% per annum;
– leasehold land and buildings – the period of the lease; and 
–  plant, machinery and fi xtures and fi ttings – 1% to 33% 
per annum.
Investment properties are stated at cost less any provision 
for impairment. 54 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
Annual Report 2009
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements
continued
Impairment of assets (excluding goodwill)
The entity assesses at each reporting date whether an asset 
may be impaired. If any such indication exists, the Group 
makes an estimate of the assets recoverable amount. An 
asset’s recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value 
less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing value in use, 
the estimated future cash fl ows attributable to the asset are 
discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate 
that refl ects current market assessments of the time value of 
money and the risks specifi c to the asset.
Where the recoverable amount is estimated to be less than 
its carrying amount, the carrying amount is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately in the income statement.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice 
amounts less an allowance for any amount estimated to be 
uncollectable.
Leases
(a) Finance leases
Where assets are fi nanced by leasing agreements that give 
rights approximating to ownership, the amount representing the 
outright purchase price is capitalised and the corresponding 
leasing commitments are shown as obligations to the lessor. 
The relevant assets are depreciated in accordance with the 
Group’s depreciation policy or over the lease term if shorter. 
Net fi nance charges, calculated on the reducing balance 
method, are included in fi nance costs.
(b) Operating leases
Payments made under operating leases, net of any incentives 
received from the lessor, are charged to the income statement 
on a straight line basis over the period of the lease.
Critical accounting estimates and judgements
The preparation of these fi nancial statements requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of 
the fi nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from 
these estimates. Information about such judgements and 
estimations are contained in individual accounting policies.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty that could cause an 
adjustment to be required to the carrying amount of asset or 
liabilities within the next accounting period are outlined below:
(a) Carrying amount of certain assets and goodwill
In reviewing the carrying value of certain assets and goodwill, 
estimates of future fi nancial performance of the assets and 
businesses concerned are taken into account. The estimates 
inherently include assumptions about internal and external 
factors that, whilst considered reasonable at the date of these 
accounts, may change in the future from those levels currently 
expected. The carrying value of goodwill has been considered 
fully in note 13.
(b) Pensions and other post retirement costs
The liability in respect of the Group’s retirement benefi t 
obligations is dependent on a number of estimates including 
those relating to mortality, infl ation, salary increases and the 
rate at which liabilities are discounted. Any change in these 
assumptions would impact the retirement benefi t obligation 
recognised. Further information on the assumptions used is 
disclosed in note 16.
(c) Revenue recognition and assessment of construction 
contract performance
Revenue and profi t on long-term construction contracts are 
usually recognised according to the stage of completion 
of the contract, which is calculated by reference to the 
estimated contract revenues and expected costs including 
provisions. The judgements made in this process are 
considered to be appropriate; however, a change in these 
estimates would have an impact on the amount of revenue, 
costs and profi ts recognised.
(d) Industrial disease claims
Provision is made for compensation for industrial disease 
claims where it is possible to estimate the liability with 
suffi cient reliability. The key critical accounting estimates 
and assumptions in respect of the provisions for industrial 
disease are detailed in note 26.
(e) Deferred tax assets
Deferred tax has only been recognised where it is assumed 
that the deferred tax asset is recoverable. The accumulated 
losses reported by the Group for tax purposes in various tax 
jurisdictions have not been recognised as deferred tax assets 
where the Directors hold the view that it is unlikely that the 
Group will be able to utilise them in the future. Further 
information on the assumptions used is disclosed in note 17.
Compensation for industrial disease
Provision is made for compensation for industrial disease where 
it is possible to estimate the liability with suffi cient reliability. 
This is in respect of both claims lodged and outstanding at 
the period end and future potential claims. Where this is not 
possible, a contingent liability is noted. Benefi t is recognised 
for insurance recoveries for claims provided when they are 
anticipated with virtual certainty.
Provisions
Provisions for liabilities are made where the timing or amount 
of settlement is uncertain. A provision is recognised when: the 
Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result 
of past events; it is probable that an outfl ow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation and the amount has been 
reliably estimated.
Provisions are measured at the present value of the 
expenditures expected to be required to settle the obligation 
using a pre-tax rate that refl ects current market assessments 
of the time value of money and risks specifi c to the obligation.  55 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
2009 operations Governance Financial statements
Inventories
Inventories which include raw materials and work in progress 
are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Raw materials are valued based on fi rst in fi rst out method.
Net realisable value is the estimated selling price in the ordinary 
course of business less selling expenses. Allowance is made 
for obsolete and slow moving items based on annual usage. 
Revenue recognition
Revenue comprises the fair value of the consideration received 
or receivable for the sale of goods and services in the ordinary 
course of the Group’s activities. Revenue is shown net of value 
added tax, returns, rebates and discounts and after eliminating 
sales within the Group. Revenue recognition in relation to 
construction contracts is described in the accounting policy 
for construction contracts.
Construction contracts
Contracts are undertaken for customers either on a short 
or long-term basis. For short-term contracts, work done is 
substantially billed as performed and for long-term contracts, 
work is carried out on a substantially fi xed or limited-price 
basis. For short-term contracts, revenue and profi t are 
recognised according to work executed. Amounts taken to 
revenue in respect of work done but not billed are included 
within amounts recoverable on contracts. Costs incurred, 
including an appropriate allocation of overheads and 
attributable profi ts, in respect of long-term contracts are 
included in work in progress net of progress payments received 
and provisions for foreseeable losses. Provision is made in full 
for any losses as soon as they can be foreseen. Any payments 
on account or provisions for foreseeable losses in excess of 
contract balances are included in trade and other payables. 
Revenue and attributable profi t on long-term contracts is 
recognised according to the percentage of estimated total 
contract value completed or the achievement of contractual 
milestones provided that the outcome of the contract can be 
assessed with reasonable certainty.
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax is 
provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using 
the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively 
enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred income tax is recognised, using the full liability 
method, on temporary differences arising between the tax 
bases of assets and liabilities and their carrying amount in the 
consolidated fi nancial statements. Deferred income tax is 
determined using tax rates (and laws) that have been enacted, 
or substantially enacted, by the balance sheet date and are 
expected to apply when the related deferred tax asset is 
realised or deferred tax liability is settled.
Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it 
is probable that future taxable profi ts will be available against 
which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred income tax is provided on temporary differences 
arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference is 
controlled by the Group and it is probable that the temporary 
difference will not be reversed in the foreseeable future.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items represent income and expenses relating 
to non-recurring transactions that are signifi cant, by virtue of 
their size or nature, and therefore relevant to understanding 
the Group’s fi nancial performance and are shown separately 
to provide a better indication of the underlying results of 
the business.
Employee benefi ts
The Group operates both defi ned benefi t and defi ned 
contribution schemes. 
A defi ned contribution scheme is a pension scheme under 
which the Group pays fi xed contributions into a separate entity. 
The Group has no legal or constructive obligation to pay further 
contributions if the fund does not hold suffi cient assets to pay 
all employees the benefi ts relating to employment in the current 
or prior periods. The pension expense for defi ned contribution 
schemes represents contributions payable in the year.
A defi ned benefi t scheme is a pension scheme that is not a 
defi ned contribution scheme. The asset recognised in the 
balance sheet in respect of the defi ned benefi t scheme is the 
present value of the defi ned benefi t obligation at the balance 
sheet date less the fair value of the plan assets. The defi ned 
benefi t obligation is calculated tri-annually by independent 
actuaries using the projected unit method and this valuation 
is updated at each balance sheet date. The present value of 
the defi ned benefi t obligation is determined by discounting 
the estimated future cash outfl ows using interest rates of high 
quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in 
which the benefi ts will be paid and that have terms to maturity 
approximating to the terms of the related pension liability.
Current and past service costs, fi nance costs and expected 
returns on assets are charged to operating profi t. Actuarial 
gains and losses arising from new valuations and from updating 
the latest actuarial valuation to refl ect conditions at the balance 
sheet date are recognised in full in the statement of recognised 
income and expense.
The pension schemes’ defi cits or surpluses, (to the extent that 
any surpluses are considered recoverable), are recognised in 
full and presented on the face of the balance sheet.
Under IFRIC 14 the recoverability of a surplus must be 
assessed against the minimum funding requirements of the 
pension scheme.
The Group operates gratuity schemes in certain overseas 
countries. These are accounted for in accordance with IAS 19 
and accounting follows the same principles as for a defi ned 
benefi t scheme. 56 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
Annual Report 2009
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements

Accounting for derivative fi nancial instruments 
and hedging activities
The Group uses derivative fi nancial instruments such as 
forward currency contracts and interest rate swaps to hedge 
its risks associated with foreign currency and interest rate 
fl uctuations. Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value 
on the date the contract is entered into and are subsequently 
remeasured at their fair value.
The fair value of forward currency contracts is calculated by 
reference to current forward exchange rates for contracts with 
similar maturity profi les. The fair value of interest rate swaps is 
determined by reference to market values of similar 
instruments.
For the purpose of hedge accounting, hedges are classifi ed as:
–  fair value hedges when hedging the exposure to changes 
in the fair value of a recognised asset or liability; 
–  net investment hedges when hedging the exposure to 
changes in the value of the Group’s interests in the net 
assets of foreign operations; and
–  cash fl ow hedges when hedging exposure to variability in 
cash fl ows that is either attributable to a particular risk 
associated with a recognised asset or liability or a highly 
probable forecast transaction.
The Group formally designates and documents the relationship 
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item at the 
inception of the transaction, as well as its risk management 
objectives and strategy for undertaking various hedge 
transactions. The documentation also includes identifi cation 
of the hedging instrument, the hedged item or transaction, the 
nature of the risk being hedged and how the Group will assess 
the effectiveness of the hedging instruments in offsetting the 
exposure to changes in the fair value of the hedge or the cash 
fl ows attributable to the hedged risk. The Group also 
documents its assessment, both at inception and on an 
ongoing basis, of whether the derivatives that are used in the 
hedging transactions are highly effective in offsetting changes 
in fair values or cash fl ows of the hedged items.
Any gains or losses arising from changes in the fair value of 
derivatives that do not qualify for hedge accounting are taken 
to the income statement. The treatment of gains and losses 
arising from revaluing derivatives designated as hedging 
instruments depends on the nature of the hedging relationship, 
as follows:
(a) Fair value hedges
For fair value hedges, the carrying amount of the hedged item 
is adjusted for gains and losses attributable to the risk being 
hedged; the derivative is remeasured at fair value and gains 
and losses from both are taken to the income statement. 
For hedged items carried at amortised cost, the adjustment 
is amortised through the income statement such that it is 
fully amortised at maturity. The Group discontinues fair value 
hedge accounting if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, 
terminated or exercised, or the hedge no longer meets the 
criteria for hedge accounting.
(b) Net investment hedges
For net investment hedges, the gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument relating to the effective portion of the hedge is 
recognised directly in equity. The gain or loss relating to the 
ineffective portion is recognised immediately in the income 
statement.
Gains and losses accumulated in equity are included in the 
income statement when the foreign operation is partially 
disposed of or sold. 
(c) Cash fl ow hedges
For cash fl ow hedges, the effective portion of the gain or loss 
on the hedging instrument is recognised directly in equity, while 
the ineffective portion is recognised in the income statement. 
Amounts taken to equity are transferred to the income 
statement when the hedged transaction affects the income 
statement.
If the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised without replacement or rollover, or if its designation 
as a hedge is revoked, any cumulative gain or loss existing in 
equity at that time remains in equity and is recognised when 
the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income 
statement. When a forecast transaction is no longer expected 
to occur, the cumulative gain or loss that was reported in equity 
is immediately transferred to the income statement.
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at the amount of the 
consideration received after deduction of issue costs. Issue 
costs together with fi nance costs are charged to the income 
statement over the term of the borrowings and represent a 
constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments 
outstanding.
Cumulative preference shares are classifi ed as liabilities. The 
dividends on these preference shares are recognised in the 
income statement as interest expense. 
Borrowings are classifi ed as current liabilities unless the Group 
has an unconditional right to defer settlement of the liability for 
at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held 
on call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments 
with original maturities of three months or less, and bank 
overdrafts. Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings 
in current liabilities on the balance sheet.
Restricted cash relating to the Scheme of Arrangement 
(see note 34) is excluded from cash and cash equivalents 
for the purpose of the Group statement of cash fl ows.
Share capital
Ordinary shares and deferred shares are classifi ed as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net 
of tax, from the proceeds.

2009 operations Governance Financial statements
Share based payments
The Group issues equity settled share based payments to 
certain employees which must be measured at fair value and 
recognised as an expense in the income statement with a 
corresponding increase in equity. The fair values of these 
payments are measured at the dates of grant using option 
pricing models, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the awards are granted. The fair value is 
recognised over the period during which employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the awards subject to the Group’s 
estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, either 
due to employees leaving the Group prior to vesting or due 
to non-market based performance conditions not being met.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited 
to share capital and share premium.
Segment reporting
Operating segments are reported in a manner consistent with 
the internal reporting provided to the Chief Operating Decision 
Maker (CODM). The CODM, who is responsible for allocating 
resources and assessing performance of the operating 
segments, has been identifi ed as the Group Board.
Financial risk factors
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of fi nancial risks: 
market risk (including currency risk, cash fl ow interest rate risk 
and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The 
Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the 
unpredictability of fi nancial markets and seeks to minimise 
potential adverse effects on the Group’s fi nancial performance. 
The Group uses derivative fi nancial instruments to hedge 
certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the Group treasury 
department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. 
Group treasury identifi es, evaluates and hedges fi nancial risks 
in close co-operation with the Group’s operating units. The 
Board provides written principles for overall risk management, 
as well as written policies covering specifi c areas, such as 
foreign exchange risk, interest rate risk, credit risk, use of 
derivative fi nancial instruments and non-derivative fi nancial 
instruments, and investment of excess liquidity.
(a) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign 
exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, 
primarily with respect to the US dollar, Australian dollar and 
the GB pound. 
The primary exposure to the Group in terms of foreign currency 
risk is translation of the subsidiary results. This risk is managed 
primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant 
foreign currencies. 
 
Foreign currency transaction exposure arising on normal trade 
fl ows is not hedged. The exposure of overseas operating 
subsidiaries to transaction risk is minimised by matching 
functional currency income with functional currency costs. 
(b) Cash fl ow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. 
Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash 
fl ow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fi xed rates expose 
the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
Group treasury reviews its interest rate exposure, taking into 
consideration refi nancing, renewal of existing positions and 
alternative fi nancing and hedging. 
Based on various scenarios, the Group manages its cash fl ow 
interest rate risk by using fl oating to fi xed interest rate swaps. 
Such interest rate swaps have the economic effect of 
converting borrowings from fl oating to fi xed rates. Generally, 
the Group raises long-term borrowings at fl oating rates and 
swaps them into fi xed rates that are lower than those available 
if the Group borrowed at fi xed rates directly. Under interest rate 
swaps, the Group has entered into transactions to exchange, 
at specifi ed intervals (primarily quarterly), the difference 
between fi xed contract rates and fl oating rate interest amounts 
calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
(c) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of fi nancial loss to the Group if a 
customer or counterparty to a fi nancial instrument fails to 
meet its contractual obligations. Credit risk arises principally 
from the Group’s receivables from customers and deposits 
with fi nancial institutions.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk is infl uenced mainly by the 
individual characteristics of each customer. The Group has an 
established credit policy under which each new customer is 
analysed for creditworthiness before the Group’s standard 
payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The 
Group’s review includes external ratings, and in some cases 
bank references. 
(d) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet 
its fi nancial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s approach 
to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have 
suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities when due, under both 
normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable 
losses or damage to the Group’s reputation.
(e) Capital risk
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to 
safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in 
order to provide returns for shareholders and benefi ts for other 
stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to 
reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group 
may adjust the amount of dividends payable to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets 
to reduce debt. 58 Cape plc Annual Report 2009

12. (Loss)/earnings per ordinary share
The basic loss per share calculation for the year ended 31 December 2009 (2008: earnings per share) is based on the loss after 
tax attributable to ordinary shareholders of £4.1 million (2008: earnings of £30.6 million) divided by the weighted average number 
of ordinary 25p shares of 115,427,015 (2008: 114,537,257).
The diluted loss per share calculation for the year ended 31 December 2009 (2008: diluted earnings per share) is based on 
the loss after tax of £4.1 million (2008: earnings of £30.6 million) divided by the diluted weighted average number of ordinary 
25p shares of 118,038,129 (2008: 116,381,373).
Share options are considered potentially dilutive as the average share price during the year was above the average exercise prices.

The adjusted earnings per share calculations have been calculated after excluding the impact of amortisation, exceptional items, 
IDC related costs and interest income, the tax impact of these items and an exceptional tax credit received in Australia 
predominantly arising on the consolidation of PCH assets in Australia which was acquired during 2007. 
Options are dilutive at the profi t from continuing operations level and so, in accordance with IAS 33, have been treated as dilutive 
for the purpose of diluted earnings per share. Diluted loss per share in 2008 is lower than basic loss per share in respect of 
discontinued operations because of the effect of losses on discontinued operations. 64 Cape plc Annual Report 2009

Other intangibles include customer relationships and contracts, technological assets and amounts relating to favourable contracts. 
The useful economic lives of the intangible assets range from three to fi ve years.
Amortisation charges of £2.9 million (2008: £2.7 million) have been charged to cost of sales in the income statement. 
There are three individually signifi cant intangible assets. There are two customer relationships and contracts which have carrying 
values of £0.6 million and £0.8 million and will be fully amortised to £nil over the next year, and a favourable lease contract which 
has a carrying value of £1.1 million and will be amortised to £nil over the next three years.
Impairment tests for goodwill
Goodwill is allocated to the Group’s Cash-Generating Units (CGU). All goodwill relates to Industrial Services.
The aggregate carrying amounts of goodwill allocated by geographical area is as follows:
      2009 2008
      £m £m
UK      16.2 16.2
Gulf/Middle East      0.7 0.7
Australia      190.1 165.6
      207.0 182.5
The recoverable amount of a CGU is determined based on value-in-use calculations. These calculations use pre-tax cash fl ow 
projections based on fi nancial budgets approved by management covering a fi ve-year period. Cash fl ows beyond the fi ve-year 
period are extrapolated using the estimated growth rates stated below. 
The key assumptions used for value-in-use calculations are:
  2009 2008
  United  Gulf/Middle   United  Gulf/Middle  
  Kingdom East Australia Kingdom East Australia
Terminal growth rate  3.0% 3.0% 3.3% 3.0% 3.0% 3.3%
Average ﬁ ve-year growth rate  3.2% 1.8% 17.6% 4.0% 5.0% 6.0%

Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements
continued  65 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
2009 operations Governance Financial statements
13. Intangible assets (continued)
Terminal growth rates are based on the long-term growth rates for the countries in which the CGU operates. Management 
determined growth rates over the next fi ve years based on internal forecasts that were derived from detailed analysis on future 
prospects combined with the secured order book for the relevant CGU. The discount rates used are pre-tax and refl ect specifi c 
risks relating to the relevant CGU. 
Sensitivity analysis
A sensitivity analysis has been performed on the base case assumptions used for assessing the goodwill. The directors have 
concluded that in the case of both the UK and Middle East goodwill there are no reasonably possible changes in key assumptions 
which would cause the carrying value of goodwill to exceed its value in use. In the case of Cape Australia, it is reasonably possible 
that a change in key assumptions could occur which would lead the carrying value to exceed the value in use. The recoverable 
amount exceeds carrying value by £24.0 million. If the terminal growth rate, average fi ve-year growth rate or discount rate 
assumptions used in the model were changed to 2.7%, 15.7% or 12.0% respectively then carrying amount and value in use 
would be equal. 
14. Property, plant and equipment
During the year ended 31 December 2009, the Group acquired assets with a cost of £11.6 million (2008: £26.2 million) and 
received proceeds from asset sales of £1.1 million (2008: £2.7 million) giving net capital expenditure of £10.5 million (2008: 
£23.5 million). The capital expenditure of £10.0 million (2008: £19.9 million) shown in the cash fl ow statement represents the 
actual cash outfl ow and therefore excludes purchases funded through fi nance leases of £1.6 million (2008: £6.3 million).

Depreciation expense of £15.8 million (2008: £15.3 million) has been charged to cost of sales in the income statement.
Exchange adjustments relate to the translation of assets held by foreign operations into the presentation currency.
Included within Land and buildings is an investment property with a value of £2.0 million (2008: £2.0 million). No rent is received 
from the investment property. The fair value of the investment property has not been estimated as the property is the residual land 
left over from the sale of the Calsil businesses.
The Group leases plant and machinery under fi nance lease agreements. The leased equipment secures lease obligations (see 
note 22). At 31 December 2009 the net carrying amount of leased plant and machinery was £21.0 million (2008: £26.3 million).

16. Retirement benefi t obligations
The Group operates a defi ned benefi t scheme and a defi ned contribution scheme for employees within the UK and provides 
pensions for employees of overseas companies in accordance with local requirements and practices. The assets of both the 
defi ned benefi t and defi ned contribution schemes are held in trustee administered funds. The latest full valuation of the defi ned 
benefi t scheme was assessed by independent qualifi ed actuaries as at 6 April 2007 using the projected unit method. The 
valuation showed that the assets of the defi ned benefi t scheme had a market value of £132.4 million and was 100% funded. 
Included within the assets balance is an amount of £65.6 million in respect of insurance policies covering pensioner liabilities. 
The next full valuation will take place as at 6 April 2010.
Some of the Group’s overseas subsidiary undertakings operate leaving indemnity schemes as required by local laws and 
regulations. These schemes are unfunded. The provision for leaving indemnities is based on the number of years service 
and the current salary of the employee. 
The pension expense in the period for the defi ned contribution pension scheme of £3.7 million (2008: £2.7 million) equalled 
the Group contributions to the scheme. 
The defi ned benefi t scheme disclosures of the Group in this note also include fi gures relating to a small scheme held by a 
subsidiary undertaking.

17. Deferred income tax (continued)
At the balance sheet date, the Group has unused tax losses of £8.6 million (2008: £15.9 million) available for offset against future 
profi ts, subject to agreement with the tax authorities. The losses carried forward are in certain entities and can only be utilised 
against future profi ts of those entities. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses as there is uncertainty 
in respect of its future recoverability. In particular, £3.3 million (2008: £10.4 million) of the balance relates to losses arising in the 
Australian consolidated group which are subject to strict recognition rules. The Group is still determining whether the losses can 
be recognised and if so, the extent to which they can be recognised.
Advance corporation tax written off to date amounts to £1.8 million (2008: £1.7 million) and is available for offset against future 
United Kingdom corporation tax liabilities subject to certain conditions being met. The future benefi t of advance corporation tax 
has not been accounted for in the provision of deferred taxation as its recoverability is uncertain.

Bank borrowings
The bank loans and overdrafts of £152.0 million (2008: £174.1 million) are secured by fi xed and fl oating charges over the assets 
of the Group. Bank loans are stated net of unamortised issue costs of £2.1 million (2008: £2.8 million). The Group incurred issue 
costs of £3.9 million in respect of the fi ve-year facility entered into in September 2007 (amended December 2007 and July 2008) 
under which amounts were drawn down to part fund the acquisitions in Australia. These issue costs together with the interest 
expense are allocated to the income statement over the fi ve-year term of the facility at a constant rate on the carrying amount.

Disclosures in respect of the Group’s fi nancial risks are set out below.
Financial risk management
The Group’s activities expose it to a variety of fi nancial risks: market risk (including currency risk, cash fl ow interest rate risk 
and fair value interest rate risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk management programme focuses on the 
unpredictability of fi nancial markets and seeks to minimise potential adverse effects on the Group’s fi nancial performance. 
The Group uses derivative fi nancial instruments to hedge certain risk exposures.
Risk management is carried out by the Group treasury department under policies approved by the Board of Directors. Group 
treasury identifi es, evaluates and hedges fi nancial risks in close cooperation with the Group’s operating units. The Board provides 
written principles for overall risk management, as well as written policies covering specifi c areas, such as foreign exchange risk, 
interest rate risk, credit risk, use of derivative fi nancial instruments and non-derivative fi nancial instruments, and investment of 
excess liquidity.
(a) Market risk
(i) Foreign exchange risk
The Group operates internationally and is exposed to foreign exchange risk arising from various currency exposures, primarily 
with respect to the US dollar, Australian dollar and the GB pound. 
 
The primary exposure to the Group in terms of foreign currency risk is translation of the subsidiary results. This risk is managed 
primarily through borrowings denominated in the relevant foreign currencies. No sensitivity analysis has been performed for the 
purposes of these accounts as under IFRS 7 translation related risk is not taken into account.
 
Foreign currency transaction exposure arising on normal trade fl ows is not hedged. The exposure of overseas operating subsidiaries 
to transaction risk is minimised by matching functional currency income with functional currency costs. Group management has 
completed a sensitivity analysis on the exposure of the Group to reasonable movements in the main functional currencies used by 
the subsidiaries and conclude that the impact on profi t and equity is minimal. 
  76 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
Annual Report 2009
23. Financial instruments (continued) 
(ii) Cash fl ow and fair value interest rate risk
The Group’s interest rate risk arises from long-term borrowings. Borrowings issued at variable rates expose the Group to cash 
fl ow interest rate risk. Borrowings issued at fi xed rates expose the Group to fair value interest rate risk. 
As at 31 December 2009, the Group’s debt was denominated in GB pounds, US dollars and Australian dollars and was all at 
a fl oating rate. The Group has interest rate swaps in place for both the US dollar denominated debt and a proportion of the 
GB pound debt.
The Group reviews its interest rate exposure, taking into consideration refi nancing, renewal of existing positions and alternative 
fi nancing and hedging. 
Based on various scenarios, the Group manages its cash fl ow interest rate risk by using fl oating to fi xed interest rate swaps. Such 
interest rate swaps have the economic effect of converting borrowings from fl oating to fi xed rates. Under interest rate swaps, the 
Group has entered into transactions to exchange, at specifi ed intervals (primarily quarterly), the difference between fi xed contract 
rates and fl oating rate interest amounts calculated by reference to the agreed notional amounts.
Management has performed a sensitivity analysis on the impact of reasonable movements in interest rates on Group profi t and 
equity and consider that the impact is negligible. 
(b) Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of fi nancial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a fi nancial instrument fails to meet its 
contractual obligations, and arise principally from the Group’s receivables from customers and deposits with fi nancial institutions.
The Group’s exposure to credit risk (see note 19 for additional information) is infl uenced mainly by the individual characteristics 
of each customer. The Group has an established credit policy under which each new customer is analysed for creditworthiness 
before the Group’s standard payment and delivery terms and conditions are offered. The Group’s review includes external ratings, 
and in some cases bank references. 
 
(c) Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to meet its fi nancial obligations as they fall due (see note 22 for additional 
information). The Group’s approach to managing liquidity is to ensure that it will always have suffi cient liquidity to meet its liabilities 
when due, under both normal and stressed conditions, without incurring unacceptable losses or damage to the Group’s 
reputation.
(d) Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to 
provide returns for shareholders and benefi ts for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the 
cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure the Group may adjust the amount of dividends payable to shareholders, 
return capital to shareholders, issue new shares or sell assets to reduce debt.
(e) Accounting for derivative fi nancial instruments and hedging activities
On inception derivatives are accounted and measured at fair value and subsequently remeasured at fair value. The gain or loss 
on remeasurement is taken to the income statement except where the derivative is a designated hedging instrument when it is 
recognised in equity. The accounting treatment of derivatives classifi ed as hedges depends on their designations, which occurs 
on the date that the derivative contract is committed to. The Group designates derivatives as:
– a hedge of the income/cost of a highly probable forecasted transaction or commitment (‘cash fl ow hedge’);
– a hedge of the net investment in a foreign entity (‘net investment hedge’); and
– a hedge of the fair value of an asset or liability (‘fair value hedge’).
In order to qualify for hedge accounting, the Group documents in advance the relationship between the item being hedged and 
the hedging instrument and demonstrates the relationship between the hedged item and the hedging instrument, to show that the 
hedge will be effective on an on-going basis. Testing the effectiveness of the hedging instrument is performed bi-annually.

Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements
continued  77 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
2009 operations Governance Financial statements
23. Financial instruments (continued) 
Gains or losses on cash fl ow hedges that are regarded as highly effective are recognised in equity. Where the forecast transaction 
results in a fi nancial asset or liability, the gains or losses previously recognised in equity are reclassifi ed to the income statement in 
the same period as the asset or liability affects income or expenditure. Where the forecasted transaction or commitment results in 
a non-fi nancial asset or a liability, then any gains or losses previously deferred in equity are included in the cost of the related asset 
or liability. If the forecasted transaction or commitment results in future income or expenditure, gains or losses deferred in equity 
are transferred to the income statement in the same period as the underlying income or expenditure. 
For the portion of hedges deemed ineffective or transactions that do not qualify for hedge accounting under IAS 39, any change in 
assets or liabilities is recognised immediately in the income statement. Where a hedge no longer meets the effectiveness criteria, 
any gains or losses deferred in equity are only transferred to the income statement when the committed or forecasted transaction 
is recognised in the income statement. However, where the Group applied cash fl ow hedge accounting for a forecasted or 
committed transaction that is no longer expected to occur, then the cumulative gain or loss that has been recorded in equity is 
transferred to the income statement. When a hedging instrument expires or is sold, any cumulative gain or loss existing in equity 
at that time remains in equity and is recognised when the forecast transaction is ultimately recognised in the income statement.
Where the Group hedges net investments in foreign entities through currency borrowings that are regarded as highly effective, 
the gains or losses on the translation of the borrowings are recognised in equity. If the Group uses derivatives as the hedging 
instrument, the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in equity with any ineffective portion recognised in the income 
statement. On disposal of the foreign operation gains and losses accumulated in equity are transferred to the Income Statement.
The Group has not entered into any fair value hedges.
The fair values of short-term deposits, loans and other borrowings with a maturity of less than one year are assumed to 
approximate to their book values. In the case of the bank loans and other borrowings due in more than one year, the fair value 
of fi nancial liabilities for disclosure purposes is estimated by discounting the future contractual cash fl ows at the current market 
interest rate available to the Group for similar fi nancial instruments.

(i) Interest rate swaps
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding interest rate swap contracts at 31 December 2009 were £85.6 million 
(2008: £109.5 million). 
At 31 December 2009 the main fl oating rates were UK LIBOR, US LIBOR and Australian inter bank rate. Interest rate swaps 
were in place which swapped fl oating LIBOR amounts for fi xed rates. UK LIBOR was swapped for a fi xed rate of 5.145% on 
£60 million of the sterling debt and 5.66% on £7 million of the sterling debt. US LIBOR was swapped for a fi xed rate of 3.23% 
on $30 million of US dollar denominated debt. 
(ii) Forward foreign exchange contracts
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts at 31 December 2009 were £nil 
(2008: £4.8 million).
Gains and losses recognised through the statement of changes in equity on forward foreign exchange contracts as of 
31 December 2008 are recognised in the income statement in the period or periods during which the hedged forecast 
transaction affects the income statement, which is generally within 12 months from the balance sheet date unless the gain 
or loss is included in the initial recognition of a fi nancial asset in which case recognition is over the lifetime of the asset.  78 Cape plc Annual Report 2009

Provision for future liabilities      70.5 –
Total IDC provision      80.2 9.7
Following further work from independent actuaries in the fi nal quarter of last year, the Board consider that the value of the total 
future asbestos-related liabilities can be estimated with suffi cient reliability to enable a provision to be recorded. The Group has 
previously provided for the estimated costs of notifi ed claims only and disclosed by way of a contingent liability the range of low 
and high estimates of £48 million and £203 million provided by the actuarial review as at 31 December 2007.
Following the most recent review it was concluded that a reasonable estimate would lie in the range of £60 million to £100 million 
with a central estimate of £79 million. In the context of the increased net assets of the Group to £319 million, excluding the 
provision for future IDC liabilities (net of tax), the Board considers the range of reasonable estimates has reduced the level of 
uncertainty associated with recognising the liability for potential future claims. With the increased confi dence provided, an 
additional provision of £70.5 million has been recognised. The Board considers that by recognising a provision for the total 
estimated discounted liability on balance sheet, the Group’s fi nancial statements are more informative and meaningful. 
The range of reasonable estimates of £60 million to £100 million is contained within the range of low and high estimates 
of £48m to £203m respectively.
In coming to this decision, the Board have considered the key variables that could infl uence this liability in advance of the next 
full actuarial review which will be as at 31 December 2010. Although not an exhaustive list, the key variables are:
(a) Actual versus Expected claims experience – actual claims experience has broadly tracked to forecast contained in the 
most recent triennial actuarial review at 31 December 2007.
(b) Changes in underlying model assumptions – the Health and Safety Executive (HSE) and the GIRO Institute of Actuaries 
UK Asbestos Working Party (AWP) have recently published updated benchmarks which could impact the reasonable range of 
estimated liability. There are a number of key changes which could impact:
(i) Propensity to claim – this is a major assumption change to the AWP model and estimates how the propensity for individuals 
to claim for damages has increased over time. However, given the high profi le of Cape and the Scheme of Arrangement this is 
thought to be less signifi cant to Cape in comparison to other involved parties.

2009 operations Governance Financial statements
26. Provisions for Industrial Disease Claims (continued)
(ii) Future population mortality – the latest AWP models exclude the impact of past and future migration as well as using 
the latest projections for mortality. Although the assumptions will be updated for the 2010 review, the 2007 review already 
excluded migration impacts and therefore this change should again be less signifi cant.
(iii) Exposure to asbestos over time – the AWP has changed its assumptions on the relative exposure per head of the 
UK population. Although this will impact Cape’s third party and contractor claims it will impact the employee claims to a lesser 
extent, which account for a large proportion of total claims, since the relative exposure per head of employees is based on 
location specifi c rather than general population assumptions.
(iv) Projection for years after 2040 – the initial AWP study excluded these years, however, the 2007 Cape review projected liabilities 
to 2070 and so this will not impact the 2010 review.
(c) Changes in the legal, social or economic environment that may impact claims – there is no view that there has been 
any signifi cant change to the legal, social or economic environment that could materially impact the provision.
After considering the potential impact of the above variables the Board consider the value of the liability at 31 December 2009 
can be estimated with suffi cient reliability to recognise the provision for future industrial disease liabilities.
The total provision for industrial disease related liabilities at 31 December 2009 is £80.2 million and includes estimated costs 
of £9.7 million (2008: £9.7 million) in respect of notifi ed claims. The provision for future liabilities of £70.5 million refl ects the 
central estimate of £79 million adjusted for cash settlements and the unwinding of the discount since the last full actuarial review. 
A deferred tax asset of £19.7 million has also been recognised in respect of the provision for future liabilities. The impact on the 
Group’s balance sheet position at 31 December 2009 is an additional net liability of £50.8 million.
Due to the inherent uncertainty regarding the timing of settlement, all provisions have been classed as non current.
The £74.2 million income statement charge consists of £3.7 million (2008: £5.7 million) in respect of notifi ed claims and 
£70.5 million in respect of the provision for future liabilities. A deferred tax benefi t of £19.7 million has been recorded in the 
tax line in the income statement.

Deferred shares
The holders have no dividend rights, redemption entitlement or voting rights. On a winding up the holders are entitled to 
repayment of capital only after ordinary shareholders have received £100 for each ordinary share.
plc Scheme Share
The plc Scheme Share is held by the Law Debenture Trust Corporation plc on behalf of the Scheme creditors.
The rights attaching to the share are designed to ensure that Scheme assets are only used to settle Scheme claims and ancillary 
costs and do not confer any right to receive a distribution or return of surplus capital save that the holder will have the right to 
require the Company to redeem the share at par value on or at any time after the termination of the Scheme.
The share carries two votes for every vote which the holders of the other classes of shares in issue are entitled to exercise on any 
resolution proposed during the life of the Scheme to engage in certain activities specifi ed in the Company’s Articles of Association.
The Company will not be permitted to engage in certain activities specifi ed in the Company’s Articles of Association without the 
prior consent of the holder of the share.

Share based payments
The Group has a savings related share option scheme (‘Sharesave plan’) which entitles employees of the Group to buy shares 
in the Company. Grants of share options under this scheme are offered to employees periodically and the options are usually 
awarded at a 20% discount to the market price at the date the options are offered to employees. These options must be 
exercised within six months of the vesting date.
The Employee Incentive Plan (EIP) allows the Group to grant options to Directors and senior employees. The EIP carries a 
non-market based performance criteria. The contractual life of the options is 10 years. The options become exercisable on 
the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to a growth in earnings per share over that period exceeding an average 3% 
compounded annually above the growth in the consumer price index over the same period. Exercise of an option is subject to 
continued employment.
The Performance Share Plan (PSP) is the award of Ordinary Shares at no cost to the participant employees or Executive Directors 
of the Group. Awards are made upon the terms set out in the plan and such other additional terms as the Board shall determine. 
PSP awards are conditional awards granted at no cost to the participant. Awards are made upon the terms set out in the plan 
and such other additional terms as the Board shall determine. Vesting of these awards is subject to Cape plc adjusted diluted 
Earnings Per Share (EPS) meeting the specifi ed performance criteria over a three-year vesting period. The performance criteria 
is adjusted diluted EPS growth of the Retail Price Index (‘RPI’) plus 3% for the minimum of 30% of the shares awarded to vest, 
and EPS growth of RPI plus 10% for all of the shares awarded to vest. The contractual life of the award is three years and is 
subject to continued employment.
Options are valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. The fair value per option granted and the assumptions used 
in the calculation for the current and preceding year are as follows:

     Incentive Plan Sharesave plan  Sharesave plan

The expected share price volatility is based on historic volatility. The expected option life is the average expected period to 
exercise. The risk free rate of return is the yield on a fi ve-year zero coupon UK Government bond. The assumed dividend yield 
is zero.
The shares issued under the PSP, are deemed to have a fair value equivalent to the share price on the day of grant. Therefore the 
shares granted in April and July 2009 have fair values of 118.0 pence and 212.25 pence respectively.

31. Repayment of borrowings
The repayment of borrowings shown in the cash fl ow statement represents a £15.0 million (2008: £20.0 million) scheduled 
repayment under the Group’s Senior Debt facility, in addition to a £5.4 million (2008: £nil) reduction of the revolving facility 
in the UK and Australia which could be redrawn at the discretion of Cape.
32. Settlement of loan notes
The loan notes of £3.7 million relate to deferred consideration payable for the acquisition of the DBI Group which took place 
during 2006. These loan notes were settled during January 2009.
33. Contingencies
(a) There is a history of industrial disease claims being lodged against the Group for a number of years. Where the Group has 
determined that it is appropriate to do so, settlement has been made. Based on this experience, it is likely that similar claims will 
continue to be received for the foreseeable future. However, there is signifi cant uncertainty over the number, nature, timing and 
validity of such future claims. This is as a result of, inter alia, uncertainties concerning the population that may have been exposed 
to asbestos and that may develop asbestos-related diseases, the nature and timing of the diseases that may develop, the impact 
of other factors which might have contributed to the claimant’s condition, changes in the legal environment and to the typical cost 
of settlement. These factors affect considerations of liability and the quantum of settlements. Experience to date is that some of 
these claims will be at least partially covered by insurance policies but the amount of cover will not be known until the details of 
the claims are available.
In order to provide for the long-term fi nancing of a great majority of all future asbestos-related claims likely to be made successfully 
against the Group, Cape plc has put in place the Scheme details of which are set out in note 34. The Scheme became effective in 
relation to Cape plc and 12 of its wholly-owned subsidiaries on 14 June 2006. The Scheme companies are listed in note 34.  85 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
2009 operations Governance Financial statements
33. Contingencies (continued)
In accordance with the terms of the Scheme, the Directors have commissioned independent actuaries to review and provide an 
estimate of certain of the Group’s unpaid and uninsured UK asbestos-related claims as at 31 December 2007. Estimates of unpaid 
asbestos-related claims are inherently uncertain. Although the review did not take account of all potential claims against the 
Group, it covers, in the opinion of the Directors, the overwhelming majority of all UK asbestos-related claims likely to be made 
against the Group. The actuaries’ central estimate of the aggregate projected discounted value, net of insurance recoveries, of the 
unpaid UK asbestos-related claims they reviewed is £74.0 million (2008: £74.0 million). This estimate is contained within a range of 
low and high estimates of £48.0 million (2008: £48.0 million) and £203.0 million (2008: £203.0 million) respectively, although there 
can be no certainty that the total cost of such claims will fall within the range of such estimates. The discount rate applied is 5%. 
Claims not covered by the review include, inter alia, overseas claims and certain potential claims for reimbursement from insurers 
and others. 
Following further work from independent actuaries in the fi nal quarter of 2009, the Board consider that the value of the total future 
asbestos-related liabilities can be estimated with suffi cient reliability to enable a provision to be recognised. Previously, the Group 
has provided only for the estimated costs of notifi ed claims only, however, following the most recent review it was concluded that 
a reasonable estimate would lie in the region of £60 million to £100 million with a revised central estimate of £79 million. In the 
context of the increased net assets of the Group to £319 million, excluding the provision for future IDC liabilities (net of tax), the 
Board considers the range of reasonable estimates has reduced the level of uncertainty associated with recognising the liability 
for potential future claims. With the increased confi dence provided, an additional provision of £70.5 million has been recognised. 
The Board considers that by recognising a provision for the total estimated discounted liability on balance sheet, the Group’s 
fi nancial statements are more informative and meaningful. 
The range of reasonable estimates of £60 million to £100 million is contained within the range of low and high estimates of 
£48 million to £203 million respectively.
There remains uncertainty over the net present value of the future claim settlements which could occur over a period of more than 
40 years. However, in aggregate they are unlikely to exceed the amount of the net assets included in the current Group balance 
sheet. Based on the recent history of settlements, the Directors anticipate that, assuming there is no material deterioration in the 
Group’s trading performance nor a signifi cant increase in either the number of asbestos-related claims or the quantum of 
damages or costs the Group has to settle, nor any signifi cant shortfall in the recoveries that the Directors expect the Group to 
make from its insurers and under third-party indemnities and the Scheme fund achieves investment returns in line with current 
expectations, the Group will be able to ensure that (i) its subsidiary Cape Claims Services Limited (‘CCS’) will be suffi ciently funded 
to satisfy all Scheme claims and (ii) the Group will be suffi ciently funded to satisfy any UK asbestos-related claims falling outside 
the Scheme. Should the future pattern as regards timing and quantum of claims prove to be materially and adversely different 
from the historic trend, this could impact on the Group’s fi nancial position.
(b) The Company was the defendant in proceedings brought by some 7,500 South African residents who claimed that they 
suffered injury as the result of mining activities in South Africa undertaken by former subsidiaries of Cape plc. The Company 
entered into an agreement on 13 March 2003 with the claimants in the group action and new claimants who had come forward 
in 2002.
It is possible that claims could arise in the future from claimants who were not included in the group action, or who claim they have 
developed an asbestos-related disease since the date of the settlement and as a result of the Group’s former mining activities in 
South Africa. There is a signifi cant uncertainty as to whether such future claims will be made and as to the number, nature, timing 
and validity of such claims. However, no such claims have been received to date.
(c) Certain companies in the Group continue to be named, along with several asbestos fi bre and asbestos product suppliers, 
as defendants in a number of legal actions in North America. The plaintiffs in such actions are claiming substantial damages 
as a result of the use of these products. The Company has received legal advice in the UK that default judgments obtained 
in North America against Companies within the Group which are not present in North America, would not be enforceable in 
the UK. Consequently the Directors believe that the above-mentioned matters are unlikely to have a material effect on the 
Group’s fi nancial position.
(d) The Group has contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees and bonds entered into in the normal course of business, 
in respect of which no loss is expected. 86 Cape plc Annual Report 2009

34. The Scheme of Arrangement
On 14 June 2006, the Scheme became effective and binding upon Cape plc and the following 12 of its wholly-owned subsidiaries:
Cape Building Products Limited
Cape Calsil Systems Limited
Cape Contracts International Limited
Cape Durasteel Limited
Cape East Limited
Cape Industrial Services Limited
Cape Industries Limited
Cape Insulation Limited
Cape Specialist Coatings Limited
Predart Limited
Somewatch Limited
Somewin Limited
The detailed terms of the Scheme are set out in the Scheme itself, a copy of which has been fi led with the Registrar of Companies, 
the Articles of Association of Cape and Cape Claims Services Limited (‘CCS’) and a number of other ancillary agreements. 
The effect of the Scheme as a whole can be summarised as follows:
(a) While Scheme creditors retain their rights against Scheme companies, and may bring proceedings against Scheme 
companies for declaratory relief to determine whether they have a claim and, if so, of what amount, their rights, subject as 
provided in sub paragraphs (k) and (m) below are only enforceable against CCS under the terms of the Scheme guarantee;
(b) CCS was funded in the fi rst instance with a sum of £40 million which represented what was considered to be a suffi cient sum 
to discharge CCS’s liabilities to Scheme creditors which became payable over at least eight years from 1 January 2006;
(c) Every three years there is an assessment of the projected Scheme claims against Scheme companies payable by CCS over 
the following nine years, by reference to which the Funding Requirement, is established;
(d) The use of Scheme funds is restricted to the payment of established Scheme claims and Scheme creditor costs;
(e) In the event that an assessment reveals a shortfall between the Scheme assets and the Funding Requirement, the Company 
will top up CCS’s funding over the following three years provided that suffi cient cash is available, Cape’s obligation being limited 
to 70% of the Group’s consolidated adjusted operational cash fl ow (including, for example, adjustments to take account of 
acquisitions, an element of capital expenditure and repayment of borrowing facilities); 
(f) Should the Company not be able to meet its top up obligation in any one year, it will be required to make good the shortfall 
in the next year, again subject to suffi cient cash being available;
(g) Alongside the Funding Requirement there is the Scheme Funding Requirement which is assessed every year by reference 
to projected Scheme claims against Scheme companies payable by CCS over the next six years;
(h) If at any time the ratio of the Scheme assets to the Scheme Funding Requirement (the Scheme Funding Percentage) falls 
below 60%, CCS will have the ability to reduce the percentage (the Payment Percentage) of each established claim which it 
pays to Scheme creditors until such time as the Scheme Funding Percentage is restored to 60%;
(i) Cape is permitted to pay dividends provided that at the time of payment (i) the Scheme Funding Percentage in relation 
to the last preceding fi nancial year was certifi ed to be not less than 110%, (ii) the Directors of Cape certify that they anticipate 
that the Scheme Funding Percentage for the current and following fi nancial year will be not less than 110% and (iii) the Payment 
Percentage has not at any time within the previous 40 business days been below 100%. Any distribution which Cape proposes 
to make to its shareholders may not, without the consent of the Scheme Shareholder, exceed the greater of (i) 50% of the 
consolidated operating profi ts of the Group for the last preceding fi nancial year and (ii) the aggregate of any permitted dividends 
made in the preceding fi nancial year. This restriction therefore places a cap on the amount of dividends that the Company may 
pay in any one year;
(j) There have been established special voting shares (the Scheme Shares) in CCS and Cape which are held by an independent 
third party (the Scheme Shareholder) on trust for Scheme creditors. The Scheme Shares have special rights which are designed 
to enable the Scheme Shareholder to protect the interests of Scheme creditors;  87 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
2009 operations Governance Financial statements
34. The Scheme of Arrangement (continued)
(k) In the case of certain Scheme creditors (Recourse Scheme Creditors), who are those Scheme creditors whose claims are in 
whole or in part the subject of a contract of insurance (Recourse Scheme Claims) their rights to enforce their Recourse Scheme 
Claims against a relevant Scheme company will revive in certain circumstances. These circumstances are where the relevant 
Scheme company is insolvent or where there has been a specifi ed reduction in the Payment Percentage and if the Scheme 
creditor was able to bring about the insolvency of the relevant Scheme company he would be able to recover greater 
compensation from the FSCS (‘Financial Services Compensation Scheme’) or, in certain circumstances, from a solvent insurer 
than is available from CCS at that time under the Scheme. There will be a specifi ed reduction if either (i) the Payment Percentage 
has been reduced below 100% but above 50% and the Scheme creditor has not been paid in full after 12 months or (ii) the 
Payment Percentage is reduced to 50% or below;
(l) Each Scheme company will agree to hold on trust for any Scheme creditor concerned the proceeds of any policy of insurance 
(or any compensation received from the FSCS) referable to that Scheme claim;
(m) The restriction described in sub-paragraph (a) above will not apply to proceedings to enforce the right to confer under sub-
paragraph (l) above; and
(n) There are provisions contained in two reimbursement agreements which preserve certain rights of proof by CCS and Cape 
respectively in any insolvency of Cape or any of the other Scheme companies.

1. Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The fi nancial statements are prepared on the going concern 
basis under the historical cost convention and in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006 and applicable accounting 
standards. The Company’s fi nancial statements have been 
prepared in accordance with accounting principles generally 
accepted in the United Kingdom and are therefore being 
presented separately from the consolidated fi nancial 
statements of Cape plc, which have been prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and International 
Financial Reporting Interpretations Committee (IFRIC) 
Interpretations.
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the 
Company has elected not to present its own profi t and loss 
account for the year. In accordance with FRS 1 (revised 1996) 
and FRS 8 the Company has taken advantage of the 
exemptions not to prepare a cash fl ow statement and not to 
disclose related party transactions with entities that are part of 
the Cape plc Group or investees of the Cape plc Group. FRS 
29 Financial instruments: Disclosures became effective from 
1 January 2008. As the consolidated fi nancial statements have 
been prepared in accordance with IFRS 7, the Company is 
exempt from the disclosure requirements of FRS 29. Other 
new accounting standards issued by the Accounting Standards 
Board and effective from 1 January 2009 have had no impact 
on the accounts of the Company.
Fixed asset investments
Investments are held at cost less impairment. 
Use of estimates and assumptions
The preparation of these fi nancial statements requires 
management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities at the date of 
the fi nancial statements and the reported amounts of revenue 
during the reporting period. Actual results could differ from 
these estimates. Information about such judgements and 
estimation is contained in individual accounting policies.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty that could cause an 
adjustment to be required to the carrying amount of asset 
or liabilities within the next accounting period are:
– review of carrying value of fi xed asset investments;
–  estimation of liabilities for pension and other post 
retirement costs;
– liabilities in relation to industrial disease claims; 
–  liabilities in relation to central provisions; and
– recoverability of deferred tax assets.
Compensation for industrial disease
Provision is made for compensation for industrial disease 
where it is possible to estimate the liability with suffi cient 
reliability. This is in respect of both claims lodged and 
outstanding at the period end and future potential claims. 
Where this is not possible, a contingent liability is noted. 
Benefi t is recognised for insurance recoveries for claims 
provided when they are anticipated with virtual certainty.
Provisions
Provisions for liabilities, except for those for industrial disease, 
are made where the timing or amount of settlement is 
uncertain. A provision is recognised when: the Company 
has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of 
past events; it is probable that an outfl ow of resources will be 
required to settle the obligation and the amount has been 
reliably estimated.
Deferred income taxation
Deferred taxation is recognised in respect of all timing 
differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance 
sheet date where transactions or events have occurred at that 
date that will result in an obligation to pay more, or a right to 
pay less, tax in the future. Resultant deferred tax assets are 
recognised only to the extent that it is considered more likely 
than not that there will be suitable taxable profi ts from which 
the underlying timing differences can be deducted, or where 
there are deferred tax liabilities against which the assets can be 
recovered. Deferred tax is measured on an undiscounted basis 
at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in 
which timing differences reverse, based on tax rates and laws 
enacted or substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
 
Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at the amount of the 
consideration received after deduction of issue costs. Issue 
costs together with fi nance costs are charged to the profi t 
and loss account over the term of the borrowings and 
represent a constant proportion of the balance of capital 
repayments outstanding.
Cumulative preference shares are classifi ed as liabilities. 
The dividends on these preference shares are recognised 
in the income statement as interest expense. 
Borrowings are classifi ed as current liabilities unless the 
Company has an unconditional right to defer settlement of 
the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date. 
Cash at bank and in hand
Cash at bank and in hand include cash in hand, deposits 
held on call with banks and other short-term highly liquid 
investments with original maturities of three months or less. 
Bank overdrafts are shown within borrowings in current 
liabilities on the balance sheet.
Share capital
Ordinary shares and deferred shares are classifi ed as equity. 
Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new 
shares or options are shown in equity as a deduction, net 
of tax, from the proceeds.
Accounting for derivative fi nancial instruments 
and hedging activities
The Company has adopted FRS 26 and has accounted 
for derivative fi nancial instruments consistent with the 
method adopted by the Group shown on page 56 of the 
fi nancial statements.
Parent Company 
Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements (UK GAAP) 90 Cape plc Annual Report 2009
Annual Report 2009
Share based payments
The Company issues equity settled share based payments to certain employees which must be measured at fair value and 
recognised as an expense in the profi t and loss account with a corresponding increase in equity. The fair values of these 
payments are measured at the dates of grant using option pricing models, taking into account the terms and conditions 
upon which the awards are granted. The fair value is recognised over the period during which employees become 
unconditionally entitled to the awards subject to the Company’s estimate of the number of awards which will lapse, either 
due to employees leaving the Group prior to vesting or due to non-market based performance conditions not being met.
Proceeds received on the exercise of share options are credited to share capital and share premium.
Pensions
The Group operates two major pension schemes in the UK, one is a defi ned benefi t scheme and the other is a defi ned 
contribution scheme. The assets of the plan are held separately from those of the Company in an independently 
administered fund.
(a) Defi ned benefi t plan
The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the scheme on a consistent and 
reasonable basis and therefore, as permitted by FRS 17, accounts for the plan as if it were a defi ned contribution plan. 
The consolidated fi nancial statements include full disclosures of the UK defi ned benefi t plan in accordance with IAS 19 
which is similar to FRS 17 (note 16 to the Group fi nancial statements).
(b) Defi ned contribution plan
Payments to the defi ned contribution plan are charged as an expense as they fall due.
 
2. Loss of the Company
The retained loss for the fi nancial year attributable to the Company was £10.0 million (2008: £24.0 million).
Auditor remuneration is disclosed in note 9 to the Group fi nancial statements.

The provision for industrial disease represents the expected costs of claims. It is anticipated that most of these claims will be paid 
within the next two years. The charge to profi t for the compensation for industrial disease in the year net of insurance recoveries 
is £2.6 million (2008: £3.3 million). The provision charge is recognised within net operating expenses. Insurance recoveries of 
£1.3 million (2008: £0.7 million) are receivable against certain of these claims and are included in other debtors in the Parent 
Company balance sheet. The full disclosure regarding the provision in respect of notifi ed and future claims can be found in 
notes 26 and 33(i) to the Group fi nancial statements.

13. Contingencies
(a) Full disclosure in respect of the Group’s contingent liability for industrial disease claims is detailed in note 33 to the Group 
fi nancial statements. The liability for potential future claims has been fully borne by other Scheme Companies and as such there is 
no longer a contingent liability in respect of the Parent Company. Accordingly, the Emphasis of Matter paragraph with regards to 
the fundamental uncertainty of future IDC liabilities is not required in respect of the 2009 Parent Company fi nancial statements.
(b) The Company was the defendant in proceedings brought by some 7,500 South African residents who claimed that they 
suffered injury as the result of mining activities in South Africa undertaken by former subsidiaries of Cape plc. The Company 
entered into an agreement on 13 March 2003 with the claimants in the group action and new claimants who had come forward 
in 2002.
It is possible that claims could arise in the future from claimants who were not included in the group action, or who claim they have 
developed an asbestos-related disease since the date of the settlement and as a result of the Group’s former mining activities in 
South Africa. There is a signifi cant uncertainty as to whether such future claims will be made and as to the number, nature, timing 
and validity of such claims. However, no such claims have been received to date.
(c) The Company continues to be named, along with several asbestos fi bre and asbestos product suppliers, as defendants in a 
number of legal actions in North America. The plaintiffs in such actions are claiming substantial damages as a result of the use 
of these products. The Company has received legal advice in the UK that default judgments obtained in North America against 
Companies within the Group which are not present in North America, would not be enforceable in the UK. Consequently the 
Directors believe that the above-mentioned matters are unlikely to have a material effect on the Company’s fi nancial position.
(d) The Company has contingent liabilities in respect of guarantees and bonds entered into in the normal course of business, 
in respect of which no loss is expected. 94 Cape plc Annual Report 2009

Adjusted operating profi t margin
Defi ned as Group operating profi t before other items expressed as a percentage of revenue. The continued improvement in the 
margin over the last fi ve years represents the change in operations, including the exit from the manufacturing activities and 
increased international operations.
Return on managed assets
Defi ned as Group operating profi t before other items expressed as a percentage of managed assets**. The 2009 return is 
indicative of the signifi cant investment in the business over the last 3 years.
Operating cash conversion 
This is defi ned as cash generated from operating activities divided by adjusted EBITDA (see note 30 to the Group fi nancial 
statements). The conversion rate in 2009 demonstrates the effectiveness of the Group in turning profi t into cash.
Lost Time Incidents (LTI)
Number of incidents per 100,000 man hours worked. Cape considers safety as a key part of the Group strategy and the 
improvement in the safety record demonstrates the achievements in this area. 
* Cash conversion has only been considered as a KPI since 2008 (with 2007 comparative disclosed).
** Managed assets are property, plant and equipment, inventories, trade and other receivables and trade and other payables.

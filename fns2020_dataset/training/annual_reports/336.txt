Chairman’s Statement
Focused for future growth
Introduction
2012 was an important year for the Group 
following the acquisition of RESORBA® in late 
December 201 1. Group revenues and proﬁts both 
saw strong growth as a result, not just from the 
new business we acquired but also from many of 
our existing operations which continued the 
excellent progress of the last few years. 
As we indicated at the interims, we have been 
reviewing the organisational structure of the 
Group to ensure that the business is best 
positioned to deliver growth following the 
acquisition. As a result of this review, we have 
now moved from reporting under two business 
units, Advanced Woundcare and Wound 
Closure, to four business units: Branded Direct, 
Branded Distributed, OEM and Bulk Materials, 
and will be reporting our results under these 
business segments. 
Financial Highlights
Reported Group revenue was up 53% to £52.6 
million (2011: £34.4 million) at constant currency. 
On a like-for-like, constant currency basis, 
excluding the contribution from RESORBA®, 
revenue grew 3% to £35.3 million  
(2011: £34.6 million).
The Group’s adjusted operating margin 
increased by 520 basis points (‘bps’) to 24.3% 
(2011: 19.1%), mainly due to the change in mix 
of business towards more of our own brands, 
including the contribution from the sutures and 
collagen products resulting from the RESORBA® 
acquisition. After net ﬁnance costs of £0.7 million 
(2011: £NIL), adjusted proﬁt before tax increased 
by 85% to £12.1 million (2011: £6.6 million). 
Adjusted fully diluted earnings per share¹ 
increased by 24% to 5.30p (2011: 4.28p).
Strong cash ﬂow has reduced the Group’s net 
debt at 31 December 2012 to £5.5 million, which 
compares to £13.4 million at the end of 2011 
following the RESORBA® acquisition. In this 
regard, we have been able to repay additional 
amounts of £2 million and €2 million of the 
original €25 million RESORBA® related term loan 
ahead of schedule.
Key Business Achievements
We have now completed our restructuring 
of the Group so that we are appropriately 
organised to deliver the commercial 
opportunities resulting from our acquisition 
of RESORBA®. The details of this are included 
in the Chief Executive’s Review.
Within our Branded Direct business, ActivHeal® 
continues to perform well and achieved a 29% 
increase in revenues, while LiquiBand® in the UK 
grew by 5% with some initial success being seen 
from our new Operating Room (OR) sales force. 
The largest part of this unit, however, comprises 
the direct sales of RESORBA®‘s sutures, collagen 
and dental products into the German domestic 
market, which grew by 5% compared with 2011.
Sales of LiquiBand® into the US are included in 
our Branded Distributed business, and 2012 saw 
a mixed performance with continued gains in 
the non-hospital or alternative site market partly 
oﬀset by a disappointing end to the year in the 
hospital market due to a key partner not meeting 
its contractual minima. However, we have now 
reassessed our market approach and our various 
partners’ capabilities, and we are pleased to 
advise that we will be positioning a new 
LiquiBand® product with a new partner in the US, 
with a launch expected in H2 2013. Elsewhere, 
the distributor business that we acquired with 
RESORBA® grew by a satisfactory 12%.

Dr. Don Evans
Chairman
Within our OEM business, it was pleasing to see 
the 22% growth from our silver alginate business 
in 2012, well ahead of market growth rates. The 
previous destocking eﬀect we saw with one of 
our partners is now well behind us. 
As we had previously ﬂagged, our Bulk Materials 
business declined 43% compared with the prior 
year due to pipeline ﬁlling by partners in 2011. 
This business is expected to return to growth 
in 2013.
Dividend
We are proposing a ﬁnal dividend of 0.35p per 
share, making a total dividend for the year of 
0.52p per share, a 16% increase on 2011. If 
approved at the Annual General Meeting on 
22 May 2013, this will be paid on 28 May 2013 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of 
business on 3 May 2013.
Board
With the opportunities available to the Group 
we have decided to strengthen the Board and 
we will be adding a further Non-Executive 
Director with commercial experience during  
this year. 
I also intend to step down as Chairman later 
this year after a successor has been found. In my 
16 years with AMS I have seen the complete 
transformation of the Group, and I know that I 
will be leaving a business in excellent shape for 
future growth. I would like to thank the Board, 
my colleagues and all our employees for helping 
to build this great Company and to wish them all 
continued success. 
Employees
On behalf of the Board, I would also like to thank 
all Group employees for all their hard work over 
the past year in ensuring the successful 
integration of RESORBA® into the Group as part 
of the continued development of AMS as a 
leading global medical technology business. 
Outlook
We continue to be excited by the opportunities 
for LiquiBand® in the US and the beneﬁts that 
our acquisition of RESORBA® will bring. These, 
together with the continued growth of 
ActivHeal® and silver alginate, as well as new 
product developments such as anti-microbial 
dressings and our hernia mesh device, give us 
conﬁdence that the Group is well positioned 
for the future.
With our business more focused to deliver 
growth across the Group, we remain positive 
for the prospects of the Group.

Chief Executive’s Statement
Chris Meredith
Chief Executive Oﬃcer
I am pleased to report that much of the progress 
highlighted at the interims continued through 
the second half of 2012, and AMS has delivered 
another strong year of growth. In particular, 
ActivHeal®, silver alginate and our converted 
foam portfolios all showed solid year-on-year 
progress and we are also pleased that the now 
completed integration of RESORBA® went to 
plan.
Business Restructure
With AMS now having multiple product 
portfolios, six manufacturing sites in four 
countries, several routes to market, and a 
number of diﬀerent growth opportunities to 
pursue, the Group has been restructured to 
ensure the business continues to operate 
eﬃciently whilst retaining critical focus on each 
of our growth drivers. This has resulted in the 
reorganisation of the Group into four discrete 
business units - Branded Direct, Branded 
Distributed, OEM and Bulk Materials - each 
responsible for two key value streams, namely a 
focused route-to-market and a core part of our 
R&D programme.
Each of the four business units will consist of a 
mix of sales, marketing, business development 
and R&D teams, led by individual business unit 
Directors, all of whom are appointed and in place. 
Linked to the above changes, our operational 
sites will focus on manufacturing their specialised 
products for any unit, with the focus being on 
sustained improvements in quality, eﬃciency, 
cost and service. Each operational site has a Site 
Manager who reports into our Group Operations 
Director. To complete the senior management 
team, a Group Quality and Regulatory Director 
will be starting in May 2013 to ensure that a 
consistent strategy and policy is adhered to 
throughout the Group, and a Site Manager for 
Germany has joined in March 2013.
I am pleased to report that the completion of 
the reorganisation marks the ﬁnal stage of the 
integration of the RESORBA® business and we 
now have the focused organisational structure 
to deliver on the numerous opportunities across 
the Group. 
OEM 
With revenue in 2012 of £22.0 million (2011: £18.5 
million), our Original Equipment Manufacture 
(‘OEM’) business unit is the largest in the Group 
and has responsibility for driving our OEM 
contract manufacturing sales through 
business-to-business partners, as well as the 
R&D value stream associated with advanced 
woundcare dressings. Within this unit, 
accounting for nearly 50% of its revenue in 2012, 
are our silver alginate technologies which 
delivered 22% growth compared to 2011. After 
the destocking eﬀect we previously saw with 
one of our major partners in 2011, it was pleasing 
to see our sales of silver alginate products grow 
by 26% in the UK and Europe and by 17% in the 
US. Silver alginate continues to be a key growth 
driver of this business unit. The rest of this 
business unit consists of alginate and foam-
based ﬁnished dressings for our partners, 
together with the collagen OEM business 
acquired with RESORBA®.
R&D is working on a range of new anti-microbial 
dressings with launches scheduled during 2013.
Branded Direct 
Our Branded Direct business unit is the next 
largest with 2012 revenue of £20.1 million (2011: 
£5.7 million) and has responsibility for driving 
our own brand sales direct to end users in 
Germany, the UK and the Czech Republic, 
together with our suture and collagen R&D 
value stream as most sales based on these 
technologies are included in this unit. Other key 
growth drivers in this division are ActivHeal® 
sales to the NHS, up 29% in 2012, LiquiBand® 
sales into direct territories, up 5% in the UK and 
up 15% in Germany, and RESORBA® branded 
sutures and collagen dressings which grew by 
5% in 2012 to £12.3 million.

Branded Distributed 
Our Branded Distributed business unit reported 
2012 revenue of £6.8 million (2011: £3.6 million) 
and has signiﬁcant potential for growth given it 
has responsibility for driving our own brand 
sales through our third party network of global 
distribution partners, as well as managing our 
adhesives and sealants R&D value stream. This 
unit’s key growth drivers are LiquiBand® and 
sealants into the US which accounted for 29% of 
this unit’s total 2012 revenue (including sales to 
Russia), up by 10% over 2011.
Our progress into the US market with LiquiBand® 
was mixed in 2012. Latest data shows that we 
now have 13% of the alternative site market, a 
strong improvement from the 10% we had at 
the end of June 2012. We are pleased with this 
progress which is well in line with the targets 
that we set on launch two years ago. Our 
progress in the acute care or hospital sector has, 
however, been disappointing with our market 
share slipping back to 4% from the 6% we had at 
the half year. In this regard, LiquiBand® received 
less focus than we expected from one of our 
key partners in the second half of the year and 
this resulted in the partner not meeting their 
contractual minima in 2012. This has however 
given us an opportunity to reassess and refocus 
our US growth strategy for LiquiBand®, as outlined 
elsewhere in this report, and we remain positive 
about LiquiBand®’s overall prospects in the US. 
This business unit also includes sales of 
RESORBA® products into Russia, along with 
RESORBA® and LiquiBand® products into new 
geographies through distributors, together 
with any ‘co-branded’ initiatives we choose to 
progress in order to get any of our technologies 
successfully established into new markets.
Bulk Materials 
Our ﬁnal business unit handles our bulk 
materials, mainly roll-stock foam, through 
third-party partners who have their own 
converting and packaging capabilities. It also 
manufactures foam for AMS’s own operational 
requirements. Revenue in 2012 was lower at £3.8 
million (2011: £6.6 million) due to the previously 
ﬂagged pipeline ﬁlling from customer product 
launches that took place in 2011. Foam rollstock 
is the key growth driver in this unit, with 2012 
revenue of £3.6 million (2011: £6.4 million), 86% 
of the total. We anticipate that revenue growth 
will resume in 2013.
Prospects for 2013
I believe we have signiﬁcant growth 
opportunities across all four of our new business 
units. Our strategic focus remains unchanged on 
our goal of establishing a leading global position 
in the woundcare, wound closure and sealants 
arenas, and the work done in 2012 ensures we 
have an organisation ﬁt for purpose, with the 
RESORBA® business fully integrated.
Our silver alginate partners continue to make 
gains in the anti-microbial market segment, and 
planned product upgrades in 2013 will help 
strengthen our proposition in this area. 
Our ActivHeal® success is expected to continue 
to build and deliver another year of solid double 
digit growth as we convert more hospitals and 
improve compliance in existing Trusts.
Our trial investment in a direct UK OR sales team is 
starting to deliver results with some notable recent 
LiquiBand® gains. This team will be strengthened 
further in 2013 and has also been trained on the 
RESORBA® products. With the tender awards that 
were granted in Q4 2012, we are well placed to 
grow our UK direct business in 2013.
The failure of a key US LiquiBand® partner to 
meet their contractual commitments in 2012 has 
allowed us to re-think our growth strategy in the 
US. Our alternate site partner has demonstrated 
what can be achieved with our formulations and 
designs. We have carved out individual areas of 
focus for our existing partners and will allow 
these to progress in 2013. Over and above these, 
we are seeking approval for a new formulation 
and plan to launch this by July 2013 with an 
additional new partner, giving them their own 
unique position and product and thereby 
further strengthening our ability to capture 
market share in the US tissue adhesive space.
Regulatory approvals are progressing for 
LiquiBand® in Russia and China, and we have a 
strategy that could see us introducing RESORBA® 
sutures into the US market for the ﬁrst time, by 
the end of 2013.
On the new product front, we are still on track to 
gain approval for our Hernia Mesh Fixation 
device before the end of 2013 and will launch 
this initially through our own teams in the UK 
and Germany.
We are conﬁdent 2013 will be another strong 
year for the Group.

Business Review Company Overview
Financial Review
Reported revenue increased by 53% to £52.6 
million (2011: £34.4 million). At constant currency 
(that is re-translating the current period’s 
performance at the previous period’s exchange 
rates), revenue growth would have been 57%. 
The Group had £0.8 million of exceptional items 
in 2012 (2011: £1.8 million) relating to integration 
and restructuring costs associated with the 
acquisition of the RESORBA® business. 
Amortisation of acquired intangible assets  
was £0.5 million (2011: £0.2 million). 
Comparisons with 2011 are made on a 
pre-exceptional, pre-amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets cost basis as we believe that 
this provides a more relevant representation  
of the Group’s trading performance. To aid 
comparison, the Group’s adjusted income 
statement is summarised in Table 1 below.

¹  Administration expenses exclude exceptional items and amortisation of acquired intangible assets
²  See Note 15 Earnings per share for details of calculation
Across the Group, gross margins increased by 
730 bps to 54.5% (2011: 47.2%), reﬂecting the 
higher margins resulting from a direct, branded 
business.
Administration expenses¹ increased by 64% to 
£15.6 million (2011: £9.5 million) with increased 
costs resulting from the direct sales teams in 
Germany, the Czech Republic and Russia.
Total spend on R&D, both expensed and 
capitalised, was £2.8 million (2011: £1.5 million), 
however £0.8 million (2011: £0.3 million) was 
capitalised reﬂecting the progress of a number 
of projects. 
Adjusted operating proﬁt increased by 95% to 
£12.8 million (2011: £6.6 million) and the adjusted 
operating margin increased by 520 bps to 24.3% 
(2011: 19.1%).
Proﬁt before tax for the period was 135% higher 
at £10.8 million (2011: £4.6 million). 
The Group’s eﬀective rate of tax for the year was 
10.3%. This is reﬂective of the utilisation of 
previously unrecognised brought forward tax 
losses in the UK and R&D relief. It also reﬂects the 
impact of blending proﬁts and losses from 
diﬀerent countries and the diﬀerent tax rates 
associated with these countries. The eﬀective 
tax rate is lower than that reported at the half 
year due to the change in mix of sales in the 
second half of the year with LiquiBand® sales 
being lower than expected. 
A reconciliation between the standard rate of 
taxation in the UK and the eﬀective rate is 
summarised in Table 2. Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 12

Eﬀective taxation rate 10.3
Earnings (excluding exceptional items and amortisation of acquired 
intangible assets) increased by 61% to £11.0 million (2011: £6.8 million), 
resulting in a 24% increase in adjusted basic earnings per share to 5.40p 
(2011: 4.36p) and a 24% increase in fully diluted adjusted earnings per share 
to 5.30p (2011: 4.28p). 
Proﬁt after tax (after exceptional items and amortisation) increased by 
100% to £9.7 million (2011: £4.9 million), resulting in a 53% increase in basic 
earnings per share to 4.75p (2011: 3.10p) and a 53% increase in fully diluted 
earnings per share to 4.66p (2011: 3.04p).
The Board is proposing a ﬁnal dividend of 0.35p per share, to be paid on  
28 May 2013 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on  
3 May 2013. This follows the interim dividend of 0.17p per share that was 
paid on 2 November 2012 and would make a total dividend for the year of 
0.52p per share (2011: 0.45p), a 16% increase on 2011.
The Group generated net cash from operating activities before exceptional 
items of £13.4 million (2011: £6.7 million) (see Table 5) and had net debt of 
£5.5 million (2011: £13.4 million) at the end of the year.
OEM 
This business unit’s revenues grew by 18% to £22.0 million (2011: £18.5 
million), partly as a result of the £0.8 million collagen partner business 
acquired with RESORBA® and partly from the 22% growth of the silver 
alginate business.
The operating margin of this segment increased to 24% (2011: 19%) due to 
the contribution from both silver alginate and from collagen sales.
Branded Direct
Revenues in this business unit increased by 255% to £20.1 million  
(201 1: £5.7 million), largely due to sales into the German and Czech domestic 
markets of £12.3 million (201 1: £NIL) resulting from the RESORBA® acquisition. 
Also in this unit, ActivHeal® sales into the NHS continued to perform well, 
up by 29% compared to 2011, while LiquiBand® sales into the UK and 
Germany grew by 5% and 15% respectively, the latter resulting from the 
increased focus of the German sales team.
The operating margin from this segment was 30% (2011: 20%) reﬂecting 
the contribution of the higher margin suture business in Germany and the 
growth of the underlying ActivHeal® and LiquiBand® businesses in the UK.
Branded Distributed 
This business unit’s revenues grew by 89% to £6.8 million (201 1: £3.6 million), 
with sales resulting from the RESORBA® acquisition contributing £3.9 million to 
this growth, including £1.6 million from our Russian subsidiary. LiquiBand® and 
sealants in the US grew by 10% despite one of our LiquiBand® distributors 
failing to meet its contractual minima for the year. Elsewhere, sales of 
LiquiBand® in Europe (excluding the UK and Germany) increased by 13% but 
small sales in early stage ROW markets such as Canada and Japan did not 
increase as further clinical data is needed locally to develop these new 
markets. This data is now being prepared. 
The operating margin for this segment declined to 17% (2011: 24%) as the 
indirect business acquired from RESORBA® attracts a lower margin than the 
existing LiquiBand® business.
Bulk Materials 
Revenue from this business unit declined by 43% to £3.8 million (2011: £6.6 
million) due to the previously ﬂagged pipeline eﬀect of product launches 
that occurred in 2011. 
The operating margin of this segment declined to 8% (2011: 21%) reﬂecting 
the sensitivity of this business segment to the reduced sales and 
production volumes.

only around 36% of sales are denominated in Euros. Approximately 75% 
of all sales to the US are denominated in US Dollars.

The Group had an operating cash ﬂow before exceptional items of  
£13.4 million (2011: £6.7 million) and a conversion of adjusted operating 
proﬁt into free cash ﬂow of 66% (2011: 36%).
Exceptional items are the £0.8 million of integration and restructuring 
costs associated with the acquisition of the RESORBA® business. In 2011, 
£1.8 million of exceptional costs were associated with the acquisition of 
RESORBA®.
Working capital decreased by £1.6 million in the period. Inventory 
decreased by £0.3 million to £6.5 million or 3.2 months of supply (2011: 2.3 
months of supply excluding inventory acquired through the acquisition). 
Inventory is now higher in the Group due to levels of inventory acquired 
with RESORBA®. Trade receivables decreased by £0.9 million with debtor 
days at 43 (2011: 61 excluding debtors acquired with the acquisition), 
helped by collection in Germany averaging less than 30 days. Trade 
payables have reduced by £2.7 million since the end of 2011 when 
expenses associated with the acquisition were still outstanding. 
We invested £2.8 million in capital equipment and software in the year 
(2011: £2.5 million). The major areas of spend have been in upgrading 
equipment and business information systems.
Finance costs of £0.7 million have been paid on our €25 million term  
loan facility and the availability of the £8 million revolving credit facility 
with HSBC. 
Taxation of £0.7 million is a payment on account made against the 
liabilities of the German subsidiaries.
The Group paid its ﬁnal dividend for the year ended 31 December 2011 of 
£0.6 million (2010: £0.6 million) on 15 June 2012, and its interim dividend for 
the six months ended 30 June 2012 of £0.3 million (2011: £0.2 million) on  
2 November 2012.
The Group generated a free cash ﬂow of £8.5 million in the period  
(2011: £2.4 million). 
In December 2011, the Group entered into a €25 million amortising term 
loan facility with HSBC, with a ﬁnal maturity of 31 July 2015. This facility 
carries an annual interest rate of EURIBOR plus a margin of 1.5% to 2.5% 
depending on the Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio. On 22 June 2012 the 
Group repaid €2 million of this facility ahead of the agreed schedule, 
leaving €23 million drawn down as at 30 June 2012. 
On 13 July 2012, the Group converted half of the then outstanding  
€23 million term loan into Sterling. The resulting £9.4 million facility carries 
an annual interest rate of LIBOR plus a margin of 1.5% to 2.5% depending 
on the Group’s net debt to EBITDA ratio. With cash being generated in 
both Sterling and Euros, this restructuring of the Group’s debt better aligns 
the cash ﬂows generated with the repayment of the term loan.
On 20 December 2012, a further payment of £2.0 million was made ahead 
of schedule together with the €1.2 million and £1 million scheduled 
payments that were required to be paid. At 31 December 2012, £6.3 million 
and €10.3 million of the respective Sterling and Euro term loan facilities 
were outstanding. 
In December 2011, the Group also entered into a £8 million revolving credit 
facility with HSBC with a ﬁnal maturity of 31 July 2015. This facility is for 
general working capital purposes, and carries an annual interest rate of 
LIBOR plus a margin of 1.5% to 2.5% depending on the Group’s net debt  
to EBITDA ratio. This facility was undrawn as at 31 December 2012.
At the end of the period, the Group had net debt¹ of £5.5 million (2011: 
£13.4 million), a reduction of £7.9 million since 31 December 2011. The 
movement in net debt during 2012 is reconciled in Table 6 below:

The Group’s going concern position is fully described in note 2 and the 
Group remains comfortably within its lending covenants.

Directors’ Report
For the year ended 31 December 2012
The directors present their report, incorporating the Chairman’s 
Statement, Chief Executive’s Statement and the Financial Review, and 
the audited ﬁnancial statements for the year ended 31 December 2012.
Principal activities, trading review and future developments
The Group is primarily involved in the design, development, 
manufacture and distribution of novel high performance polymers, 
both natural and synthetic, for use in advanced woundcare dressings 
and of medical adhesives for closing and sealing tissue. The 
acquisition of RESORBA® in December 2011 has provided the Group 
with further technical capabilities in collagen and in sutures. Collagen 
is used both as a haemostat and as a scaﬀold for tissue regeneration. 
Sutures are used to close wounds both internally and topically. The 
Group distributes its products to the global medical device market by 
selling to healthcare companies and distributors and selling directly 
into the hospital and dental markets in Germany, the Czech Republic, 
Russia and to the NHS in the UK.
Business Units
Following the acquisition of RESORBA® in December 2011, the Group 
has been restructured into four business units during 2012. The 
purpose of this is to focus resources to deliver growth opportunities 
across all four strategic routes to market. 
The new structure provides clarity on accountability and 
responsibility, empower clear lines for decision making, improve 
prioritisation on key projects and focus operations on quality and 
cost-eﬃcient manufacturing and supply. There are harmonised 
policies, processes and procedures across the Group and Group 
functions are utilised where appropriate. It is believed that the new 
business structure will support the growth of the Group in the most 
eﬀective way. The business units are outlined in further detail on 
pages 2 to 5.
Principal risks and uncertainties
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc is a business that depends on 
revenues through its sales to business partners and distributors and its 
direct sales to healthcare providers in the UK, Germany, the Czech 
Republic and Russia, together with a pipeline of new products through 
its research and development programme to build future revenues and 
a manufacturing capability to produce the products it sells. 
The directors have set out below the principal risks facing the business. 
In addition to the risk factors discussed below, further information 
about the business, its strategy, products and markets and its ﬁnancial 
risks is contained in the Business Review on pages 8 to 13.
Global economic conditions
The Group has a widespread geographical market sector and 
customer base which helps to minimise the impact of any single 
event in one region or with one customer. 
That said, the general economic climate is one where a number of 
governments, particularly in Europe, are looking to reduce spend  
on public services including spend on healthcare or, as in the US, 
governments are looking to raise taxes from medical device 
companies on the supply of medical devices, ultimately 
increasing costs. 
In general, however, with an ageing population increasingly suﬀering 
from health problems such as obesity and diabetes, the incidence  
of chronic wounds which are treated with advanced woundcare 
dressings is increasing and the demographics are beneﬁcial for 
the Group.
Revenue streams and consolidation in the sector
The Group enters contractual relationships with its business partners 
wherever possible; however, there can be no guarantee that sales will 
be maintained or increased in future years. The healthcare sector 
continues to undergo consolidation. This presents both opportunities 
and risks. Consolidation could result in the loss of a partner to a 
competing business which could have an adverse eﬀect on the results 
of the Group.
Reliance on key customers
The Group maintains close partnerships with a number of companies 
but aims not to have more than 20% of its revenues from any one 
partner. In 2012, no one partner contributed more than 10% of 
revenues. The loss of a key partner would impact the business in the 
short term, although as the Group increases in size, the signiﬁcance of 
this for the Group overall, is reduced. The Group supports its partners 
and distributors with marketing assistance and with clinical trial 
programmes where possible to drive awareness of its products. There 
is a risk that if partners and distributors do not support the products 
or decide to change the focus of their priorities that opportunities are 
lost, resulting in revenue shortfall.
Pricing pressures and commoditisation of products
There are also risks from pricing pressure and from competition from 
other products, particularly when the economic climate is diﬃcult. 
The Group seeks to provide diﬀerentiated products that are patented 
wherever possible to reduce the eﬀects of competition.
Risk associated with organisational structure and employee 
retention
The Board reviewed the organisation of the Group in 2012 and 
implemented a new organisational structure with four clearly deﬁned 
business units positioning the Group to deliver future growth as 
outlined on pages 2 to 5. It is recognised that implementation of a 
new organisational structure carries inherent risk. Management are 
working closely with staﬀ with regular and open lines of 
communication to mitigate this risk.
The Group recognises that succession planning is key to the future 
of the business and that if this is not addressed, presents a risk to 
the Group. Succession plans are reviewed by the Nomination 
Committee with actions taken to address any gaps identiﬁed.
Acquisitions
In making any acquisition there is some risk that the business acquired 
does not deliver the opportunities anticipated or that unanticipated 
problems arise. To mitigate this risk, detailed due diligence is 
undertaken to understand the business prior to it being acquired,  
and a detailed integration programme is implemented to deliver the 
opportunities anticipated. 
New products
The Group continues to invest in research and development to 
develop its next generation of products. By its nature, not all 
research leads to successful new products, although the Group 
believes that by monitoring progress against key milestones, it 
avoids excessive expenditure on projects that will not deliver a 
viable product. There is also the risk that the Group will not identify 
a new technology or opportunity before its competition and 
therefore miss an opportunity to gain competitive advantage. The 
business units will help to focus the Group to better understand 
market dynamics and to develop closer working relationships with 
key customers to reduce the risk of missed opportunities and ensure 
products meet customer requirements. Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 18
Raw materials and cost pressures
The Group is exposed to the risk that margins would be eroded if 
price increases occur in raw materials, and the price increases could 
not be passed on to the business partner or customer. Wherever 
possible the Group tries to maintain more than one source of the 
supply of key materials. Where materials can only be sourced from a 
sole supplier or are linked to commodity prices the Group includes 
pricing mechanism clauses in its contracts wherever possible. If a sole 
supplier stopped supplying a key material at short notice, it could 
result in an interruption of supply of goods until a suitable solution 
could be found.
Product liability claims
As a manufacturer, the Group is exposed to potential product liability 
claims but has in place insurance cover to mitigate this risk. The 
Group’s products are subject to medical device regulatory approval 
and certiﬁcation before launch. The Group’s manufacturing facilities 
are in compliance with ISO 13485, the latest international quality 
assurance standard for medical devices and receives regular 
inspection by regulatory authorities.
Business information systems
As the Group continues to grow, there is a risk that the Group 
outgrows its information systems. The Group has reviewed its 
information systems and is implementing new systems where 
required across the business. The Group recognises that there are 
risks in implementing new information systems which need to be 
managed but to not upgrade systems presents a greater risk in the 
longer term.
Financial risk
The Group is subject to various ﬁnancial risks including the following:
 Currency. The Group’s main currency exposures are to the US 
dollar and the Euro, with 14% of the Group’s sales in US dollars and 
36% of its sales in Euros. The Group’s policy is to hedge signiﬁcant 
transaction exposure by using forward contracts and options. 
In 2012, if the average US dollar rate had depreciated against 
the actual sterling rate by 10%, there would have been a £0.7m 
(2011: £0.7m) impact on revenue and the gross margin and proﬁt 
would have been reduced by 60bps (2011: 110bps). In 2012, if the 
average Euro rate had depreciated against the actual sterling rate 
by 10%, there would have been a £2.0m (2011: £0.7m) impact on 
revenue and the gross margin and proﬁt would have been 
reduced by 70bps (2011: NIL).
 Credit. The Group assesses the risk of contracting with each 
customer and sets credit limits which are carefully monitored. 
If a signiﬁcant risk is identiﬁed credit facilities are withdrawn and 
transactions are carried out on a cash basis. However, if a key 
partner was signiﬁcantly aﬀected by a diﬃcult trading 
environment, this would have a short-term impact on the Group. 
 Price. Supplier costs, discounts and rebates are monitored and 
checked in line with budgets and documentary evidence. 
Wherever possible contracts are in place with key suppliers which 
deﬁne prices and terms. The Group estimates that if material prices 
had increased by a further 5% in 2012 and the Group was unable to 
pass the increases on, there would have been a negative impact of 
£0.6m (2011: £0.4m) to the cost and the gross margin would have 
reduced by 100bps (2011: 110bps). 
 Interest rate risk. The Group is subject to interest rate risk on its 
Term Loan and its Revolving Credit Facility if drawn. The Group’s 
policy is to review terms on a regular basis and if appropriate, 
convert a portion of its ﬂoating rate debt into ﬁxed rate using 
interest rate swaps. Due to the debt proﬁle of the Group and 
current forecasts on interest rates, all of the Group’s debt was  
at a ﬂoating rate of interest at the end of the ﬁnancial year. 
Capital Structure
The Group raises appropriate levels of debt to fund acquisitions on 
signiﬁcant capital events, ensuring that it has adequate cash for 
working capital and short-term requirements.
The Group’s intention is to repay its term loan ahead of schedule in 
2013, and to raise further ﬁnance as necessary.
Key Performance Indicators
The directors have monitored the performance of the Group with 
particular reference to the relevant key performance indicators: 
revenue growth, operating margin, earnings per share growth, 
customer service (OTIF) and return on capital employed. The Group 
monitors progress on a regular basis and will update KPIs during 2013 
to reﬂect the new organisational structure.
Going concern
After making enquiries and on the basis outlined in the Corporate 
Governance Report on pages 25 to 27 , the directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in 
operational existence for the foreseeable future and for this reason they 
continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
Dividends
The Group made a proﬁt for the year to 31 December 2012 of 
£9.7 million (2011: £4.9 million). The directors are recommending 
payment of a ﬁnal dividend of 0.35p per share. The ﬁnal dividend 
will, subject to shareholders’ approval, be paid on 28 May 2013 to 
shareholders on the register at the close of business on 3 May 2013. 
This will make a total dividend of 0.52p for the full year (2011: 0.45p).
Research and Development
The Group has expensed to the income statement in the year ended 
31 December 2012 £1,996,000 (2011: £1,255,000) on research and 
development. In accordance with International Accounting Standards 
a further £802,000 (2011: £266,000) has been capitalised. Further 
details on the Group’s research and development activities are 
included in the outline of the business units on pages 2 to 5.
Creditors’ payment policy
The Group’s policy, for all suppliers, is to ﬁx terms of payment when 
agreeing the terms of each business transaction, to ensure the 
supplier is aware of those terms, and to abide by the agreed terms of 
payment provided that the supplier performs its obligations. Where 
terms have not been speciﬁcally agreed, it is the Group’s practice to 
settle invoices in line with local and industry requirements. The 
Group’s trade creditors at 31 December 2012 represented 
approximately 41 days of purchases (2011: 62 days).
Charitable and political contributions
The Group did not make any charitable or political contributions 
during the year (2011: £NIL).
Share capital and issue of ordinary shares
The authorised and issued share capital of the Company is set out in 
note 30 to the accounts on page 55.

Employees
The Group depends on the skills and commitment of its employees  
in order to achieve its objectives. Staﬀ at every level are encouraged 
to make the fullest possible contribution to the Group’s success. The 
Group is an equal opportunities employer. It is committed to giving 
fair and equal treatment to all employees and job applicants in  
terms of recruitment, pay conditions, promotions, training and all 
employment matters regardless of their race, sex, ethnic background 
or religious beliefs, sexual orientation or disabilities. An equal 
opportunities policy is in force which aims to ensure that all 
employees are selected, trained, compensated, promoted and 
transferred solely on the strength of their ability, skills, qualiﬁcations 
and merit. The Group also believes that all employees have a right  
to work in an environment free from discrimination and bullying.
The Group’s policy is to consult and discuss with employees, through 
meetings, both formal and informal, those matters likely to aﬀect 
employees’ interests. The Employees’ Consultative Committee in the 
UK, and the Workers Council, in Germany, which comprises 
representatives of employees and management, meet regularly to 
discuss business issues and areas of concern. Management 
communicates with staﬀ through regular team briefs.
The Group’s aim is to recruit and retain suﬃcient skilled and motivated 
employees to meet the needs of the business. The Group operates to 
the internationally recognised medical device standard ISO 13485. 
Staﬀ work within a deﬁned quality system and are trained in Lean 
Manufacturing Practices. Each line manager is responsible for 
implementing this approach. Employees are encouraged to become 
involved in the ﬁnancial performance of the Group through 
participation in the Group’s share option plans and are incentivised 
directly through the Company’s bonus scheme, performance reviews, 
and training and development opportunities.
It is the Group’s policy to give full and fair consideration to all 
applications for employment from disabled persons having regard to 
their particular aptitudes and abilities and to encourage the training 
and career development of all personnel employed by the Group, 
including disabled persons. Should an employee become disabled, 
the Group would, where practicable, seek to continue their 
employment and arrange appropriate training.
Employees’ share schemes
Employees, except for participants in the Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP), may be eligible after a period of service to be granted options 
over shares in the Company under the Company Share Option Plan or 
Executive Share Option Scheme. The Group received HMRC approval 
in 2009 to adopt a Company Share Option Plan (CSOP). Under the 
CSOP , employees are allowed to receive up to £30,000 of options in a 
tax-eﬃcient manner. Options granted under these schemes are not 
oﬀered at a discount. Further details are included in the Remuneration 
Report on pages 22 to 24.
The Company also operates a Deferred Share Bonus Scheme (DSB) 
in which employees are invited to participate. The DSB encourages 
employee share ownership which helps to align the employees’ 
interests with those of the shareholders. The details on the DSB 
Scheme are provided in the Remuneration Report on page 23.
The Company no longer satisﬁes the requirements for granting 
tax-eﬃcient options under its EMI scheme. Options already granted 
under this scheme will be allowed to vest in accordance with the  
rules of the scheme.
677,783 Ordinary Shares were issued during the year to employees 
exercising their share options. Details are given in note 33 to the 
Group ﬁnancial statements.
Health and Safety
The Group is committed to high standards in health, safety and 
environmental performance. It is the Group’s policy to abide by all 
laws, directives and regulations pertinent to its ﬁeld of operations and 
to act in a manner so as to minimise the eﬀects of its operations on 
the environment. The Group provides safe places and systems of 
work, safe plant and machinery, safe handling of materials and ensures 
appropriate information, instruction and training is given. Employees 
are encouraged to identify ‘near misses’ to ensure preventative actions 
are taken to avoid any unsafe work practices. Emphasis is placed on  
all employees having a responsibility to maintain a safe working 
environment. Health & Safety Committees at all sites assist with advice 
on safe working practices and ensure any corrective action is taken 
where necessary. Health and Safety reports are regularly received 
from Group sites and are reviewed by the Board. Regular audits are 
undertaken to evaluate compliance with Group policy.
Environment
Where possible, the Group aims to reduce its impact on the 
environment. The Group facility at Winsford has been built with a high 
level of thermal insulation to reduce the Group’s carbon footprint. It is 
also one of the ﬁrst in the country to utilise a solar wall: a renewable 
energy source that captures the sun’s warmth and supplements the 
building’s heating system. Lighting is controlled by movement sensors 
to avoid wastage and the heating system is fully programmable. Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 20

during or at the end of the year in any contract in any relation to the business of the Company or its subsidiaries.
Directors’ and oﬃcers’ liability insurance
Insurance cover is in force in respect of the personal liabilities which may be incurred by directors and oﬃcers of the Company in the course of 
their service with the Group.
Re-appointment
At the forthcoming Annual General Meeting, Don Evans, who was elected to Non-Executive Chairman on 1 January 2011, retires and will formally 
oﬀer himself for reappointment. As Don was not independent upon appointment he is proposed for re-election annually. Don intends to step 
down as Chairman later this year after a successor has been found and is being reappointed to ensure continuity and a smooth transition to the 
new Chairman. Mary Tavener and Penny Freer will retire by rotation and, being eligible, will be proposed for re-appointment. Details of the 
current directors of the Company are as shown on page 14.
Directors’ responsibilities statement
The directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the ﬁnancial statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations.
Company law requires the directors to prepare ﬁnancial statements for each ﬁnancial year. Under that law the directors are required to prepare 
the Group ﬁnancial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union and 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulation and have elected to prepare the parent company ﬁnancial statements in accordance with United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice (United Kingdom Accounting Standards and applicable law). Under company law the directors must not 
approve the accounts unless they are satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view of the state of aﬀairs of the Company and of the proﬁt or loss of 
the Company for that period.
In preparing the Parent Company ﬁnancial statements, the directors are required to:
 select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently; 
 make judgments and accounting estimates that are reasonable and prudent; and 
 prepare the ﬁnancial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Company will continue in business. 
In preparing the Group ﬁnancial statements, International Accounting Standard 1 requires that directors:
 properly select and apply accounting policies; 
 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information; 
 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the speciﬁc requirements in IFRSs are insuﬃcient to enable users to understand the 
impact of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s ﬁnancial position and ﬁnancial performance; and 
 make an assessment of the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern. 
The directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting records that are suﬃcient to show and explain the Company’s transactions and 
disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁnancial position of the Company and enable them to ensure that the ﬁnancial statements 
comply with the Companies Act 2006. They are also responsible for safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable 
steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and ﬁnancial information included on the Company’s 
website. Legislation in the United Kingdom governing the preparation and dissemination of ﬁnancial statements may diﬀer from legislation in 
other jurisdictions.

Responsibility statement
We conﬁrm that to the best of our knowledge:
 the ﬁnancial statements, prepared in accordance with the relevant 
ﬁnancial reporting framework, give a true and fair view of the 
assets, liabilities, ﬁnancial position and proﬁt or loss of the 
Company and the undertakings included in the consolidation 
taken as a whole; and 
 the management report, which is incorporated into the Directors’ 
Report, includes a fair review of the development and 
performance of the business and the position of the Company and 
the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, 
together with a description of the principal risks and uncertainties 
that they face. 
Auditor
Each of the persons who is a director at the date of approval of this 
Annual Report conﬁrms that:
 so far as the director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and 
 the director has taken all the steps that he/she ought to have taken 
as director in order to make himself/herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Company’s auditor is 
aware of that information. 
This conﬁrmation is given and should be interpreted in accordance 
with the provisions of S418 of the Companies Act 2006. 
Deloitte LLP has expressed their willingness to continue in oﬃce as 
auditor and a resolution to reappoint them will be proposed at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
Special business
The eﬀect of Resolution 8, to be proposed at the meeting would be to 
disapply the statutory pre-emption rights conferred by S570 of the 
Companies Act 2006.
The eﬀect of Resolution 9, to be proposed at the meeting would be to 
allow the Company to purchase its own shares conferred by S701 of 
the Companies Act 2006.
Annual General Meeting
The Annual General Meeting will be held at 11.00 am on 22 May 2013 
at the oﬃces of Investec Bank plc, 2 Gresham Street, London EC2V 
7QP . Details of the notice of the Annual General Meeting are given on

10 April 2013 Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 22
The Board presents the Remuneration Report for the year ended 
31 December 2012.
As an AIM quoted company, Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc  
is not required to comply with the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
Regulations 2002. The following disclosures are made voluntarily.
The members of the Remuneration Committee are all non-executive 
directors of the Group and have no personal ﬁnancial interest arising 
from cross-directorship and no day-to-day involvement in running the 
business. The Committee met four times during the year. All meetings 
were attended by all members.
The Board has accepted the Remuneration Committee’s 
recommendations in full.
The Remuneration Committee, on behalf of the Board and in 
consultation with the Chief Executive, determines the Group’s policy on 
executive remuneration, employment conditions and the individual 
remuneration packages of executive directors of all Group companies 
and management earning in excess of £100,000 per annum and 
administers the Share Option Schemes. It also determines the design  
of performance-related pay schemes, sets the targets for such schemes 
and approves payment under such schemes. The Terms of Reference of 
the Remuneration Committee are reviewed each year and are available 
for review on the Company’s website ‘www.admedsol.com’.
Remuneration policy
The remuneration policy is based on the need to oﬀer competitive 
packages to attract and retain senior executives of the highest calibre. 
Regular reviews of the policy are carried out, supported by independent 
advice, to ensure that the range and level of emoluments and incentive 
schemes continue to match current market practice. Kepler Associates 
were engaged in February 2012 to advise the Remuneration Committee 
with regard to the remuneration of the executives and senior 
management and the Remuneration Committee implemented  
changes taking into account their recommendations.
Salary
The Remuneration Committee reviews the salaries of the executive 
directors of all Group companies annually and salaries are measured 
against performance and market medians.
Annual performance bonus
Each of the directors is entitled under the terms of their service 
agreements to receive an annual bonus to be determined by the 
Remuneration Committee based on the Group’s ﬁnancial and operating 
performance and the achievement of speciﬁc targets which are set by 
the Remuneration Committee. In 2012, the targets set were against 
Group revenue, Group proﬁt before tax and earnings per share. 
Following the recommendations made by Kepler, each participant may 
receive up to 100% of his or her salary. 60% reward is dependent upon 
performance measured against targets resulting from the performance 
of the Group. 15% reward is achievable for meeting all personal 
objectives as long as the proﬁt threshold metric is achieved. 25% reward 
is achieved through share matching. Half of any bonus earned over the 
ﬁrst 20% is deferred as part of the Deferred Bonus Scheme. Senior 
management may earn up to 50% of their salary in bonus.
Share options
Employees, except for participants in the Long-Term Incentive Plan 
(LTIP), may be granted options over shares in the Company under the 
Company Share Option Plan and Executive Share Option Scheme, 
under which either approved or unapproved options may be granted. 
Options granted under these schemes are not oﬀered at a discount.
The exercising of options under these schemes is conditional on 
certain performance conditions which are pre-determined by the 
Remuneration Committee and which accord with the Joint Statement 
from the Investment Committees of the Association of British Insurers 
and the National Association of Pension Funds. Options are 
exercisable normally only after the third anniversary of the date of 
grant (or such later time as may be determined at the time of grant) 
and cannot in any event be exercised later than the tenth anniversary 
of the date of grant. Awards will not vest if the Group is not proﬁtable 
at the end of the performance period. Full details are included in 
note 33 on pages 57 to 60.
Company Share Option Plan (CSOP)
The Company received approval for a Company Share Option Plan 
(CSOP) on 2 June 2010. This was adopted after HMRC approval on 
13 August 2010. This Plan allows relevant employees to receive up to 
£30,000 of Company shares by reference to the market value of these 
shares on the grant date and to beneﬁt from the growth in value of 
those shares.
2009 Executive Share Option Scheme
Options granted under this scheme are not oﬀered at a discount. Up 
until 2010, the Company was able to oﬀer options under an Enterprise 
Management Incentive (EMI) Scheme. The Company no longer 
satisﬁes the requirements for operating this scheme, however, options 
already granted will be allowed to vest in accordance with the 
scheme rules.
Long-term incentives
The Company’s Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP) was introduced in 2005. 
Individuals who are entitled to awards under the LTIP are not eligible to 
receive options under the Company’s Share Option Plan or the 
Executive Share Option Scheme. The objectives of the LTIP are to align 
the interests of executives with those of shareholders by making a part 
of remuneration dependent on the success of management in 
delivering superior returns to shareholders. 50% of the Award is 
determined based on the performance of the Company compared with 
the AIM Healthcare Share Index over the vesting period and 50% of the 
Award is determined by the growth in the average earnings per share 
per year of the Company over the three year vesting period.
Of the 50% of the Award that is determined by reference to the AIM 
Healthcare Share Index, no shares will be awarded if the Company is 
ranked below the 50% level. If the Company is ranked in the upper 
quartile of the index i.e. at 75% or above, the full 50% of the Award 
shall become vested. If the Company is ranked between 50% and 75%, 
the provision of an Award which shall become vested shall be 
determined on a straight-line basis between 0% and 50%.
The other 50% of the Award will be vested if the Company achieves 
an average of 20% or more earnings per share (pre-exceptional items) 
growth per year over three years from the date of grant. The 
Committee has removed the annual underpin of 10% EPS growth 
being achieved in any one year with a discretionary underpin at the 
end of the performance period that requires the Committee to be 
satisﬁed that the recorded EPS performance is consistent with the 
underlying performance of the Company.
The proportion of the Award that shall become vested if the Company 
achieves an average earnings per share growth per year between 10% 
and 20% shall be on a straight-line basis between 0% and 50%.
Awards made have no performance re-testing facility.

Deferred Share Bonus Plan
The Company also has a Deferred Share Bonus Plan (the ‘DSB’) which is available to all employees. The DSB allows for the payment of any bonus 
to be made in the form of shares. It also allows for the provision of additional matching shares if the bonus shares are held for a set period. The 
DSB encourages employees to acquire shares in the Company and retain those shares to receive additional free shares from the Company. It acts 
as a valuable retention tool and aligns the employees’ interests with those of shareholders. The ﬁrst year that the DSB operated was in 2007.
Pension
All staﬀ are entitled to become members of the Group Pension and Life Assurance Scheme, which was set up with eﬀect from 1 February 1999. 
The Scheme entitles executive directors to contribute up to 10% of salary with the Group contributing 10%. All other employees contribute 3%  
of their salary which is matched by a 6% contribution from the Group. The Pension Plan is a money purchase scheme. In 2011, the Group made 
further arrangements allowing individuals to sacriﬁce their salary for pension contributions. The Group is preparing for the introduction of 
automatic enrolment.
Service agreements
The service agreements for Chris Meredith and Mary Tavener are terminable by either party giving not less than 12 months’ notice in writing.
Private healthcare
Executive directors and other senior employees are entitled to private healthcare and permanent health insurance.
Non-executive directors
The fees of the non-executive directors are determined by the executive directors. Non-executive directors receive travel expenses but do not 
participate in any incentive arrangements. The non-executive directors have entered into terms of appointment. The non-executive directors’ 
appointments are terminable by either party upon six months’ notice in writing without any right to compensation on early termination. 
Following his appointment as Non-Executive Chairman in January 2011, new terms of appointment were agreed with Don Evans. His 
appointment as Non-Executive Chairman was agreed for an initial term of one year. Thereafter, his appointment is terminable by either party 
upon six months’ notice in writing. Don Evans intends to step down as Chairman later this year after a successor has been found and will stand 
for re-election at the 2013 AGM to ensure continuity and a smooth transition to the new Chairman. As a result of his previous position as Chief 
Executive Oﬃcer, Don Evans held LTIPs with a vesting date of 23 April 2012. The Remuneration Committee recommended and the Board agreed 
that these LTIPs vested in the normal way, subject to the usual performance conditions. Don Evans is no longer eligible to receive LTIPs.
Don Evans also has bonuses earned in earlier years deferred as part of the Deferred Shares Bonus Scheme. The Remuneration Committee has 
recommended and the Board agreed that Don Evans should be allowed to leave his shares in the scheme for the normal retention time and not 
be required to withdraw them early from the scheme.

Corporate Governance Report 
UK Corporate Governance Code
The rules relating to AIM companies do not require the Company to 
report in accordance with the UK Corporate Governance Code 2010 
(“the Code”). However the Board is committed to the principles of 
good corporate governance and the directors have applied the Code 
in a manner which they consider appropriate for the size of the Group. 
The departures considered more signiﬁcant by the directors are 
mentioned below.
Board composition
The Board comprises the non-executive Chairman, the Chief 
Executive, the Group Finance Director and two non-executive 
directors as detailed on page 14. The non-executive directors, both 
of whom are considered by the Board to be independent, bring 
signiﬁcant experience of senior roles to their stewardship of the 
Group’s business. The Chairman fosters a climate of debate and 
challenge in the boardroom. This is built on his challenging but 
supportive relationship with the Chief Executive which sets the tone 
for Board interaction and discussions.
The Chairman, Don Evans, who was previously the Chief Executive 
Oﬃcer of the Group, is not considered to be an independent 
non-executive director.
The Board is aware that appointing the Chief Executive Oﬃcer to the 
role of Chairman does not comply with the independence criteria 
speciﬁed in A.3.1 of the Code. The remainder of the Board believes 
that Don Evans’s considerable experience in the sector and with the 
Group signiﬁcantly outweighs any disadvantages that his lack of 
independence could potentially bring. The opinions of major 
shareholders and advisors were sought in advance of this decision 
being taken. Don Evans was not involved in the Board decision 
surrounding his appointment.
All directors are required to stand for re-election at the ﬁrst Annual 
General Meeting following their appointment and, as a minimum,  
every three years thereafter. Don Evans intends to step down as 
Chairman later this year after a successor has been found and will stand 
for re-election at the 2013 AGM to ensure continuity and a smooth 
transition to the new Chairman. In addition, the Group intends to 
appoint a further Non-Executive Director with commercial experience 
to strengthen the Board. The recruitment has commenced.
Senior Independent Director
In 2010 Penny Freer was appointed as Senior Independent Director.
Board committees
The Board has delegated speciﬁc authority to the Remuneration 
Committee, Nomination Committee and the Audit Committee.
Don Evans, Penny Freer and Steve Bellamy are members of the 
Remuneration, Audit and Nomination Committee’s. Chris Meredith 
is a member of the Nomination Committee.
Most Board Committee meetings are scheduled around Board 
meetings. The Terms of Reference of all three Board Committees are 
given on our corporate website ‘www.admedsol.com’.
Role of the Board
The Board meets on a formal basis regularly, and met formally ten 
times in 2012. All of the directors attended all of the meetings. The 
Board’s practice is to hold several of its meetings each year at oﬃces 
other than the Group Head Oﬃce. The Board retains full and eﬀective 
control of the Group and has a schedule of matters speciﬁcally 
reserved for its approval. The Board is responsible for formulating the 
Group’s corporate strategy, approval of budgets, monitoring ﬁnancial 
performance, approval and review of major capital expenditure, 
corporate governance and risk management. Operational control is 
delegated to the executive directors and the Senior Management 
Team (SMT). 
All directors have access to the advice and services of the Company 
Secretary and can take independent professional advice, if necessary, 
at the Group’s expense. The non-executive directors are able to 
contact the executive directors at any time for further information.
Board and committee evaluation
The performance evaluation of the Board, its Committees and 
directors is undertaken by the Chairman annually and implemented 
in collaboration with the Committee Chairman. The 2012 Board and 
Committee evaluations were conducted by way of each director and 
Committee member completing comprehensive questionnaires. 
The results are collated, discussed and acted upon by the Board and 
Committees. The Board reviews the outcomes of the Committee 
evaluations and assesses their performance. The Chairman conﬁrms 
that the performance of the non-executive directors continues to 
be eﬀective. 
Professional advice, indemnities and insurance
There is provision for directors to take independent professional 
advice relating to the discharge of their responsibilities should they 
feel they need it. The Company has arranged directors’ and oﬃcers’ 
liability insurance against certain liabilities and defence costs. 
However, the directors’ insurance does not provide protection in 
the event of a director being found to have acted fraudulently 
or dishonestly.
Investor relations
The Board maintains a regular dialogue with its shareholders, mainly 
in the periods following the announcement of the interim and ﬁnal 
results, but also at other times during the year. The views of 
shareholders are sought through direct contact and via feedback from 
advisors and are communicated to the Board as a whole. The Board 
encourages the participation of shareholders at its Annual General 
Meeting, notice of which is sent to shareholders at least 20 working 
days before the meeting. The AMS website ‘www.admedsol.com’ is 
regularly updated and provides additional information on the Group 
including information on the Group’s products and technology. 
Annual General Meeting
This year’s AGM will, as last year, include a detailed presentation by the 
Chief Executive on the current progress of the business, including an 
outline of the new organisational structure, and allow the opportunity 
for follow up questions on this or any of the resolutions before the 
meeting. The Company proposes separate resolutions for each 
separate issue and speciﬁcally relating to the reports and accounts. 
The Company ensures all proxy votes are counted and indicates the 
level of proxies on each resolution along with the abstentions after  
it has been dealt with on a show of hands.
After the meeting, shareholders will have the opportunity to talk 
informally to the Board and Company staﬀ and raise any further 
questions or issues they may have. The outcome of the AGM and
a copy of the AGM presentation will be posted on the Company’s 
website after the meeting. Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 26
Internal control 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal control  
and for reviewing its eﬀectiveness, taking guidance from the Audit 
Committee. In the context of the Group’s business any such system 
can only reasonably be expected to manage rather than eliminate 
risks arising from its operations. It can therefore only provide 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material loss 
or misstatement.
Key features of the internal control system are as follows:
 The Group has an organisational structure with clear 
responsibilities and lines of accountability. The Group promotes 
the values of integrity and professionalism. The members of the 
Board are available to hear, in conﬁdence, any individual’s concerns 
about improprieties. 
 The Board has a schedule of matters expressly reserved for its 
consideration. This schedule includes potential acquisitions, major 
capital projects, treasury, risk management policies, approval of 
budgets and health & safety.
 The Board monitors the activities of the Group through the 
management accounts, monthly forecasts and other reports on 
current activities and plans. The Senior Management Team 
regularly monitors ﬁnancial and operational performance in detail. 
 The Group has set appropriate levels of authorisation which must 
be adhered to as the Group concludes its business.
 The Group operates a ‘whistle-blowing’ policy enabling any 
individual with a concern to approach the non-executive directors 
in conﬁdence. 
Risk Management
Management are responsible for the identiﬁcation and evaluation of 
signiﬁcant risks applicable to their areas of the business together with 
the design and operation of suitable internal controls. These risks are 
assessed on a continual basis and may be associated with a variety of 
internal or external factors including ﬁnancial and operational risks.
Management report to the Board regularly on their review of risks and 
how they have managed the risks. The Board reviews the inherent 
risks, including the key risks, at Board meetings and the system of 
control necessary to manage such risks. The Board reviews the 
eﬀectiveness of the Group’s procedure in managing risk and, 
therefore, believes it meets the requirements of the Guidance. The 
business risks and controls to mitigate the risks are formally reviewed 
by the Audit Committee and then by the Board at least twice a year. 
Audit Committee
The Audit Committee comprises Steve Bellamy (Chairman), Don Evans 
and Penny Freer. 
Steve Bellamy, a qualiﬁed Chartered Accountant, chairs the Committee. 
The Committee has Terms of Reference that are reviewed at least 
annually. The Assistant Company Secretary acts as Secretary to the 
Committee.
The Committee met four times during the year. All meetings were 
attended by all members. The Chief Executive Oﬃcer, Group Finance 
Director and Group Financial Controller and the external audit partner 
attended a number of these meetings. The Audit Committee also met 
with the external audit partner without the executives and senior 
managers present. The role of the Committee is to:
 consider the appointment, fees, independence and eﬀectiveness 
of the auditor and the audit process, and discuss the scope of the 
audit and its ﬁndings; 
 monitor the Group’s accounting policies;
 review and challenge the Group’s assessment of business risks and 
internal controls to mitigate these risks as well as reviewing the 
annual and interim statements prior to their submission for 
approval by the Board; 
 review and challenge the Going Concern assumptions for the Group; 
 review the Group’s Whistle-blowing, Bribery and Gifts policies; 
 review the Group’s need for and implementation of an internal 
audit function; and
 annually assess the performance of external auditor.
It is the task of the Audit Committee to ensure that auditor 
objectivity and independence is safeguarded when non-audit 
services are provided by the auditor. To ensure auditor objectivity 
and independence there is a process in place to approve any 
non-audit work.
Internal Audit
The Audit Committee has considered that, given the size and nature 
of the Group’s operations, an internal audit resource is required in 
2013. An internal audit plan will be agreed by the Audit Committee. 
All internal audit reports will be discussed with the Audit Committee 
and the external auditor and the recommendations considered and 
acted upon.
The Group also calls on the services of external bodies to review the 
controls in certain areas of the Group. The quality assurance systems 
are reviewed by the Group’s notiﬁed bodies, the British Standards 
Institution (BSI), TUV Product Service and Lloyd’s Quality Register 
Assurance on a regular basis.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee comprises Don Evans (Chairman), Penny 
Freer, Steve Bellamy and Chris Meredith.
The Committee nominates and recommends the appointment of 
new directors to the Board, considers succession planning for 
directors and other senior management and membership of the Audit 
and Remuneration Committees. In making recommendations, the 
Committee takes into account the balance of skill, knowledge and 
experience of the Board and gives due regard to the beneﬁts of 
diversity of the Board, including gender. The Committee has Terms of 
Reference that are reviewed at least annually. The Assistant Company 
Secretary acts as Secretary to the Committee.
The Committee reviewed the composition of the Board during 2012 
and identiﬁed the need for a non-executive director with relevant 
commercial experience of the medical device sector. A proﬁle for this 
position has been drawn up, agreed and a search using an external 
recruitment agency has commenced.
Following Don Evans’ indication that he intends to step down as 
Chairman of the Board later this year when a successor has been 
recruited, a proﬁle for this position has been drawn up, agreed 
and an external recruitment agency appointed to identify suitable 
candidates. Don will stand for re-election at the 2013 AGM and will
be involved in the recruitment process to ensure continuity and a 
smooth transition.
The Committee met formally three times during the year. All meetings 
were attended by all members.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises Penny Freer (Chairman), 
Don Evans and Steve Bellamy.
The Committee, in consultation with the Chief Executive, determines 
the Group’s policy on executive remuneration, employment 
conditions, and the individual remuneration packages of executive 
directors of all Group companies and senior management earning  
in excess of £100,000 per annum. It also approves all new incentive 
schemes, the grants of options under the Group’s Share Option 
Schemes, and the grant of shares under the Group’s Long-Term 
Incentive Plan (LTIP). The Committee has Terms of Reference that are 
reviewed at least annually. The Assistant Company Secretary acts as 
Secretary to the Committee. The Remuneration Committee met four 
times in 2012. All meetings were attended by all members. The report 
of the Committee is included on pages 22 to 24.
Going concern
In carrying out their duties in respect of going concern, the Directors 
have carried out a review of the Group’s ﬁnancial position and cash ﬂow 
forecasts for the next twelve months. These have been based on a 
comprehensive review of revenue, expenditure and cash ﬂows, taking into 
account speciﬁc business risks and the current economic environment.
With regard to the Group’s ﬁnancial position, it had cash and cash 
equivalents at the year-end of £8.9 million (2011: £7.1 million). The 
Group also has in place a term loan of €10.3 million and £6.3 million 
(2011: €25 million) and a revolving credit facility of £8 million which 
expires on 31 July 2015.
While the current economic environment is uncertain, AMS operates 
in a market whose demographics are favourable, underpinned by an 
increasing need for products to treat chronic and acute wounds. 
Consequently, market growth is predicted. The Group has a number 
of long-term contracts with customers across diﬀerent geographic 
regions and also with substantial ﬁnancial resources, ranging from 
government agencies through to global healthcare companies.
Having taken the above into consideration the Directors have 
reached the conclusion that the Group is well placed to manage its 
business risks in the current economic environment. Accordingly, 
they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the 
ﬁnancial statements.

Consolidated Income Statement, the Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position, the 
Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, the Consolidated Statement of Cash Flows, the Company Balance Sheet, the related consolidated 
notes 1 to 35, and the related Company notes 1 to 9. The ﬁnancial reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the Group 
ﬁnancial statements is applicable law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union. The ﬁnancial 
reporting framework that has been applied in the preparation of the parent company ﬁnancial statements is applicable law and United Kingdom 
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Practice).
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Chapter 3 of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s 
report and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the 
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁnancial statements 
and for being satisﬁed that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the ﬁnancial statements in 
accordance with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the 
Auditing Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁnancial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the ﬁnancial statements suﬃcient to give reasonable assurance that 
the ﬁnancial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the 
accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately 
disclosed; the reasonableness of signiﬁcant accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the ﬁnancial statements. 
In addition, we read all the ﬁnancial and non-ﬁnancial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited 
ﬁnancial statements. If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.
Opinion on ﬁnancial statements
In our opinion:
 the ﬁnancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s and of the parent company’s aﬀairs as at 31 December 2012 and 
of the Group’s proﬁt for the year then ended; 
 the Group ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
 the parent company ﬁnancial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting 
Practice; and 
 the ﬁnancial statements have been prepared in accordance with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006.
Opinion on other matter prescribed by the Companies Act 2006
In our opinion the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁnancial year for which the ﬁnancial statements are prepared is consistent 
with the ﬁnancial statements.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception
We have nothing to report in respect of the following matters where the Companies Act 2006 requires us to report to you if, in our opinion:
 adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or 
 the parent company ﬁnancial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or 
 certain disclosures of directors’ remuneration speciﬁed by law are not made; or 
 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit.

Notes Forming Part of the Consolidated 
Financial Statements
1. Reporting entity
Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc (“the Company”) is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales 
(registration number 2867684). The Company’s registered address is Premier Park, 33 Road One, Winsford Industrial Estate, Cheshire, CW7 3RT.
The Company’s ordinary shares are traded on the AIM market of the London Stock Exchange plc. The consolidated ﬁnancial statements of the 
Company for the twelve months ended 31 December 2012 comprise the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).
The Group is primarily involved in the design, development and manufacture of novel high performance polymers (both natural and synthetic) 
for use in advanced woundcare dressings and materials, and medical adhesives and sutures, for closing and sealing tissue, for sale into the global 
medical device market.
2. Basis of preparation
The Group accounts have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs), as adopted by the EU.
The ﬁnancial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis of accounting except as disclosed in the accounting policies set out below.
The individual ﬁnancial statements for each Group company are presented in the currency of the primary economic environment in which it 
operates (its functional currency). For the purpose of the consolidated ﬁnancial statements, the results and ﬁnancial position of each Group 
company are expressed in pounds sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company, and the presentation currency for the Consolidated 
Financial Statements.
In carrying out their duties in respect of going concern, the Directors have carried out a review of the Group’s ﬁnancial position and cash ﬂow 
forecasts for the next twelve months. These have been based on a comprehensive review of revenue, expenditure and cash ﬂows, taking into 
account speciﬁc business risks and the current economic environment. 
With regards to the Group’s ﬁnancial position, it had cash and cash equivalents at the year-end of £8.2 million, and £14.4 million term loan repayable 
by 31 July 2015. The Group also has in place a revolving credit facility of £8 million, which has not been drawn down and expires on 31 July 2015.
While the current economic environment is uncertain, AMS operates in markets whose demographics are favourable, underpinned by an 
increasing need for products to treat chronic and acute wounds. Consequently, market growth is predicted. The Group has a number of 
long-term contracts with customers across diﬀerent geographic regions and also with substantial ﬁnancial resources, ranging from government 
agencies through to global healthcare companies.
After taking the above into consideration, the directors have reached a conclusion that the Group is well placed to manage its business risks in 
the current economic environment. Accordingly, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the accounts.
The Group has applied IAS 24 (revisions 2010), IFRIC 14 (amendments 2010) and improvements to IFRS (2010) . These have had no signiﬁcant 
impact on this set of ﬁnancial information.
3. Accounting policies
Use of estimates and judgments
The preparation of ﬁnancial statements requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that aﬀect the application of 
accounting policies and the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expense. Actual results may diﬀer from these estimates. Estimates 
and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the 
estimate is revised and in any future periods aﬀected. 
Impairment of goodwill
Determining whether goodwill is impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating units to which the assets have been 
allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash ﬂows expected to arise from the cash-generating unit and 
a suitable discount rate to calculate present value.
Capitalisation of development costs
In determining the development expenses to be capitalised, estimates and assumptions are required based on expected future economic 
beneﬁts generated by products that are the result of these development costs. Other important estimates and assumptions in this assessment 
process are the required internal rate of return, the distinction between research and development and the estimated useful life.
Share-based payment
The charge to the income statement in relation to options and incentive plans is based on the Black-Scholes Merton or the Binominal Theorem 
valuation technique. This technique requires a number of assumptions to be made such as those in relation to share price volatility, movement in 
interest rates, dividend yields and staﬀ behavioural patterns. Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 34
3. Accounting policies continued
Inventory impairment provisions
The Group makes provisions for inventory deemed to be obsolete or slow-moving. This provision is established on each individual stock keeping 
unit (SKU) based on the age of the stock, the forward order book, management’s experience and its assessment of the present value of 
estimated future cash ﬂows.
Receivables impairment provisions
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables, estimated by the Group’s management based on 
prior experience and their assessment of the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows.
Deferred tax
A deferred tax asset is recognised when it is judged probable that the Group will generate taxable proﬁts which can be oﬀset against tax losses.
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power to govern the ﬁnancial and operating policies of 
an entity so as to retain beneﬁts from its activities. The ﬁnancial statements of the subsidiaries are included in the consolidated ﬁnancial 
statements on the basis of acquisition accounting, from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
Intercompany transactions and balances between Group entities are eliminated upon consolidation.
Business combinations
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair 
values, at the date of exchange, of assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed, the equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the issue of debt or equity. Acquisition related expenses are accounted for as 
expenses in the period in which the costs are incurred and the services rendered, with the exception of directly attributable costs incurred as a 
result of raising equity, which are oﬀ-set against share premium, and raising debt, which are capitalised and amortised over the term of the debt. 
The acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition under IFRS 3 Business Combinations 
are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets (or disposal groups) that are classiﬁed as held for sale in 
accordance with IFRS 5 Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured at fair value less costs  
to sell.
Goodwill arising on acquisition is recognised as an asset and initially measured at cost, being the excess of the cost of the business combination 
over the Group’s interest in the net fair value of the identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised. If, after reassessment, the 
Group’s interest in the net fair value of the acquiree’s identiﬁable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities exceeds the cost of the business 
combination, the excess is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on consolidation represents the excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the fair value of the identiﬁable 
assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled entity at the date of acquisition. Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at 
cost and is subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for 
impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised immediately in proﬁt or loss and is not subsequently reversed.
Revenue recognition
Revenue represents the fair value of sales of the Group’s products to external customers at amounts excluding value added tax, and is 
recognised when the products have been delivered and title has passed. Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic beneﬁts will ﬂow to the Group and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Revenue from royalty income receivable under licence agreements from external customers at amounts excluding value added tax is recognised 
as the products under licence are sold and the revenue can be reliably measured. 
Other Income
This represents non-refundable up-front licence payments received for the grant of rights for the development and marketing of products, and 
other sundry income. The income is recognised in the income statement, over the life of each development project, in proportion to the stage of 
completion of each project.

3. Accounting policies continued
Finance Income         
Finance income relates to interest earned on cash, cash equivalents and investments. Interest income is accrued on a time basis, by reference to 
the principal outstanding and at the eﬀective interest rate applicable.
Finance Costs         
Finance costs relate to ﬁnance payments associated with ﬁnancial liabilities. They are recognised in the income statement as they accrue using 
the eﬀective interest method.
Finance costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take a 
substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are substantially 
ready for their intended use.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of speciﬁc borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted 
from the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
Provisions         
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that an outﬂow of 
resources embodying economic beneﬁts will be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
Foreign currencies         
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities 
denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated at the foreign exchange rate ruling at that date. Foreign exchange 
diﬀerences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical 
cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in 
foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated at foreign exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined.
The assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated at foreign 
exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenue and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate for the year 
where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates at the dates of the transactions. Exchange diﬀerences arising on consolidation are 
recognised in equity.
Hedging
The Group designates certain hedging instruments, which include derivatives, embedded derivatives and non-derivatives in respect of foreign 
currency risk, as either fair value hedges, cash ﬂow hedges, or hedges of net investments in foreign operations. Hedges of foreign exchange risk 
on ﬁrm commitments are accounted for as cash ﬂow hedges. At the inception of the hedge relationship, the entity documents the relationship 
between the hedging instrument and the hedged item, along with its risk management objectives and its strategy for undertaking various 
hedge transactions. Furthermore, at the inception of the hedge and on an ongoing basis, the Group documents whether the hedging 
instrument is highly eﬀective in oﬀsetting changes in fair values or cash ﬂows of the hedged item. Note 26 sets out details of the fair values of 
the derivative instruments used for hedging purposes. Movements in the hedging reserve in equity are described in note 31.
Taxation
Taxation expense includes the amount of current income tax payable and the charge for the year in respect of deferred taxation.
The income tax payable is based on an estimation of the amount due on the taxable proﬁt for the year. Taxable proﬁt is diﬀerent from proﬁt 
before tax as reported in the income statement because it excludes items of income or expenditure which are not taxable or deductible in the 
year as a result of either the nature of the item or the fact that it is taxable or deductible in another period. The Group’s liability for current tax is 
calculated by using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for on a basis of temporary diﬀerences, except to the extent where it arises from the initial recognition of goodwill or 
of an asset or liability in a transaction that is not a business combination. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable 
that future taxable proﬁts will be available against which temporary diﬀerences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is charged or credited to the income statement, except when it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case 
it is dealt with within equity. It is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply to the period when the asset is realised or the liability is 
settled based on tax laws enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets
Acquired intangible assets that are acquired in a business combination are initially recognised at their fair value. Acquired intangible assets are 
purchased outright are initially recognised at cost, capitalised and amortised over their estimated useful economic lives. In determining the 
useful economic life each asset is reviewed separately and consideration given to the period over which the Group expects to derive economic 
beneﬁt from the asset. Amortisation is included in administration costs. Acquired intangible assets with an indeﬁnite useful economic life are not 
amortised but are subject to an annual impairment review as detailed on page 36. Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 36
3. Accounting policies continued
Development costs
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientiﬁc or technical knowledge, is recognised in the income 
statement as an expense in the period in which it is incurred.
Expenditure on development activities, where research ﬁndings are applied to a plan or design for the production of new or substantially improved 
products and processes, is capitalised once it can be demonstrated that the product or process is clearly identiﬁable, technically and commercially 
feasible, will generate future economic beneﬁts, that the development costs of the asset can be measured reliably and the Group has suﬃcient 
resources to complete development. Expenditure capitalised is stated as the cost of materials and direct labour less accumulated amortisation.
         
Where development expenditure results in new or substantially improved products or processes and it is probable that recovery will take place, 
it is capitalised and amortised on a straight-line basis over the product’s useful life starting from the date on which serial production commences, 
which is between one and ten years. Amortisation of capitalised development costs is included in cost of sales.
Patents and trademarks
Patents and trademarks are measured initially at purchase cost and are amortised on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives, which 
is between three and twenty years. Amortisation is included in administration costs.
         
Software intangibles         
Where computer software is not integral to an item of property, plant or equipment its costs are capitalised and categorised as intangible assets. 
Amortisation is provided on a straight-line basis over its economic useful life, which is between three and ten years.
         
Property, plant and equipment         
Land and buildings and plant and equipment held for use in the production of goods and services or for administrative purposes are carried in 
the balance sheet at cost less any subsequent accumulated depreciation and subsequent accumulated impairment losses.
         
The Group elected to use the fair value as the deemed cost in respect of land and buildings at the date of transition to IFRS. Fair value was 
calculated by reference to their existing use at the date of transition.
         
Depreciation is provided to write oﬀ the cost, less estimated residual values, of all property, plant and equipment, over the expected useful life of 
the asset from the date that the asset is brought into use. It is calculated at the following rates:
 Freehold property and improvements    – 4% per annum on cost
 Leasehold improvements     – over the length of the lease
 Plant and machinery    – 6.7% to 33.3% per annum on cost
 Fixtures and ﬁttings    – 33.3% per annum on cost
 Motor vehicles     – 25% per annum on cost
Property, plant and equipment in the course of construction for production are carried at cost, less any recognised impairment loss. Depreciation 
of these assets, on the same basis as other property, plant and equipment assets, commences when the assets are ready for their intended use.
No depreciation is provided on freehold land.
Impairment of intangible assets excluding goodwill
The carrying amount of the Group’s assets other than inventories and deferred tax assets, are reviewed at each balance sheet date to determine 
whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
An impairment loss is recognised whenever the carrying amount of an asset or its cash-generating unit exceeds its recoverable amount. 
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Impairment losses recognised in respect of cash-generating units are allocated to reduce the carrying amount of the assets in the unit on a pro 
rata basis. A cash-generating unit is the smallest identiﬁable group of assets that generates cash inﬂows that are largely independent of the cash 
inﬂows from other assets or groups of assets.
Calculation of recoverable amount
The recoverable amount of the Group’s receivables carried at amortised cost is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows.  
As the Group’s receivables are of short duration they are not discounted.
Reversal of impairment
An impairment loss in respect of a receivable carried at amortised cost is reversed if the subsequent increase in recoverable amount can be 
related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment loss was recognised.
In respect of other assets, an impairment loss is reversed when there is an indication that the impairment loss may no longer exist and there has 
been a change in the estimates used to determine the recoverable amount.
An impairment loss is reversed only to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would have been 
determined, net of depreciation or amortisation, if no impairment loss had been recognised.

3. Accounting policies continued
Inventory
Inventory is valued at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and, where applicable, direct labour costs that 
have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and condition and an attributable proportion of manufacturing 
overheads based on normal levels of activity.
Net realisable value is based on estimated selling price less further costs to completion and disposal.
The Group makes provision for inventory deemed to be irrecoverable or where the net realisable value is lower than cost. This provision is 
established on a stock keeping unit (SKU) basis by reference to the age of the stock, the forward order book, management’s experience and its 
assessment of the present value of estimated future cash ﬂow.
Financial Instruments
Classiﬁcation of ﬁnancial instruments
Financial instruments are classiﬁed as ﬁnancial assets, ﬁnancial liabilities or equity instruments.
Financial instruments issued by the Group are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions:
 They include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other ﬁnancial assets that are potentially unfavourable to the 
Group; and 
 Where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no obligation to 
deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group exchanging a ﬁxed 
amount of cash or other ﬁnancial assets for a ﬁxed number of its own equity instruments.
To the extent that this deﬁnition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classiﬁed as a ﬁnancial liability. 
Recognition and valuation of ﬁnancial assets
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash at bank and in hand and cash deposits and amounts under short-term guarantees, usually 90 days or 
less, that are held for the purpose of meeting short-term cash commitments and are subject to insigniﬁcant risk in change in value and which are 
readily convertible to a known amount of cash. Cash held in accounts with more than 90 days’ notice that are not required to meet short-term 
cash commitments are shown as an investment. 
Investments
Cash held in accounts with more than 90 days’ notice that are not required to meet short-term cash commitments are shown as an investment. 
The Group invests funds which are surplus to requirements in ﬁxed rate deposits operating within parameters for credit ratings and credit limits 
for individual institutions that are approved and monitored by the Board.
Under IAS 39 “Financial instruments; recognition and measurement”, such investments are classiﬁed as loans and receivables and are recognised 
at fair value on initial recognition and subsequently measured at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest method.
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the lower of their original invoiced value and recoverable amount. An impairment is made when it is 
likely that the balance will not be recovered in full. The recoverable amount is calculated as the present value of estimated future cash ﬂows. Estimated 
future cash ﬂows are not discounted due to the relatively short period of time between recognition of trade receivables and receipt of cash.
Recognition and valuation of ﬁnancial liabilities
Financial liabilities are classiﬁed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into.
Recognition and valuation of equity instruments
Equity instruments are stated at par value. Any premium on issue is taken to the share premium account.
Trade payables
Trade payables are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest method.
Other loans
Other loans are initially recognised at fair value and are subsequently recognised at amortised cost.
Financial liabilities at Fair Value Through Proﬁt or Loss (‘FVTPL’)
A derivative that is not designated and eﬀective as a hedging instrument is classiﬁed as held for trading. Financial liabilities are classiﬁed as at 
FVTPL where the ﬁnancial liabilities are held for trading.
Financial liabilities at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any resultant gain or loss recognised in proﬁt or loss. Fair value is determined in the 
manner described in note 26. Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 38
3. Accounting policies continued
Derivative ﬁnancial instruments
The Group enters into foreign exchange forward contracts to manage its exposure to foreign exchange rate risk. Further details of derivative 
ﬁnancial instruments are disclosed in note 26 to the ﬁnancial statements.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date a derivative contract is entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair value 
at each balance sheet date. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in proﬁt or loss (administrative costs) immediately unless the derivative is 
designated and eﬀective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in proﬁt or loss depends on the nature of the 
hedge relationship. The Group currently designates certain derivatives as hedges of highly probable forecast transactions or hedges of foreign 
currency risk of ﬁrm commitments (cash ﬂow hedges). A derivative with a positive fair value is recognised as a ﬁnancial asset whereas a derivative 
with a negative fair value is recognised as a ﬁnancial liability. 
Derivatives with remaining maturity of less than twelve months are presented as current assets or current liabilities.
Leased assets
Leases are classiﬁed as ﬁnance leases when the terms of the lease transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to the Group. 
All other leases are classiﬁed as operating leases.
Assets held as ﬁnance leases are recognised as assets of the Group at their fair value or, if lower, at the present value of the minimum lease 
payments during the lease term at the inception of the lease. Lease payments are apportioned between the reduction of the lease liability and 
ﬁnance charges in the income statement so as to achieve a constant rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Assets held under 
ﬁnance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the estimated useful life of the assets and the lease term.
Assets leased under operating leases are not recorded on the balance sheet. Rental payments are charged directly to the income statement. 
Lease incentives, primarily up-front cash payments or rent-free periods, are capitalised and spread over the period of the lease term on a straight 
line basis unless another systematic basis is more representative of the time pattern of the users’ beneﬁt. Payments made to acquire operating 
leases are treated as prepaid lease expenses and amortised over the life of the lease.
Pensions
The Group operates a money purchase pension scheme. The assets of the scheme are held separately from those of the Group in an 
independently administered fund. The amount charged against the income statement represents the contributions payable to the scheme in 
respect of the accounting period.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of IFRS 2 ‘Share-based payments’. IFRS 2 has been applied to all options granted after 7 November 2002 
that were unvested as of 1 January 2006.
The group issues equity–settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at 
the date of grant. The fair value as determined at the grant date of equity–settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of options that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes Merton or a Binomial Theorem model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, 
based on management’s best estimate, for the eﬀect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Capital management
For the years ended 31 December 2011 and 31 December 2012, the Group has had net debt. Capital is managed by maximising retained proﬁts. 
Working capital is managed in order to generate maximum conversion of these proﬁts into cash and cash equivalents thereby maintaining 
capital. 
Capital includes share capital, share premium, investment in own shares, share-based payments reserve, share-based payments deferred tax 
reserve, other reserve, translation reserve, hedging reserves and retained earnings reserve. There are no externally imposed capital requirements 
on the Group.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items are those items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence, or that the directors consider should be disclosed 
separately to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results. This includes non-recurring acquisition and integration costs (see note 6). 
Exceptional items have been presented separately on the face of the income statement. The directors consider that this presentation gives a 
fairer presentation of the results of the Group.
Employee Beneﬁt Trusts
The Group operates an Employee Beneﬁt Trust (EBT): ‘Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc UK Employee Beneﬁt Trust’.
The Group has de facto control of the assets, liabilities and shares held by the Trust and bears their beneﬁts and risks. The Group records assets 
and liabilities of the Trust as its own.

4. Segment information
As referred to in the Chief Executive’s Report, the Group has been re-organised into four business units: branded direct, branded distributed, 
OEM (original equipment manufacturer) and bulk materials. These business units are the basis on which the Group reports its segment 
information. The comparative information has been restated under this new format.
Segment results, assets and liabilities include items directly attributable to a segment as well as those that can be allocated on a reasonable basis. 
Unallocated items comprise mainly investments, and related revenue, corporate assets, head oﬃce expenses and income tax assets. These are 
the measures reported to the Group’s Chief Executive for the purposes of resource allocation and assessment of segment performance.
Business segments
The principle activities of the business units are as follows:
 – selling, marketing and innovation of the Group’s branded products by the Group’s sales teams
 – distribution, marketing and innovation of the Group’s brands sold by distributors in markets not serviced by the 
Group’s sales teams
 – selling and innovation of products supplied to the Group’s global and national partners
 – selling, marketing and innovation of bulk materials to medical device partners and convertors Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 40

Proﬁt before taxation 10,796 4,587
Proﬁt multiplied by the standard rate of corporation tax in the UK of 24.5% (2011: 26.5%) 2,645 1,216

Research and development relief (192) (220)
Share-based payments 9 (181)
Adjustments in respect of prior year 236 – 
Taxation 1,104 (263)
Legislation to reduce the main rate of UK corporation tax from 24% to 23% from 1 April 2013 was passed by Parliament on 17 July 2012. A further 
reduction to the main rate of UK corporation tax is proposed to reduce the rate to 22% from 1 April 2014 The reduction in the main rate to 23% 
had been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date and, therefore, the deferred tax assets are calculated in these ﬁnancial statements at 
this rate.
In addition to the amount charged to the income statement and other comprehensive income, the Group has recognised directly in equity:
 excess tax deductions related to share-based payments on exercised options together with;
 changes in excess deferred tax deductions related to share-based payments, totalling £451,000 surplus: (2011: £234,000 deﬁcit).

RESORBA® brand name, which has a carrying value of £8,463,000, and the directors believe to have an indeﬁnite useful economic life. In reaching 
this assessment the directors have considered that the RESORBA® brand has existed for over 80 years and is recognised as a market leader in the 
wound closure market in Germany.
Acquired intangible assets were initially recognised on the acquisition of MedLogic Global Limited representing patents and on the acquisition of 
RESORBA® representing brand names, know-how, customer listings and contracts.

Goodwill arose on the acquisition of Advanced Medical Solutions B.V. on 30 September 2009 and the acquisition of RESORBA® on

34,351 10,945 349 1,238 46,883
The Group tests goodwill annually for impairment, or more frequently if there are indications that goodwill might be impaired.
The recoverable amounts have been determined based on a value-in-use calculation on a cash generating unit basis, which uses cash ﬂow 
projections based on ﬁnancial budgets approved by the directors. These budgets have been adjusted to reﬂect the existing state of the business 
and, consequently, omit investment plans. Cash ﬂows have been extrapolated to 20 years or less using a steady 2% (2011: 2%) per annum growth 
rate, being the medium-term expected growth which is consistent with external information. This growth rate does not exceed the long-term 
average growth rate for the market in which the Group operates. A discount rate adjustment of 8% per annum (2011: 8%), being the Group’s 
current pre-tax weighted average cost of capital, has been applied to these cash ﬂows, being an estimation of current market risks and the time 
value of money. The directors believe that any reasonably possible further change in the key assumptions on which the recoverable amount is 
based would not cause any of the carrying amounts to exceed the relevant recoverable amount.

The Group’s principal ﬁnancial assets are cash and trade receivables. The Group’s credit risk is primarily attributable to its trade receivables.
The average credit period taken on sales of goods is 43 days (2011: 65 days). No interest is charged on the receivables within the contracted credit 
period. Thereafter, interest may be charged at 2% per month on the outstanding balance. In determining the recoverability of a trade receivable 
the Group considers any change in the credit quality of the trade receivable from the date credit was initially granted up to the reporting date. 
The concentration of credit risk is limited due to the Group’s large and unrelated customer base. Accordingly, the directors believe that there is 
no further credit provision required in excess of the allowance for impairments.
Before accepting any new customer, the Group assesses the potential customer’s credit quality and deﬁnes credit limits by customer. Limits are 
reviewed on an ongoing basis and reﬂect current payment history.
Included in the Group’s trade receivables balance are debtors which are past due at the reporting date for which the Group has not provided as 
there has not been a signiﬁcant change in credit quality and the amounts are still considered recoverable. The Group does not hold any collateral 
or other credit enhancements over these balances. The carrying amount and ageing of these debtors are summarised below:

credit terms. Thereafter, interest may be charged on the outstanding balances at various interest rates. The Group has ﬁnancial risk management 
policies in place to ensure that all payables are paid within the pre-agreed credit terms.

31. Reserves
Investment in own shares
This is the nominal value of the shares held in trust on behalf of employees in respect of the DSB scheme.
Other reserve
This represents Advanced Medical Solutions Limited’s share premium account arising from merger accounting.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve represents the cumulative amount of gains and losses on hedging instruments deemed eﬀective in cash ﬂow hedges. The 
cumulative deferred gain or loss on the hedging instrument is recognised in proﬁt or loss only when the hedged transaction impacts the proﬁt 
or loss, or is included as a basis adjustment to the non-ﬁnancial hedged item, consistent with the applicable accounting policy.
Translation reserve
Exchange diﬀerences relating to the translation of the net assets of the Group’s foreign operations, which relate to subsidiaries only, from their 
functional currency into the parents functional currency, being Sterling, are recognised directly in the translation reserve. Gains and losses on 
hedging instruments that are designated as hedges of net investments in foreign operations are included in the translation reserve.
£1,258,000 has been recorded in the translation reserve during the period, which would otherwise have been recognised in administration costs 
(2011: £158,000), if hedge accounting had not been adopted. Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 56 Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 56
32. Acquisition of subsidiary

commercial opportunities and more direct control of our sales channels.

As required by IFRS3 – ‘Business Combinations’, any adjustments in the hindsight period to the provisional fair value of the assets and liabilities 
acquired with a business should be adjusted as if the amendments had occurred on the acquisition date. As a consequence, following the 
completion of the fair value exercise in relation to the acquisition of RESORBA® in 2011, the Group Balance Sheet as at 31 December 2011 has been 
restated to reﬂect the adjustments made. The impact of these adjustments is shown above.
Goodwill is denominated in Euros in line with RESORBA®’s functional currency. The goodwill has been translated at the closing Euro rate on each 
balance sheet date.

The goodwill arising on the acquisition of RESORBA® is attributable to the assembled workforce and the implied workforce.
None of the goodwill is expected to be deductible for income tax.
The fair value of ﬁnancial assets includes receivables (predominately trade receivables) with a fair value of £2.1m and a gross contractual value of 
£2.1m. The best estimate at acquisition date of the contractual cash ﬂows not to be collected are £NIL.
Total costs for the transaction amounted to £3,244,000, of which, £1,807,000 was included in administration costs (exceptional items), £449,000 
was capitalised as the cost of debt, and £988,000 was oﬀ-set against share premium as the cost of raising equity. 
RESORBA® contributed £NIL to revenue and £NIL to proﬁt before tax for the period between the date of acquisition and 31 December 2011.
If the acquisition of RESORBA® had been completed on the ﬁrst day of the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2011, Group revenues for the period 
would have been £52,537,000 and the Group proﬁt attributable to equity holders of the parent would have been £6,222,000.

Under the terms of the Company’s Share Option Schemes, approved by Shareholders in 1999 and amended in 2001 and 2002, the Board may 
oﬀer options to purchase ordinary shares in the Company to all employees of the Company at the market price on a date to be determined prior 
to the date of the oﬀer. Since 2005, individuals who are entitled to awards under the LTIP are no longer eligible to receive options under the 
Company’s Share Option Schemes.
Performance targets are assessed over a three-year period from the date of grant. Once options have vested they can be exercised during the 
period up to ten years from the date of grant.
The expected volatility was determined by calculating the historic volatility of the Group’s share price over the previous three years. Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 58 Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 58

Notes Forming Part of the Company Financial 
Statements
1. Signiﬁcant accounting policies
Basis of accounting
The separate ﬁnancial statements of the company are presented as required by the Companies Act 2006. They have been prepared under the 
historical cost convention and in accordance with applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards and law.
The principal accounting policies are summarised below. They have all been applied consistently throughout the year and the preceding year.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption of FRS8 from disclosing transactions with other members of the Group and the exemption 
in FRS29 for making disclosures in relation to ﬁnancial instruments.
Investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiaries and associates are shown at cost less provision for impairment.
For investments in subsidiaries acquired for consideration including the issue of shares qualifying for merger relief, cost is measured by reference 
to the nominal value only of the shares issued. Any premium is ignored.
Financial liabilities and equity
Financial liabilities and equity instruments are classiﬁed according to the substance of the contractual arrangements entered into. An equity 
instrument is any contract that evidences a residual interest in the assets of the Group after deducting all of its liabilities.
Share-based payments
The Group has applied the requirements of FRS20 Share-based Payments. In accordance with the transitional provisions, FRS 20 has been applied 
to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002 that were unvested as at 1 January 2005.
The Group issues equity-settled share-based payments to certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at 
the date of grant. The fair value as determined at the grant date of equity-settled share-based payments is expensed on a straight-line basis over 
the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest.
Fair value is measured by use of a Black-Scholes Merton model. The expected life used in the model has been adjusted, based on management’s 
best-estimate, for the eﬀect of non-transferability, exercise restrictions and behavioural considerations.
Liquid resources
Liquid resources comprise variable term deposits that are accessible with less than 12 months’ notice.
2. Proﬁt for the year
As permitted by section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company has elected not to present its own proﬁt and loss account for the year. 
AMS Group plc reported a proﬁt for the ﬁnancial year ended 31 December 2012 of £2,942,000 (2011: Loss of £854,000).
The auditor’s remuneration for audit and other services is disclosed in note 7 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements.
The average number of employees in the year was 8 (201 1: 6). The directors’ remuneration is detailed in note 9 to the consolidated ﬁnancial statements. Company Overview Business Review Corporate Governance Financial Statements

As special business:
To consider and, if thought ﬁt, to pass Resolution 7, which will be proposed as an Ordinary Resolution, and Resolutions 8 and 9, which will be 
proposed as Special Resolutions.
7. To authorise the directors generally and unconditionally for the purposes of section 551 of the Companies Act 2006 (the ‘2006 Act’) to 
exercise all the powers of the Company to allot shares in the Company and to grant rights to subscribe for or to convert any security into 
shares in the Company (each an allotment of ‘relevant securities’) up to an aggregate nominal amount of £3,410,555 provided that this 
authority is for a period expiring upon the earlier of the date of the Company’s next Annual General Meeting and ﬁfteen months after the 
date of the passing of this Resolution but the Company may before such expiry make an oﬀer or agreement which would or might require 
relevant securities to be allotted after such expiry and the directors may allot relevant securities in pursuance of such oﬀer or agreement 
notwithstanding that the authority conferred by this resolution has expired. This authority is in substitution for all subsisting authorities, to 
the extent unused. 
8. Subject to the passing of resolution 7 above, to authorise the directors pursuant to section 570 of the 2006 Act to allot equity securities

(a) in connection with an oﬀer of such securities by way of rights to holders of ordinary shares in proportion (as nearly as may be 
practicable) to their respective holdings of such shares, but subject to such exclusions or other arrangements as the directors may deem 
necessary or expedient in relation to fractional entitlements or any legal or practical problems under the laws of any territory, or the 
requirements of any regulatory body or stock exchange; 
(b) otherwise than pursuant to sub-paragraph (a) above up to an aggregate nominal amount of £1,023,166; and 
(c) which shall expire on the earlier of the conclusion of the next Annual General Meeting of the Company and ﬁfteen months after the date 
of the passing of this Resolution, save that the Company may before such expiry make an oﬀer or agreement which would or might 
require equity securities to be allotted after such expiry and the directors may allot equity securities in pursuance of any such oﬀer or 
agreement notwithstanding that the power conferred by this resolution has expired. 
9. That the Company is hereby generally and unconditionally authorised for the purposes of Section 701 of the 2006 Act to make market 
purchases (within the meaning of Section 693(4) of the 2006 Act) of any of its ordinary shares of 5p each in the capital of the Company on 
such terms and in such manner as the directors may from time to time determine provided that: 
(a) the maximum number of ordinary shares which may be purchased is 10,231,666; 
(b) the minimum price which may be paid for each ordinary share is 5p which amount shall be exclusive of expenses, if any; 
(c) the maximum price (exclusive of expenses) which may be paid for each ordinary share shall not be more than 5% above the average of 
the middle market quotations for an ordinary share as derived from The London Stock Exchange Daily Oﬃcial List for the ﬁve business 
days immediately preceding the date on which the ordinary share is purchased; 
(d) unless previously renewed, revoked or varied, this authority shall expire upon the earlier of the date of the Company’s next Annual 
General Meeting and ﬁfteen months after the date of the passing of this Resolution; and 
(e) under this authority the Company may make a contract to purchase ordinary shares which would or might be executed wholly or partly 
after the expiry of this authority, and may make purchases of ordinary shares pursuant to it as if this authority had not expired.

Notes
1. A member entitled to attend and vote at the meeting convened by the notice set out above may appoint a proxy to attend, speak and, on a 
poll to vote in his place. A holder of more than one ordinary share may appoint diﬀerent proxies in relation to each or any of those ordinary 
shares. 
2. A member may appoint more than one proxy provided each proxy is appointed to exercise rights attached to diﬀerent shares. A member 
may not appoint more than one proxy to exercise rights attached to any one share. To appoint more than one proxy notice must be given to 
the Company’s Registrars not later than 48 hours before the time appointed for the holding of the meeting. 
3. A proxy does not need to be a member of the Company but must attend the meeting to represent you. Details of how to appoint the 
Chairman of the meeting or another person as your proxy using the proxy form are set out at note 1 of the proxy form. If you wish your proxy 
to speak on your behalf at the meeting you will need to appoint your own choice of proxy (not the Chairman) and give your instructions 
directly to them. 
4. On a vote on a resolution on a show of hands at the meeting, a proxy has one vote for and one vote against if the proxy has been appointed 
by more than one member and the proxy has been instructed by one or more of the members to vote for the resolution and by one or more 
other member to vote against it. 
5. Any corporation which is a member can appoint one or more corporate representatives who may exercise on its behalf all of its powers as a 
member provided that they do not do so in relation to the same shares. 
6. A form of proxy is enclosed for use by members. To be eﬀective, it must be completed and arrive not later than 48 hours before the time 
ﬁxed for the Meeting at Capita Registrars, PXS, 34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU. You may also deliver by hand to The Registry, 
34 Beckenham Road, Beckenham, Kent BR3 4TU during usual business hours. 
7. The register of directors’ interests in the shares of the Company will be available for inspection at the registered oﬃce of the Company 
during usual business hours on any weekday (public holidays excepted) until the date of the Meeting and also on that date and at the place 
of the Meeting from 9.00 a.m. until the conclusion of the Meeting. 
8. The Company, pursuant to Regulation 41 of the Uncertiﬁcated Securities Regulations 2001, speciﬁes that only those shareholders registered 
in the Register of Members of the Company as at 6:00 p.m. on 20 May 2013 shall be entitled to attend or vote at the aforesaid Annual General 
Meeting in respect of the number of shares registered in their names at that time. Changes in the entries in the relevant register of Securities 
after 6:00 p.m. on 20 May 2013 shall be disregarded in determining the rights of any person to attend or vote at the meeting. 
Notes on special business
Resolution 7: Authority to Allot Shares and other relevant securities
This resolution would give the directors the authority to allot ordinary shares up to an aggregate nominal amount equal to £3,410,555 
(representing 68,211,113 ordinary shares of 5p each). This amount represents approximately one-third of the issued ordinary share capital of the 
Company as at 10 April 2013, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice.
The authority sought under this resolution will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2014 or, if earlier, 
15 months after the passing of the resolution.
While the Directors have no present intention of issuing any of the authorised but unissued share capital, it is considered prudent and 
appropriate to maintain the ﬂexibility that this authority provides.
Resolution 8: Disapplication of Pre-emption Rights
Your directors also require additional authority from shareholders to allot shares or grant rights over shares or sell treasury shares where they 
propose to do so for cash and otherwise than to existing shareholders in proportion to their existing holdings. Accordingly, Resolution 8 will be 
proposed as a special resolution to grant such authority. Apart from rights issues, open oﬀers or any other pre-emptive oﬀer as mentioned the 
authority will be limited to the issue of shares and sales of treasury shares for cash up to an aggregate nominal value of £1,023,166 (being 10% of 
the Company’s issued ordinary share capital at 10 April 2013, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice). This is in keeping with 
the extent for which such authority has been sought and given at each previous Annual General Meeting of the Company since 2006.
Allotments made under the authorisation in paragraph (a) of Resolution 8 would be limited to allotments by way of a rights issue only (subject to 
the right of the directors to impose necessary or appropriate limitations to deal with, for example, fractional entitlements and regulatory matters).
If given, this authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2014 or, if earlier, 15 months after the 
passing of the resolution. Advanced Medical Solutions Group plc Annual Report 2012 | 68
Notes on special business continued
Resolutions 9: Purchase by the Company of its own Shares
In certain circumstances, it may be advantageous for the Company to purchase its own shares. Under Section 701 of the 2006 Act, the directors 
of a company may make market purchases of that company’s shares if authorised to do so. Your directors believe that granting such approval 
would be in the best interests of shareholders in allowing directors the ﬂexibility to react promptly to circumstances requiring market purchases.
Accordingly, Resolution 9, which will be proposed as a special resolution, will give the directors the authority to purchase issued shares of the 
Company under Section 701 of the 2006 Act.
The authority contained in this resolution will be limited to an aggregate nominal value of £511,583 (representing 5% of the issued ordinary share 
capital of the Company as at 10 April 2013 the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice; representing 10,231,666 ordinary shares of 
5p each). The price which may be paid for those shares is also restricted as set out in the resolution.
This authority will expire at the conclusion of the Annual General Meeting of the Company held in 2014 or, if earlier, 15 months after the passing 
of the resolution.
The Board has no present intention of exercising this authority. However, this will be kept under review, and the Board will use this power only if 
and when, taking account of market conditions prevailing at the time, other investment opportunities, appropriate gearing levels and the overall 
ﬁnancial position of the Group, they believe that the eﬀect of such purchases will be in the best interests of shareholders generally and that they 
will result in an increase in earnings per share.
Shares purchased under this authority may be held as treasury shares. Shares held in treasury do not carry voting rights and no dividends will be 
paid on any such shares. Shares held in treasury in this way can be sold for cash or cancelled. This would allow the Company to manage its 
capital base more eﬀectively and to replenish its distributable reserves.
If and when the Board resolves to exercise its authority to make market purchases, it will at that time decide whether shares purchased are to be 
cancelled or held in treasury.
As at 10 April 2013, the latest practicable date prior to publication of this Notice, there were share options outstanding over ordinary shares, 
representing 3.4% of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital. The Company has no warrants in issue in relation to its shares. If the buyback 
authority was to be exercised in full, these options would represent 3.6% of the Company’s ordinary issued share capital.

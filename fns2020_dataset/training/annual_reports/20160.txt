for the longer term.”

Report and accounts 2007 03
Directors’ report Directors’ remuneration report Auditors’ report Financial statements Additional financial information Information for shareholders
3i has had another year of strong financial
performance. A number of our strategic
initiatives have contributed to our growth
and it has been a very productive period for
business development. The Group’s total
return of £1,075 million for the year to 
31 March 2007 represented 26.8% on
opening shareholders’ funds. 
Realisations were again very strong. 
The quality of our portfolio, favourable
merger and acquisitions markets and the 
skill of our teams around the world have
delivered realisation proceeds of 
£2,438 million, with an uplift in value 
on sale of 52%. 
3i’s strategic position in both high growth 
and more mature markets also enabled the
Group to increase investment by 42% to
£1,576 million. Growth was especially 
strong in Asia, which accounted for 16% 
of investment in the year.
During the year the Buyouts business raised
its latest 15 billion mid-market buyout 
fund, Eurofund V, and we extended our
international reach with new Growth Capital
teams in Beijing and New York. We also
established two new business lines, with the
£700 million launch of 3i Infrastructure
Limited on the London Stock Exchange, and
the establishment of our “Quoted Private
Equity” team. 
Progress on so many fronts would not, 
of course, have been possible without the
commitment and experience of many 
people to whom I offer my thanks: our staff
world-wide; the management teams and
advisers of our portfolio companies; and
above all our Chief Executive Philip Y ea and
his Management Committee. 
The strength of the Group’s cash flow 
has meant that we have been able not only
to grow investment levels and invest 
in a number of strategic initiatives but 
also to return capital to shareholders.
Following approval at our Extraordinary
General Meeting (“EGM”) last year, 
£700 million has been returned to our
shareholders. The Group also bought back
£74 million of ordinary shares during the
year. The Board has announced its intention
to return a further £800 million to
shareholders by way of a bonus issue of listed
B shares. Resolutions relating to the return of
capital proposals will be put to shareholders
at another EGM, which is currently expected 
to take place in July.
The Board is recommending a final ordinary
dividend of 10.3p, making a total ordinary
dividend for the year of 16.1p, up 5.9% on 
last year. 
I was delighted to welcome Robert Swannell
as a non-executive Director to the Board in
September 2006. Robert is Vice Chairman of
Citigroup Europe and a member of Citigroup’s
Global Investment Banking Committee, 
in addition to being a non-executive Director
of British Land Company plc. He has
extensive experience of international financial
services and wide experience of business. 
Danny Rosenkranz, who has been a 
non-executive Director of the Group since
2000, retires from the Board at the AGM 
in July. I would like to thank him for the
considerable contribution he has made to 
the Board during a very important period for
3i and especially for his work as Chairman of
the Remuneration Committee. 
As private equity has grown as an asset 
class for investors, so it has attracted more
attention from political and business
commentators. Our track record as a 
FTSE 100 company since 1994, and our
pioneering approach to governance and
corporate responsibility issues in the industry,
stand 3i in good stead as the debate about
responsibility and transparency in the 
industry develops. 
As a member of Sir David Walker’s working
group for the British Venture Capital
Association I am delighted to be involved 
in taking this debate to the next stage.
Meanwhile, in this report you will see that we
have provided further details on our largest
investments and realisations in the year. 
At 3i, we are proud of our record of 
growing businesses. We have always placed
considerable emphasis on the quality of our
relationships with investee companies, and on
corporate responsibility, as endorsed by our
high ranking in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index for 2007. I would like to congratulate
our Corporate Responsibility Committee, led
by the Company Secretary, T ony Brierley, 
on winning this year’s Investor Relations
Society Best Practice Award for the
Corporate responsibility section of our 
2006 Annual report.
In summary, this has been an exceptional
year for 3i. The Group has delivered a high
return on shareholders’ funds and a strong
cash flow and, most importantly of all, 
has taken important steps to develop the
business for the longer term.

Newly established business lines
During the year two new business lines were established as part 
of our strategy to use our private equity skill base, knowledge and
network to grow our assets and shareholder value.  
Infrastructure
Following the launch of 3i Infrastructure
Limited on the London Stock Exchange, in
which 3i has a 46.4% shareholding, 3i’s
dedicated infrastructure team now primarily
advises this listed vehicle. 3i Infrastructure
Limited seeks to invest in a broad range 
of international infrastructure assets,
principally in transportation, utilities 
and social infrastructure. 
QPE
3i QPE’s objective is to build a portfolio 
of influential equity interests in small and
mid-cap quoted companies primarily in 
the UK and continental Europe. 
The QPE team will create value with the
management teams of these companies
through applying 3i’s private equity skill base, 
network and resources.

Chief Executive’ s statement
“Continued broadening of our investment activities by
geography and asset class, and a focus on delivering 
real value within each specific opportunity, remain
critical components of our strategy.”
This was a further year of good progress 
for the Group. The Group’s financial
performance was very strong, in terms of
new investment and divestment activity, 
as well as the high level of returns achieved. 
At the same time we are able to report
further significant progress in our strategic
development, most notably in the scale up 
of our Infrastructure business and the launch
of our QPE business line.
The first element of our strategy is to
invest in high-return assets. In this regard,
total return was notable at 26.8%, a figure
that was beyond our expectations at 
the start of the year, not least because
divestment conditions remained attractive
throughout the period due to favourable
economic conditions and the buoyancy of
debt financing markets. This figure was 
well ahead of last year’s return of 22.5%,
principally as a result of both our Buyouts 
and Growth Capital businesses delivering
exceptional gross portfolio returns on a one
year basis at 53.8% and 47.7% respectively,
well ahead of our through the cycle targets
and last year’s equivalent figures of 29.4%
and 26.4%.
These results were underpinned by a high
proportion of realised profits, a consequence
of a record level of realisations, which
at £2.4 billion for the Group, was an
improvement on last year’s previous record
figure of £2.2 billion. Our Venture Capital
business line improved its performance in the
second half, reducing its negative return to
(5.6)% for the full year compared to (8.4)%
for the first six months. 
The next elements of our strategy are 
to grow our assets and those we manage
on behalf of third parties, as well as to
extend our international reach both
directly and through investing in other
funds. The amount of 3i’s own investment
rose from £1.1 billion to £1.6 billion, an
increase of 42% on last year. This rise in new
investment reflects the strategic changes of
the last few years, with the most significant
increases coming in Growth Capital and
Infrastructure on a business line basis, 
and within Growth Capital in Asia on a
regional basis. 
Asia represented 9% of the Group’s portfolio
value at the end of the year, an increase 
over last year’s 4%. Assuming no change to
financial markets, we are targeting a further
increase in investment levels over the new
financial year, with a contribution from our
QPE business line and further progress in 
Buyouts and Growth Capital.
As a key element of our strategy is to
grow the level of third-party funds
under management, it is pleasing to report
that these rose by 76% last year, increasing
from £1,573 million to £2,772 million. 
This figure includes the third-party element
of our most recent buyout fund, Eurofund V, 
which in total closed at 15 billion, a significant
increase on the13 billion raised for 
Eurofund IV. 
Further growth in assets under management
came from the launch of 3i Infrastructure
Limited, a £700 million Jersey-based listed
infrastructure fund to which the Group
contributed assets and cash of £325 million
and third-party shareholders contributed the
balance of £375 million. 
The Group’s strategy is to raise third-party
money where structurally it is necessary 
to do so as in the case of Buyouts, or 
where it optimises our shareholders’ exposure
to a particular asset due to the nature of the
returns, such as Infrastructure. These
activities can be attractive due to the
opportunity to earn management, advisory
and performance fees that enhance the
overall level of shareholder return. Since the
end of the year we have announced the 
signing of a Memorandum of Understanding
with IIFCL, a debt financing institution set up
by the Indian Government, which will pave
the way for 3i to raise a further infrastructure
fund dedicated to the Indian market.
These developments are also excellent
examples of the fourth part of our
strategy, which is to use our balance
sheet and resources to develop both
existing and new business lines.
With unprecedented liquidity in financing
markets, as well as continued significant
change in the shape of the Group’s business,
the last element of our strategy, to
continue to build our strong culture
of operating as one company across
business lines, geographies and sectors,
is critical. 
All of our senior management, and in
particular our Group Partners, have made it
their priority to ensure that this unique 3i
culture is nurtured and strengthened, through
informal and formal channels. We measure
our colleagues’ level of engagement on an 
annual basis, and the 2007 figure of 87%, 
together with other key performance
measures, is reported on page 11 of this
report to shareholders.
Further significant progress 
in our strategic development 3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 07
Directors’ report Directors’ remuneration report Auditors’ report Financial statements Additional financial information Information for shareholders
At a time when there is increasing debate
about private equity as an asset class, with
concerns being raised with respect to its
stewardship, its transparency and the sources
of and sustainability of returns, we have
chosen to increase yet again 3i’s own level 
of disclosure in this report to shareholders. 
In addition to the point by point disclosure 
of progress against our strategy mentioned
above, we are also giving greater disclosure
of the financial and business progress of 
key investments for each of our major
business lines. 
Twelve months ago we announced the
intention to return some £700 million to
shareholders. At the time we wanted to retain
sufficient resources to grow our near-term
investment levels whilst maintaining strategic
flexibility as we considered the development
of the Infrastructure and QPE business lines.
With these two initiatives now launched, 
and on the back of the excellent rate of
realisations over the year, it is possible to
recommend a further return of cash without
compromising our ambition to grow assets.
Markets remain fast-changing. On the one
hand the drive by major firms to increase
their deal size is expanding the definition 
of the mid-market, which given the
international spread of 3i’s network is to 
our advantage. On the other hand, there 
is an increase in the number of firms
contemplating investing in the growth
capital market on a trans-national basis. 
Prices are generally high, and so our teams
remain selective in their choice of targets,
focused on identifying and then driving, 
with management, the underlying value of
each investment in order to deliver or exceed
our return targets. It is important to keep the
organisation of our business flexible in order
to face these markets. The formation of 
distinct Infrastructure and QPE business lines
was consistent with our policy of building
internal capabilities before building assets.
We welcome the announced and actual
listings of other private equity firms, whether
as management companies, or funds under
management. We believe that this can only
be beneficial to stock markets’ understanding
of both the sector generally, and their
appreciation of the 3i business model in
particular. Just as within the public markets
there are different companies with different
models, so too within private equity will the
market grow to understand better that
various firms have different strategies, 
some differentiated and others less so. 
3i is defined by an explicit choice to work
predominantly in the mid-market, by our
spread of assets over 14 countries and five
different asset classes, and our desire to
ensure that all of our teams nurture and value
our relationships with those outside the
Group in a way that delivers real benefits to
the companies in which we invest. 
We continue to see good investment
opportunities in our chosen areas, albeit that
pricing remains high. Continued broadening 
of our investment activities by geography
and asset class, and a focus on delivering 
real value within each specific opportunity,
remain critical components of our strategy.
Although levels of realisations are expected
to slow, we remain confident of reporting
further good progress in the delivery of our
strategy over the year ahead.

Business review Group business
This review provides an overview of our main activities;
principal markets; Group and business line performance;
and risk management. It also describes our key 
financial performance measures and our performance
against them.
Introduction to the Group
3i is a world leader in private equity and
venture capital with five distinct business
lines investing across Europe, Asia and the US.
We invest from our own balance sheet and
also with funds that we advise or manage 
on behalf of others.
There are detailed descriptions, performance
data and commentaries for our Buyouts,
Growth Capital and Venture Capital business
lines on pages 12 to 23, together with case
studies illustrating the nature and range of
their investment activity. Our two new
business lines, Infrastructure and Quoted
Private Equity are also described on pages 24
and 25.
The Group’s overall vision is to be the private
equity firm of choice: operating on a world-
wide scale; producing consistent market-
beating returns; being acknowledged for our
partnership style; and winning through our
unparalleled resources. On pages 10 and 11
we have set out the strategy for achieving
this vision, along with a summary of our
progress, the key risk factors involved and
statistics relating to our performance with
respect to each key element of strategy.
3i’s vision and strategy are regularly reviewed
by the Group Board and the risk management
framework as set out on pages 26 to 31
provides the framework for identifying,
assessing and responding to risks in 
relation to executing that strategy and 
delivering our business objectives. 
We operate in a number of distinct
geographical and sector markets and the
market for each of our business lines has its
own specific characteristics. However, the
environment and competitive landscape for
each of them is influenced by the level of
private equity funds raised and invested, 
the strength of the capital markets and the
extent of merger and acquisitions activity.
With the exception of Venture Capital, 
all of these influences were strongly positive
during the year increasing both activity 
and competition, especially in Buyouts.  
Overall, global private equity fundraising 
and investment levels were dominated by
buyouts. Preliminary statistics for calendar
year 2006 released by the European Private
Equity and Venture Capital Association
(“EVCA”) in March 2007 show that European
private equity firms raised a record 190 billion
in 2006 (2005: 172 billion) and invested 
150 billion (2005: 147 billion). According to
the EVCA some 79% of funds raised and 
78% of that invested related to buyouts.
According tounquote”, the number of
mid-market buyouts in Europe increased 
by 17% from 2005 to 2006.
Funds raised for venture capital in Europe
rose almost 50% in the year to 116 billion,
according to EVCA data. Ernst & Y oung and
Dow Jones VentureOne data shows that
European venture capital investment
increased by 5% to 14.1 billion and that US
venture capital investment increased by 8%
to $26 billion in 2006, its highest level 
of investment in five years.
Although there is no single source that
accurately tracks the European growth 
capital market in which 3i operates, our 
own internal data suggests that there was
a 65% increase in the amount invested to 
14.5 billion in 2006. 
According to Asian Venture Capital Journal
statistics, the Asian markets in which 3i
operates directly (China, India, North Asia 
and South East Asia) saw a 50% increase 
in investment. 
3i is a highly-selective investor and made 
62 investments during the year to 31 March
2007 (2006: 58). We make a small number
of investments each year across a range of
sectors, regions and types of investment.
Consequently, general economic conditions
have less influence than changes occurring 
in specific sectors.  3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 09
Directors’ report Directors’ remuneration report Auditors’ report Financial statements Additional financial information Information for shareholders
Private equity thrives on change, and
strategic shifts within economies and sectors
drive activity both in terms of investment
and realisations. 3i’s local presence and
dedicated sector-focused teams enable us to
achieve competitive advantage in originating
investment opportunities, assessing them
and in managing assets. 
As a returns-focused business, we set clear
targets for our key performance measures 
at a Group and business line level and these
are set out in detail for each business line on
pages 12 to 25.
We employ a relatively small number of 
staff (an average of 765 for the year) 
for a FTSE 100 company, and they work 
in focused teams across 23 locations in 
three continents in a matrix structure. 
The key dimensions of this matrix are
business line, geography and sector, with
each business line unified through common
carried interest schemes and processes.
Our professional service teams are
incentivised on Group performance. 
The high levels of staff engagement achieved

Business review Our strategy
Achieving our vision depends upon a clear strategy, 
ensuring that we measure our progress towards reaching
our strategic goals and taking account of the key risks
involved and how they change. Here is a summary of 
where we are today.
Strategy
Invest in high-return assets
Achieving our vision and delivering our return
objectives across the cycle, depends upon making
high-quality investments.    
– Gross portfolio return, one of the key
investment performance measures, averaged
25% over the last three years. 
– Measures of current portfolio health for each 
of our business lines are strong.
Progress
Grow our assets and those
we manage and advise 
on behalf of third parties
Combining growth in assets with our 
investment disciplines will enable us to 
grow shareholder value.
– T otal funds under management grew by 
25% in the year to 31 March 2007 to 
£7,134 million.
– The average investment size (£26 million) 
has trebled over the last four years. 
– The closing of the 15 billion mid-market 
buyout fund, Eurofund V.
– The £700 million listing of 3i Infrastructure
Limited on the London Stock Exchange.
Extend our international 
reach, directly and through
investing in funds
International expansion supports asset 
growth, provides competitive advantage 
and delivers significant added value to our
portfolio companies.
– The proportion of assets outside the UK has
steadily increased to 59% at 31 March 2007. 
– With the opening of new offices in Beijing 
and New York, 18 of 3i’s 23 offices are now
outside the UK.
– The value of the portfolio in Asia rose by 123%
in the year to £373 million.
– 3i’s investments in eight private equity funds
around the world further extend our reach.
Use our balance sheet and
resources to develop existing
and new business lines
3i’s permanent capital base, FTSE 100 status,
credit rating and strong cash flow provide the
platform, resources and credibility to grow.
– Buyouts and Growth Capital have increased
investment by 77% and 51% respectively over
the last three years.
– Venture Capital has increased the proportion of
late-stage investment from 44% to 65% during
the last financial year.
– During the year, two new business lines 
were established, Infrastructure and Quoted
Private Equity.
Continue to build our strong
culture of operating as one
company across business
lines, geographies and sectors
Every aspect of our vision depends upon our
people, the strength of their relationships and 
the way they work together.
– Our 2007 staff engagement survey shows a very
high level of engagement and commitment to
3i’s goals. Employee engagement is the extent
to which employees are committed to their role,
their team and the Group and its objectives.
– Our People Programmes for Chairmen and 
Chief Executives are now operating in Europe,
Asia and the US. 3i Group plc

Business review Buyouts
“An excellent year for 3i Buyouts in a very competitive
market. Our performance and market position,
combined with our new 15 billion Eurofund V, 
position the business well for future growth.”
Business model
The Buyouts business line targets cash-to-
cash IRR returns of 20% through the cycle
and is focused on leading or co-leading
mid-market transactions across Europe of
typically up to around 11billion in value.
Investments are made through a Limited
Partnership private equity fund vehicle
(currently Eurofund V), which is managed by
3i (see Fund management section opposite).
Returns from individual investments are
achieved through a mix of income, returns 
of capital and capital realisation upon exit.
Returns to 3i Group are enhanced through
fees and carried interest from these funds.
A core element of the business model is that
our team of over 100 investment professionals
operates as one pan-European team with full
economic alignment. This enables resources
to be matched to opportunities across
Europe on a “best team for the job” basis,
allowing 3i to pursue larger and more
complex transactions than smaller funds.
Strategy
The core elements of strategy relate to
origination and value creation. As part of 
3i Group, an extensive origination network is
combined with pan-European decision making,
sector expertise and access to high-quality
operational expertise. This provides the
opportunity to be able to choose the best
12 to 15 investments to make in each year.
Working with management, we create a
bespoke value creation plan for each
investment, focused on growing earnings and
using 3i’s network, knowledge and expertise
to maximum effect. These value creation
plans are benchmarked and reviewed by a
team of experienced partners on a pan-
European basis. An illustration of the range 
of business transformation possible through
this approach can be seen from the case
studies on pages 14 and 15.
Extending our international reach has also
been a component of our strategy. During
the year a team was established to focus on
central and eastern European investments.

Report and accounts 2007 13
Directors’ report Directors’ remuneration report Auditors’ report Financial statements Additional financial information Information for shareholders
This team made its first investment shortly
after the 31 March year end. Our latest 
fund, the 15 billion Eurofund V, also has the
capacity to invest up to 10% of its capital in
companies outside Europe.
Marketplace
The mid-market buyout market in Europe
remains buoyant. In calendar year 2006
this segment, defined as deals between
125 million and 11 billion deal size, according
tounquote”, represented some 470
transactions with an aggregate deal value 
of 167 billion (2005: 402 transactions, 
169 billion).
It is a highly fragmented and competitive
marketplace with 283 different firms
completing transactions in 2006 
(2005: 227).
Increased market activity has been driven 
by an increase in the capital allocated by
institutions to buyout funds attracted by the
recent track record of returns on buyouts
generally and a benign economic environment
which presents favourable investment
conditions and low corporate default rates.
There has also been a plentiful source of debt
from traditional lenders and, increasingly,
from institutional investors such as collateral
debt and loan obligation funds.
Increased competition continues to put
upward pressure on deal entry pricing
multiples. Therefore, in this environment, 
we have remained highly-selective 
buyers and active sellers.
Investment and realisations
We invested £383 million (2006: 
£360 million) in 12 new transactions in 
the year (2006: 14). Investment including 
co-investment funds was £615 million
(2006: £525 million). Although the amount
of investment was ahead of the previous
year, the number of transactions was
marginally lower as we remained highly
selective.
In addition to new investments, £115 million
of further investments were made into the
existing portfolio, which included sizeable
acquisitions made by portfolio companies 
such as Carema.
Realisation activity was also very strong with 
total proceeds of £1,341 million (2006:
£877 million) or £2,089 million including 
co-invested funds (2006: £1,477 million).
Significant realisations during the year
included SR T echnics, NCP Off Street and
Vetco Gray, all businesses which had been
significantly developed, where employment
had grown and which attracted good prices
due to their future growth prospects.
Gross portfolio return
The Buyouts business line generated a gross
portfolio return of £788 million in the year 
to 31 March 2007 (2006: £447 million). 
As can be seen from the chart opposite, this
represented some 54% (2006: 29%) of
opening portfolio value, demonstrating 
the continuing effectiveness of our 
business model.
Realised profits up 159% to £538 million 
were responsible for 68% of gross portfolio
return. The unrealised value movement was
£123 million (2006: £124 million).
Portfolio health
The health of the Buyouts portfolio remains
robust. The realised loss rate on total
investments since the new business model
was introduced in 2001 was 1% as at 
31 March 2007, and the level of provisions
taken for the same period was 4% of total
investment at cost as at 31 March 2007 (2006:
realised loss rate 1%, provision rate 2%).
Fund management
During the year we successfully closed
Eurofund V with 15 billion of commitments,
exceeding our initial target of 13.5 billion. 
The fund attracted 62 Limited Partners,
approximately half of whom are based in
Europe, a third in North America and the
balance in the Middle East and Asia Pacific.
This year saw the final investment made by
the predecessor 13 billion fund, Eurofund IV.
By 31 March 2007, four new investments
had been completed by Eurofund V, which
started investing in January 2007.
The performance of Eurofund IV continues 
to remain strong in comparison to market
benchmarks for funds of a similar vintage. 
At 31 March 2007, Eurofund IV had 
already returned 76% of its drawn
commitments, with a significant 
portfolio value still remaining.
Fund management fees and carried interest
receivable by 3i amounted to £118 million
(2006: £103 million).
A list of current funds, together with details
relating to their size and the size of 
3i’s commitment, can be found on page 38.
Long-term IRRs
We have a target “through the cycle” IRR 
of 20% on each vintage and look to achieve
aggregate money multiples in excess of 
two times the original cost we invest.
Our 2003 vintage has delivered a strong
performance with an IRR of 50% at 
31 March 2007, a large proportion of which
is driven by realised profit. The 2004 and
2005 vintages continue to perform well
(30% and 54% IRRs respectively), with the
strong performance of the 2005 vintage
being driven by exits in the year of Keolis,
Vetco Gray, Damcos, Interflora, Jung
Pumpen, and KBBI.
The 2006 vintage, although still relatively
immature, is already showing strong
performance assisted by the early positive
realisations of NCP Off Street and 
Nordic Modular.

Current trading
Performance in 2006 was better than expected
due to higher net charter income. Market
conditions at the end of 2006 and going into
2007 were favourable with strong demand for 
oil rig transportation particularly for those being
built in Asia. 
Developments since 3i invested
Dockwise was the first investment made by
Eurofund V in January 2007. 3i’s Oil, Gas & Power
sector team is working closely with the Dockwise
management team to implement the business
plan. In April 2007 a successful refinancing of the
business was completed, returning $64m to 3i
and Eurofund V investors (3i: $36m). In May
2007 Dockwise merged with Norwegian OTC
listed Sealift, generating proceeds of $264m for
3i and investors in Eurofund V, who retain a 29.5%
holding in the combined group.

Business review Growth Capital
“An excellent year for the Growth Capital business 
with strong investment, especially in Asia. Our focus 
on continuing to build our capabilities and extend our 
reach has further strengthened our proposition to 
high-growth companies around the world.”
Business model
The Growth Capital business, which has a team
of over 100 investment professionals in
Europe, Asia and the US, targets cash-to-cash
IRR returns of 20% through the cycle. These
returns are achieved through a mix of dividend
and interest income, returns of capital and
capital realisation upon exit. A highly-selective
approach to investment is taken with 20 to
30 minority transactions completed each
year, investing typically 110 million to 
1250 million from 3i’s own balance sheet 
in each situation. The purpose of the
investment may include supporting organic
growth, funding for acquisitions, to resolve
succession issues or simply to reduce gearing.
Another key element of the business model 
is to have a portfolio which is diversified by
region, sector, investment type and size of
business. Aligning interests between 3i and
the majority owners of the company, who
are typically the management, underpins the
delivery of targeted returns.
The Growth Capital business line 
also manages some third-party funds 
which include pre-Eurofund IV buyout
co-investment funds which had a mandate 
to make growth capital investments.
In recognition of the increased significance
and potential of infrastructure as a 
separate asset class, a new business line
“Infrastructure” was established during 
the year. Prior to this, the Growth Capital
business line also managed 3i’s infrastructure
investing activity. Accordingly, whilst all of the
performance data for the year to 31 March
2007 regarding gross portfolio return,
investment and realisations excludes
Infrastructure, comparatives have not been
restated. In addition, long-term performance
IRRs exclude those assets which formed part
of the Infrastructure portfolio at 1 April
2006. Information on the performance of
the new Infrastructure business line can be
found on page 24.

Strategy
Our strategy is to capitalise on 3i’s
competitive advantages in this market which
are principally our track record, experience,
global network and the flexibility afforded to
us by investing from our own balance sheet.
Over the last five years we have increased the
average size of each investment significantly
(2007: £26 million, 2003: £6 million), targeting
larger companies which are more likely to
have international operations or aspirations.
3i’s expansion in Asia and the US has increased
the opportunity to leverage our network,
People Programmes and sector expertise for
the benefit of the companies in which we
invest. For each opportunity, we assemble the
“best team for the job” with the most relevant
geographical, sector and transactional
experience drawn from the global team.

The market in the last year has both grown
and become more competitive. Global market
statistics are somewhat inconsistent but the
general consensus is that the market for
growth capital investments grew by around
20% in terms of value.
Although the mandates of many private
equity funds preclude them from making
minority investments and few competitors
can currently access permanent capital to
fund their investments, competition has
increased in several regions due to new
entrants. These include US growth specialists
entering the European market, hedge funds
starting to take minority positions in private
rather than public companies and mezzanine
funds moving towards private equity as
mainstream banks encroach on their
traditional markets.
In Asia, general economic development has
driven opportunity, especially in consumer-
related sectors. Competition varies from
market to market, with India being the 
most competitive.
Investment and realisations
Our strategy is to accelerate the development
of the business in Asia and to increase 
the average size of investment globally. 
At £258 million (2006: £91 million) Asia
represented 54% of the £482 million 
(2006: £497 million) invested in the year.
Excluding infrastructure investment 
(£89 million) from the 2006 total, 
Growth Capital investment grew by 18%.
The average size of the 21 Growth Capital
investments (2006: 18) made during the
year was £26 million (2006: £21 million),
with the two largest being Singapore-based
ACR Limited at £105 million and Spanish-
based STEN at £78 million. Both of these
investments, together with our two largest
realisations (SeLoger in France and Alimak in
Sweden) and our next largest portfolio
company DIAB, also from Sweden, are
profiled in more detail on pages 18 and 19.
Realisation performance was once again
strong with total realisations of £691 million
(2006: £855 million), delivering realised
profits of £235 million (2006: £232 million).
The majority of proceeds arose from the 
sale of portfolio companies to trade buyers. 
In addition, four companies achieved an 
IPO. The largest of these was SeLoger, a 
£41 million 2005 investment which achieved a
listing on the Paris Stock Exchange in December
2006 since when 3i has realised £98 million.
Gross portfolio return
The Growth Capital business line generated a
gross portfolio return of £569 million in the
year to 31 March 2007 (2006: £341 million).
As can be seen from the chart opposite, this
represents a return of 48% (2006: 26%) on
opening portfolio value.
Realised profits, which were up 1% to 
£235 million, produced 41% of gross portfolio
return. The unrealised value movement of
£269 million (2006: £60 million) included
£129 million of uplifts to imminent sale on
assets, of which £60 million has been realised
since the year end.
Post 2002 vintages have performed
particularly strongly, contributing 57% 
of gross portfolio return in the period,
demonstrating the effectiveness of our
business model.
Portfolio health
A favourable macroeconomic environment, 
the focus on a smaller number of higher-
value investments, together with a global
approach to assessing opportunities and
more international deal and portfolio
management teams, have led to a significant
reduction in the level of portfolio write-
downs over the last two years. Provisions of
£1 million were made in the year, the 
lowest level for a number of years. As at
31 March 2007, 92% of our investments
were classified as healthy, against a three year
rolling average of 81% (2006: 84%, and 74%).
Long-term IRRs
The long-term vintage IRRs from this business
line have been above target in recent years
and the younger vintages, which are of
greater size, are already showing encouraging
signs. Indeed, returns from the investments
made in the year to 31 March 2006 have
already achieved a 35% return, ahead of our
expectations at this stage in the evolution of
the vintage.
Management
In November 2006 we announced that 
Guy Zarzavatdjian would succeed Michael

Business review V enture Capital
“A challenging year for V enture Capital returns but a 
year in which we strengthened our team and achieved 
the necessary changes to become more focused on 
late-stage investing.”
Business model
The Venture Capital business targets 
cash-to-cash IRR returns of 25% through 
the cycle.
With an early and late-stage technology
focus, our Venture Capital team of 47
investment professionals works as a global
team across six offices in Europe and the 
US. Returns, which are achieved principally
through realisations, have a higher volatility
than the Group’s other business lines. 
The purpose of the investment is usually to
move a technology business from an early 
or development stage through to revenue
and profit.
A highly-selective approach is taken with
around 20 new investments made each year 
of between 12 million and 150 million in
companies new to the portfolio.
Our value proposition is based on the scale 
of 3i’s network of relationships within and
outside the venture industry, the proactive
involvement of 3i’s investment team, the
ability to provide multiple investments and our
deep knowledge of core technology sectors.
As can be seen from the Financial
performance table, the majority of Venture
Capital investment is made directly from 3i’s
balance sheet. We also manage third-party
funds of £15 million in Asia.
Strategy
By operating as a single team, 3i’s
international reach, which is fundamental 
to our value proposition to entrepreneurs 
and syndicate investors, is delivered to
highly-specialised segments of the
technology industry.

Report and accounts 2007 21
Directors’ report Directors’ remuneration report Auditors’ report Financial statements Additional financial information Information for shareholders
Activity has been focused on early (30%) and
late (70%) stage investment in healthcare, 
IT and cleantech. Our preference is to lead or
co-lead investments, and invest in companies
with significant growth potential, disruptive
technologies and strong management. 
We select opportunities where we can create
and realise significant value, take board seats
and achieve exits via trade sale or IPO.
This strategy is now working well in the US
where our scale and international offering
appeals to more mature venture businesses. 
Reflecting the increased focus on later-stage
investing, we changed our resourcing mix
during the year. In the US we recruited Jim
McLean, who has almost two decades of
venture capital experience, to run our
business there. We also consolidated our 
US team in Silicon Valley and made plans to
close our Waltham office.
Marketplace
According to reports from Ernst & Young and
Dow Jones VentureOne, European venture
capital investment at14.1 billion and the
number of venture IPOs (90) in 2006 
were at their highest since 2002 and 
2000 respectively.
In the US, the equivalent report stated that 
US venture capital investment in 2006
increased by 8% to $26 billion. Fifty six
venture IPOs were completed raising 
$3.7 billion, an increase of 33% and 64% 
on 2005 respectively.
Despite the increased amount of investment
in both the US and Europe, the actual number
of deals dropped 27% in Europe and was 
only slightly ahead in the US, when compared
with 2005.
Corporate acquisitions of venture-backed
companies in Europe decreased by 12% with
185 acquisitions made, and in the US the
number and value of acquisitions were flat.
The competitive landscape is changing with
fewer but larger funds being raised in both
Europe and the US. This more selective
environment is reflected in the US as the
number of active venture capital firms there
continues to shrink with many firms not
raising new funds. 
The main quoted technology indices,
NASDAQ and techMARK, rose 3.5% and
7.9% respectively during the year.
Gross portfolio return
Due to a weaker market for realisations and
reduced share prices of several quoted assets
in the Venture Capital portfolio, both realised
and unrealised profits were lower than last
year. As a consequence we delivered a
negative return of £(46) million, which
represented (6)% on the opening portfolio.
The unrealised loss on the quoted part of the
Venture Capital portfolio was £(64) million in
total and, although spread over a number of
assets, the fall in the share price of Vonage
was most significant. Vonage, a US asset in
which 3i first invested in 2004, accounted 
for £49 million of the unrealised value loss in
the year. 
Net realised profits of £12 million (2006: 
£72 million) resulted from a number of
smaller disposals as we continued to focus
the portfolio.
Our performance for the year at the 
gross portfolio return level was therefore
disappointing despite the modest recovery 
in the second six months of the year.
Investment and realisations
In line with our strategy, the increase in 
later-stage investments resulted in total
investment of £200 million (2006: 
£156 million) during the year of which 46%
was in the US and 40% was in the UK.
A total of £123 million (2006: £64 million)
was invested in 20 companies which were
new to the portfolio. Late-stage investment
accounted for 65% (2006: 44%) of total
investment. The average size of a late-stage
investment during the year was £13 million.
This investment included £1 million of a 
£5 million total commitment in DT Capital
Partners fund in China to provide a window
on this rapidly-growing venture market.
There were a total of 35 realisations during
the year delivering proceeds of £187 million
and realised profits of £12 million. Five
companies from the portfolio achieved 
IPOs: Vonage; Eleksen; Newron; Santhera; 
and Omniture.
The case studies on pages 22 and 23 include
the most valuable exit of the year, Domantis,
from the 2004 vintage.
Portfolio health
Portfolio health is more volatile in Venture
Capital than 3i’s other business lines but 
at 31 March 2007, 69% of the portfolio
companies were classified as healthy, 
against a three year rolling average of 67%
(2006: 67% and 65%).
Long-term IRRs
The significant changes that we have made
to the venture business in the last two years
are having a positive influence on earlier
vintages but the main effects will be seen
from the 2006 vintage and in subsequent
years. Currently the 2007 vintage is showing
a small negative IRR of (2)%, in line with
expectation at this stage in the vintage’s 
life cycle.

Business review Infr astructur e
“Our first year as a distinct business line has seen 
the successful launch of 3i Infrastructure Limited, and 
our reach extended in continental Europe, Asia and the 
US. T ogether, these initiatives made for a good year and 
provide a strong base from which to build future asset 
growth in this rapidly-expanding market.”
Business model
Building on 3i’s experience of making
infrastructure investments for over 
20 years, the Group established a distinct
Infrastructure business line during the year.
Infrastructure assets and returns had
previously been reported as a part of the
Growth Capital business line.
The objective was to facilitate the expansion
of 3i’s business in this rapidly-growing 
market internationally and also to prepare 
for the launch of a listed investment vehicle,
3i Infrastructure Limited, which is advised
exclusively by 3i and in which 3i Group plc
has a 46.4% stake.
The business model for the Infrastructure
business line is to achieve a blended return
through a combination of returns earned 
on assets (invested either directly by 3i or
indirectly through 3i Infrastructure Limited)
and advisory and performance fees earned
from advising external funds such as 
3i Infrastructure Limited.
An annual advisory fee paid by 3i Infrastructure
Limited to 3i is based on the fair value of 3i
Infrastructure Limited’s investments at 1.5%
for investments when initially acquired,
reducing to 1.25% for investments held for
longer than five years. A performance fee of
20% is earned by 3i on the total return above
an 8% performance hurdle at the end of a
financial period.
Strategy
A dedicated international team of 14
investment professionals has a geographical
focus on Europe, Asia and the US through
four hubs: London; Frankfurt; Mumbai; 
and New York. These investors target three
main sub sectors: social infrastructure 
(eg PFI projects, hospitals, education, and
government accommodation); utilities 
(eg water, gas, electricity distribution); and
transportation (eg roads, airports, ports, 
rail and ferry operations).
An example in the utilities sector was 
the £251 million AWG investment. 
Anglian Water, AWG’s principal business, 
is the fourth largest Ofwat regulated 
water and waste-water company, 
with 4.2 million water and 5.4 million 
waste-water customers.
Marketplace
Infrastructure businesses tend to be asset-
intensive businesses providing essential 
public services over the long term, often 
on a regulated basis or with a significant
component of revenue and costs that are
subject to long-term contracts.
There is a substantial market opportunity 
for new and replacement infrastructure in
developing and more mature economies.
Increasing recognition by governments of the
value that the private sector can bring to
infrastructure has also grown demand.
The combination of these factors has
resulted in a significantly growing asset class.
3i Infrastructure Limited
3i Infrastructure Limited listed on 13 March
2007 with a market capitalisation of 
£700 million. 3i’s infrastructure investments
in Europe and the US are now made mainly
through the 3i Infrastructure listed company.
3i’ s initial investment in 3i Infrastructure Limited
was provided by transferring four seed assets
with a value of £234 million and investing 
£91 million in cash. Three assets, Alpha Schools,
Octagon Holdings and Infrastructure Investors
(I
2
), were transferred in full (£94 million). 
Osprey (AWG) was transferred in part 
(£140 million) with the balance (£111 million)
remaining on the 3i balance sheet, as 3i
Infrastructure Limited is not permitted to hold
more than 20% of its portfolio cost in any
individual asset.
The board of 3i Infrastructure Limited, 
which is chaired by Peter Sedgwick, a former
member of the management committee of
the European Investment Bank, comprises
four independent non-executive directors. 
A fifth non-executive director is Paul Waller, 
a member of 3i’s Management Committee. 
At 31 March 2007, 3i’s 46.4% shareholding,
including associated warrants, in 3i
Infrastructure Limited was valued at 
£334 million.
3i Infrastructure Limited is expected to publish
its first interim results in November 2007.
Gross portfolio return
The Infrastructure business line generated 
a gross portfolio return of 16% on opening
portfolio value in the year to 31 March
2007. Of the return, £12 million relates to
the transfer of assets to 3i Infrastructure
Limited and income yield on the portfolio. 
A further £8.6 million unrealised profit was
generated from the increase in 
3i Infrastructure Limited’s share price and
associated warrants since flotation.
Investment and realisations
During the year, the Infrastructure team
made new investments of £251 million 
in Osprey (AWG) and £6 million in T2C. 
In addition, further drawdowns of £32 million
were made by I
2
and Alma Mater to fund the
purchase of new assets in those funds. 
The only disposals made were transfers of
assets to 3i Infrastructure Limited and proceeds
from a partial realisation in the Alma Mater fund.
Portfolio
In addition to the £334 million value of 
3i’s holding in 3i Infrastructure Limited 
at 31 March 2007, the Group continues to
hold direct investment in four assets not
transferred to 3i Infrastructure Limited with 
a value of £135 million, the largest of these
being the retained holding in Osprey (AWG)
with a value of £111 million.

d Business review Quoted Private Equity (“QPE”)
“The potential market for QPE’ s offering is very
significant and we will take a highly-selective approach,
creating value with the management teams of these
companies through 3i’ s private equity skill base, 
network and resources.”
3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 25
Directors’ report Directors’ remuneration report Auditors’ report Financial statements Additional financial information Information for shareholders
Business model
This new business line was established to
address a significant market opportunity to
provide equity finance and added value to
small and mid-cap quoted companies in
Europe. The QPE team will aim to deliver
private equity value creation techniques to
public companies without taking them
private. A number of small and mid-cap
quoted companies in Europe suffer from a
lack of strategic focus or direction; are
typically relatively under-researched by the
capital markets; and frequently suffer from
relatively limited liquidity in their shares, in
some cases exacerbated by shareholders with
significant holdings who may be sellers. We
believe that the operating performance of
many such companies could be significantly
improved by applying private equity
techniques.
QPE will acquire influential stakes in selected
companies and will have flexibility in the size
of its equity investment. We will aim to avoid
competing on price with traditional buyout
funds or other buyers seeking 100%
ownership. As portfolio companies will remain
listed, existing investors will have a choice 
of whether to sell to QPE or to remain
invested, sharing in the value which may 
be created by enhancing the investee
companies’ operational performance.
QPE’s business model is differentiated from
typical buyout funds which generally require
total ownership as a condition of any offer 
for a public company; are typically restricted
in the planned holding period for any
investment; and are generally required to pay
a significant premium over current trading
prices in order to secure full control.
Strategy
The initial geographic focus of QPE’s activity is
in Europe and QPE will use 3i’s sector resources
and geographic deal origination network to
build a view of each relevant sector and
identify potential investment candidates.
Investments will only be made on the basis 
of a strategic plan for each situation, which
will include some or all of the following key
elements:
– Governance – the strengthening of boards
and executive management to ensure a
direct connection between shareholders’
interests and the operational delivery 
of performance;
– Management and incentives – the
enhancement of management capabilities
together with the introduction or
strengthening of incentive structures
designed to drive sustained growth in
shareholder value;
– Value creation plan – the rigorous
construction of strategic, operational and
financial objectives set out over a clear
timeline, starting with a “100-day” plan and
transitioning into monthly performance
milestones; and 
– Active ownership – the strategic and
practical input required to drive earnings
growth and accelerate enhanced shareholder
value, which may include identifying
opportunities for acquisitions or disposals 
by the investee company.
3i’s track record, network, People
Programmes, sector resources and private
equity skill base mean that this should 
be a compelling offering to many public
companies. QPE will also seek to provide
further value by appointing at least one 
of its Partners to the board.
Marketplace
Research undertaken by 3i has identified
approximately 2,300 companies with 
market capitalisation between 1100 million
and 12 billion quoted on major European
exchanges. This research has also highlighted
that in 2006 there were approximately 
25 public-to-private transactions of all sizes
involving private equity funds on these
exchanges. Therefore, the potential market
for QPE’s offering, which is differentiated
from either an “activist fund” or “Public-to-
Private” approach, is very significant.
However, QPE will take a highly-selective
approach to this opportunity and aims to
invest in only eight to 12 situations during 
its first two years.

Business review Risk management
3i has a risk management framework which provides 
a structured and consistent process for identifying,
assessing and responding to risks in relation to the
Group’ s strategy and business objectives.
Introduction  
Risk management operates at all levels throughout the Group, across business lines, geographies and professional functions. The Board is
ultimately responsible for risk management, which includes the Group’s risk governance structure and maintaining an appropriate internal
control framework. Management’s responsibility is to manage risk on behalf of the Board.
By reporting regularly to Audit and Compliance Committee, the Group’s Compliance and Risk Assurance and Audit functions provide support to
the Board in maintaining the effectiveness of risk management across the Group. Following a review of the Group’s risk management processes
in the year, a new monitoring framework was implemented, with a number of new committees providing input to Group Risk Management
Committee. This became operational in March 2007 and formalised many existing practices. The diagram below shows this risk management
framework and outlines the key responsibilities of each committee.

Business review Risk management continued
External risks 
Macroeconomic risks
3i invests mainly in European companies and
continues to develop its operations in Asia
and the US. The performance of the Group’s
underlying investment portfolio is influenced
by economic growth, interest rates, currency
movements and changes in commodity and
energy prices. Market conditions for initial
public offerings, the level of mergers and
acquisitions activity, the number of active
trade or other private equity buyers, and the
availability of well-priced debt finance, all
have an impact, not only on the Group’s
ability to invest but on the Group’s ability to
exit from its underlying portfolio, or on the
levels of profitability achieved on exit.
T o mitigate this, 3i aims to invest over time in
a range of sectors, with different economic
cycles, across its different business lines and
geographical markets. This includes expansion
in both the US and in Asia, which further
diversifies the portfolio. 
Geopolitical risk
Part of the Group’s investment strategy is 
to invest in new and emerging markets. 
The legal, regulatory and capital frameworks
in these markets may be less developed than
in the other main geographical markets in
which the Group operates. Changes and
developments in all our markets are
monitored closely to ensure that any 
impact on the value of existing investments,
planned levels of investment or investment
returns are, as far as possible, anticipated,
understood and acted upon. This work
includes periodic legal and regulatory updates
by geography, in-depth market and sector
research and regular reviews for existing
investments. Entry into new geographical
markets is subject to extensive market
research and due diligence.
Government policy and regulation
3i Investments plc, a wholly owned subsidiary
of 3i, is an authorised person under the
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000 
and regulated by the FSA in the United
Kingdom. Where applicable, certain 3i Group
subsidiaries’ businesses outside the United
Kingdom are regulated locally by relevant
authorities. Changes to the regulatory
frameworks under which the Group 
operates are closely monitored. There are 
also appropriate processes and procedures 
in place, including a dedicated Group
Compliance function, whose remit is to
minimise the risk of a breach of applicable
regulations which could affect the Group’s
compliance costs, its business, results of
operations or financial position.  
3i carries on business as an investment 
trust under section 842 of the Income 
and Corporation T axes Act 1988.
Continuation of this status is subject to the
Company directing its affairs in line with 
the relevant requirements of the legislation.
Anticipated and actual changes in
government policy and related tax treatment
of investment trusts are closely monitored, 
as are other changes which could affect
results of operations or financial position.
Related risks exist in other jurisdictions in
which the Group operates, where there is
similar close monitoring of changes in local
taxation legislation which could affect the
expected tax position of the Group. 
Strategic risks
The Group’s strategy is based on a full
analysis of its operating environment. 
In determining the appropriate business
model, market and sector evaluations 
are taken into account, as well as the
identification and assessment of external and
internal risk factors. Significant unexpected
changes or outcomes, beyond those factored
into the Group’s strategy and business model,
may occur which could have an impact on
the Group’s performance or financial position.
This is addressed through the monitoring 
of a range of key performance indicators,
forecasts and periodic updates of plans and
underlying assumptions.  3i Group plc

Investment risks  
Investment decisions
The Group operates in a very competitive
market. Changes in the number of market
participants, the availability of funds within
the market, the pricing of assets, or in the
ability to access deals on a proprietary basis
could have a significant effect on the Group’s
competitive position and on the sustainability
of returns. 
The ability of the Group to source and
execute good quality investments in such
markets is dependent upon a range of
factors. The most important of these include:
(i) the ability to attract and develop people
with the requisite investment experience 
and cultural fit; (ii) organisation of teams
whose structure is market-adapted and
whose compensation is results-oriented; 
and (iii) effective application of collective
knowledge and relationships to each
investment opportunity. 
3i’s investment appraisal is undertaken in a
rigorous manner. This includes approval by
the relevant business line partnerships, and
where appropriate, peer review by executives
from other business lines, together with 3i’s
international network of industry and sector
specialists. Investments over £5 million are
presented to an Investment Committee
chaired by an authorised member of the
Management Committee and comprising our
senior investment executives.
Investment performance
The performance of the Group’s portfolio 
is dependent upon a range of factors. 
These include, but are not limited to: (i) the
quality of the initial investment decision
described above; (ii) the ability of the
portfolio company to execute successfully its
business strategy; and (iii) actual outcomes
against the key assumptions underlying the
portfolio company’s financial projections. 
Any one of these factors could have an
impact on the valuation of a portfolio
company and upon the Group’s ability to
make a profitable exit from the investment
within the desired timeframe. 
A rigorous process is put in place for
managing the relationship with each 
investee company for the period through to
realisation. This includes regular asset reviews
and, in many cases, board representation by a
3i investment executive.
Investment concentration
The Group invests across a range of
economic sectors and geographies. 
Over-exposure to a particular sector or
geography could increase the impact of
adverse changes in macroeconomic or
market conditions on the Group. An increase
in the average size of investments over time
could also increase the exposure of the Group
to the performance of a small number of
large investments, albeit in different sectors
and/or geographies.
The portfolio is subject to periodic reviews 
at both the business line and Group levels to
monitor exposure to any one sector or
geography and to monitor the exposure to
larger investments. 
Investment valuations 
and exit opportunities
The valuation of 3i’s unquoted portfolio 
and opportunities for realisation depend to
some extent on stock market conditions 
and the buoyancy of the wider mergers and
acquisitions market. Changes in market or
macroeconomic conditions, could impact the
valuation of portfolio assets and the ability to
exit those investments profitably within the
desired timeframe.  3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 30
Business review Risk management continued
Treasury and funding risks  
3i’s funding objective is that each category 
of investment asset is broadly matched with
liabilities and shareholders’ funds according to
the risk and maturity characteristics of the
assets, and that funding needs are met ahead
of planned investment.
Credit risk 
3i’s financial assets are predominantly
unsecured investments in unquoted
companies. The Group considers the
maximum credit risk to be the carrying value
of the asset. An increase in concentration 
of the portfolio in a particular sector 
or geography could increase credit risk. 
Likewise large or unexpected increases 
in interest rates could increase credit 
risk, particularly in companies which are 
highly leveraged. 
The portfolio is well diversified and, for 
this reason, credit risk exposure is managed
on an asset-specific basis by individual
investment managers. 
The Group’s remaining financial assets 
are mainly in the form of deposits 
with banks of a credit rating of AA or 
better. Counterparty limits are set and 
closely monitored. 
Liquidity risk 
The Group invests from its own balance
sheet using cash generated from its investing
activities and its core funding. The Group 
also has available to it undrawn committed
facilities. In addition to funding from its own
balance sheet, the Group periodically raises
third-party funds to co-invest in mid-market
buyout transactions. It also invests indirectly
through funds administered by third parties,
or quoted investment vehicles. 
Unexpected changes in the levels of
investment and divestment activities or in
interest rates could impact the availability 
of funds required for investment needs or 
to meet obligations as they fall due. 
T o address this, a range of cash flow
forecasts are produced and updated on a
regular basis for each business line and for
the Group as a whole. The Board reviews the
Group’s financial resources every six months.
This includes consideration of the currency
hedging and maturity profile aspects, as 
well as liquidity, of the Group’s current and
forecast financial position. 
Price risk 
The valuation of unquoted investments
depends upon a combination of market
factors and the performance of the
underlying asset. The Group does not
currently hedge the market risk inherent 
in the portfolio but manages asset
performance risk on an asset specific 
basis, as described earlier.
Foreign exchange risk 
3i reports in sterling and pays dividends from
its sterling profits. The Group seeks to reduce
structural currency exposures by matching
assets denominated in foreign currency with
borrowings in the same currency. The Group
makes some use of derivative financial
instruments to effect foreign exchange
management. The current policy is to hedge
the main currency exposures in the range 
of 90%–100%.
Interest rate risk
3i has a mixture of fixed and floating-rate
assets. The assets are funded with 
a combination of shareholders’ funds 
and borrowings according to the risk
characteristics of the assets. The Board 
seeks to minimise interest rate exposure 
by considering the average life profile of 
the various asset classes and adopting a
portfolio approach to the interest rate
hedging structure. Some derivative 
financial instruments are used to achieve 
this objective. 3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 31
Directors’ report Directors’ remuneration report Auditors’ report Financial statements Additional financial information Information for shareholders
Operational risks  
The Group is exposed to a range of
operational risks which can arise from
inadequate or failed processes, people and
systems or from external factors affecting
these. These include operational events 
such as human resources risks, legal and
regulatory risks, information technology
systems failures, business disruption 
and shortcomings in internal controls. 
Line management at all levels is responsible
for identifying, assessing, controlling and
reporting operational risks. This is supported
by a framework of core values, standards 
and controls, a code of business conduct 
and delegated authorities. There is also an
independent internal audit function which
carries out periodic reviews.
People
The ability to recruit, develop and retain
capable people is of fundamental importance
to achieving the Group’s strategy. The Group
operates in a competitive industry and aims
to remunerate staff in line with market
practice and to provide superior development
opportunities. The Group has human
resources policies and procedures covering
recruitment, vetting and performance
management, and appropriate processes 
in place to monitor their application. 
Staff engagement is also regularly 
evaluated and reported to the Board.
Business processes
The Group’s information technology and
treasury systems, as well as its business
processes and procedures, support its
operations and business performance. 
The Group has policies and procedures
covering information security, change
management, business continuity and
disaster recovery. These are subject to
periodic testing.
Legal and regulatory
In order to conform to necessary legal and
regulatory requirements across multiple
jurisdictions, the Group operates a complex
legal and corporate structure. This requires
appropriate internal processes and
procedures to be developed and followed,
supported by professional teams with
appropriate skills, drawing upon external
resources where appropriate. There is also 
a Legal and Regulatory Risk Forum which
meets at least four times a year to review
and plan for forthcoming legal and regulatory
changes which could impact the Group. 3i Group plc

Business review Financial review
This review provides detailed information on our
financial performance for the year and the financial
position at the year end.
Investment
A total of £1,576 million was invested 
from our balance sheet during the year 
in 62 new assets, including the £91 million 
cash investment in 3i Infrastructure 
Limited (2006: £1,110 million, 58 new
assets). Buyouts accounted for 32% of 
this total investment; Growth Capital 31%;
Infrastructure 24%; and Venture Capital 
13%. Investment made on behalf of
co-investment funds, principally in Buyouts, 
was £290 million (2006: £212 million).
This represents a year-on-year increase of
42% in investment and followed an increase
in the average size of new investment for the
year to £26 million (2006: £15 million). 
The two largest new investments for each of
Buyouts, Growth Capital and Venture Capital
are profiled on pages 14, 18 and 22.
The increase also reflects, in line with 
our strategy, the significant growth 
of investment in Asia, which included
transactions in China, India and Singapore,
totalling £259 million (2006: £91 million).
The significant rise in investment in the UK
included the £251 million investment in
AWG. US Venture Capital investment,
principally in later-stage situations, also grew
by 31% and accounted for 6% of total Group
investment in the year. 
The Group invested a further £77 million in
private equity funds of which £26 million was
in new funds (Ithmar Capital L.L.C., Korea
Global Fund L.P., D T Capital Partners, Indiareit
Offshore Fund and the SVG Strategic
Recovery Fund II). Commitments to these
five new funds totalled £81 million.

Realisations 
The ability to capitalise on continued
favourable market conditions throughout 
this year gave rise to realisation proceeds 
of £2,438 million (2006: £2,207 million).
Once again, this represented a high level of
portfolio activity resulting in some 39% of the
total opening portfolio value being realised in
the year (2006: 38%). Europe continued to
represent the majority of realisations, with the
continental European portfolio contributing
£1,159 million (2006: £891 million), and the
UK £1,169 million (2006: £1,173 million).
Realisations from the portfolio in Asia of 
£54 million came principally from Chinese
investments. 
The nature of realisations followed a broadly
similar pattern to last year with 37% of
proceeds arising from trade sales (2006:
31%) and 8% through refinancing portfolio
businesses (2006: 8%). Sales to other private
equity firms, so-called “secondaries”,
amounted to £651 million (2006: 
£404 million). T en portfolio companies
achieved an IPO during the year and
realisations from these and other quoted
portfolio companies amounted to 
£240 million (2006: £372 million).
The SMI portfolio delivered realisations 
of £214 million from 233 investments 
(2006: £268 million, 278 investments).
Consistent with our strategy, this portfolio,
which is now valued at £391 million, has
been reduced from 1,079 companies as at
31 March 2004 to 293 at 31 March 2007,
realising £916 million in the process.

Returns
T otal return
3i achieved a total return for the year ended
31 March 2007 of £1,075 million (2006:
£831 million), which equates to a 26.8%
return on opening shareholders’ funds (2006:
22.5%). This was a very strong result for the
year, the most significant component of
which was realised profits of £830 million
(2006: £576 million).
Gross portfolio return at £1,406 million
(2006: £1,053 million) for the year
represented 34.0% on opening portfolio 
value (2006: 24.4%), of which more than
80% was crystallized in the form of realised
profits, interest and dividends, and unrealised
profits on uplifts to sale in respect of assets
sold shortly after the end of the financial year.
After adding carried interest receivable 
and external fees and deducting carried
interest payable and operating expenses, 
the net portfolio return for the year was
£1,127 million (2006: £881 million)

Realised profits
The high level of realisations was also
accompanied by a significant increase in 
the level of uplift achieved on sale of 52%
(2006: 35%), resulting in realised profits 
of £830 million (2006: £576 million). 
This exceptional rate of uplift is in part
attributable to a small number of high-value
realisations being sold, some still valued at
original investment cost. The most significant
of which was the partial disposal of NCP,
described in more detail on page 15.
Realised profits are stated net of write-offs 
of £27 million (2006: £66 million).
Unrealised value movement
The unrealised profit on revaluation of
investments was £323 million (2006: 
£245 million). £139 million of this
movement arises from revaluations due 
to imminent sales (2006: £97 million),
including Smart & Cook and Clínica Baviera.
A further £142 million (2006: £70 million)
is attributable to first time uplifts from cost,
particularly in relation to the Buyouts
portfolio. Assets valued on an earnings basis
at the beginning and end of the financial year
also showed an increase of £147 million
(2006: £136 million). Offset against these
positive movements was a net decrease 
in the value of the quoted portfolio of 
£(37) million, principally due to share price
movements in the Venture Capital
investments Vonage and CSR plc.
Portfolio income
Portfolio income of £253 million (2006:
£232 million) includes £158 million (2006:
£133 million) of interest and £81 million
(2006: £75 million) of dividends, as well 
as £14 million (2006: £24 million) of net
deal-related fees.
The increase in interest income results from a
number of high-yielding Buyout investments
made in the year together with some early
redemption premiums related to the strong
realisations in the year. Dividends benefited
from some significant distributions from our
investments in unquoted funds. Lower levels
of negotiation fee income together with
increasing deal-related fee costs, underlie the
reduction in net fee income. 3i Group plc

Fees receivable from external funds
Following the successful launch of 
Eurofund V, fees receivable from our
managed funds have increased substantially
in the year to £37 million (2006: 
£24 million).
Net carried interest
Carried interest aligns the incentivisation of
3i’s investment staff and the management
teams in 3i’s portfolio with the interests
of 3i’s shareholders and fund investors. 
3i receives carried interest from the 
co-investment funds managed by 3i
Investments plc, and pays carried interest 
to investment staff based on the
performance of its assets under
management. An explanation of carried
interest is provided on pages 110 to 
111, together with a description of our
accounting methodology.
Carried interest receivable of £81 million
(2006: £79 million) relates primarily to two
managed funds, Eurofund III and Eurofund IV,
which account for 80% of the accrued
income. Investments in these funds have
performed particularly strongly in the period
and the Group has accrued its entitlement to
carried interest based on the realised profits
generated in the funds and the fair value 
of unrealised assets at 31 March 2007.

A
Gross portfolio return
In aggregate, realised profits, unrealised value
growth and portfolio income gave 
rise to a total gross portfolio return for 2007
of £1,406 million (2006: £1,053 million). 
From a business line perspective, Buyouts
and Growth Capital were the main
contributors, delivering gross portfolio
returns of 54% (2006: 29%) and 48%
(2006: 26%) respectively. For both business
lines, these returns were above our across-
the-cycle expectations, and reflect
favourable market conditions for realisations,
good portfolio health and earnings growth. 
In contrast, despite a stronger second half of
the year, the Venture Capital business line
generated a negative gross portfolio return of
(6)% (2006: 17% positive). This was largely
a consequence of adverse movements in the
value of its quoted portfolio, but also due to a
less advantageous realisations market. 
The new Infrastructure business line
contributed £15 million to gross portfolio
return as a result of income yield on the
portfolio, profit on the transfer of assets to 
3i Infrastructure Limited and a subsequent
rise in the share price of 3i Infrastructure
Limited (and its associated warrants) 
since flotation. 
The SMI portfolio generated a positive 
gross portfolio return of £74 million (2006:
£137 million) representing 13% (2006:
18%) of opening portfolio value.

In the prior year, most of the carry receivable
related to Eurofund III, which achieved its
performance hurdle in that year.
There has been a substantial increase in
carried interest payable to investment staff in
the year. The Group has accrued £142 million
of carried interest payable across all its
business lines, based on the realised profits
generated by assets in carry schemes and the
closing value of assets that remain unrealised
(2006: £64 million). The increase is due to
the strong gross portfolio return in Buyouts
and Growth Capital in the financial year, and
the high proportion of realisations being
made from the most recent vintages, all of
which are in market-aligned carried interest
schemes with typically higher carry rates
than earlier vintages. Of the £142 million
charge in the year, 63% relates to Buyouts
and 35% to Growth Capital.
Costs 
Operating expenses totalled £255 million
(2006: £211 million). Approximately one-
third of the £44 million increase in costs
relates to expenses associated with
implementing new strategic initiatives such as
the establishment of the two new business
lines (Infrastructure and QPE), continued
development in Asia and the US, as well as
the move of our office in London. In addition,
the exceptional level of total return has
generated correspondingly higher levels of
performance payment to employees.
We have continued to reshape our regional
network with new offices added in Beijing
and New York, the closure of four smaller
regional offices in Europe and the decision 
to focus our US venture activity in Silicon
Valley and to close our office in Waltham,
Massachusetts. Restructuring costs in the
year for these changes totalled £8 million. 
Net operating expenses for the year (after
offsetting fee income from external funds)
are 5.3% of opening portfolio value. 
With effect from 1 April 2007 we are
adopting a further key performance measure
to monitor cost efficiency. We expect this
measure to reduce to around 4.5% in the
next two to three years, with a long-term
target of 3%.
Net interest payable for the year was 
£9 million (2006: £17 million), reflecting the
low level of net borrowings maintained
throughout the year. 
Other movements
The two largest “other” movements in the
year relate to Exchange movements and the
movements in the fair value of derivatives. 
The movements in the fair value of
derivatives relate largely to the valuation 
of the equity derivative embedded in the
€550 million 2008 Convertible Bond. 
This unrealised value movement accounted
for a gross charge of £(62) million in this
category. It is the product of a number of
factors, the most significant of which was the
Company’s share price which rose 21%
during the year to 1136p (2006: 941p).
Offsetting this movement were net
movements on interest-rate swaps used to
hedge the portfolio. A number of these
swaps were closed out profitably during the
period to reflect changes in the proportion of
the sterling portfolio.
Exchange movements of £(31) million
(2006: £47 million) arose as a result of the
weakening of both the US dollar and the Euro
during the year.
Portfolio and assets 
under management
Assets under management
At 31 March 2007 assets under
management totalled £7,134 million 
(2006: £5,712 million). This comprised
£4,362 million of portfolio assets 
owned directly (2006: £4,139 million), 
co-investment funds of £2,387 million
(2006: £1,573 million) and external quoted
investment companies of £385 million
(2006: nil).
The main contributors to this 25% growth 
in assets under management were the 
closing of 3i’s latest mid-market buyout 
fund, Eurofund V, in November 2006 at 
€5 billion and the £700 million launch of 
3i Infrastructure Limited on the London 
Stock Exchange in March 2007. 
3i Group’s commitment to Eurofund V is
€2,780 million and the Group’s investment 
in 3i Infrastructure Limited was valued at
£334 million at 31 March 2007. 
Portfolio assets directly 
owned by the Group
The value of the portfolio at 31 March 2007
was £4,362 million (2006: £4,139 million).
In line with our strategy, the number of
companies in the portfolio was reduced
further during the year. At 31 March 2007
there were 762 companies in the portfolio
compared with 1,087 at the start of the year
and 1,878 just three years ago. The SMI
programme again made another significant
contribution to this reduction with 233 exits
during the year. This reduction, combined
with higher realisations in other business lines,
means that more than two-thirds of the
portfolio is now less than three years old, 
and 36% is less than one year old. 3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 38
Business review Financial review continued
The portfolio is well diversified by business
line. The high level of realisations in the
Buyouts business has resulted in the value of
the Buyouts portfolio falling by 13% despite
increasing investment by 10%. This has
increased the proportion of the Buyout
portfolio held for less than three years from
64% to 83%.
Excluding Infrastructure investment 
(£89 million) from the 2006 total, Growth
Capital investment grew by 18% in the year,
and the proportion of the portfolio
represented by Growth Capital increased
to 33%. During the year, £234 million 
of portfolio assets were transferred to 
3i Infrastructure Limited, £92 million of
which was included in Growth Capital as 
at 31 March 2006.
Geographically, significant growth in
investment in Asia led to an increase in the
proportion of the portfolio value in that
region, rising from 4% to 9% during the year.
The continental European portfolio now
represents 43% (2006: 46%) of total value
with the UK representing 41% (2006: 42%)
and the US portfolio 6% (2006: 7%). 
The Group also increased its investment in
private equity funds . As a consequence, the
value of this portfolio of investments at 
31 March 2007 was £64 million (2006:
£25 million). These investments are included
within the respective business line totals in
table 6 and geographies in table 7.
Assets managed and advised by 3i
These assets principally relate to Buyouts,
where there are three current funds in
operation, and to Infrastructure, where 
our investment in 3i Infrastructure Limited
includes the provision of advisory services 
to the company on an exclusive basis.

Balance sheet
Capital structure and gearing
3i’s capital structure comprises a combination
of shareholders’ funds, long-term borrowing,
short-term borrowing and liquid treasury
assets and cash. The Board is committed to
achieving capital efficiency for the Group and
remains of the view that a gearing ratio of
debt to shareholders’ funds of between 30%
and 40% is appropriate across the cycle given
both the current profile of the business and
its plans for development. 
During the year, £774 million was returned
to shareholders by way of the B share
arrangements (£700 million) and an 
on-market share buy-back programme 
(£74 million), as approved by shareholders at
an Extraordinary General Meeting and the
Annual General Meeting in July 2006.
Despite a 42% increase in investment,
repurchases of B shares amounting to 
£689 million and the aforementioned 
buy-backs of ordinary shares, the Group
ended the year ungeared (0%), with a net
cash balance of £1 million (2006: 1% geared,
equating to net borrowings of £56 million).
At 31 March 2007 there were B shares
outstanding at an issued value of £11 million.
On 29 March 2007, the Board announced 
its intention to return a further £800 million
to shareholders by means of a bonus issue 
of listed preference shares and approval for
this issue will be sought at an Extraordinary
General Meeting expected to take place 
in July 2007. Had this further £800 million
return taken place before the year end, it
would have resulted in gearing of 23% on a 
pro forma basis at 31 March 2007. 
Growth in diluted net asset value
Diluted net asset value (“NA V”) per share was
932p at 31 March 2007, which compares
with 739p at 31 March 2006, a net increase 
of 193p. 
This increase comprises 236p attributable 
to the total return of £1,075 million in the
year, offset by the combination of the dilutive
impact of the £700 million return of capital
(14.5p), share buy-backs (1p), the payment
of the interim and final dividends (15.5p) and
other adjustments (12p), which together
totalled 43p.

3i’s Corporate Responsibility Committee 
(“the Committee”) considers and reviews
environmental, ethical and social issues
relevant to 3i’s business and reports regularly
to the Board. It promotes awareness of 
these issues across the business through
training and communication. It promotes 
the development of corporate responsibility
policies, procedures and initiatives and
monitors and reviews their operation. 
The Committee, on behalf of the Board,
identifies and assesses the significant risks
and opportunities for 3i arising from social,
ethical and environmental issues. A risk 
matrix methodology is used to identify 
and assess potential risks and their impact,
monitor developing trends and best practice,
and consider changes in 3i’s business and
culture. A Group-wide risk log is used to
record identified risks and to monitor their
management and mitigation. This log of
identified risks is reviewed and updated at
meetings of the Committee and significant
risks are reported to 3i’s Operational 
Risk Committee.
As Chairman of the Committee, 
T ony Brierley, has specific responsibility 
for 3i’s environmental policies, leading the
development of new initiatives and targets
and reporting to the Board. The Committee’s
membership reflects the balance of 3i’s
business with representation from Europe,
Asia and the US and from a range of business
line and Group activities. 
All employees have a responsibility to be
aware of, and to abide by, 3i’s policies and
procedures which have been developed 
to guide staff and regulate the conduct of
the day-to-day operations of the business.
These policies and procedures include 3i’s
environmental, ethical and social policies, 
and are available to all employees through 
3i’s portal, a web-based knowledge system.
Employees are encouraged to make
suggestions to improve these policies 
and procedures.

As an investor
Investment policy
3i has a portfolio of over 750 investments 
in businesses across Europe, Asia and the US.
As an investor, corporate governance 
is a priority and account is taken of
environmental, ethical and social issues 
when making investment decisions. 
We believe it is important to invest in
companies whose owners and managers 
act responsibly on environmental, ethical 
and social matters. We therefore aim to
invest in companies which:
– respect human rights;
– comply with current environmental, 
ethical and social legislation;
– have proposals to address defined future
legislation; and
– seek to comply with their industry
standards and best practice.
We recognise that the most significant risks
to 3i’s short-term and long-term value 
from environmental, ethical and social
matters arise from its investment business. 
If a company in which 3i has an investment
acts irresponsibly on corporate responsibility
issues, this may affect the monetary value of
that investment and, as a shareholder in that
company, raise reputational issues for 3i.
Although we do not have day-to-day
operational control over the companies in
which we invest, we do have the opportunity
to influence the behaviour of these
businesses. We expect and encourage the
companies in which we invest to take a
responsible approach to the conduct and
governance of their business and to put in
place governance structures, policies and
processes appropriate to the nature and scale
of the business and the markets in which it
operates. This is supported through the
training of investment staff and non-
executive Directors who are appointed to the
boards of investee companies and the raising
of awareness within investee companies of
social, environmental and ethical issues. 3i is
also active in promoting good governance in
the private equity industry through the
provision of tutors for courses run by the
BVCA and the EVCA.
Investment procedures
We have policies and procedures to reduce
the risks of investing in businesses which
operate in an environmentally, ethically or
socially unacceptable manner. Details of 
these policies and procedures may be found
on 3i’s website at www.3igroup.com. 
When reviewing businesses for potential
investment, investment executives are
required to consider whether any corporate
responsibility risks arise and, if any risks 
are identified, to follow 3i’s corporate
responsibility investment procedures.
Depending on the nature of the risk identified
and its seriousness, a condition precedent 
or post completion undertaking requiring 
that the situation be remedied may be
required from the investee company or 
its management. Alternatively, it may be
decided not to proceed with the investment.
All new investment opportunities are the
subject of a process of filtering and review.
When a potential new investment
opportunity is first identified by an
investment professional, it is added to the
Company’s work in progress list (“Work in
Progress”). Following a preliminary appraisal
of the potential investment opportunity, a
decision is taken by the investment
professional’s local team as to whether the
investment opportunity merits further work.
At this stage the opportunity is reviewed in
detail by a group of senior and experienced
investment executives in the relevant
business line (known as the “Partner
Review”). If it is agreed through the Partner
Review process that a particular investment
opportunity should continue to be pursued,
the Partner Review process will also agree
what further in-depth analysis and due
diligence should be undertaken. 
3i is proud to be one of the BitC’s “T op 100

Corporate responsibility report continued
The decision to continue to pursue a
particular investment opportunity will 
be taken against a number of criteria and
policies, including commercial, financial,
sector, geographic, environmental, ethical 
and social considerations. Following a Partner
Review, and providing the results of the
detailed analysis and due diligence of the
opportunity are positive, the investment
opportunity will be submitted for formal
approval. At this stage, any potential
environmental, ethical or social issues in 
the investment opportunity will be formally
identified and a decision taken against 3i’s
investment policies and procedures whether
to proceed with the proposed investment,
and if so, on what basis. 
Over the year 1,054 potential new
investments were placed in Work in Progress,
196 of which proceeded to a Partner Review
and 62 new investments were approved 
and completed.
Where, after an investment has been made,
we become aware that an investee company
is not operating in an acceptable way, we 
will seek to use our influence to encourage
improvement. Where that is not possible, 
we will seek to dispose of the investment.
Over the course of the year, all existing
investments in the portfolio were the subject
of review.
Relationship management
Our key relationships are with the boards 
of the companies in which we invest,
together with the intermediaries, advisers
and consultants used to facilitate 
investment and portfolio management. 
We actively engage with these groups to
benchmark our performance and improve 
our investment procedures and skills.
As a corporate
As an employer 
3i’s staff are fundamental to the success 
of our business. An environment of mutual
respect where staff are highly motivated
around their work, where they have a strong
commitment to deliver, and where retention
is good are the standards we strive both to
achieve and maintain.
Employees are organised in small teams and 
a spirit of co-operation is encouraged to
ensure the highest standards of integrity and
professionalism. In accordance with 3i’s core
values, individual consultation with employees
on matters affecting them, and fair and open
communication, are a high priority. 
Our Chief Executive plans to meet separately
with each team every year to listen to their
views and insights and to share his vision and
strategy for the business. In addition, his
policy is to have  a one to one meeting with
each new joiner, regardless of organisational
level.
A conference was also held in London for 
all 3i’s staff world-wide. The objectives 
of this conference included reinforcing 
3i’s “One room: One firm” philosophy,
emphasising that whilst 3i’s 750 plus staff
may work in many different locations and
markets across the world, it operates as one
firm with a strong culture working across
borders and harnessing the knowledge and
skills of its people from across the world. 
Our people
Employee engagement is the extent to
which employees are committed to their
role, their team and the Group and its
objectives. How effective and productive
they are as a result of this commitment
and levels of retention are indicators of
engagement. 
World-wide conference
Our “One room: One firm” culture is key to our
success and the value that we bring to the
companies in which we invest. Although working
across three continents in small highly-focused
teams, with just over 750 employees it is feasible
for 3i to bring all of our staff together in one room.
Our 2006 conference, which was attended by
over 700 staff, was a great success and one of
the highest-rated sessions at the conference was
on community involvement. 3i Group plc

Directors’ report Directors’ remuneration report Auditors’ report Financial statements Additional financial information Information for shareholders
Every two years a comprehensive
confidential employee survey of staff is
conducted which includes a number of
questions that have a proven correlation to
employee engagement. The last survey was
conducted in 2005/06. In order to monitor
progress a “mini-survey” of the employee
engagement questions only was conducted
during the year. The response rate, at 78%,
was high, with an overall average of the
favourable responses to the questions 
of 87%. This was 3% higher than the average
for the same questions in 2005/06. 
Not only are the individual scores significantly
higher than the 2005 Ipsos MORI T op T en
norm (which was used to benchmark the 
full 2005/06 survey), but favourable scores
of over 95% were recorded against the
statements “I am always looking for ways 
to do my job better”, “I am committed to
helping 3i to achieve its objectives” and 
“I am proud to work for 3i”. 
3i has comprehensive behaviour policies 
to help ensure that employees treat their
colleagues and others with courtesy and
respect. 3i’s Guide to Business Conduct 
sets out the rules and guidelines we expect
all of our staff to follow with the objective 
of ensuring that we maintain professional
standards in all aspects of the conduct of 
our business.
3i also has a whistle-blowing policy setting
out procedures for staff to raise in confidence
matters of concern, for an appropriate and
independent investigation of such matters
and, where necessary, for follow-up action.
Training and development
We are committed to encouraging the
continuous development of our staff with 
the objective of maximising the overall
performance of the business. Emphasis is
placed on work-based learning, with the
provision of development opportunities
supported by appropriate coaching and
mentoring. This is supplemented by more
formal training programmes, such as
workshops to enhance the board
management skills of our investment staff. 
In addition, investment staff are required to
complete an investment training programme
on joining 3i, and professional services staff
are supported in developing their functional
specialisms through external courses,
networks and forums. During the year, 
306 employees attended internal training
and development courses.
It is a legal and regulatory requirement that 
all executives involved in making or managing
investment transactions receive anti-money
laundering training and periodic refresher
training. A programme of training is in place
to discharge these obligations.
Environmental Awareness Day
In March 2007, an environmental awareness day 
was held for 3i’s London-based staff to report our
progress on reducing 3i’s CO2 emissions and to
raise awareness on practical ways in which staff
can help at work and at home. The event was 
also attended by the Chairman and other
Directors. We are now considering ways to hold
similar events across the 3i network in an
environmentally sensitive way. A programme of sector-based workshops
and training courses has been developed 
for investment staff focusing on corporate
responsibility. The objectives of these
workshops are to ensure that staff remain
fully informed of 3i’s corporate responsibility
policies, to identify and raise awareness to
specific sector or geographical issues and 
to gain input to the formulation of policy.
During the year, workshops were held for
investment executives in 3i’s software sector
and Infrastructure and Asia investment teams
and further workshops are planned. In March
2007 an Environmental Awareness Day was
arranged for 3i’s London-based staff around
a screening of the Oscar-winning Al Gore
film, “An Inconvenient T ruth”. The objectives
of the day were to raise further the
awareness of staff to climate change issues,
to report on 3i’s own carbon footprint and 
to discuss ways in which 3i and individual
members of staff might take steps to reduce
carbon emissions. Following the success of
this event, further awareness days are being
planned for other offices.
T raining for Directors on corporate
responsibility issues is achieved through a
system of regular Board reporting and by
Board presentations on relevant corporate
responsibility issues.
Health and safety
We recognise that the promotion of health
and safety at work is an essential function 
of staff and management at all levels. 
In an endeavour to achieve high standards,
appropriate policies and procedures have
been put in place. Details of these policies
and procedures can be found on 3i’s website
at www.3igroup.com. Simon Ball as Finance
Director, has overall responsibility for the
implementation of 3i’s health and safety
policies and procedures. A Health and 
Safety Committee, chaired by the Company
Secretary, T ony Brierley, has been established
to oversee the application of these policies
and procedures and to consider health and
safety risks across the business.
The purpose of 3i’s health and safety policy 
is to enable all members of 3i’s staff to 
go about their everyday business at 3i’s
offices in the expectation that they can 
do so safely and without risk to their health. 
High standards of health and safety are
applied to staff and sub-contractors and 
we endeavour to ensure that the health,
safety and welfare of our employees, 
visitors, customers, sub-contractors’ staff
and the general public is not compromised.
Our objective is not to have any reportable
accidents or incidents. During the year to 
31 March 2007, no reportable accidents
occurred under UK Health and Safety
regulations or under similar regulations
outside the UK.
As a member of T ommy’s Pregnancy
Accreditation Programme, 3i complies with
criteria for pregnancy management, geared
towards creating a positive environment for
parents-to-be in the workplace.
Procurement 
We have developed policies and procedures
relating to the purchasing of goods 
and services for use by the business. 
These policies and procedures must be
followed by all staff. As far as possible, we 
will work only with suppliers who support 
our aim to source products responsibly.
Suppliers that exploit child or “sweated
labour”, that disregard social legislation 
and basic health and safety provision, that
“pirate” the intellectual property of others 
or that wilfully and avoidably damage the
environment will be avoided. Details of 3i’s
procurement policies may be found on 3i’s
website at www.3igroup.com.
We aim to have a collaborative relationship
with our suppliers and, wherever possible,
when problems arise with a supplier’s
performance or behaviour, will work with 
the supplier concerned to help them meet
our requirements.

Corporate responsibility issues 
and the environment
The principal benchmarks against which 
3i measures its direct impact on the
environment are for CO
2
emissions; and
recycling of paper and other materials.
SFC Smart Fuel Cell AG
Location: Germany
Website: www.sfc.com
Environment 
As a financial services business employing
approximately 750 employees world-wide,
3i’s direct environmental impact is relatively
low. However, we measure our own energy
and resource usage where practicable 
and set targets to achieve improvement. 
A benchmark against which we measure 
our performance is for CO
2
emissions
associated with our office accommodation. 
Our previously published objective has been
to reduce CO
2
emissions attributable to
office accommodation by 6% over the two
years to 2007, from approximately 6,964
tonnes of office related CO
2
emissions
generated in the year to 31 March 2005.
Following an independent assessment by
CarbonNeutral against the World Business
Council for Sustainable Development
greenhouse gas protocol, CO
2
emissions
attributable to office accommodation in the
year to 31 March 2007 have been assessed
at 5,110 tonnes; a reduction of 26.6% over
the two year period to 31 March 2007. 
This was achieved largely as a result of a
move to more energy efficient offices in
London. For the future, 3i’s objective is to
become carbon neutral over the course of
the three years to 31 March 2010. 
We assess the environmental standards 
of suppliers and, through our procurement
policy and our purchasing choices, will favour
products showing clear environmental
advantages unless there are significant
reasons for not so doing.
Fuel cells have long been recognised as alternative
power sources. However, their promise has been
slow to materialise into real products.
In 2004, SFC was the world’s first company 
to introduce a fully commercialised fuel cell to 
the market. T oday the company is one of the
international market leaders in mobile and portable
fuel cells in a power range from 10 to 250 W,
selling several thousand fuel cells per year into a
wide range of applications in leisure and industrial
markets. Fuel cells made by SFC are providing
electrical energy globally. These are used in
recreational vehicles, yachts, holiday homes, 
traffic monitoring systems, observation stations,
light electric vehicles and other applications.
A product by SFC was also the first fuel cell ever
to be installed as original equipment in a vehicle.
It powers the electrical system in the Hymer 5
Class RV.
SFC, which employs 75 people, is already
developing portable fuel cells weighing less 
than 1kg.
As an active and committed participant in the
promotion of sustainable technologies, 3i sees
opportunities to form partnerships and make
investments in forward-thinking businesses and
SFC is one example. 3i Group plc

Charity and community 
3i’s charitable policy aims to focus on:
– the disadvantaged, young people and
education in the communities in which 
we have offices. Charities are supported 
on the basis of their effectiveness 
and impact;
– charitable activities of staff. 3i matches
donations made by UK staff under the 
Give As You Earn scheme (“GAYE”) and 
the proceeds of staff fundraising efforts. 
In the year to 31 March 2007, 25% of 
3i’s charitable donations were matching
GAYE donations;
– charities relevant to our corporate activity.
For example, 3i founded and supports the
Enterprise Education T rust, a charity now 
in its 30th year, which aims to inspire
young people to become involved in, 
and understand business.
Charitable donations made in the year to 
31 March 2007 amounted to £429,409,
supporting a variety of charities with
donations up to £35,000.
Performance and measurement
The Committee has overseen the 
formulation and implementation of corporate
responsibility investment procedures,
implemented appropriate risk management
procedures and set strategic targets and
objectives for corporate responsibility.
3i’s performance is measured against 
two indices:
– the Dow Jones Sustainability World Index
(“DJSI”), a global index which tracks the
financial performance of leading companies
in terms of corporate sustainability; and 
– the Business in the Community (“BitC”)
Corporate Responsibility Index, which 
aims to benchmark environmental, ethical
and social performance and encourage
sustainable development.
3i has again been selected as a constituent 
of the DJSI during the year and was leader 
of its industry group on a global basis. 
We were also recognised as one of the best
companies on a global basis in respect of our
codes of conduct, compliance and anti-crime
measures. We aim to continue to be included
within this Index.
The Passage
Following the move of our London office to
Victoria in 2006, 3i identified The Passage, a
locally based charity focused on helping homeless
people back into employment, as one which had
high local impact. We quickly formed a relationship
with The Passage and are now providing financial
and other support.
3i is proud to be a founding investor in Bridges
Ventures, a privately-owned UK venture capital
company with a social mission. Bridges was
founded in 2002, since when it has made equity
investments in 24 businesses employing 700
people, almost 200 of whom came out of
unemployment.
3i helped to found EET (formerly businessdynamics)
30 years ago and has continued to support its
work in inspiring school children to get involved
in business ever since. Over 90,000 pupils took
part in EET programmes in 2006. 3i Group plc

In 2006 we again participated in the annual
BitC Corporate Responsibility Index and were
included in the BitC’s “T op 100 Companies
that Count”. In particular, the integration into
the business of our corporate responsibility
principles and risk management processes
relating to corporate responsibility issues
were recognised. We aim to continue 
to be included within this Index. 
Each of 3i’s business unit and department
heads is required to confirm on an annual
basis that their operating procedures,
including investment procedures, are
consistent with 3i’s standards and controls
and that these procedures are operating 
in practice.
3i’s performance management appraisal
process reviews the performance of
individual members of staff against agreed
objectives and the knowledge, skills and
behaviours expected by 3i. All 3i’s offices 
are the subject of health and safety audits 
to ensure high standards are adopted on a
consistent basis world-wide.
During the year, at the invitation of 
3i’s Chairman, Baroness Hogg, 3i’s major
shareholders met with the Chairman, 
the Chairmen of the Audit and Compliance
Committee and the Remuneration
Committee and the Company Secretary 
to discuss matters of corporate governance 
and corporate responsibility relevant to 
3i and its shareholders. 
Audit and verification
The Committee is responsible for monitoring
the operation of 3i’s corporate responsibility
policies and procedures. The identification
and management of corporate responsibility
risks is integral to the ongoing operational
processes of 3i’s business units and 
functions. 3i’s internal audit function carries
out periodic independent reviews of risks 
and related controls in this area, including
compliance with 3i’s corporate responsibility
investment procedures.
The Committee may also supplement 
internal review processes with external
reviews where necessary. The Committee 
is not aware of any material breaches 
in the application of 3i’s internal policies 
and procedures for managing risks from
corporate responsibility issues.
The disclosures in this Corporate
responsibility report are the subject 
of a process requiring each statement 
made to be verified.

Corporate governance 
Throughout the year, the Company complied
with the provisions of section 1 of the
Combined Code on corporate governance
published by the Financial Reporting Council
in July 2003.
The Company’s approach 
to corporate governance 
The Company has a policy of seeking to
comply with established best practice in the
field of corporate governance. The Board has
adopted core values and Group standards
which set out the behaviour expected of
staff in their dealings with shareholders,
customers, colleagues, suppliers and other
stakeholders of the Company. One of the
core values communicated within the Group
is a belief that the highest standard of
integrity is essential in business.
The Board’s responsibilities and processes 
The Board is responsible to shareholders 
for the overall management of the Group. 
It determines matters including financial
strategy and planning and takes major
business decisions. The Board has put in 
place an organisational structure. This is
further described under the heading 
“internal control”.
The Board has approved a formal schedule of
matters reserved to it and its duly authorised
Committees for decision. These include:
– approval of the Group’s overall strategy,
strategic plan and annual operating budget;
– approval of the Company’s interim and
annual financial statements and changes 
in the Group’s accounting policies 
or practices;
– changes relating to the capital structure 
of the Company or its regulated status;
– major capital projects;
– major changes in the nature of 
business operations;
– investments and divestments in the
ordinary course of business above certain
limits set by the Board from time to time;
– adequacy of internal control systems;
– appointments to the Board and
Management Committee;
– principal terms and conditions of
employment of members of Management
Committee; and
– changes in employee share schemes and
other long-term incentive schemes.
Matters delegated to management 
include implementation of the Board
approved strategy, day-to-day operation 
of the business, the appointment of all
executives below Management Committee
and the formulation and execution of risk
management policies and practices.
A Group succession and contingency plan 
is prepared by management and reviewed
periodically by the Board. The purpose of 
this plan is to identify suitable candidates 
for succession to key senior management
positions, agree their training and
development needs, and ensure the
necessary human resources are in place 
for the Company to meet its objectives.
Meetings of the Board During the year, there
were six meetings of the Board of Directors.
The Directors who served throughout the
year attended all six meetings, save for 
Mr F G Steingraber who attended five
meetings. Mr R W A Swannell attended the
four meetings held since his appointment 
on 1 September 2006 and Dr P Mihatsch
attended the two meetings held before his
retirement as a Director on 31 July 2006.

Report and accounts 2007 53
Directors’ report Directors’ remuneration report Auditors’ report Financial statements Additional financial information Information for shareholders
The principal matters considered by the
Board during the year included:
– the Group strategic plan, budget and
financial resources;
– the Group’s capital structure, balance 
sheet efficiency and the return of capital 
to shareholders;
– regular reports from the Chief Executive;
– co-investment arrangements for
investment staff;
– the recommendations of the Valuations
Committee on valuations of investments;
– the Company’s share price performance 
and shareholder perceptions following 
the release of year end results;
– the raising of the Group’s latest European
Buyout Fund;
– the raising of a fund for infrastructure
investment;
– establishing a Quoted Private Equity team 
to apply private equity management skills
to small and mid-cap listed companies;
– risk management arrangements and
investment approval process;
– a review of the Group’s advisory and
corporate broking relationships;
– independence of non-executive Directors; 
– the valuation methodology, investment
strategy and the composition of the
trustees of The 3i Group Pension Plan; and
– corporate responsibility initiatives 
and performance.
Information Reports and papers are circulated
to the Directors in a timely manner in
preparation for Board and committee
meetings. These papers are supplemented 
by information specifically requested by 
the Directors from time to time.
Performance evaluation During the year, the
Board conducted its annual evaluation of its
own performance and that of its committees
and individual Directors. The Chairman led the
process with the aid of an external
consultant. All Board members completed a
questionnaire and gave personal views to the
Chairman, who also sought views from all
members of the Management Committee.
The Chairman gave feedback to the Board
and to individual Directors. These processes
also involved evaluation by members of
Board committees of their performance. 
The Senior Independent Director led a 
review by the Directors of the performance
of the Chairman. 
Following the completion of the above
process, the Board concluded that:
– it had benefited from having two strategy
sessions during the year (in addition to its
regular Board meetings), dealing with high
level issues and specific issues respectively,
and that this practice should be continued; 
– as the number of business lines had 
increased, the amount of time spent on
specific strategic issues relating to them
would also increase;
– it should continue the practice of holding 
at least one meeting a year away from 
the Company’s head office in order to
enable members to spend time with the
executives responsible for building the
Company’s global capability; 
– the preparation for succession planning had
been beneficial and the Board invited more
opportunities to engage with those
executives likely to be promoted to
Management Committee;
– it should continue the process of adding
external capability to the Board to match
changes in the Group’s international
commercial business and in financial
markets; and
– consideration should be given as to how
further external input into the Board review
process could supplement existing
processes.
The roles of the Chairman 
and the Chief Executive 
The division of responsibilities between 
the Chairman of the Board and the Chief
Executive is clearly defined and has been
approved by the Board.
The Chairman The Chairman leads the Board
in the determination of its strategy and in the
achievement of its objectives. The Chairman
is responsible for organising the business of
the Board, ensuring its effectiveness and
setting its agenda. The Chairman has no
involvement in the day-to-day business 
of the Group. The Chairman facilitates the
effective contribution of non-executive
Directors and constructive relations between
executive and non-executive Directors. 
The Chairman ensures that regular reports
from the Company’s brokers are circulated 
to the non-executive Directors to enable
non-executive Directors to remain aware 
of shareholders’ views. The Chairman 
ensures effective communication with 
the Company’s shareholders.
The Chief Executive The Chief Executive has
direct charge of the Group on a day-to-day
basis and is accountable to the Board for 
the financial and operational performance 
of the Group. The Chief Executive has
formed a committee called Management
Committee to enable him to carry out the
responsibilities delegated to him by the
Board. The Committee comprises the
executive Directors, the Company Secretary, 
Mr B N Carnegie-Brown, Ms D R Collis, 
Mr C P Rowlands, Mr J B C Russell, 
Mr A J M T aylor, Mr P Waller and 
Mr G A R Zarzavatdjian. The Committee
meets on a regular basis to consider
operational matters and the implementation
of the Group’s strategy. 3i Group plc

Directors’ report – statutory and corporate governance inf ormation
continued
Senior Independent Director 
The Board has appointed Mr O H J Stocken
as Senior Independent Director, to whom, 
in accordance with the Combined Code,
concerns can be conveyed.
Directors 
The Board comprises the Chairman, six
independent non-executive Directors and
three executive Directors. Biographical details
for each of the Directors are set out on 
page 49. Baroness Hogg (Chairman), 
Mr O H J Stocken, Mr P E Y ea, Mr S P Ball,
Mme C J M Morin-Postel, Mr M J Queen, 
Mr F D Rosenkranz, Sir Robert Smith and 
Mr F G Steingraber served throughout the
period under review. Mr R W A Swannell
served as a Director from 1 September
2006. Dr P Mihatsch served as a Director
until 31 July 2006. As stated in the Notice of
AGM for 2006, Mr F D Rosenkranz will be
retiring from the Board at the conclusion of
the 2007 AGM. 
In addition to fulfilling their legal
responsibilities as Directors, non-executive
Directors are expected to bring an
independent judgment to bear on issues 
of strategy, performance, resources and
standards of conduct, and to help the 
Board provide the Company with effective
leadership. They are also expected to 
ensure high standards of financial probity 
on the part of the Company and to monitor
the effectiveness of the executive Directors.
The Board’s discussions, and its approval of
the Group’s strategic plan and annual budget,
provide the non-executive Directors with 
the opportunity to contribute to and validate
management’s plans and assist in the
development of strategy. The non-executive
Directors receive regular management
accounts, reports and information which
enable them to scrutinise the Company’s 
and management’s performance against
agreed objectives.
Directors’ independence  All the non-
executive Directors (other than the
Chairman, who was independent on
appointment) are considered by the Board 
to be independent for the purposes of the
Combined Code. The Board assesses and
reviews the independence of each of the
non-executive Directors at least annually
having regard to the potential relevance 
and materiality of a Director’s interests 
and relationships rather than applying rigid
criteria in a mechanistic manner.
No Director was materially interested in any
contract or arrangement subsisting during 
or at the end of the financial period that 
was significant in relation to the business 
of the Company.
Directors’ employment contracts Details of
executive Directors’ employment contracts
are set out in the Directors’ remuneration
report on page 72.
Training and development The Company has
developed a training policy which provides a
framework within which training for Directors
is planned with the objective of ensuring
Directors understand the duties and
responsibilities of being a director of a listed
company. All Directors are required to update
their skills and maintain their familiarity with
the Company and its business continually.
Presentations on different aspects of the
Company’s business are made regularly to the
Board. On appointment, all non-executive
Directors have discussions with the Chairman
and the Chief Executive following which
appropriate briefings on the responsibilities 
of Directors, the Company’s business and 
the Company’s procedures are arranged. 
The Company provides opportunities for
non-executive Directors to obtain a thorough
understanding of the Company’s business by
meeting members of the senior management
team who in turn arrange, as required, visits
to investment or support teams.
During the year the Directors received
training on anti money-laundering, the
changes to the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance, developments in relation to the
implementation of the T ransparency Directive
and Companies Act 2006 and changes to the
Listing Rules. Non-executive Directors also
received presentations on specific aspects of
the Company’s business. During the year, the
Company also held an Environmental
Awareness day in which both staff and
Directors participated. 
The Company has procedures for Directors to
take independent legal or other professional
advice about the performance of their duties.
Re-election Subject to the Company’s
Articles of Association, the Companies Acts
and satisfactory performance evaluation, 
non-executive Directors are appointed for an
initial period of three years. Before the third
and sixth anniversaries of a non-executive
Director’s first appointment, the Director
discusses with the Board whether it is
appropriate for a further three year term 
to be served. The reappointment of 
non-executive Directors who have served 
for more than nine years is subject to 
annual review.
The Company’s Articles of Association
provide for:
(a) Directors to retire at the first AGM after
their appointment by the Board and for
the number nearest to, but not exceeding,
one-third of the remaining Directors 
to retire by rotation at each AGM; and
(b) all Directors to retire at least every 
three years. 
Subject to the Articles of Association, retiring
Directors are eligible for reappointment.  3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 55

In accordance with the Articles of
Association, at the AGM to be held

Directors’ indemnities The Company’s
Articles of Association provide that, subject
to the provisions of the Companies Acts, 
the Directors shall be indemnified against
liabilities incurred by them as Directors in
defending any proceedings in which judgment
is given in their favour, or where they have
been acquitted or been granted relief by the
court. As permitted by the Companies (Audit,
Investigations and Community Enterprise)
Act 2004 and the Company’s Articles of
Association, the Company has maintained
Qualifying Third-Party Indemnity Provisions
(as defined under section 309B of the
Companies Act 1985) for the benefit of 
the Company’s Directors and the Company
Secretary throughout the period.
Under the rules of the 3i Group Pension 
Plan (“the Plan”), the Company has granted
an indemnity to the directors of Gardens
Pension T rustees Limited (a corporate trustee
of the Plan and a wholly owned subsidiary 
of the Company) against liabilities incurred 
as directors of that corporate trustee.
The Board’s committees 
The Board is assisted by various standing
committees of the Board which report
regularly to the Board. The membership of
these committees is regularly reviewed by
the Board. When considering committee
membership and chairmanship, the Board
aims to ensure that undue reliance is not
placed on particular Directors.
These committees all have clearly defined
terms of reference which are available at
www.3igroup.com. The terms of reference 
of the Audit and Compliance Committee, 
the Remuneration Committee and the
Nominations Committee provide that no 
one other than the particular committee
chairman and members may attend 
a meeting unless invited to attend 
by the relevant committee.
Audit and Compliance Committee 
The Audit and Compliance Committee
comprises Mr O H J Stocken 
(Chairman), Mme C J M Morin-Postel, 
Mr F D Rosenkranz and Sir Robert Smith, 
all of whom served throughout the period. 
All the members of the Committee are
independent non-executive Directors.

and relevant financial experience. 
During the year, there were four meetings 
of the Committee all of which were attended 
by all members of the Committee save that
Mme C J M Morin-Postel attended three of
the four meetings.

The Remuneration Committee 
comprises Sir Robert Smith (Chairman), 
Mme C J M Morin-Postel, 
Mr F D Rosenkranz, Mr F G Steingraber and
Mr O H J Stocken all of whom served
throughout the period. Sir Robert Smith
succeeded Mr F D Rosenkranz as Chairman 
of the Committee with effect from 1 August

During the year, there were six meetings of
the Remuneration Committee all of which

The terms of reference of the Nominations
Committee provide that the Chairman of 
the Board shall not chair the Committee 
when dealing with the appointment of the
Chairman’s successor.
During the year, the Nominations Committee
considered and recommended a candidate 
for appointment as a non-executive Director
of the Company. The Committee also
considered the composition of the Board to
ensure that the balance of its membership, 
as between executive and non-executive
Directors, and non-executive Directors’
length of service remained appropriate.
A formal, rigorous and transparent process
for the appointment of Directors has been
established with the objective of identifying
the skills and experience profile required 
of new Directors and identifying suitable
candidates. The procedure includes the
appraisal and selection of potential
candidates, including (in the case of 
non-executive Directors) whether they 
have sufficient time to fulfil their roles.
Specialist recruitment consultants assist the
Committee to identify suitable candidates 
for appointment. The Committee’s
recommendations for appointment are 
put to the full Board for approval.
Valuations Committee 
The Valuations Committee comprises
Baroness Hogg (Chairman), Mr O H J Stocken,
Mr P E Y ea, Mr S P Ball and Mr R W A Swannell,
all of whom served throughout the period,
save that Mr R W A Swannell served from

served as a member of the Committee 
until 31 July 2006. There were three

during the year. The members who served
throughout the year attended all meetings.
Mr R W A Swannell attended the one 
meeting held following his appointment and
Dr P Mihatsch attended the one meeting held
before he ceased to be a Committee member.
During the year, the Valuations Committee
considered and made recommendations 
to the Board on valuations of the Group’s
investments to be included in the interim and
annual financial statements of the Group and
reviewed valuations policy and methodology.
The Company Secretary 
All Directors have access to the advice 
and services of the Company Secretary. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for
advising the Board, through the Chairman, on
governance matters. The Company’s Articles
of Association and the schedule of matters
reserved to the Board or its duly authorised
committees for decision provide that the
appointment and removal of the Company
Secretary is a matter for the full Board.
Relations with shareholders 
The Board recognises the importance of
maintaining a purposeful relationship with the
Company’s shareholders. The Chief Executive
and the Finance Director, together with the
Group Communications Director, meet with
the Company’s principal institutional
shareholders to discuss relevant issues as
they arise. The Chairman maintains a dialogue
with shareholders on strategy, corporate
governance and Directors’ remuneration 
as required.
The Board receives reports from the
Company’s brokers on shareholder issues 
and non-executive Directors are invited 
to attend the Company’s presentations to
analysts and are offered the opportunity 
to meet shareholders.
The Company’s major shareholders are
offered the opportunity to meet newly-
appointed non-executive Directors. 
During the year such shareholders 
were given the opportunity to meet
Mr R W A Swannell following his 
appointment on 1 September 2006.
The Company also uses its AGM as an
opportunity to communicate with its
shareholders. At the Meeting, business
presentations are made by the Chief
Executive and the Finance Director. 
The Chairmen of the Remuneration, 
Audit and Compliance, and Nominations
Committees are available to answer
shareholders’ questions. 3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 57
Directors’ report Directors’ remuneration report Auditors’ report Financial statements Additional financial information Information for shareholders
During the year, at the invitation of the
Chairman, the Company’s major shareholders
met with the Chairman, the Chairmen of 
the Audit and Compliance Committee and
the Remuneration Committee and the
Company Secretary to discuss matters 
of corporate governance and corporate
responsibility relevant to the Company 
and its shareholders.
The Notice of AGM for 2006 was dispatched
to shareholders not less than 20 working
days before the Meeting. At that Meeting,
voting on each resolution was taken on a poll
and the poll results were made available on
the Company’s website. In accordance with
the Company’s Articles of Association, on
each poll every member who was present in
person or by proxy had one vote for each
share held.
Portfolio management and voting policy 
In relation to unquoted investments, the
Group’s approach is to seek to add value to
the businesses in which the Group invests
through the Group’s extensive experience,
resources and contacts. In relation to quoted
investments, the Group’s policy is to exercise
voting rights on matters affecting the
interests of the Group.
Internal control 
The Board is responsible for the Group’s
system of internal control and reviews its
effectiveness at least annually. Such a system
is designed to manage rather than eliminate
the risk of failure to achieve business
objectives and can provide only reasonable
and not absolute assurance against material
misstatement or loss.
Through the regular meetings of the Board
and the schedule of matters reserved to the
Board or its duly authorised committees for
decision, the Board aims to maintain full and
effective control over appropriate strategic,
financial, operational and compliance issues.
The Board has put in place an organisational
structure with clearly defined lines of
responsibility and delegation of authority. 
The Board considers and approves a strategic
plan every two years and approves a budget
on an annual basis. In addition, there are
established procedures and processes for
planning and controlling expenditure and 
the making of investments. There are also
information and reporting systems for
monitoring the Group’s businesses and 
their performance.
The Group Risk Management Committee is 
a management committee formed by the
Chief Executive and its purpose is to review
the business of the Group in order to ensure
that business risk is considered, assessed and
managed as an integral part of the business.
There is an ongoing process for identifying,
evaluating and managing the Group’s
significant risks. This process was in place 
for the year to 31 March 2007 and up to 
the date of this report. 
With effect from 1 March 2007, the Group
Risk Management Committee’s activities
were supported by not only the established
activities of Investment Committee but also
by two new committees: Financial Risk
Committee and Operational Risk Committee.
Details of the new risk management
framework can be found in the Risk
management section of the Business review
on pages 26 to 31. 
The overall internal control process is
regularly reviewed by the Board and the 
Audit and Compliance Committee and
complies with the internal control guidance
for Directors on the Combined Code issued 
by the T urnbull Committee. The process
established for the Group includes:
Policies
– core values, Group standards and Group
controls together comprising the Group’s
high level principles and controls, with
which all staff are expected to comply;
– manuals of policies and procedures,
applicable to all business units, with
procedures for reporting weaknesses 
and for monitoring corrective action;
– a code of business conduct, with
procedures for reporting compliance
therewith;
Processes
– appointment of experienced and
professional staff, both by recruitment 
and promotion, of the necessary calibre 
to fulfil their allotted responsibilities;
– a planning framework which incorporates 
a Board approved strategic plan, with
objectives for each business unit;
– formal business risk reviews performed by
management which evaluate the potential
financial impact and likelihood of identified
risks and possible new risk areas;
– the setting of control, mitigation and
monitoring procedures and the review 
of actual occurrences, identifying lessons
to be learnt;
– a comprehensive system of financial
reporting to the Board, based on an 
annual budget with monthly reporting 
of actual results, analysis of variances,
scrutiny of key performance measures 
and regular re-forecasting;
– regular treasury reports to the Board, which
analyse the funding requirements of each
class of assets, track the generation and 
use of capital and the volume of liquidity,
measure the Group’s exposure to interest
and exchange rate movements and record
the level of compliance with the Group’s
funding objectives; 3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 58
Directors’ report – statutory and corporate governance inf ormation
continued
– a Group Compliance function whose role 
is to integrate regulatory compliance
procedures into the Group’s systems;
– well defined procedures governing the
appraisal and approval of investments,
including detailed investment and
divestment approval procedures,
incorporating appropriate levels of
authority and regular post 
investment reviews;
Verification
– a Group Risk Assurance and Audit function 
which undertakes periodic examination 
of business units and processes and
recommends improvements in controls 
to management;
– the external auditors who are engaged 
to express an opinion on the annual 
financial statements;
– an Audit and Compliance Committee which
considers significant control matters and
receives reports from Group Risk
Assurance and Audit and the external
auditors and the Group Compliance
function on a regular basis.
The internal control system is monitored 
and supported by a Group Risk Assurance 
and Audit function which operates on 
an international basis and reports to
management and the Audit and Compliance
Committee on the Group’s operations. 
The work of Group Risk Assurance and Audit
is focused on the areas of greatest risk to the
Group determined on the basis of the Group’s
risk management process. The external
auditors independently and objectively review
the approach of management to reporting
operating results and financial condition. 
In co-ordination with Group Risk Assurance
and Audit, they also review and test the
system of internal financial control and the
information contained in the annual financial
statements to the extent necessary for
expressing their opinion.
Employment 
The Group’s policy is one of equal opportunity
in the selection, training, career development
and promotion of employees, regardless of
age, gender, sexual orientation, ethnic origin,
religion and whether disabled or otherwise.
The Group treats applicants and employees
with disabilities equally and fairly and provides
facilities, equipment and training to assist
disabled employees to do their jobs. 
Should an employee become disabled during
their employment, efforts are made to retain
them in their current employment or to
explore the opportunities for their retraining
or redeployment within the Group. 
The Group also provides financial support to
disabled employees who are unable to work,
as appropriate to local market conditions. 
The Group’s principal means of keeping 
in touch with the views of its employees 
are through employee appraisals, 
informal consultations, team briefings, 
and staff conferences and surveys. 
Managers throughout the Group have a
continuing responsibility to keep their staff
fully informed of developments and to
communicate financial results and other
matters of interest. This is achieved by
structured communication including regular
meetings of employees.
The Group has clear grievance and
disciplinary procedures in place, which include
comprehensive procedures on discrimination
and the Group’s equal opportunities policy.
The Group also has an employee assistance
programme which provides a confidential,
free and independent counselling service
and is available to all staff and their families 
in the UK.
There are clearly defined staff policies for 
pay and working conditions. The Group’s
employment policies are designed to provide
a competitive reward package which will
attract and retain high quality staff, whilst
ensuring that the cost element of these
rewards remains at an appropriate level.
The Group’s remuneration policy is 
influenced by market conditions and practices
in the countries in which it operates. 
All employees receive a base salary and 
are eligible for a performance related bonus.
Where appropriate, employees are eligible
to participate in Group share schemes to
encourage employees’ involvement in 
the performance of the Group. Investment
executives may also participate in
co-investment plans and carried interest
schemes, which allow executives to share
directly in the future profits on investments.
Further details of these plans are set out in
the Directors’ remuneration report.
Employees participate in local state or
company pension schemes as appropriate 
to local market conditions.
Charitable and political donations 
Charitable donations made by the Group 
in the year to 31 March 2007 amounted 
to £429,409. Excluding the Company’s
matching of Give As You Earn contributions
by staff, charitable donations amounted to
£322,524. Of this amount approximately
58% were donated to causes which aim to
relieve poverty or benefit the community, or
both, approximately 12% were donated to
charities which advance education, and
approximately 9% were donated to medical
charities. Further details of charitable
donations are set out in the Corporate
responsibility report on pages 40 to 47.
In line with Group policy, no donations were
made to political parties during the year.
Under the Companies Act 1985, as
amended, the Company is required to
disclose particulars of any donation to any 
EU political organisation and EU political
expenditure incurred during the year. 
During the period, 3i plc, the main operating
company of the Group, made a payment to
one organisation, detailed below, which may
fall within the definition of donations to EU
political organisations. This payment was an
annual subscription to the Industry Forum 
of £3,407. 3i Group plc

Policy for paying creditors 
The Group’s policy is to pay creditors in
accordance with the CBI Prompt Payers Code
of Good Practice, copies of which can be
obtained from the Confederation of British
Industry at Centre Point, 103 New Oxford
Street, London WC1A 1DU. The Company
had no trade creditors during the year. 
3i plc had trade creditors outstanding 
at the year end representing on average 
19 days’ purchases.
Statement of Directors’ responsibilities 
The Directors are required by UK company
law to prepare financial statements which
give a true and fair view of the state of
affairs of the Company and the Group as at
the end of the year and of the profit for the
year. The Directors have responsibility for
ensuring that proper accounting records are
kept which disclose with reasonable accuracy
the financial position of the Group and enable
them to ensure that the financial statements
comply with the Companies Act 1985. 
They have a general responsibility for taking
such steps as are reasonably open to them 
to safeguard the assets of the Group and 
to prevent and detect fraud and other
irregularities. Suitable accounting policies,
which follow generally accepted accounting
practice and are explained in the notes to 
the financial statements, have been applied
consistently and applicable accounting
standards have been followed. In addition,
these financial statements comply with
International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the European Union and
reasonable and prudent judgments 
and estimates have been used in 
their preparation.
Going concern 
The Directors are satisfied that the Company
and the Group have adequate resources to
continue to operate for the foreseeable
future. For this reason, they continue to
adopt the “going concern” basis for preparing
the financial statements.
Auditors’ independence and objectivity 
Subject to annual appointment by
shareholders, auditor performance is
monitored on an ongoing basis and formally
reviewed every five years, the next review
being scheduled for 2008. The Audit and
Compliance Committee reviewed auditor
performance during the year and concluded
that Ernst & Young LLP’s appointment as the
Company’s auditors should be continued.
The Committee recognises the importance of
ensuring the independence and objectivity of
the Company’s auditors. It reviews the nature
and extent of the services provided by them,
the level of their fees and the element
comprising non-audit fees. The Audit and
Compliance Committee Chairman is notified
of all assignments allocated to Ernst & Young
over a set threshold, other than those 
related to due diligence within the Group’s
investment process where the team engaged
would be independent of the audit team.
Safeguards have been put in place to reduce
the likelihood of compromising auditor
independence, including the following
principles which are applied in respect of
services provided by the auditors and other
accounting firms and monitored by the 
Audit and Compliance Committee:
– services required to be undertaken by 
the auditors, which include regulatory
returns, formalities relating to borrowings,
shareholder and other circulars. This work is
normally allocated directly to the auditors;
– services which it is most efficient for 
the auditors to provide. In this case,
information relating to the service is largely
derived from the Company’s audited
financial records; for example, corporate
tax services. This work is normally allocated 
to the auditors subject to consideration 
of any impact on their independence;
– services that could be provided by 
a number of firms including general
consultancy work. All significant
consultancy projects are normally put out
to tender and work would be allocated to
the auditors only if it did not present a
potential threat to the independence of the
audit team. Included in this category is due
diligence work relating to the investment
process. If this service were to be provided
by the auditors, the specific team engaged
would be independent of the audit team.
Details of the fees paid to the auditors are
disclosed in note 6 to the financial
statements on page 84.
Audit information 
Pursuant to section 234ZA (2) of the
Companies Act 1985, each of the Directors
confirms that: (a) so far as they are aware,
there is no relevant audit information of
which the Company’s auditors are unaware;
and (b) they have taken all steps they ought
to have taken to make themselves aware 
of any relevant audit information and to
establish that the Company’s auditors are
aware of such information.
Appointment of auditors
In accordance with section 384 of the
Companies Act 1985, a resolution proposing
the reappointment of Ernst & Y oung LLP 
as the Company’s auditors will be put to
members at the forthcoming AGM.

Remuneration Committee
Composition and terms of reference
The Remuneration Committee (the “Committee”) comprises only independent non-executive Directors. Its members during the year to 
31 March 2007 (the “year”) were Sir Robert Smith (Committee Chairman from 1 August 2006), Mr F D Rosenkranz (Committee Chairman
until 1 August 2006), Mme C J M Morin-Postel, Mr F G Steingraber and Mr O H J Stocken. None of the Committee members sits with any
executive Director on the board of any other quoted company. The Committee’s terms of reference take into account the provisions of the
Combined Code on corporate governance and are available on the Company’s website.
Activities during the year
The Committee met six times during the year to consider remuneration policy and to determine, on behalf of the Board, the specific 
remuneration packages for each of the executive Directors and the other members of Management Committee. The Committee also 
reviewed the fees payable to the Chairman of the Board. Details of Committee members’ attendance at the Committee’s meetings are 
set out in the Directors’ report.
During the year the Committee considered and, where appropriate, made recommendations to the Board on the Company’s framework 
of executive remuneration and its costs to ensure that remuneration policy continued to support the Group’s strategy.
The Committee considered performance for the year to 31 March 2006 against key performance measures in assessing executive Director
performance for bonus awards in respect of that year. In addition, the Committee reviewed the key performance measures to be used for
remuneration purposes in relation to the year to 31 March 2007.
The Committee reviewed the long-term incentives available to senior executives and introduced a new category of performance shares 
(“Super-performance Shares”) with a particularly challenging performance condition.
The Committee determined revised remuneration arrangements for Mr M J Queen, the executive Director responsible for Growth Capital and
Infrastructure, to take effect from 1 April 2007.
The Committee determined appropriate adjustments to be made to share awards and performance conditions as a result of the Company’s
issue of B shares and share capital consolidation in July 2006. The aim of the Committee was to achieve neutrality of treatment, neither
advantaging nor disadvantaging participants.
Assistance to the Committee
Persons who materially assisted the Committee with advice on Directors’ remuneration in the year were: PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP 
(“PwC”) (until September 2006) and Kepler Associates (from September 2006), external remuneration advisers appointed by the Committee; 
the Chairman of the Board, Baroness Hogg; the Chief Executive, Mr P E Y ea; and the Group’s Human Resources Director, Ms D R Collis 
(Ms D R Collis was not appointed by the Committee). Baroness Hogg, Mr P E Y ea and Ms D R Collis did not advise the Committee on their 
own remuneration. During the year, PwC also provided the Group’s businesses with taxation advice, HR services, training services, due diligence
and advisory services in relation to investments and services of an employee on secondment. Kepler Associates did not provide any other
services to the Group during the year.

Directors’ report Directors’ remuneration report Auditors’ report Financial statements Additional financial information Information for shareholders
Background
The Company operates in the private equity and venture capital sector and is a constituent of the FTSE 100 Index. The majority of the
Company’s competitors are either partnerships of individuals managing funds for investment on behalf of third parties or unquoted subsidiaries
of larger banking or financial services groups. The private equity and venture capital sector continues to be well funded and the ability of 
trained and experienced executives to gain substantial rewards in the industry remains. Maintaining a remuneration structure to support 
the recruitment and retention of senior executives continues to be critical. In addition to cash bonuses, it is market practice for investment
executives in the private equity and venture capital sector to be given the opportunity to participate in carried interest schemes, which allow
executives to share directly in the future profits on investments, subject normally to a variety of conditions relating to the performance of
those investments. These are often coupled with co-investment schemes, which require participants in carried interest schemes to put money
of their own at risk.
The left hand graph below compares the Company’s total shareholder return (“3i TSR”) for the five financial years to 31 March 2007 with 
the total shareholder return of the FTSE All-Share Index. The Directors consider that since the Company invests in a broad range of industrial
and commercial sectors, this continues to be the most appropriate index against which to compare the Company’s total shareholder return.
Additional information is provided by the right hand graph below, which compares percentage changes in the Company’s diluted net asset 
value per share over each of the last five financial years (with dividends re-invested), with the Company’s total shareholder return and the 
FTSE All-Share Index total return over the same periods. This has been included as changes in net asset value have been one of the tests 
used in the Company’s long-term incentive schemes.
Directors’ remuneration policy
The Committee made no major changes in Directors’ remuneration policy during the year. Implementation of existing policy continued 
to develop. In particular:
(a) one executive Director participated in a co-investment plan, as approved by shareholders at the Company’s Annual General Meeting held 
on 12 July 2006 (the “2006 AGM”);
(b) a portion of the performance share awards made to executive Directors comprised Super-performance Share awards. These awards were
made subject to a particularly challenging performance condition. Further details are provided on pages 63 and 68; and
(c) the Committee considered appropriate remuneration arrangements for senior staff in the Group’s Infrastructure and Quoted Private Equity
businesses, including the Director responsible for Growth Capital and Infrastructure.

Non-executive Directors
The Company’s policy for the financial year to 31 March 2008 (the “coming year”) for non-executive Directors (including the Chairman)
continues to be to pay fees which are competitive with the fees paid by other financial services companies. Non-executive Directors are not
eligible for bonuses, share options, long-term incentives, pensions or performance-related remuneration. The Company does not currently
expect its policy on non-executive Directors’ remuneration for subsequent financial years to change significantly. Non-executive Directors’ 
fees (other than those of the Chairman, which are determined by the Committee) are regularly reviewed and determined by the Board 
as a whole, within the limits set by the Company’s Articles of Association, having taken advice from the Committee’s remuneration advisers. 
During the year the basic non-executive Director’s fee was £48,000 per annum. The annual fee for membership of the Audit and 
Compliance, Remuneration and Valuations Committees was £3,000 and the annual fee for Committee Chairmanship was £10,000. 
No fees were paid to Directors in respect of their membership of Nominations Committee.
Executive Directors
The Company’s policy for the coming year for executive Directors is to provide remuneration and other benefits sufficient to attract, retain 
and motivate executives of the calibre required. Variable remuneration (comprising annual cash bonuses, deferred share bonuses and long-term
incentives) is intended to form a substantial component of total remuneration.
(a) Salaries The Committee is sensitive to wider issues including pay and employment conditions elsewhere in the Group when setting
executive Directors’ pay levels and takes into account the Company’s reward strategy generally, before deciding specific packages for 
the executive Directors. The table below provides details of the average percentage increase in base salaries per annum for members 
of Management Committee (including executive Directors) and other executive staff in the UK who were in employment for the period from 
31 March 2006 to 31 March 2007.
% increase from 31 March 2006 
to 31 March 2007
Management Committee (including executive Directors) 6.47%
Other UK executive staff 11.61%
Salaries for Chief Executive and Finance Director The Company’s policy for the coming year in relation to the remuneration of the Chief
Executive and Finance Director is to pay salaries comparable to those paid by other financial services companies of broadly similar UK market
capitalisation. Salary supplements are paid to Mr P E Y ea and Mr S P Ball to enable them to make additional pension provision.
Salaries for Directors responsible for investment business The Company’s policy for the coming year in relation to the remuneration of 
Directors with responsibility for investment business continues to be to provide salaries comparable to those paid in the private equity and
venture capital industry.
(b) Annual bonuses Employees, including executive Directors, are eligible for discretionary annual bonuses. The Committee determines target
bonuses for each executive Director at the beginning of each year. These are intended to be competitive with arrangements in the financial
services industry or, in the case of Directors responsible for investment businesses, the private equity and venture capital industry. 
T arget bonuses are achievable if corporate performance targets, personal performance targets and, in the case of Directors responsible 
for investment businesses, business targets are met. During the year, executive Directors’ target bonuses were 90% of base salary, except 
that the target bonus for the Director responsible for Growth Capital and Infrastructure was 125%. Bonuses above target will only be paid for
outstanding performance, and the maximum is twice the target bonus. Bonuses above 1.5 times target will be in shares deferred for two years
and the Committee may decide that a higher proportion of bonus should be paid in deferred shares. The Committee retains discretion to make
adjustments to bonus arrangements in appropriate circumstances.
The main measures used to assess corporate performance for the year were: total shareholder return and change in net asset value per share
both in absolute terms and compared with the FTSE All-Share Index; total non market-driven return; and one to three-year internal rate of
return compared with performance of the private equity and venture capital industry as a whole. In forming its overall judgment the Committee
also took into account a number of more detailed indicators of performance and activity, such as the level of investment, realised profits 
and costs. The Committee’s view, after reviewing performance of the Company against the indicators outlined above, was that corporate
performance merited bonus levels above target. As this report shows, total shareholder return of 22.9% was well ahead of the FTSE All-Share
return of 11.1%; total return on opening shareholders’ funds was 26.8% and the greater part of this came from non market-driven factors. 
The two main business lines (Buyouts and Growth Capital) performed ahead of their published return targets during the year, and IRR
comparisons with the European private equity industry indicated strong outperformance by the Company over the three-year period.
Realisations were very high, and investment was significantly higher than in the year to 31 March 2006. While costs had risen, these were
mainly associated with the development of the Group’s business lines (including the continuing development of the Infrastructure team and 
the formation of a Quoted Private Equity team).
Directors’ remuneration report continued 3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 63
Directors’ report Directors’ remuneration report Auditors’ report Financial statements Additional financial information Information for shareholders
The Committee’s combined assessment of corporate and personal performance in the year led to awards in the upper part of the bonus range
for all three executive Directors. Within the maximum of two times target bonus, combined awards ranged from 1.8 to 1.89 times target,
which translated into 1 to 1.41 times salary in cash and 0.62 to 0.94 times salary in shares deferred for two years.
For the coming year, following consultation with major shareholders, the target bonus for the Chief Executive will be raised from 90% of base
salary to 125%, being the same level as the Director responsible for Growth Capital and Infrastructure, and the target bonus for the Finance
Director will be raised from 90% of base salary to 100%. For both the Chief Executive and the Finance Director, any bonus over 100% of base
salary will be in shares deferred for two years. The target bonus for the Director responsible for Growth Capital and Infrastructure will remain
125% of base salary with any bonus in excess of 1.5 times target paid in shares deferred for two years. Maximum bonuses for executive
Directors will continue to be twice target bonus.
(c) Long-term incentives The Committee determines the levels of long-term incentives. During the year, long-term incentive arrangements 
for the Chief Executive and Finance Director consisted of share options, Performance Share awards and Super-performance Share awards under
The 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan (“the Discretionary Share Plan”) and this will not change for the coming year.
During the year and following approval by shareholders at the 2006 AGM, Mr M J Queen, the Director responsible for Growth Capital and
Infrastructure, participated in co-investment arrangements and carried interest arrangements. Following consultation with major shareholders,
we are now making the following changes: (i) in order to reflect that Mr Queen will be giving up responsibility for Growth Capital by 1 April
2008 and concentrating on developing the Group’s infrastructure business, Mr Queen’s level of participation in the two-year 2006-08 Growth
Capital carried interest arrangement is being cut in half and he has not been eligible to make any further co-investment since 1 April 2007; 
(ii) in compensation for this, and in recognition for the fact that he received no carried interest or share of fees in relation to infrastructure
assets acquired in 2006-07, it is proposed to award him an exceptional bonus in the coming year, part of which is to be deferred over the
three years to 2009-10. Payments made during the year to 31 March 2008 will be reported in the 2008 Directors’ remuneration report; 
and (iii) Mr Queen will be eligible to participate in the new part-deferred bonus arrangement being introduced in the coming year for senior
members of the Infrastructure team, in place of carried interest, which is intended to provide similar long-term incentive awards and is based
on shares of the advisory fees and performance fees paid to the Group by 3i Infrastructure Limited. The aim is to align Mr Queen’s
remuneration arrangements both with the Group and with the objectives of investors in infrastructure assets, who expect to see much of their
return in the form of yield. The first payment under this new part-deferred bonus arrangement is expected to be made in the year to 31 March
2009 and will be reported in the 2009 Directors’ remuneration report. Mr Queen has also undertaken to invest £1 million of his own money in 
3i Infrastructure Limited shares over three years.
The Discretionary Share Plan The Discretionary Share Plan is a shareholder approved executive share plan conforming with the Association 
of British Insurers’ guidelines on dilution limits. The level of annual awards of options, Performance Shares and Super-performance Shares is
reviewed each year taking account of market practice, individual performance, the specific circumstances facing the Company and calculations
of the fair values of share options, Performance Shares and Super-performance Shares. During the year the Company’s policy was that
maximum annual awards should be market price options with an aggregate exercise price of six times annual salary, or three times salary in
respect of Performance Shares and Super-performance Shares. This was subject to an overall limit on the fair value of all share-based awards 
of two times salary. During the year awards with face values of approximately four times salary in share options, one half times salary in
Performance Shares and two times salary in Super-performance Shares were made to the Chief Executive and to the Finance Director. 
For the coming year the Committee proposes to maintain the limit of six times salary in nominal terms for an award made in share options and
maintain the limit of three times salary for awards in Performance Shares and Super-performance Shares, with any combination being subject 
to an overall limit on the fair value of all share-based awards in the year. Following consultation with major shareholders, this limit will be
increased; the limit for the coming year will be increased to 2.5 times annual salary. This change reflects the fact that the Chief Executive and
Finance Director do not participate in any carried interest or co-investment arrangements and reflects the introduction of Super-performance
Share awards, which must be awarded within this overall limit. The Committee’s remuneration advisers calculate the fair values of share-based
awards. For the coming year, these fair values have been calculated by the Committee’s remuneration advisers to be 23% of face value for
share options, 58% of face value for Performance Share awards and 23% of face value for Super-performance Share awards. These fair values
are subject to re-calculation in changing market conditions.
Co-investment plans and carried interest plans Shareholder approval was given at the 2006 AGM to enable executive Directors responsible 
for investment business to participate in co-investment plans established for the Group’s investment executives. Directors responsible for
investment business are also eligible to participate in carried interest plans, following approval by shareholders in 2004. The Company’s policy 
is that awards of carried interest are only normally made to executives who have taken up the opportunity offered to them of participating 
in co-investment plans. The Chief Executive and the Finance Director are not eligible to participate in co-investment plans or carried interest
plans. Decisions on an executive Director’s participation in co-investment plans and carried interest plans are taken by the Committee, taking
into account market practice and the Director’s investment responsibilities.
The Company does not currently expect its policy on executive Directors’ remuneration for subsequent financial years to change significantly. 3i Group plc

Share options
Options granted under the Company’s executive share option plans entitle executives to acquire ordinary shares, at an exercise price based 
on market price at the date of grant, from the third until the tenth anniversaries of grant to the extent, normally, that a performance condition
set at the time of the grant has been satisfied over a three year performance period.
The performance condition for options granted in the year was as follows:
Percentage
Annual percentage compound growth in net asset value per share with dividends re-invested, of the
relative to the annual percentage change in RPI grant vesting
Below RPI +3 percentage points 0%
At least RPI +3 percentage points 30%
At levels of performance between RPI +3 percentage points and RPI +8 percentage points the grant will vest pro rata
At least RPI +8 percentage points 100%
The performance condition is the same as for the year to 31 March 2006. In the year to 31 March 2005 the performance condition was also
the same save that the percentage of grant vesting at the minimum performance level was 50% instead of 30%. For options granted after 
31 March 2004 there is no opportunity for the performance condition to be retested after the three-year performance period.
For grants made between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2004 the condition required annual percentage compound growth in the net asset 
value per share (with dividends re-invested) of RPI plus 5 percentage points to achieve minimum vesting of 50% of the award and growth 
of RPI plus 10 percentage points for full vesting. For these grants, if the minimum threshold for vesting is not achieved in the three-year
performance period, the period is extended to four and then five years but from the same base year. Performance conditions for grants 
made before 1 April 2001 are set out on page 66.
These conditions are based on increases in net asset value per share to enable a significant proportion of relevant executive Directors’ potential
remuneration to be linked to an increase in the assets per share of the Company. The intention is to approximate to the performance conditions
attached to carried interest schemes in the private equity and venture capital industry whilst retaining the essential feature of aligning
executives’ interests with those of the Company’s shareholders. The performance conditions were chosen as being appropriately demanding 
in the prevailing market conditions at the time of grant. 3i Group plc

Notes
1 The fair values of awards made in the year were as follows: Mr P E Y ea, £729,000 and Mr S P Ball, £453,600. These fair values have been calculated by the Committee’s
remuneration advisers using a Monte Carlo simulation based on appropriate assumptions. The fair value of the share options granted during the year was calculated as being 
27% of the market value at the date of grant of the shares under option.
2 On 17 July 2006, the Company issued one B share for each 53
1
/ 8p ordinary share existing on 14 July 2006. This was followed by a share consolidation, of 11 new ordinary
shares of 62
69
/ 88p for every 13 ordinary shares of 53
1
/ 8p. This was designed to maintain the price per share, other things being equal, at the same level after the issue of 
B shares as before it. As a result of this consolidation there was no need to adjust the number of shares comprised in option awards or the exercise price per share and options
took effect following the consolidation as options over new ordinary shares of 62
69
/ 88p.
3 Options granted before 1 April 2001 were granted under The 3i Group 1994 Executive Share Option Plan (the “1994 Plan”) and are normally exercisable between the third and
tenth anniversaries of grant provided a performance condition was met over a rolling three-year period. This required adjusted net asset value per share (after adding back
dividends paid during the performance period) at the end of the three-year period to equal or exceed the net asset value per share at the beginning of the period compounded
annually over the period by the annual increase in the RPI plus 4%.
4 Options granted after 1 April 2001 were granted under the Discretionary Share Plan and the performance conditions are as set out on page 65.
5 The Committee determines the fulfilment of performance conditions based on calculations which are independently reviewed by the Company’s auditors. These performance
conditions require net asset value per share at the beginning and end of the performance period to be calculated on a consistent basis using the same accounting policies. 
Where accounting policies have altered between the beginning and end of the period, the Committee adjusts the net asset value calculations appropriately to ensure
consistency. The Committee also has power to adjust the calculations to reflect circumstances including changes to the capital of the Company. During the period 
the Committee made appropriate adjustments to reflect the issue of B shares, the consolidation of the Company’s share capital and the repurchase by the Company 
of its own shares.
6 The market price of ordinary shares in the Company at 31 March 2007 was 1136.0p and the range during the period 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007 was 819.6p to
1194.5p. Aggregate gains made by Directors on share option exercises in the year were £402,467 (2006: £199,158). The amount attributable to the highest paid Director
during the year was £nil (2006: £nil). Options were granted at no cost to the option holder with exercise prices not less than prevailing market value.
7 As at 31 March 2007 there were approximately 2.2 million shares available under the 5% dilution limit applicable to the Discretionary Share Plan arising from the guidelines 
issued by the Association of British Insurers and approximately 22.9 million shares available under the 10% dilution limit arising from those guidelines applicable to “all employee”
plans. In addition, approximately 3.3 million unallocated shares were held in an employee trust and were available for awards under the Discretionary Share Plan.

Performance Share and Super-performance Share awards
These are awards of shares which are transferred to the participant subject to forfeiture in certain circumstances. Awards are subject 
to a performance condition determining whether awards vest. Non-vested shares are forfeited.
(a) Performance Shares Awards of Performance Shares were made during the year. Performance Shares vest based on the Company’s
“percentage rank” by total shareholder return for the three years from grant (averaged over a 60 day period) compared to a comparator group.
This group consists of the FTSE 100 Index constituents at the grant date (adjusted for mergers, demergers and delistings during the
performance period). A company’s percentage rank is its rank in the comparator group divided by the number of companies in the group at the
end of the performance period expressed as a percentage. At a percentage rank below 50% no shares vest. At a rank of 50%, 35% of the
shares vest and at 75% all the shares vest. Between these points shares vest pro rata. This condition was chosen to align the interests of
participants and shareholders by linking remuneration to shareholder returns relative to a comparator index of which the Company is a
constituent. The Committee will determine whether the condition has been met based on calculations prepared by the Committee’s
remuneration advisers.

1 The fair values of Performance Share awards made in the year were as follows: Mr P E Y ea, £182,250 and Mr S P Ball, £113,400. These fair values were calculated by the
Committee’s remuneration adviser using a Monte Carlo simulation based on appropriate assumptions. The fair value of the Performance Shares awarded during the year was
calculated as being 58% of the market value at the date of award of the shares subject to the award.
2 Shares held at 1 April 2006 were ordinary shares of 53
1
/ 8p each. “Adjustment during the year” refers to the change in the number of shares in the award resulting from the
consolidation of the Company’s share capital on 17 July 2006. Shares held at 31 March 2007 are ordinary shares of 62
69
/ 88p each and B shares (cumulative preference shares 
of 1p each).
3 During the year, ordinary dividends on Performance Share awards were re-invested net of tax in further Company shares (as in previous years). These shares, which are in
addition to the above Performance Share awards, are required to be held for the remaining vesting period to which they relate, but are not forfeitable. Such shares attributable 
to Directors during the year were as follows: Mr P E Y ea, 3,082 shares; Mr S P Ball, 386 shares; and Mr M J Queen, 936 shares. 3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 68
(b) Super-performance Shares Awards of Super-performance Shares were also made during the year. Awards are subject to a particularly
challenging performance condition determining whether awards vest. The performance condition is measured over a three-year period. 
If the condition is satisfied, the shares remain subject to a further two-year holding period before they cease to be subject to forfeiture. 
The performance condition for awards granted in the year was as follows:
Percentage
of the 
Annual percentage compound growth in net asset value per share with dividends re-invested, relative to the annual percentage change in RPI grant vesting
Below RPI +10 percentage points 0%
At least RPI +10 percentage points 25%
At levels of performance between RPI +10 percentage points and RPI +13.5 percentage points 
the grant will vest pro rata (between 25 per cent and 50 per cent of the grant)
At least RPI +13.5 percentage points 50%
At levels of performance between RPI + 13.5 percentage points and RPI +17 percentage points 
the grant will vest pro rata (between 50 per cent and 100 per cent of the grant)
At least RPI +17 percentage points 100%
The performance condition was chosen to add to the mix of long-term incentives a further incentive to achieve outstanding levels of
shareholder returns. The Committee will determine whether the condition has been met based on calculations independently reviewed 
by the Company’s auditors.

Share Incentive Plan
The HM Revenue and Customs approved Share Incentive Plan is open to eligible UK employees and is intended to encourage employees to 
invest in the Company’s shares. Accordingly it is not subject to a performance condition. Participants invest up to £125 per month from 
pre-tax salary in shares (“partnership shares”). For each partnership share the Company grants two free shares (“matching shares”) which 
are normally forfeited if employment ceases (other than on retirement) within three years of grant. Dividends are re-invested in further shares
(“dividend shares”).

Co-investment plans and carried interest plans
Participants in co-investment plans invest their own money in the plan relating to the area of the business in which they work. Plans are organised
by business line and geography with each plan investing in all investments made by the Group within the relevant business line and geography
over a specified time period (usually two years). Participants provide at least one-third of the capital to finance the plans and the Group not more
than two-thirds. The plans invest in investments alongside the Group on terms which are in all material respects the same as the terms on which
the Group and its funds under management invest. For the period 2006 to 2008 the plans will fund 1% (2% in the US Growth plan) of the total
budgeted investment made by the Group and its funds under management, including the plans. Plans share (in proportion to their investment) in
the profits and losses made on those investments in the same way as the Group and its funds under management. Proceeds realised on
investments made by the Plans are applied first to repaying the amount invested by the Group together with a management charge and a
preferential return fixed by Remuneration Committee. For the period 2006 to 2008 this will be 2% over the relevant inter-bank lending rate per
annum compound. The remaining proceeds will be distributed to participants as a return on their investment.
Participants in carried interest plans are entitled to the profits made on the proportion of the total carried interest allocated to them subject 
to the satisfaction of a performance condition which is determined in advance by the Committee, in line with market conditions at the time 
of the award. The total carried interest, for all executives eligible to participate in each plan, does not exceed 15% of the relevant pool of
investments made over a specific period (usually two years). The proportion of the total carried interest that is allocated to an executive
Director depends, amongst other matters, on the size of his investment team. The carried interest plans are designed to follow best practice 
in the private equity and venture capital industry.
As mentioned on page 63, Mr Queen’s level of participation in the two-year (2006-08) Growth Capital carried interest arrangement is being
cut by half. He will also not be eligible to make any further co-investment after 1 April 2007. 3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 70
In the tables below, interests in co-investment and carried interest plans are expressed in terms of a percentage of the relevant pools 
of investments in respect of which the participant has an interest, subject to fulfilment of relevant conditions.
The tables also show the accrued value of co-investment and carried interest at the end of the year. The carried interest accrued values are
calculated on the basis set out in note 5 on page 83. Accrued values can increase and decrease with investment valuations and other factors
and will not necessarily lead to a payment of the relevant amount to the participant.

1 As explained above, Mr Queen’s level of participation in the Global Growth 2006-08 carried interest plan is being reduced by half following the changes to his responsibilities. 
The figure shown is after this reduction.
2 No carried interest plan has been established for infrastructure investments made in the year to 31 March 2007.
3 Normally, before any payment to a participant becomes due under the carried interest plans, the Group and funds under its management must first have received back the 
amount of their investment in the relevant vintage together with a 1.5% per annum management charge (2% for the Global Growth 2006-08 plans) and a hurdle rate of 8% 
per annum compound on their investment.

Pension arrangements
The executive Directors are members of the 3i Group Pension Plan, a defined benefit contributory scheme which from 1 April 2006 has not
been offered to new participants. The plan provides for a maximum pension of two-thirds of final pensionable salary (limited, in the case of
members joining on or after 1 June 1989, to the plan earnings cap) on retirement (normally at age 60). For members of the plan who joined
before 1 September 2002, the pension accrues at the rate of 1/37.5 times final pensionable salary per year of service in respect of service
from 1 December 2006. For members who joined the plan between 1 September 2002 and 31 March 2006 inclusive (which includes 
Mr P E Y ea and Mr S P Ball), the pension accrues at the rate of 1/50 times final pensionable salary per year of service. The plan also provides
death-in-service cover of four times final pensionable salary (limited to the earnings cap where this applies), pensions payable in the event 
of ill health and spouses’ pensions on death. Further details of the plan are set out in note 9 to the financial statements on pages 85 and 86.
Pension entitlements of Directors who served during the year are set out below. The final column of the table gives the difference between the
transfer value of the Director’s pension entitlement at the start of the year and the transfer value at the end, less the contributions paid by the
Director. The difference over the year is the result of any extra benefits earned over the year and any change in the value placed on £1 per
annum of pension by the actuaries. The value placed on £1 per annum of pension reflects financial conditions at the time (eg the level of the
stock market or returns available on government bonds) and the method and assumptions the actuaries use to calculate transfer values from
time to time. Changes in the value placed on £1 per annum of pension can be positive or negative and can have much greater impact than the
actual pension benefits earned.

Notes
1 The increase in accrued pension shown reflects the difference between deferred pensions on leaving, payable from age 60.
2 The pensions shown are deferred pensions payable from age 60.
3 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the relevant professional guidance applicable at 31 March 2007 (Actuarial Guidance
Note GN11 (version 9.2)).
4 The transfer values have been calculated on the basis of actuarial advice in accordance with the relevant professional guidance applicable at 31 March 2006 (Actuarial Guidance
Note GN11 (version 9.2)).
5 Additional voluntary contributions are excluded from the above table.
6 The pensions shown above become payable at a Normal Retirement Age of 60. On early retirement from active membership of the plan, there is a discretionary practice 
of calculating the early retirement pension by applying a reduction factor less than the standard factor, in accordance with Company policy. This is not available to deferred
pensioners and no allowance for it is made in the calculations of cash equivalents for deferred pensioners under the plan.
Deferred pensions in excess of the guaranteed minimum pension (“GMP”) are increased in the deferment period according to statutory
requirements (subject to an annual minimum of 3% per annum on pension accrued prior to 1 July 2004 for those members who joined the
plan before 7 February 1992). GMPs are increased at fixed rate revaluation with increases vesting at Normal Retirement Age. For members
who joined the plan before 1 September 2002, pensions in respect of service before 1 July 2004 and in excess of the GMP increase each year 
in payment to match the increase in the RPI since the pension started (or 30 June 1989, if later), subject to an annual maximum of 7.5% per
annum and a minimum of 3% per annum. Pensions for members who joined the plan after 1 September 2002 and pensions in respect of
service on or after 1 July 2004 for members who joined the plan before 1 September 2002 increase each year in payment to match the RPI
subject to a maximum increase in any year of 7.5% and a minimum of 0%. On death in deferment or after retirement, a two-thirds pension is
payable to the member’s spouse. Dependants’ pensions may be payable in the absence of a spouse’s pension. In addition, on death within the
first five years of retirement, a lump sum is payable equal to the balance of five years’ pension. 3i Group plc

Directors’ service contracts
The Chairman and the non-executive Directors hold office under the Company’s Articles of Association and do not have service contracts.
Their appointment letters provide that there is no entitlement to compensation or other benefits on ceasing to be a Director.
Company policy is that executive Directors’ notice periods should not normally exceed one year. Mr P E Y ea, Mr S P Ball and Mr M J Queen 
have employment contracts with 3i plc dated 27 July 2004, 19 April 2005, and 22 June 1987 respectively. These contracts are terminable 
on 12 months’ notice given by the Company or six months’ notice given by the employee. Save for these notice periods the contracts have no
unexpired terms. There are no provisions for compensation of executive Directors on early termination save that the Company can elect to give
pay in lieu of notice. In the case of Mr Y ea, the Company can also elect to terminate employment without notice subject to making 12 monthly
payments thereafter equivalent to monthly basic pay and benefits less any amounts earned from alternative employment.
The Committee considers that compensation payments on early termination of employment should depend on individual circumstances. 
The duty of Directors to mitigate their loss will always be a relevant factor.
Historic award
An historic award held during the year by a Director under the Management Equity Investment Plan lapsed based on a performance condition
relating to the period to 31 March 2007. The award would have entitled the Director to acquire shares at nil cost subject to the performance
condition described in the note below.

Y ear of 1 April during during 31 March
grant 2006 the year the year 2007
M J Queen 2000 25,776 – (25,776) –
Note
Under the performance condition no shares were to vest unless the Company’s total shareholder return over a three-year performance period (averaged over the six months
before the beginning and end of the period) equalled or exceeded the compound annual increases in the RPI over the period +6% per annum. As the minimum performance
condition was not achieved over the three-year period to 31 March 2003, the performance period was extended annually to the maximum length of seven years from the base
year. This performance period expired on 31 March 2007. The Group’s Human Resources department calculated whether the performance condition had been satisfied and this
calculation was audited by Ernst & Young LLP . Based on this calculation, the Committee determined in May 2007 that the performance condition had not been met and that the
award had lapsed as at 31 March 2007.

Independent auditors’ report to the members of 3i Group plc
We have audited the Group and parent company financial statements (the “financial statements”) of 3i Group plc for the year to 31 March
2007 which comprise the Consolidated income statement, the Group and parent company Statement of recognised income and expense, 
the Group and parent company Reconciliation of movements in equity, the Group and parent company Balance sheets, the Group and parent
company Cash flow statement and the related notes 1 to 35. These financial statements have been prepared under the accounting policies set
out therein. We have also audited the information in the Directors’ remuneration report that is described as having been audited. 
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditors’
report and for no other purpose. T o the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the
Company and the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of directors and auditors
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual report and the Group financial statements in accordance with applicable United Kingdom
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the European Union, as set out in the Statement of Directors’ responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland).
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and whether the financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and, in
addition, the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. We also report to 
you whether in our opinion the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information
and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by law regarding directors’ remuneration and other transactions is 
not disclosed.
We review whether the corporate governance statement reflects the Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the 2003 Combined
Code specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are not required to
consider whether the Board’s statements on internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion on the effectiveness of the Group’s
corporate governance procedures or its risk and control procedures.
We read other information contained in the Annual report and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. The other
information comprises only the unaudited part of the Directors’ remuneration report, Portfolio valuation methodology, T en largest investments,
Forty other large investments, Assets under management, Investment, Realisations, Private equity and venture capital – a lexicon, Returns and
IRRs – an explanation and Carried interest – an explanation. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices Board. 
An audit includes examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements and the part 
of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited. It also includes an assessment of the significant estimates and judgments made by the
directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s and Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we considered necessary in order to provide 
us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report 
to be audited are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration
report to be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
– the Group financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state of 
the Group’s affairs as at 31 March 2007 and of its profit for the year then ended;
– the Group financial statements have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the 
IAS Regulation;
– the parent company financial statements give a true and fair view, in accordance with IFRS as adopted by the European Union, of the state
of the parent company’s affairs as at 31 March 2007; 
– the parent company financial statements and the part of the Directors’ remuneration report to be audited have been properly prepared in
accordance with the Companies Act 1985; and
– the information given in the Directors’ report is consistent with the financial statements.

Report and accounts 2007 78
Significant accounting policies
3i Group plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements for the year to 31 March
2007 comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). Separate financial statements of the Company are also
presented. The accounting policies of the Company are the same as for the Group except where separately disclosed.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 9 May 2007.
A Statement of compliance
These consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International Accounting Standards
and their interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted for use in the European Union (“IFRS”).
These consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and in compliance with the Companies Act 1985.
New standards and interpretations not applied
The IASB has issued the following standards and interpretations to be applied to financial statements with periods commencing on or after the following dates:
Effective for period beginning on or after
IAS 1 Amendment – Presentation of Financial Statements: Capital Disclosures 1 January 2007
IFRS 7 Financial Instruments: Disclosures 1 January 2007
IFRS 8 Operating Segments 1 January 2009
The Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a material impact on the financial statements in the period of initial
application and have decided not to early adopt.
Change in accounting policies
During the year, the Group has adopted IFRIC Interpretation 11 IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions, which has been applied retrospectively in accordance with 
the requirements of IAS 8, subject to the transitional provisions of IFRS 2. The impact of this change is to increase the Company’s interest in Group entities by £17 million, 
with a corresponding increase in equity, as at 31 March 2006. The change has no impact on the results of the Group.
B Basis of preparation
The financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency of the Company, rounded to the nearest million pounds (£m) except where otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgments, estimates and assumptions that affect the application of policies
and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are
believed to be reasonable under the circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgments about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not
readily apparent from other sources. Actual results may differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which the estimate is revised if
the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and future periods. The most significant techniques
for estimation are described in the accounting policies below and in the valuation methodology (page 98).
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. The income statement of the
Company has been omitted from these financial statements in accordance with section 230 of the Companies Act 1985.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied across all Group entities for the purposes of producing these consolidated financial statements.
C Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating policies of 
an entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control
commences until the date that control ceases.
(ii) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Investments that are held as part of the
Group’s investment portfolio are carried in the balance sheet at fair value even though the Group may have significant influence over those companies. This treatment is
permitted by IAS 28 Investment in Associates, which requires investments held by venture capital organisations to be excluded from its scope where those investments are
designated, upon initial recognition, as at fair value through profit or loss and accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, with changes in fair value recognised in the income
statement in the period of the change. The Group has no interests in associates through which it carries on its business.
(iii) Joint ventures
Joint ventures are those entities over whose activities the Group has joint control, established by contractual agreement. Interests in joint ventures through which the Group
carries on its business are classified as jointly controlled entities and accounted for using the equity method.
Interests in joint ventures that are held as part of the Group’s investment portfolio are carried in the balance sheet at fair value. This treatment is permitted by IAS 31
Interests in Joint Ventures, which requires venturer’s interests held by venture capital organisations to be excluded from its scope where those investments are designated,
upon initial recognition, as at fair value through profit or loss and accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, with changes in fair value recognised in the income statement in
the period of the change. The Group has no interests in joint ventures through which it carries on its business. 3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 79
D Exchange differences
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies different from the functional currency of the Group entity entering into the transaction are translated at the exchange rate ruling at the date of 
the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the income statement. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that are measured in terms of historical cost in
a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Non-monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at
fair value are translated to sterling using exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value was determined.
(ii) Financial statements of non-sterling operations
The assets and liabilities of operations whose functional currency is not sterling, including fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to sterling at exchange
rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of these operations are translated to sterling at rates approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the
dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised directly in a separate component of equity, the Translation reserve, and are released
upon disposal of the non-sterling operation.
In respect of non-sterling operations, cumulative translation differences on the consolidation of non-sterling operations are being accumulated from the date of transition to
IFRS, 1 April 2004, and not from the original acquisition date.
E Investment portfolio
(i) Recognition and measurement
Investments are recognised and derecognised on a date where the purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require the delivery or settlement 
of the investments. The Group manages its investments with a view to profiting from the receipt of dividends and changes in fair value of equity investments. Therefore, all
quoted investments and unquoted equity investments are designated as at fair value through profit or loss and subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value. Other
investments including loan investments and fixed income shares are classified as loans and receivables and subsequently carried in the balance sheet at amortised cost less
impairment. All investments are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and held at this value until it is appropriate to measure fair value on a different
basis, applying 3i Group plc’s valuation policies. Acquisition costs are attributed to equity investments and recognised immediately in the income statement.
(ii) Income
Gross portfolio return is equivalent to “revenue” for the purposes of IAS 1. It represents the overall increase in net assets from the investment portfolio net of deal-related
costs but excluding exchange movements. Investment income is analysed into the following components:
(a) Realised profits over value on the disposal of investments are the difference between the fair value of the consideration received less any directly attributable costs, 
on the sale of equity and the repayment of loans and receivables, and its carrying value at the start of the accounting period, converted into sterling using the exchange 
rates in force at the date of disposal.
(b) Unrealised profits on the revaluation of investments are the movement in the carrying value of investments between the start and end of the accounting period
converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of the movement.
(c) Portfolio income is that portion of income that is directly related to the return from individual investments. It is recognised to the extent that it is probable that there 
will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must be met before the income is recognised:
– Income from loans and receivables is recognised as it accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable, which is the rate that
exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset to the asset’s carrying value.
– Dividends from equity investments are recognised in the income statement when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment have been established except to the extent
that dividends, paid out of pre-acquisition reserves, adjust the fair value of the equity investment. 
– Fee income is earned directly from investee companies when an investment is first made and through the life of the investment. Fees that are earned on a financing
arrangement are considered to relate to a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss and are recognised when that investment is made. Fees that are
earned on the basis of providing an ongoing service to the investee company are recognised as that service is provided.
F Fees receivable from external funds
(i) Fund management fees
The Group manages private equity funds, which primarily co-invest alongside the Group. Fees earned from the ongoing management of these funds are recognised to the
extent that it is probable that there will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably measured.
(ii) Advisory fees
The Group acts as investment advisor to private equity funds. Fees earned from the provision of investment advisory services are recognised on an accruals basis in
accordance with the substance of the relevant investment advisory agreement.
(iii) Performance fees
The Group earns a performance fee from funds to which it provides investment advisory services where specified performance targets are achieved. Performance fees are
recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably measured.
(iv) Support services fees
The Group provides support services to external funds, including accounting, treasury management, corporate secretariat and investor relations. Fees earned from the
provision of these support services are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the relevant support services agreement.

G Carried interest
(i) Carried interest receivable
The Group earns a share of profits (“carried interest receivable”) from funds which it manages on behalf of third parties. These profits are earned once the funds meet certain
performance conditions.
Carried interest receivable is only accrued on those managed funds in which the fund’s performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved 
if the remaining assets in the fund were realised at fair value. Fair value is determined using the Group’s valuation methodology and is measured at the balance sheet date. 
An accrual is made equal to the Group’s share of profits in excess of the performance conditions, taking into account the cash already returned to fund investors and the 
fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
(ii) Carried interest payable
The Group offers investment executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from successful investments. “Carried interest payable” is the term used for amounts
payable to executives on investment-related transactions.
A variety of asset pooling arrangements are in place so that executives may have an interest in one or more carried interest scheme. Carried interest payable is only accrued
on those schemes in which the scheme’s performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the remaining assets in the scheme were realised
at fair value. An accrual is made equal to the executive’s share of profits in excess of the performance conditions in place in the carried interest scheme.
H Property, plant and equipment
(i) Land and buildings
Land and buildings are carried in the balance sheet at fair value less depreciation and impairment. Fair value is determined at each balance sheet date from valuations
undertaken by professional valuers using market-based evidence. Any revaluation surplus is credited directly to the Capital reserve in equity except to the extent that it
reverses a previous valuation deficit on the same asset charged in the income statement in which case the surplus is recognised in the income statement to the extent 
of the previous deficit. Any revaluation deficit that offsets a previously recognised surplus in the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the Capital reserve. 
Any excess valuation deficit over and above that previously recognised in surplus is charged in the income statement.
Depreciation on revalued buildings is charged in the income statement over its estimated useful life, generally over 50 years.
(ii) Vehicles and office equipment
Vehicles and office equipment are depreciated by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives as follows: office equipment five years; computer equipment 
three years; computer software three years; motor vehicles four years.
(iii) Assets held under finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful life on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the lease term. Assets are reviewed for
impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The interest element of the rental obligations is charged in
the income statement over the period of the agreement and represents a constant proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
I Treasury assets and liabilities
Short-term treasury assets and short and long-term treasury liabilities are used in order to manage cash flows and overall costs of borrowing. Financial assets and liabilities
are recognised in the balance sheet when the relevant Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. De-recognition occurs when rights to
cash flows from a financial asset expire, or when a liability is extinguished.
(i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months or less. For the purposes
of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits as defined above and other short-term highly liquid investments that are
readily convertible into cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, net of bank overdrafts.
(ii) Deposits
Deposits in the balance sheet comprise longer term deposits with an original maturity of greater than three months.
(iii) Bank loans, loan notes and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings. After initial recognition, 
these are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through 
the expected life of the liabilities. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any discount or premium on settlement.
(iv) Convertible Bonds
Where  Convertible Bonds have an issuer cash settlement option, the Convertible Bonds are regarded as compound instruments consisting of a liability and a derivative
instrument (see policy below for derivatives). On issue of the Convertible Bonds, the fair value of the derivative component is determined using a market rate for an
equivalent derivative. Subsequent to initial recognition the conversion option is measured as a derivative financial instrument. The remainder of the proceeds are allocated 
to the liability component and this amount is carried as a long-term liability on the amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion or redemption.
(v) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage the risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations of the investment portfolio and changes in interest rates on its
borrowings. This is achieved by the use of foreign currency contracts, currency swaps and interest-rate swaps. All derivative financial instruments are held at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the contract date and subsequently remeasured to the fair value at each reporting date. The fair value
of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange contracts for contracts with similar maturity profiles. The fair value of currency swaps
and interest-rate swaps is determined with reference to future cash flows and current interest and exchange rates. All changes in the fair value of financial instruments are
taken to the income statement.
(vi) Subordinated liabilities
The Group has some limited recourse funding, which individually finances investment assets, at various fixed rates of interest and whose maturity is dependent upon 
the disposal of the associated assets. This funding is subordinated to other creditors of the individual Group entity to which the funds have been advanced and becomes 
non-repayable as the assets fail. These liabilities are held in the balance sheet at the amount expected to be repayable based on the underlying assets. Changes in the
amounts repayable as a result of changes in the underlying assets are treated as other income in the income statement. Interest payable on subordinated liabilities is 
charged as it accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective interest rate applicable. 3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 81
J Employee benefits
(i) Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged to the income statement as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit method with actuarial valuations being carried out each balance
sheet date. Current service costs are recognised in the income statement. Past service costs are recognised to the extent that they are vested in the income statement.
Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in full as they arise as part of the statement of recognised income and expense.
A retirement benefit deficit is recognised in the balance sheet to the extent that the present value of the defined benefit obligations exceeds the fair value of plan assets.
A retirement benefit surplus is recognised in the balance sheet where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit obligations limited to the
extent that the Group can benefit from that surplus.
(ii) Share-based payments
In accordance with the transitional provisions of IFRS 1, the requirements of IFRS 2 have been applied to all grants of equity instruments after 7 November 2002, that were
unvested at 1 January 2005.
The Group enters into arrangements that are equity-settled share-based payments with certain employees. These are measured at fair value at the date of grant, which 
is then recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is
measured by use of an appropriate model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price 
of the shares of 3i Group plc. The charge is adjusted at each balance sheet date to reflect the actual number of forfeitures, cancellations and leavers during the period. 
The movement in cumulative changes since the previous balance sheet is recognised in the income statement, with a corresponding entry in equity.
K Other assets
Assets, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated at their cost less impairment losses. They are reviewed at each balance sheet date to
determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated based on expected discounted future cash
flows. Any change in the level of impairment is recognised directly in the income statement. An impairment loss is reversed at subsequent balance sheet dates to the extent
that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed its carrying value had no impairment been recognised.
L Other liabilities
Liabilities, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated based on the amounts which are considered to be payable in respect of goods or
services received up to the balance sheet date.
M Share capital
Ordinary shares issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds or fair value received with the excess of the amount received over nominal value being credited to the
share premium account. Direct issue costs net of tax are deducted from equity.
N Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation of uncertain timing or amount as a result of past events, and it is probable that the Group will be required
to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made. The provisions are measured at the Directors’ best estimate of the amount to settle the
obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value if the effect is material. Changes in provisions are recognised in the income statement for the period.
O Income taxes
Income taxes represent the sum of the tax currently payable, withholding taxes suffered and deferred tax. T ax is charged or credited in the income statement, except where it
relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. This may differ from the profit included in the consolidated income statement because it excludes items
of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or deductible. The Group’s liability for current tax is
calculated using tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the
corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit (“temporary differences”), and is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Where there are taxable differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates,
and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax liabilities are recognised except where the Group is able to control reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the
temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are generally recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be
utilised. However, where there are deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and associates, and interests in joint ventures, deferred
tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that both the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available
against which the temporary differences can be utilised, and that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at each balance sheet date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profits will be
available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if the temporary differences arise from the initial recognition of goodwill and other assets and liabilities in a transaction
that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised using tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

total investment-related fees paid to the four largest accounting firms.
Ernst & Young LLP also acts as auditor to the 3i Group Pension Plan. 
The appointment of the auditors to this Plan and the fees paid in respect of the 
audit are agreed by the trustees who act independently from the management of
the Group. The aggregate fees paid to the Group’s auditors for audit services to the

8 Share-based payments (continued)
The features of the Group’s share schemes are set out below. For legal or regulatory
reasons certain participants may be granted “phantom awards” under these schemes,
which are intended to replicate the financial effects of a share award without
entitling the participant to acquire shares.
Share options
(i)The 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan Options granted after 31 March 2001
were granted under the Discretionary Share Plan and are normally exercisable
between the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant to the extent a
performance target has been met over a performance period of three years from the
date of grant. For options granted between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2003 and
for options granted to three Directors in June 2003, if the minimum threshold for
vesting is not achieved in the first three years from grant, the performance period is
extended to four and then five years from the date of grant. For options granted
between 1 April 2003 and 31 March 2004 the performance period is extended only
to four years from the date of grant. For options granted after 31 March 2004,
there is no opportunity for the performance condition to be retested after the three-
year performance period.
Options granted between 1 April 2001 and 31 March 2003 were subject to a
performance condition that options would vest if the annual compound growth
(“ACG”) in net asset value per share with dividends re-invested was RPI plus 5%. 
If this target was achieved then 50% of the options would vest. If the ACG 
was in excess of RPI plus 10% then the maximum number of shares would 
vest. Options would vest pro rata if the ACG was between these two amounts. 
For options granted after 31 March 2003 the target ACG was RPI plus 3% with
maximum vesting at RPI plus 8%, except for options granted to three Directors 
in June 2003 where the target ACG was RPI plus 5% with maximum vesting at 
RPI plus 10%. 
(ii) The 3i Group 1994 Executive Share Option Plan Options granted before 
31 March 2001 were granted under this plan and are normally exercisable between
the third and tenth anniversaries of the date of grant provided that a performance
condition has been met over a rolling three-year period. This requires that the
adjusted net asset value per share (with dividends re-invested) at the end of the
three-year period is equal to or in excess of the net asset value per share at the
beginning of the period compounded annually over the period by the annual increase
in the RPI plus 4%.

Options are exercisable at a price based on the market value of the Company’s
shares on the date of grant.
The weighted average share price at the date of exercise during the year was 1054p
(2006: 850p). The options outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted
average contractual life of 6.34 years (2006: 6.35 years). The cost of share options
is spread over the vesting period of three to five years. The weighted average fair
value of options granted during the year was 331p (2006: 218p). These fair values
were calculated using the Black-Scholes option pricing model.
The inputs to this model were as follows:
2007 2006
Weighted average share price (pence) 849 692
Average expected volatility (%) 29 27
Expected life (years) 8.5 8.5
Average risk-free rate (%) 4.6 4.3
Average expected dividend yield (%) 1.6 2.0
The expected life of the option is based on the best estimate of the Directors
following a review of the profile of the award holders. Expected volatility was
determined using an average of the implied volatility on grant and historic share price
volatility of the preceding 8.5 years. No options have been repriced during the year
(2006: nil). 
Performance share awards
Performance share awards made under the 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan are
awards of shares to executives which are transferred to the participant by the 
3i Group Employee Trust on terms that the shares may, in certain circumstances, 
be forfeited. While the shares are subject to forfeiture they may not be sold,
transferred or used as security. Awards are subject to a performance condition
determining whether and to what extent the award will vest. Non-vested shares 
are forfeited. Two types of awards have been made: standard awards and Super-
performance Shares. 
The performance condition for standard awards provides for shares to vest based on
the Company’s “percentage rank” by total shareholder return for the period of three
years from grant (averaged over a 60 day period) compared to a comparator group.
The comparator group consists of the FTSE 100 Index constituents at the grant date
(adjusted for mergers, demergers and delistings during the performance period). 
A company’s percentage rank is its rank in the comparator group divided by the
number of companies in the group at the end of the performance period expressed
as a percentage. If the Company’s percentage rank is less than 50% none of the
shares vest. At a percentage rank of 50%, 35% of the shares vest and at 75% all 
the shares vest. Between these points shares vest pro rata.
8 Share-based payments (continued)
The performance condition for Super-performance Shares provides for shares to 
vest based on a performance condition measured over a three-year period. T o the
extent the shares vest the shares remain subject to a further two-year holding
period before they cease to be subject to forfeiture. The performance condition
requires annual percentage compound growth in the net asset value per share 
(with dividends re-invested) over the three-year period of RPI plus 10 percentage
points to achieve minimum vesting of 25% of the award and growth of RPI plus 
17 percentage points for full vesting. Between these levels shares vest pro rata.
Share Incentive Plan Eligible UK employees may participate in an Inland Revenue
approved Share Incentive Plan intended to encourage employees to invest in the
Company’s shares. Accordingly it is not subject to a performance condition. During
the year participants could invest up to £125 per month from their pre-tax salaries
in the Company’s shares (referred to as partnership shares). For each share so
acquired the Company grants two free additional shares (referred to as matching
shares) which are normally subject to forfeiture if the employee ceases to be
employed (other than by reason of retirement) within three years of grant. 
Dividends are re-invested on behalf of participants in further shares (referred to as
dividend shares).
Deferred Bonus Share Plan Certain employees receive an element of their bonus as
shares. These shares are held in trust for two years by the trustee of the 3i Group
Employee Trust in a nominee capacity. The fair value of the deferred shares is the
share price at date of the award.
Employee trust The Group has established the 3i Group Employee Trust which holds
shares in 3i Group plc to meet its obligations under certain share schemes. The share
schemes which use this trust are the 3i Group Discretionary Share Plan and the
Deferred Bonus Share Plan.
9 Retirement benefit deficit
Retirement benefit plans
(i) Defined contribution plans The Group operates a number of defined contribution
retirement benefit plans for qualifying employees throughout the Group. The assets
of these plans are held separately from those of the Group. The employees of the
Group’s subsidiaries in France are members of a state-managed retirement benefit
plan operated by the country’s government. The French subsidiary is required to
contribute a specific percentage of payroll costs to the retirement benefit scheme to
fund the benefits.
The total expense recognised in profit or loss is £4 million (2006: £4 million), which
represents the contributions payable to these plans. There were no outstanding
payments due to these plans at the balance sheet date.
(ii) Defined benefit scheme The Group operates a final salary defined benefit plan
for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK. The plan has not been offered
to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006. The plan is a funded scheme, the
assets of which are independent of the Company’s finances and are administered by
the trustees.
The last full actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2004 was updated on an IAS 19 basis
by an independent qualified actuary as at 31 March 2007.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries and used for the purpose of the
year end valuation were as follows:
2007 2006
Discount rate 5.0% 4.6%
Expected rate of salary increases 4.5% 4.2%
Expected rate of pension increases 3.1% 3.0%
Price inflation 3.0% 2.7%
Expected return on Plan assets 6.1% 5.7%
The post-retirement mortality assumptions used to value the benefit obligation at
31 March 2006 and 31 March 2007 are based on the “PA92 medium cohort” 
table with a current year of use. The life expectancy of a male member reaching age
60 in 2027 is projected to be 27.9 years compared to 26.7 years for someone
reaching 60 in 2007. 3i Group plc

Employees in Germany are entitled to a pension based on their length of service. 
3i Deutschland GmbH contributes to individual investment policies for its employees
and has agreed to indemnify any shortfall on an employee’s investment policy should
it arise. The total value of 3i Deutschland GmbH’s investment policies intended 
to cover pension liabilities is £3 million (2006: £3 million) and the future liability
calculated by German actuaries is £5 million (2006: £4 million). The Group carries
both the asset and liability in its consolidated financial statements and has recognised
an actuarial loss of £1 million (2006: nil).

to be approved as an investment trust. An investment trust is exempt from tax on

At 31 March 2007 the Group had tax losses carried forward of £588 million 
(2006: £560 million). It is unlikely that the Group will generate sufficient taxable
profits in the future to utilise these amounts and therefore no deferred tax asset 
has been recognised. These tax losses are available to carry forward indefinitely.

18 Financial risk management
The funding objective of the Group and Company is that each category of
investment is broadly matched with liabilities and shareholders’ funds according 
to the risk and maturity characteristics of the assets and that funding needs are 
met ahead of planned investment.
Credit risk
Financial assets are predominantly unsecured investments in unquoted companies, 
in which the maximum credit risk is considered to be the carrying value of the asset.
The portfolio is well diversified and for this reason credit risk exposure is managed 
on an asset-specific basis by investment managers.
Liquidity risk
During the financial year 3i generated a surplus of £857 million (2006: 
£1,089 million) from its operating activities, and cash resources at the end of 
the period amounted to £2,154 million (2006: £1,955 million). In addition, the
Group had available to it undrawn facilities of £491 million at 31 March 2007
(2006: £488 million).
Price risk
The valuation of unquoted investments depends upon a combination of market
factors and the performance of the underlying asset. The Group does not currently
hedge the price risk inherent in the portfolio but manages asset performance risk on
an asset-specific basis. 3i Group plc

18 Financial risk management (continued)
Foreign exchange risk 
The Group reports in sterling and pays dividends from sterling profits. Structural currency exposures are reduced by matching assets denominated in foreign currency with
borrowings in the same currency. The Group makes some use of derivative financial instruments to effect foreign exchange management. The exposure to the Euro, US dollar,
Swedish krona, Indian rupee, Swiss franc and all other currencies combined, is shown in the table below.

Cash flow interest rate risk
The Group has a mixture of fixed and floating rate assets. The assets are funded with a mixture of shareholders’ funds and borrowings according to the risk characteristics of
the assets. The interest rate exposure is minimised by matching the type and maturity of the borrowings to those of the corresponding assets. Some derivative instruments
are used to achieve this objective.
The interest rate profile of the financial assets and liabilities of the Group is shown in the table below by the earlier of the contractual repricing or maturity date.

The derivatives line shows the notional value of interest rate swaps.
Interest on financial instruments classified as floating rate is repriced at intervals of less than one year. Interest on financial instruments classified as fixed rate is fixed until the
maturity of the instrument. The other financial instruments of the Group that are not included in the above tables are non-interest bearing and are therefore not subject to
interest rate risk.
Fair value interest rate risk
The fair value of the Group’s derivative assets and liabilities is subject to interest rate risk. At 31 March 2007 the fair value of derivative financial instruments was 
£168 million (2006: £149 million). 3i Group plc

Forward foreign exchange contracts and currency swaps
The Group uses forward exchange contracts and currency swaps to minimise the effect of fluctuations in the value of the investment portfolio from movement in exchange
rates. Foreign currency interest-bearing loans and borrowings are also used for this purpose.
The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates. The fair value of these contracts 
is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date. No contracts are designated as
hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts is as follows:

hedging instruments and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the income statement.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding interest rate swaps is as follows:

The Group does not trade in derivatives. In general, derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures they are hedging. It is 
the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and therefore no net gain or loss is expected 
to be realised.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date. Movements in the fair value of derivatives are
included in the income statement.

On 1 August 2003, 3i Group plc issued €550 million 1.375% Convertible Bonds due 2008. The 3i share price on 1 August 2003 was 635p (31 March 2007: 1136p). 
They are convertible at the option of the Bondholder to cash or ordinary shares at any time from 11 September 2003 to 25 July 2008. The number of shares to be issued 
on conversion will be determined by dividing the principal of the bond less the cash settled amount by the conversion price in effect on the conversion date. The initial
conversion price is £8.416757, which has subsequently been adjusted to £8.53 following the share consolidation and special dividend in July 2005 and the return of capital
and share consolidation in July 2006. The issuer may make a payment in cash as an alternative to issuing shares upon either conversion or redemption. Unless previously
realised and cancelled, redeemed or converted, these bonds will be redeemed on 1 August 2008. Interest is payable on the bonds in equal semi-annual instalments in arrears
on 12 January and 12 July each year.
On issue, part of the proceeds of the Convertible Bonds was recognised as a derivative instrument. The remaining amount is recognised as a loan and is being held at
amortised cost. The effective interest rate is 4.1%. The fair value of the loan element of the Convertible Bonds is £361 million (2006: £366 million). 3i Group plc

Report and accounts 2007 98
Portf olio valuation methodology
A description of the methodology used to value the Group’s portfolio is set out below in order to provide more detailed information than is included each year in the
accounting policies for the valuation of the portfolio. The methodology complies in all material aspects with the “International private equity and venture capital valuation
guidelines” endorsed by both the BVCA and EVCA.
Basis of valuation 
Investments are reported at the Directors’ estimate of Fair Value at the reporting date. Fair Value represents the amount for which an asset could be exchanged between
knowledgeable, willing parties in an arm’s length transaction.
General 
In estimating Fair Value, we seek to use a methodology that is appropriate in light of the nature, facts and circumstances of the investment and its materiality in the context
of the total portfolio. Methodologies are applied consistently from period to period, except where a change would result in a better estimation of Fair Value. Given the
uncertainties inherent in estimating Fair Value, a degree of caution is applied in exercising judgments and making the necessary estimates.
Quoted investments 
Quoted investments are valued at the closing bid price at the reporting date. In accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, no discount is applied for liquidity
of the stock or any dealing restrictions.
Unquoted investments
Most unquoted investments are valued using one of the following methodologies:
– cost, less any required provision;
– earnings multiple;
– net assets;
– price of recent investment;
– expected sales proceeds.
New investments are valued at cost for the first 12 months and then until another methodology becomes more appropriate. This generally occurs when the first full set of
accounts covering a period of at least six months since the date of investment becomes available.
Any investment in a company that has failed or is expected to fail within the next 12 months has the equity shares valued at nil and the fixed income shares and loan
instruments valued at the lower of cost and net recoverable amount. 
Generally, the process of estimating the Fair Value of an investment involves selecting one of the above methodologies and using that to derive an Enterprise Value for the
investee company. The process is then to:
– deduct from the Enterprise Value all financial instruments ranking ahead of the Group;
– apply an appropriate Marketability Discount;
– apportion the remaining value over the other financial instruments including the Group’s loans, fixed income shares and equity shares.
Where that apportionment indicates a shortfall against the loans or fixed income shares, then the Group considers whether, in estimating Fair Value, the shortfall should be
applied, and if so, to what extent.
The Marketability Discount will generally be between 10%–30% with the level set to reflect the Group’s influence over the exit prospects and timing for the 
investee company.
When using the earnings multiple methodology, earnings before interest and tax (“EBIT”) are normally used, adjusted to a maintainable level. Generally, the latest full 
year historical accounts are used unless there is an indication of a forecast downturn in earnings in the current or forecast year, in which case those earnings may be used. 
An appropriate multiple is applied to these earnings to derive an Enterprise Value. Normally the multiple will be the average EBIT multiple for the relevant sector of the 
FTSE Global SmallCap Europe index, adjusted downwards by the Group to exclude loss-making companies.
Where a company reports an operating loss or the industry standard valuation methodology is by reference to the asset base, then the value may be estimated using the net
assets methodology.
The “price of recent investment” methodology is used mainly for investments in venture capital companies and includes cost of the investment or valuation by reference to a
subsequent financing round. Valuation increases above cost are only recognised if that round involved a new external investor and the company is meeting milestones set by
the investors. The relevance of this methodology can be eroded over time due to changes in the technology, business or market which may indicate an impairment has
occurred. In this case, carrying values will be reduced to reflect Fair Value.
Other factors that may be taken into account include:
– the expected effect of ratchets, options and liquidation preferences;
– any industry standard valuation methodology. e.g. Discounted cash flows for infrastructure type investments;
– offers received as part of a sale process, which may either support the value derived from another methodology or be used as the valuation less a Marketability Discount
of typically 10%.
For the Group’s smaller investments, the valuation is determined by a more mechanistic approach using information from the latest audited accounts. Equity shares are valued
at the higher of an earnings or net assets methodology. Fixed income shares and loan investments are valued at the lower of cost and net recoverable amount. Approximately
15% by value of the Group’s unquoted investments are valued using this methodology.
An analysis of the portfolio by valuation method is given in the portfolio analysis on pages 102 and 103.

T en largest investments
The table below provides information on our ten largest investments, as required by LR 15.4.12, in respect of the Group's holding and excluding any co-investment by 
3i managed funds, or share of 3i Infrastructure Limited owned by third parties. Income represents dividends received (inclusive of overseas withholding tax) and gross 
interest receivable in the year to 31 March 2007. Net assets and earnings figures are taken from the most recent audited accounts of the investee business, and are the 
net assets of each business and the total earnings on ordinary activities after tax respectively. It should be noted that, because of the varying rights attaching to the classes
of shares held by the Group, it could be misleading to attribute a certain proportion of the earnings and net assets to the proportion of equity capital held by the Group. 
Further information on our portfolio investments is provided as case studies on pages 14 to 23, and more generally at 3i.com.

Private equity and venture capital – a lexicon
Definitions 
“Private equity”, as the term suggests, involves
investment of equity capital in private
businesses. More recently it has become as
much associated with an investment style as
it has with its more literal description. 
3i’s private equity activities cover:
Venture capital This is investment in “early-
stage“ or “late-stage” technology companies,
Here, the investor (“the VC”) typically takes a
minority equity stake (ie less than 50% of the
equity shares) in the business as part of a
syndicate of VCs. “Early-stage” investments
typically fund research or development
expenditure and costs associated with
building an organisation for a company which
is pre revenue. “Late-stage” investments tend
to fund the scaling up of a business once the
model is proven for companies which are
either pre or just making a profit. Both early
and late-stage investing usually involves a
number of “funding rounds”. 
Examples of venture capital investments can
be found on pages 22 and 23.
Growth capital (or development capital)
This involves the provision of capital to
accelerate the growth of established
businesses and generally involves the private
equity investor (“PE investor”) taking a
minority equity position. It is a type of
investment suited to a diverse range of
growth opportunities, including acquisitions,
increasing production capacity, market 
or product development, turnaround
opportunities, shareholder succession and
change of ownership situations.
Examples of growth capital investments can
be found on pages 18 and 19.
Buyouts This involves the purchase of an
existing independent business or a subsidiary
or division of a corporate group from its
current owners. This category of investment
includes management buyouts, management
buy-ins, and institutional buyouts. Here, the
equity in the post-buyout business is usually
shared between the management team and
the PE investor, with the PE investor usually
holding a majority stake. 
The finance for the buyout would generally
comprise around 60% of senior and mezzanine
debt (usually provided by banks and
mezzanine providers), with substantially all 
of the balance of the purchase price coming
from the PE investor and a relatively small
amount coming from the management team.
In order to reflect the mismatch between the
equity finance provided respectively by the
PE investor and the management team 
and the equity stake taken by each in the
underlying business, a large part of the PE
investor’s finance is generally provided in the
form of redeemable preference shares or
shareholder loans.
Examples of buyouts investments can be
found on pages 14 and 15.
Quoted Private equity (“QPE”) This involves
the purchase of influential stakes in smaller
quoted companies which have low liquidity in
their shares, little analyst coverage and potential
to grow significantly but are constrained by
their current shareholding composition. 
The concept is that through taking a private
equity value adding approach to these
companies and working with management
their prospects can be significantly improved.
Investment objective 
Like any other investment, the objective of
the PE investor is to earn attractive returns
on its investment commensurate with the
risk being taken. The returns come either in
the form of income (interest, dividends or
fees) or capital gains. The contrast with
investment in quoted companies is that the
PE investor will usually prefer to crystallise its
capital gain through a trade sale (ie a sale to 
a corporate purchaser), a sale to a financial
purchaser or a flotation on the public markets
of the underlying business. This preference
tends to make private equity investment
medium to long term in nature, since time 
is required to implement the value growth
strategy for the business and there will also
be a wish to optimise the timing of the “exit”.
The investment lifecycle
The investment lifecycle for an investment
can be broken down into five distinct phases,
with each involving significant resource and
capability on the part of the VC or PE investor:
Origination – The ability to access and create
investment opportunities. This is a critical
component of a PE investor’s business model. 
Developing and validating the investment
case – In this phase the PE investor draws
upon their knowledge, experience, commercial
judgment and other capabilities to develop and
validate their investment case. This might
involve building a potential board and
management team and working with them to
develop the strategy for value growth and
exit; as well as conducting “due diligence” on all
significant assumptions and inputs to the
investment case.
Structuring and making the investment
This phase involves financial structuring,
negotiation and project management skills 
on the part of the PE investor. Relationships
with banks, mezzanine finance providers,
intermediaries and others are also important.
Implementing the value creation plan
This phase involves “actually making it
happen”, creating value between making 
the investment and exit. If the strategy
involves corporate acquisitions or mergers,
restructuring the business, achieving growth
in turnover or operating profits, the PE
investor would need to have the required
capability to ensure these are achieved. 
As important is the ability to assess and
strengthen the management team as 
the life cycle proceeds – this might involve
having access to a pool of management
talent in order to match a particular need 
to a particular management skill-set.
Exit This phase generally involves a trade sale,
a listing on a stock exchange or a sale to
another private equity firm (“a secondary”).
Exit prospects and strategy should generally
be reviewed on an ongoing basis during the
investment’s life – and the sale or flotation
itself requires resource and capability from
the PE investor, since both are lengthy and
complex processes.
Types of investment vehicle The predominant
vehicle in the industry is the independent,
private, fixed-life, closed-end fund, usually
organised as a limited partnership. These
funds typically have a fixed life of 10 years.
Investments generally consist of an initial
commitment of capital which is then drawn
down as the investment manager finds
investment opportunities. Capital is returned
to the investor via earnings distributions and
sales of investments. Some investment
vehicles are organised as captive or semi-
captive funds. A captive fund invests only for
the interest of its parent organisation (which
may be, for example, a bank or investment
bank, insurance company, university). A semi-
captive fund mixes capital from both outside
investors and the parent organisation. Both
captive and semi-captive funds tend to be
“evergreen” in nature – income from
investments and proceeds received on the
realisation of investments are substantially
retained for further investment rather than
being returned to investors. There are also a
limited number of private equity investment
companies, such as 3i, whose shares are
listed on a stock exchange. These tend to be
evergreen in nature and offer investors a
more liquid exposure to private equity.
Infrastructure
3i also invests in infrastructure assets. 
These relate to investment in public service
activities covering the range from “primary”
investment, the building of a public service
operation (eg a road, hospital or school), to
“secondary” investment, which involves the
operational scaling once the facilities are up
and running and finally “tertiary” investments
in mature infrastructure operations. 3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 108
Returns and IRRs – an explanation
What is an IRR measure?
The Internal Rate of Return (“IRR”) is the
interim return earned by 3i investing in an
asset from the date of initial investment up
until a particular point in time. It is calculated
as the annualised effective compound rate of
return, using monthly cash flows, generated
from the asset. For assets that have yet to be
sold, and therefore have not generated a final
cash inflow from sale proceeds, the asset
value at the date of calculation of the IRR is
used as the terminal cash flow. An IRR can
apply to a single asset or a pool of assets 
(eg all new investments made in financial
year 2004 can be pooled to calculate an IRR
for vintage year 2004).
An IRR calculated using the current value of
the asset as the terminal cash flow is called 
a Fund IRR. A cash-to-cash IRR does not
include any terminal value for unsold assets
and is a pure, more simple measure of cash
invested compared to cash returned as it
does not include any judgmental asset
valuation for the unsold assets.
In the business line IRR tables included in the
Business review, total investment represents
all first and further investment in a vintage
and investment in externally managed funds,
while return flow consists of capital proceeds
and revenue. Value remaining represents the
value still held within the vintage’s portfolio
based on our latest valuation.
What is a vintage and a vintage year?
A vintage is a collection of assets in which 
3i makes its first investment during a defined
period of time. The most common time
period measured in the private equity industry
is a year. A vintage year at 3i includes all new
investments made within our financial year, 
ie vintage year 2007 covers new investments
made from 1 April 2006 to 31 March 2007. 
Why does 3i track the performance 
of vintage years? 
Looking at the performance of a vintage
enables us to assess the returns we are
making on pools of assets invested during 
a vintage year. It gives a measure of the
performance of each year’s investment
activity in isolation.
It also allows us to assess the return
generated from assets over the length of
time we hold them, rather than just looking
at the performance between the beginning
and end of a financial year, which is shown in
our yearly total return statement. The annual 
total return analysis has limitations as a
measure of longer-term performance as it is
only a representation of how the assets have
performed in one financial year and is heavily
influenced by the valuation of the asset at
the beginning and end of the year. It does not
show the evolution of how a vintage year is
performing over time. 
T o achieve this longer-term measure of
performance over time, the IRR is the
standard measure used across the private
equity industry.
What IRR measures do 3i use to assess 
the performance of a vintage? 
3i has published target cash-to-cash IRRs for
each business line. These targets are 20% for
Buyouts and Growth Capital and 25% for
Venture Capital. 
A cash-to-cash IRR cannot be meaningfully
used to measure the performance of a
vintage until the majority of assets in that
vintage are realised. Therefore, 3i monitors
the progress of each vintage and the
evolution of the IRR using a combination 
of the Fund IRRs and the extent to which 
a vintage is realised, to assess the interim
performance. Case A, depicted in chart 1, 
is an example to show the interim cash-to-
cash IRR of an asset and clearly indicates
why, during the holding period of an asset,
the Fund IRR gives a more appropriate
measure of performance.
Our aim is to achieve market-beating returns by generating
cash-to-cash vintage year IRRs of 20% for Buyouts and
Growth Capital and 25% for V enture Capital.
How does 3i’s total return
equate to the IRR measures?
T able 3 on page 34 shows an analysis
of 3i’s total return. 
T otal return is calculated as the 
gross portfolio return plus other 
fee income, less costs and net interest
payable. T otal return can be expressed
as a quantum (eg £1,075 million for
the year to 31 March 2007) or as a
percentage of opening shareholders’
funds (eg 26.8% for the year to 
31 March 2007).
Gross portfolio return is made up 
of the income and value movement
(both realised and unrealised)
generated from our portfolio.
Costs include expenses and carried
interest payable. 
The elements that make up 
the gross portfolio return are the
same constituents used in an 
IRR calculation.
Gross portfolio return (stated as 
a percentage of opening portfolio
value) will equate to an IRR measure
over time. So, if 3i achieves 20%
gross portfolio returns each year, 
the long-term IRR will also move 
to 20%.
What is total shareholder return?
T otal shareholder return is the change
in share price over a period, plus
dividends re-invested. 3i Group plc

Volatility, the portfolio effect 
and the holding period 
The published target IRRs are for each
business line in aggregate. It does not mean
that the IRR for each asset in those business
lines will achieve the target IRRs individually.
There will always be a range of IRRs achieved
on each of the individual assets in each
vintage year. However, when assets are
pooled together, the portfolio effect will
reduce this overall volatility in each vintage
year. The range of volatility we expect in 
any one given vintage year is +/-10% for
Buyouts, +/-7% for Growth Capital and 
+/-15% for Venture Capital. 
Across the cycle, we expect the volatility to
average out at +/-5% for Buyouts, +/-3%
for Growth Capital and +/-7% for Venture
Capital.
A 3i vintage year is made up of many assets.
All will have their own individual cash flows
and different timings of when value uplift
occurs and holding periods. We believe that
after three years the maturity of a vintage
will have developed enough for the Fund 
IRR to give a good indication of the final
outcome. By seven years most vintage 
years will be largely realised. 
Tracking our progress 
T o monitor a vintage year we use a
combination of Fund IRRs and money
multiples. The Fund IRR to give a measure 
of performance and the money multiple to
show how much cash has been returned
compared to cost (eg Case A = 1.7x) so 
that we can assess the extent to which that
performance is “locked-in”.
We have published the Fund IRRs for each
business line within the Business review
(Buyouts on page 12, Growth Capital on
page 16 and Venture Capital on page 20) 
for the last five vintages (2003 to 2007).

Carried interest – an explanation
What is carried interest?
Carried interest refers to the profits
generated in a successful private equity fund
that are received by the carried interest
holders, and which typically amount to 20%
of the net profit in the fund.
Who is the carried interest holder?
This is often the senior management team of 
the fund manager but varies between private 
equity firms.
Where does the term 
carried interest come from?
The investor who receives the carried interest
is said to be carried by the other investors
since they are willing to allocate up to 20% of
their profits to the carried interest holder.
How does carried interest ensure
alignment of the parties in a private
equity transaction?
The main parties in a private equity
transaction are the management team of 
the underlying company in which the fund is
investing, the investors in the fund, and those
who manage the fund.
Management teams of companies backed
with private equity are incentivised by the
potential capital gain on their investment in
the company. Investors in private equity
funds benefit from the growth in value of
these underlying companies.
Managers of the fund holding the carried
interest benefit if the overall performance 
of the fund is successful.
When is carried interest paid 
and how is it calculated?
Carried interest is usually based on the
performance of the fund as a whole, but in
some funds is paid on an investment-by-
investment basis. Usually investors receive
their initial capital back plus a “hurdle” to
ensure a minimum level of return before any
carried interest is paid.
Typically, this hurdle is based on the Internal
Rate of Return (“IRR”) of the fund since its
inception – for more information on IRRs 
see page 108. An IRR-based hurdle is the
most appropriate mechanism in the private
equity industry due to the focus on cash-to-
cash returns.
Once the hurdle has been met, most 
funds allocate cash flows above the hurdle
disproportionately for a short period, known
as the “catch up” phase, until the carried
interest holder has received the right
proportion of the overall profits in the fund.
Why are investors in a private equity
fund willing to forego as much as 20%
of profit in carried interest?
Generally investors value the alignment that
carried interest provides.
Carried interest functions in a similar way to a
performance fee. It is directly linked to the
success of the investment fund and has the
benefit to the investors of being measured on
the cash returned to them rather than the
value of the fund.
In return for paying carried interest, fund
investors demand “active” management 
of their capital. Specifically, the fund 
manager will:
– invest fund investors’ capital in high quality
companies;
– develop and implement a value creation
strategy for each company in the portfolio;
– participate in the strategic and operational 
policy-making through board representation;
– earn an appropriate yield on the investment;
– and provide a profitable exit through a
trade sale, IPO or refinancing.
What other return does the fund 
manager receive?
The fund will pay a priority profit share (often
called the “management fee”) to cover the
costs of the fund manager. This is typically
1% to 2% of the investors’ commitments to
the fund annually.
Why does 3i have both carried 
interest receivable and carried 
interest payable?
3i’s carried interest receivable is due from
the third-party funds that 3i manages. 
3i calls these external funds “co-investment
funds” since they invest alongside 3i’s balance
sheet. A variety of funds are managed by 3i
but in recent years 3i has only raised buyout
funds to invest alongside its Buyouts business
line. The most recent fund is 3i Eurofund V,
investing primarily in mid-market European
buyouts.
3i’s carried interest payable is due to
investment executives employed by 3i. 
This is payable mainly in relation to 3i’s
Buyout, Growth Capital and Venture Capital
investments. Assets in a vintage are grouped
together in pools (typically covering two
years of investment), which are specific to a
particular investment team. The executives 
in that team purchase the rights to the
carried interest and, if the pool is profitable,
they will receive an allocation of investment
profits. 3i’s internal carry schemes are
structured in the same way as external 
funds, with similar terms and conditions.
Approximately 86% of 3i’s portfolio assets,
measured by value at 31 March 2007, are
within carried interest schemes.
Both carried interest receivable and payable 
are accrued in line with underlying realised
and unrealised profits in the fund but cash
payments are not made until the cash is
returned to investors, as noted above.
Private equity firms ensure alignment between the interests 
of management teams and investors through a variety of 
mechanisms. A key financial mechanism is “carried interest” 
or “carry” and this is explained below. 3i Group plc
Report and accounts 2007 111
As the level of carried interest receivable is
related to the returns in 3i’s co-investment
funds, while the level of carried interest
payable is related to the returns from 3i’s
own investments, carried interest receivable
and payable are only indirectly related in 
3i’s accounts.
However in 3i’s Buyout business line, there 
is a correlation between carried interest
receivable and payable because investments
in the same business are held both by the 
co-investment fund and held on 3i’s own
balance sheet.
How does 3i account for 
carried interest?
3i accounts for carried interest on an accruals
basis. As realisations are made and valuations
are adjusted, 3i reviews the impact on each
carry scheme in place and amends its carried
interest accruals accordingly.
However it should be noted that some
private equity firms account for carried
interest as it is paid and received (the 
so-called cash basis) and others account 
for carried interest at the time of making a
new investment by employing option
valuation techniques.
3i’s accounting policy means that movements
in gross portfolio return are fully reflected in
the calculation of carried interest payable and
receivable, ultimately reducing year-on-year
volatility to 3i’s total return.

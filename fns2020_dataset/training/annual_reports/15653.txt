A ROBUST 
PERFORMANCE
Robust ﬁ nancial performance in a challenging year
– Revenue down 4% to £8,890m (5% decrease at constant currency) due to planned winter capacity  
cuts and a softer summer trading environment
– Adjusted underlying operating proﬁ t
2
 was £391m (2009 restated: £415m), only 6% down in a very 
tough year
– Substantial increase in proﬁ ts from Central Europe and Airlines Germany not enough to offset 
UK decline
Outlook
– Well positioned to make progress in the current ﬁ nancial year
1  The Group statutory ﬁ nancial statements for the year ended 30 September 2010 and prior year comparatives are set out on pages 73 to 119.  
2  Underlying proﬁ t from operations is deﬁ ned as earnings before interest and tax, and has been adjusted to exclude all separately disclosed items. It also excludes our share of the results of associates 
and joint ventures. Adjusted underlying proﬁ t from operations is stated before the margin impact of the volcanic ash cloud.
3  The underlying operating proﬁ t margin is the underlying proﬁ t from operations (as above) divided by the external revenue.
4  Adjusted underlying basic earnings per share is calculated as net proﬁ t after tax, but before all separately disclosed items and the margin impact of the volcanic ash cloud, divided by the weighted 
average number of shares in issue during the period.

PROGRESS 
ON STRATEGIC 
INITIATIVES
The Group results were impacted by 
the challenging economic and trading 
environment but, despite this, the Group 
delivered a signiﬁ cant improvement in 
cash ﬂ ow performance and the adjusted 
underlying proﬁ t from operations was only 
down 6% on the prior year. 
The progress made against a number of 
strategic initiatives, such as destination 
management, airline synergies and the 
setting up of an Online Travel Agent, coupled 
with our successful reﬁ nancing in May, will 
serve us well in our drive to grow shareholder 
value. The Board believes that the decisive 
actions taken to reinforce our UK segment 
will place that business in a stronger position 
for the future.
With a trusted brand portfolio and a proven 
ability to manage our business, we will 
continue to meet the needs of our customers 
in the future.
DIVIDEND
The Board is recommending a ﬁ nal dividend 
of 7.0 pence per share, which when combined 
with the interim dividend of 3.75 pence per 
share paid on 8 October 2010, makes a total 
dividend for the year of 10.75 pence per 
share. Whilst we are committed to optimising 
value for our shareholders and understand 
the importance of dividends to them, our 
recommendation to maintain the same level 
of dividend reﬂ ects last year’s performance 
in a challenging operating environment. The 
total dividend for the year represents a payout 
of 47% of adjusted diluted earnings per 
share and is in line with our policy of paying 
between 40% and 50% of adjusted earnings 
by way of dividend.
Once approved, the ﬁ nal dividend will be 
payable on 7 April 2011 to holders of relevant 
shares registered on 18 March 2011.
THE BOARD
The Board has made solid progress in its 
ﬁ rst year of leading a fully independent 
Company. We are committed to high standards 
of corporate governance and we are fully 
compliant with the Combined Code on 
Corporate Governance. We recently conducted 
our annual Board evaluation, the output of 
which will help further develop Board and 
Committee effectiveness.
During the year, we strengthened our Board 
with a number of non-executive and executive 
appointments. Peter Middleton and Dawn 
Airey joined the Board as Independent Non-
Executive Directors on 30 November 2009 and 
12 April 2010 respectively. On 6 November 
2009, Sam Weihagen, Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, 
Northern Europe, took on the additional role 
of Deputy to the Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer 
and joined the Board as an Executive Director. 
Paul Hollingworth joined the Board on 1 
January 2010 as Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer. 
Peter Marks, the Group Chief Executive 
of The Co-operative Group, will join the 
Board upon completion of the UK Retail 
joint venture with The Co-operative Group 
and Midlands Co-operative. Each of our 
new Directors brings a wealth of welcome 
experience to the Board’s deliberations.
Jürgen Büser stepped down from the Board as 
Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer on 29 November 
2009 and, having recovered well following a 
period of ill health, returned to the business to 
take up the role of Group Strategy Director on 
the Group Executive Board. Nigel Northridge, 
one of our Non-Executive Directors, resigned 
from the Board on 25 March 2010, to pursue 
broader responsibilities within his portfolio of 
non-executive directorships.
On behalf of the Board, I would like to 
thank Jürgen and Nigel for their contribution 
to the Group.
At the forthcoming AGM, I will be standing for 
re-election for a further year. The Nominations 
Committee, under the leadership of the Senior 
Independent Director, is in the early stages 
of a process to identify my successor with the 
aim of making an announcement during the 
course of the year.
EXECUTIVE TEAM
Manny Fontenla-Novoa and his executive 
team have together made robust and 
encouraging progress in a challenging 
marketplace. The Board would like to 
thank them and conﬁ rm our conﬁ dence 
in their ability to address the challenges 
that lie ahead.
EMPLOYEES
Our employees remain central to the future 
success of the Group. There can be no better 
example of dedication to customer service 
than their response to the closure of airspace 
due to the volcanic ash cloud. With sound 
values and a range of skills and experience, 
we believe they are our key differentiator in a 
highly competitive global industry. On behalf 
of the Board and shareholders, I would like 
to thank them for their dedication and high 
standards, which they continue to maintain.
THE FUTURE
Based on our solid foundations, the actions 
taken in the UK and the progress against a 
wide range of strategic initiatives, the Board 
is conﬁ dent that the Group is well positioned 
to make progress in the current year.

Mainstream travel
Mainstream travel is primarily the sale 
of charter holiday packages where two or 
more components of travel, such as ﬂ ights, 
hotels, transfers and in-resort support, 
are bundled together in advance and 
sold to customers.
Independent travel
Independent travel is a key area of growth. 
Independent travel is where consumers 
build up the individual components of 
their own trip either by themselves or 
with the help of an agent. We are building 
our position both in retail and wholesale 
independent travel. 
Travel-related ﬁ nancial services
Travel-related ﬁ nancial services broadly 
fall into the categories of travel money, 
travel assurance and travel ﬁ nance 
products. They are typically high margin 
products and are sold alongside other 
holiday components.

RESPONDING 
TO THE 
CHALLENGE
We recognised at the outset that 
2009/10 would be demanding 
given the uncertain economic 
outlook and, accordingly, we 
took early action to deal with the 
challenges. While we made good 
progress in many of our operating 
segments and delivered a strong 
improvement in operating cash 
ﬂ ow, trading in the UK was even 
tougher than anticipated. I am 
conﬁ dent that the actions we 
have now taken to reinforce 
the UK business, together with 
continued progress on our 
strategic initiatives, leave us well 
positioned to make progress in 
the current year.

 Adjusted underlying proﬁ t
from operations
GROUP RESULTS
Group revenue for the 12 months ended 
30 September 2010 was £8,890m (2009: 
£9,269m), down 4% (5% on a constant 
currency basis), mainly reﬂ ecting planned 
capacity reductions in our winter 2009/10 
mainstream travel programme and lost sales 
as a result of the volcanic ash cloud incident. 
Adjusted underlying proﬁ t from operations 
was £391m (2009: £415m). This was the 
result of reduced capacity and the impact of 
weaker Sterling on ﬂ ying and accommodation 
costs, which was partially mitigated by cost 
initiatives in accommodation purchasing, 
airline operations and general overheads. 
Despite the challenging conditions, our 
Central Europe and Airlines Germany 
businesses recorded much improved results 
of £61m (2009 restated: £50m) and £54m 
(2009: £47m) respectively. These mainly 
resulted from product and efﬁ ciency 
improvements in both businesses and 
reduced depreciation charges in Airlines 
Germany. The Northern Europe proﬁ t of 
£94m (2009 restated: £87m) was also up and 
West & East Europe, which reported a proﬁ t 
of £87m (2009 restated: £86m), did well 
considering the difﬁ cult economic conditions 
in some of their markets.
The UK segment faced a challenging year, 
in part due to signiﬁ cant foreign exchange 
headwinds and softer demand over the 
summer and, as a result, adjusted underlying 
operating proﬁ t was £124m, down 24% on 
last year. Continued mainstream overcapacity 
in the Canadian market impacted North 
America’s proﬁ ts which fell to £10m 
(2009 restated: £18m). 
Reducing exceptional costs is a key area of 
focus for the Group. Excluding volcanic ash 
costs of £53m, other exceptional charges fell 
from £217m to £132m as the integration 
costs associated with the MyTravel merger 
fell away. Further detail can be found in the 
Financial Review on pages 42 to 45 and in 
note 6 to the Group ﬁ nancial statements. 
The net interest charge for the year remained 
broadly ﬂ at at £116m.
Overall, the Group delivered a statutory proﬁ t 
before tax of £42m compared with £45m last 
year, and the reported proﬁ t after tax was 
£3m (2009 restated: £9m). 
The adjusted underlying earnings per share 
was 22.8p (2009 restated: 25.0p). The basic 
loss per share was 0.3p (2009 restated 
earnings per share: 0.8p).
STRONG CASHFLOW PERFORMANCE
During the year, there has been a concerted 
effort across the Group to produce a 
sustainable improvement in cash ﬂ ow. This 
has largely been delivered through improved 
working capital management by raising 
customer deposit levels, accelerating holiday 
balance payments and harmonising supplier 
payment terms. This has been partly offset by 
increased hotelier deposits required in some 
cases and a reduction in creditors.
As a result of this, and despite the difﬁ cult 
trading environment, the Group achieved a 
signiﬁ cant improvement in cash ﬂ ow, with 
a £121m increase in operating cash ﬂ ow 
to £299m. 
The Group cash outﬂ ow (before changes 
in debt) was reduced to £117m compared 
with an outﬂ ow of £314m in the prior year. 
Group net debt at year end was £804m 
and headroom on banking facilities at 
30 September 2010 was £846m.
SUCCESSFUL REFINANCING 
During the year, we successfully replaced 
our previous bank facility with new funding. 
The new arrangements, which amount 
to £1,700m in total, comprise a £1,050m 
banking facility and £650m of bonds (Sterling 
equivalent). Taken together, they provide the 
Group with a simpler borrowing framework, 
longer and varied maturities and greater 
ﬂ exibility and funding going forward.
VOLCANIC ASH IMPACT AND 
OUR RESPONSE
The volcanic ash cloud from Iceland closed 
the majority of airspace above Northern 
Europe for almost six days in April, and it 
then took up to ﬁ ve days before the vast 
majority of our customers had been returned 
home. Further isolated closures in April and 
May impacted individual markets. 
I am extremely proud of the way in which 
all our people at Thomas Cook pulled 
together to respond to this crisis. The scale 
of the event was vast, involving c.180,000 
customers stranded in resort, c.190,000 
customers unable to depart on holiday 
and over 1,000 cancelled ﬂ ights. Our well-
rehearsed emergency procedures sprung 
into action and the team led a professional 
operation to reassure and assist customers, 
while simultaneously working with industry 
colleagues and the aviation authorities to 
coordinate a return to normal ﬂ ying.
The letters of thanks and praise that we 
received from customers are testament to 
the dedication of our people and the event 
highlighted again the added security of 
booking a package holiday. 
UK RESTRUCTURING AND HIGH STREET 
TRAVEL MERGER
Given the challenges experienced in the UK, 
and the uncertain outlook, we undertook a 
comprehensive review of the UK cost base 
and the structure of our UK operations 
towards the ﬁ nancial year end.
This review has resulted in a re-organisation 
of the UK into three divisions (Mainstream, 
Independent and Retail) to reduce complexity 
and give greater accountability and visibility 
of operations.

The closure of European airspace in 
April 2010 had a signiﬁ cant impact 
on the operations of the Thomas Cook 
Group. As well as incurring £52.9m 
of direct exceptional costs to 
manage the welfare and repatriate 
our customers stranded in resort, 
management estimates that the lost 
margin from not being able to operate 
our ﬂ ight programme during this time 
was £29.2m. Given the uniqueness 
of this incident and the distortion 
management believes the margin 
loss causes to our results, we have 
excluded this margin impact from 
the underlying proﬁ t from operations 
that we discuss in both the Group 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s Statement and 
the Operating and Financial Reviews. 
We refer to this proﬁ t measure as 
“Adjusted underlying proﬁ t from 
operations”. Unadjusted numbers have 
been provided in the statutory income 
statement and related notes.

Directors’ Report
Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s
statement continued
This deal represents the last signiﬁ cant 
consolidation opportunity in UK travel, 
combining two of the industry’s strongest 
and most complementary travel brands and 
distribution networks to reach out to a wider 
customer base than either company could 
achieve independently.
It will unlock annualised synergies within 
the merged entity of £35m at a one-off cost 
of £30m and further upstream synergies in 
Thomas Cook from additional mainstream 
and independent product sales of £10m. 
Thomas Cook will own 66.5% of the merged 
entity, The Co-operative Group will own 
30% and Midlands Co-operative will own 
3.5%. Whilst the merger is still subject to 
competition clearance, we are working 
with the relevant authorities to achieve an 
expedited clearance.
We believe that the restructuring, combined 
with the merger with The Co-operatives, 
will greatly strengthen our UK business 
going forward. 
CONFIDENCE IN OUR STRATEGY
Despite the challenging trading conditions 
this year, we remain conﬁ dent that the global 
travel market will return to growth and that 
our strategy is the right one to capture that 
growth and deliver value to our shareholders.
Our strategy is focused on strengthening our 
mainstream, package holiday and ﬁ nancial 
services businesses and investing in areas of 
future growth, primarily independent travel 
and new markets. 
During the year, we began work on a number 
of strategic initiatives that, we believe, have 
the potential to raise the Group operating 
proﬁ t margin by a further 100 to 150 basis 
points over the medium term.
The progress on our key strategic initiatives is 
highlighted below and a full Strategic Review 
is set out on pages 12 to 14.
Mainstream travel
The strategy for our Mainstream travel 
business is to improve product mix, whilst 
reducing operating costs, thus driving 
improvement in margin. During the year, we 
made good progress on a number of fronts.
In relation to costs, we established a new 
Group Destination Management function 
with direct control over more than £1bn of 
accommodation spend and average Group 
accommodation costs as a percentage of 
sales reduced year-on-year by 120 basis 
points to 32.5%. On aviation, by working 
together across our segments, our airlines 
delivered £19m incremental airline synergies 
from fuel efﬁ ciency improvements and joint 
tendering. In addition, good cost reductions 
were achieved in all of our operating 
segments, assisted by Group Procurement.
In terms of product mix, we improved 
our share of differentiated and exclusive 
products in all major markets and, through 
the acquisition of Öger Tours, we have 
strengthened our offering to Turkey from 
Germany. We also increased controlled and 
online distribution to 52% (2009: 51%) and 
23% (2009: 22%) respectively.
Thomas Cook Group operates a ﬂ eet of 93 
aircraft with an average age of 12 years. The 
Group has identiﬁ ed signiﬁ cant operational 
savings, particularly from maintenance 
and improved fuel efﬁ ciency, that can be 
achieved by renewing and harmonising its 
71 narrow body aircraft within a common 
ﬂ eet. Following a comprehensive review, the 
Group has selected the Airbus 320 family of 
aircraft. Accordingly, the Group will begin a 
ﬁ ve-year narrow body aircraft replacement 
programme, starting in December 2012 and 
phased in line with the planned retirement 
of the existing ﬂ eet. The replacement 
programme will deliver optimum ﬂ exibility 
by sourcing new narrow body aircraft 
through a combination of ﬁ rm and ﬂ exible 
orders direct with the manufacturer and 
though accessing the aircraft leasing market. 
A review of the wide body ﬂ eet replacement 
requirements will be undertaken during the 
current year.
As part of the replacement programme, 
the Group has reached a memorandum 
of understanding with Airbus for 12 new

“OUR STRATEGY IS FOCUSED ON STRENGTHENING OUR 
MAINSTREAM, PACKAGE HOLIDAY AND FINANCIAL SERVICES 
BUSINESSES AND INVESTING IN AREAS OF FUTURE GROWTH, 
PRIMARILY INDEPENDENT TRAVEL AND NEW MARKETS”
Our Group Executive Board
As a result of the restructuring, we expect 
to generate annualised overhead savings 
of £40m to £50m through the reduction of 
over 500 managerial and support roles; the 
renegotiation of supplier costs and reduction 
in buying requirements; and by consolidating 
and upgrading our IT infrastructure. These, 
and other savings, will be achieved in full 
in the ﬁ nancial year ending 30 September 
2012, helping to mitigate input cost pressures 
and any further deterioration in the trading 
environment. We estimate that at least £30m 
of savings will be achieved in the current year 
and that the cost of approximately £20m to 
implement all of the planned savings will be 
incurred in the current year. 
The UK business will also beneﬁ t from our 
plan to merge our UK high street travel 
and foreign exchange business with that 
of The Co-operative Group and Midlands 
Co-operative. This will create the UK’s largest 
high street travel network with around 
1,300 shops.

Back in 1896 Thomas Cook escorted 
UK customers to the ﬁ rst modern 
Olympic Games in Athens. As an 
ofﬁ cial supporter of the London 2012 
Olympic and Paralympic Games, 
Thomas Cook will be selling short 
breaks, including ofﬁ cial event tickets 
and accommodation, to the London 
2012 Games. 
Airbus 321 aircraft scheduled to be delivered 
in 2014, with a list price of US$96m each, 
together with options to purchase further 
aircraft from 2015. These aircraft are subject 
to substantial price concessions from the list 
price. The Group will remain a heavy user 
of operating leases and it is anticipated that 
directly purchased aircraft will be ﬁ nanced 
through sale and leaseback agreements with 
third-party lessors. 
For the ﬂ eet as a whole, it is estimated 
that the reduced running costs of the new 
aircraft will more than ﬁ nance the increased 
ownership costs. It is not anticipated that the 
overall ﬂ eet size will increase as a result. The 
Group expects to sign ﬁ nal contracts early in 
the New Year.
Travel-related ﬁ nancial services
Travel-related ﬁ nancial services contributed 
14% of Group adjusted underlying operating 
proﬁ t. In the UK, we increased our share of 
the foreign exchange market from 13% to 
15% and became the number one global 
provider of cash passports supplied by 
Travelex, tapping into the rising popularity 
of pre-paid currency cards. Additionally, 
we boosted our online travel insurance 
capability by acquiring Essential Travel.
Independent travel and Online
Travel Agent (OTA)
Our objective with independent travel is to 
grow both the top and bottom line, largely 
through the development of our European 
Online Travel Agent (OTA). 
In the year, we saw independent travel’s 
share of Group sales grow from 25% to 27% 
and passengers grow by 5%.
Signiﬁ cantly, we established the OTA 
organisation under the leadership of Thomas 
Döring, attracting high calibre people 
from well known internet companies and 
delivered sales with a gross booking value 
of £1bn, an increase of 22% on the previous 
year. This is a vital area for the Group and our 
ﬁ rst priority is to optimise sales of our own 
package holidays through the e-commerce 
channel. We are also developing plans to 
broaden our offering of city breaks and 
accommodation with beneﬁ ts expected to 
ﬂ ow over the next two to three years. 
Emerging markets
As a Group, we continue to see large potential 
opportunity in new, particularly emerging 
markets, where travel and GDP growth rates 
far outstrip our existing markets. We already 
operate in India, Egypt and Eastern Europe 
and, in 2010, 1.3m customers travelled with 
us from these markets. 
On 25 November 2010, Thomas Cook 
reached agreement to form a joint venture 
with VAO Intourist, one of Russia’s most 
renowned travel companies. Thomas Cook 
will acquire a 50.1% stake in the joint venture 
for a consideration of US$45m, comprising 
US$35m in new Thomas Cook shares and 
US$10m in cash. The joint venture will 
include Intourist’s outbound, domestic and 
inbound tour operating operations as well 
as its travel retail network. The joint venture 
provides Thomas Cook with an entry into the 
fast-growing Russian market with a strong 
local partner. Subject to anti-trust clearance 
in Russia and certain other conditions, the 
joint venture is expected to complete in or 
before February 2011.
SUSTAINABLE FUTURE
To secure our future success for the long term 
we need to address the long-term challenges 
facing the travel industry. We have made 
progress during the year in all areas of our 
sustainability strategy including maintaining 
a committed and engaged workforce, 
providing a great holiday experience for 
customers whilst ensuring their security 
and safety, improving fuel efﬁ ciency and 
monitoring the carbon emissions from 
our aircraft and encouraging sustainable 
practices within our supply chain. A full 
report on our progress is provided on pages 
38 to 41. 
PROUD OF OUR PEOPLE
During the year, we welcomed Paul 
Hollingworth as Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer. 
Paul’s appointment has strengthened the 
leadership team signiﬁ cantly and we have 
beneﬁ ted from his previous experience as 
Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer of a number of major 
UK listed companies.
The Group Executive Board has continued 
to show strong leadership and we made a 
number of changes that enable us to manage 
more effectively going forward. In November 
2009, Jürgen Büser, having recovered well 
following a period of ill health, returned to 
the business to take up the role of Group 
Strategy Director. Pete Constanti, previously 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, Mainstream Travel 
UK, was appointed to the new Group role of 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, Group Destination 
Management, and Ian Derbyshire, previously 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, Independent Travel 
UK, was appointed Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, UK. 
In May 2010, Thomas Döring, Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer, West & East Europe, expanded his 
role, taking on additional responsibility for 
spearheading our OTA initiative.
Ludger Heuberg , Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, 
Group Operations, who provided interim 
support as Acting Group Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer, and Alexis Coles-Barrasso, Group 
Director PR & Communications, stepped 
down to pursue other opportunities. I would 
like to thank them both for their valued 
input over the years. 
As part of the UK restructuring, we had 
to part with a number of our colleagues 
following the year end. The downsizing in no 
way reﬂ ects upon their ability or passion for 
the business and they go with our gratitude 
and best wishes for the future. 
 Next stop: London 2012
I would also like to personally thank all our 
people for their hard work and commitment 
to the Group over the last year. It has been 
challenging at times and the effort and 
energy they have shown has been invaluable.
CURRENT TRADING AND OUTLOOK
Our business has proved its resilience in 
challenging times. 
As we enter the current year, although the 
UK environment remains uncertain, we are 
encouraged by a better market environment 
in our major Continental and Scandinavian 
markets. Winter bookings are off to a good 
start and, although early in the cycle, 
summer bookings are developing well. 
We have taken further actions to simplify 
and streamline our UK business which 
will result in signiﬁ cant cost savings on an 
annualised basis, helping to mitigate input 
cost pressures and any further deterioration 
in the trading environment.
We are conﬁ dent that the actions we have 
now taken to reinforce the UK business, 
together with continued progress on our 
strategic initiatives, leave us well positioned 
to make progress in the current year.

OF THE CHALLENGES AND 
TRENDS AFFECTING THE 
TRAVEL MARKET:
Q&A
Directors’ Report
Market review
POSITIONED
WELL FOR 
GROWTH
MACRO ENVIRONMENT AND 
INTERNATIONAL TOURISM 
International tourism is closely correlated 
to economic growth and has enjoyed strong 
and sustained growth for most of the last 
three decades. Indeed, the overwhelming 
trend has been for international leisure 
travel to outpace the general economy. 
The global ﬁ nancial crisis in 2008 and 
the subsequent contraction in GDP and 
employment across many economies, 
combined with fuel and currency volatility, 
has restrained growth in recent years 
(Figure 1).
Over the last 12 months, we have started to 
see the economic indicators stabilise and 
begin to show signs of recovery in many of 
our major source markets in Continental 
and Northern Europe. This gives us some 
conﬁ dence that volumes in these markets 
will return to growth in the current ﬁ nancial 
year. The UK economy remains fragile and, 
in this source market, we have taken cost 
cutting and consolidation measures to 
prepare ourselves for another potentially 
difﬁ cult year.
CORE MARKET TRENDS
Thomas Cook’s top ten current source 
markets comprise the UK, Germany, France, 
the Netherlands, Belgium, the four Nordic 
countries and Canada. Together these markets 
account for 33%, or £274bn (Figure 2), of the 
total global leisure travel market. Our market 
segment, the travel intermediary segment, 
which is made up of travel agents and tour 
operators, totalled some £96bn in 2009 and is 
expected to grow by an average of 2.8% each 
year in real terms to reach £110bn by 2014 
(Figures 3 and 4). 
Within the travel intermediary market, 
expectations are that the package holiday 
will remain a mainstay of the market. 
Growth will be higher in independent travel 
and online bookings will grow faster than 
ofﬂ ine for both mainstream and independent 
products. Our strategy is designed to capture 
value from each of these key trends. 
Mainstream vs Independent 
In 2009, mainstream package holidays 
comprised £29bn or 30% of the total 
intermediary market (Figure 4). Customers 
continue to ﬁ nd the value, convenience 
and protection offered via the package 
holiday attractive, with modest but further 
real growth of around 2.1% per annum 
forecast to 2014. 
Independent travel, where customers 
put together their own ﬂ ight, transfer and 
accommodation arrangements is large 
and growing fast. Comprising £63bn of the 
intermediary market in 2009, independent 
travel is forecast to grow by 3.2% per 
annum to 2014. 
Online growth
In terms of distribution, the shift towards 
online continues, with internet estimated to 
increase its share of total market sales from 
25% to 31% (Figure 5). 
Although the dynamic nature of independent 
travel makes the online environment ideal 
for travel research and purchases, package 
customers too are increasingly alive to the 
convenience of online.
Consumer preferences 
Our research demonstrates that consumers 
continue to prioritise a main holiday abroad 
and that they are looking for both quality 
and value. 
These preferences have fuelled demand 
for medium haul holidays to destinations 
outside of the Eurozone, especially to Turkey 
and Egypt. All inclusive holidays, which give 
customers greater budget certainty, have also 
continued their rise. 
EMERGING MARKET GROWTH 
While our top ten source markets comprise 
approximately 33% of the world leisure travel 
market today, the BRIC economies currently 
account for only 9% (Figure 2). Travel growth 
rates in these emerging economies, however, 
far outstrip growth in our established source 
markets, supported by higher than average 
GDP growth rates and an increasingly 
afﬂ uent population. For example, between 
2008 and 2012, outbound travel in Russia is 
expected to grow 15 to 20% on average each 
year with an equivalent growth rate of 10 to 
15% in China. 
New markets and particularly the emerging 
economies offer a huge potential growth 
opportunity for Thomas Cook. We have 
already established positions in India, 
Egypt and Eastern Europe and continue to 
look for entry opportunities where we can 
leverage our expertise and capture value for 
shareholders at the right price. In November 
2010, we announced our plans to enter 
the Russian market in a joint venture with 
VAO Intourist.
As the economic climate improves, forecasters 
expect the international tourism market 
to return to growth. The rate of recovery is 
expected to vary across markets, with some 
economies emerging more conﬁ dently from 
recession than others.

Q   What would happen if the 
Icelandic volcano erupted 
again? 
A – We can be reasonably 
conﬁ dent that there wouldn’t 
be the same level of disruption. 
At the onset of the volcanic ash 
incident, the aviation authorities 
had very limited experience of 
how to maintain safe ﬂ ying in 
such an environment. Working 
closely together, the industry 
now has a much greater 
understanding of the challenge 
and the aviation authorities 
have agreed zoning procedures 
that enable safe ﬂ ying to 
continue in unaffected areas.
Q  If online distribution is growing 
so fast, why increase your 
exposure to the high street in 
the UK through the merger with 
The Co-operative Group and 
Midlands Co-operative? 
A – We’re participating in the 
online growth trend through 
the development of our 
Online Travel Agent (OTA). 
However, ofﬂ ine distribution 
remains an important channel 
for both traditional, package 
holiday sales and more ﬂ exible, 
independent travel products. 
Industry data shows that ofﬂ ine 
distribution could continue to 
account for up to 70% of total 
sales in 2014. We therefore need 
to maintain a strong but 
highly efﬁ cient high street 
network. The deal with The 
Co-operatives enables us to 
do that by improving the 
reach of our network while 
reducing our costs.
Q  What impact do you think the 
new air passenger duties in 
Germany and the UK will have 
on demand? 
A – Taxes increase the cost of 
ﬂ ying and this can obviously 
reduce demand. We are 
particularly disappointed as the 
tax increases purport to support 
the green agenda when in fact 
they will do nothing to increase 
or incentivise more efﬁ cient 
ﬂ ying. We continue to target 
high aircraft utilisation, fuel 
and operating efﬁ ciency, all 
of which help keep the cost 
of ﬂ ying as low as possible 
to support demand.

2 Real Compound Annual Growth Rate 2009 – 2014.
The mainstream travel market will 
continue to grow in real terms; 
however, independent travel will 
drive the majority of growth.
There are two distinct 
segments in the 
leisure travel market: 
direct suppliers and 
travel intermediaries. 
Direct suppliers are 
the airlines, hotels 
and cruise companies 
that sell directly to 
the customer. Thomas 
Cook operates in the 
travel intermediary 
segment, made up of 
travel agents and tour 
operators.

Our strategy has continued to serve us well
and offers plenty of opportunity for growth.
DELIVERING AGAINST 
OUR STRATEGY
Directors’ Report
Strategic review
OVERVIEW OF STRATEGY  
Inspired by the vision “We go further to 
make dreams come true,” our strategy has 
remained clear and constant, focused around 
strengthening our existing businesses and 
investing for future growth.
During the year, we began work on a number 
of strategic initiatives that have the potential 
to deliver revenue growth and lift the Group 
operating proﬁ t margin by 100 to 150 basis 
points over the medium term. 
Our strategic initiatives focus on delivering 
against our growth drivers; maximising value 
in mainstream travel and ﬁ nancial services 
and investing in areas of future growth, 
primarily independent travel and emerging 
markets. In parallel, we continue to look for 
opportunities that can accelerate our journey 
by capturing growth and value through 
mergers and acquisitions.
1 MAINSTREAM TRAVEL
The strategy for our mainstream business 
is to improve product mix, whilst reducing  
costs, thus driving an improvement in 
margin. During the year, we made good 
progress in managing our accommodation 
and aviation costs. We also continued 
to introduce new differentiated product 
concepts and drive distribution gains.
Cost efﬁ ciencies  
Accommodation and non-fuel aviation 
costs are £2.9bn and £2.5bn respectively, 
so a relatively modest saving can have a big 
impact on our performance. Our approach 
is to leverage our Group buying scale in both 
these areas, co-ordinating action across all 
segments to deliver beneﬁ t.
Group destination management
At the outset of this year, we targeted a 
signiﬁ cant reduction in accommodation costs  
to support demand in the difﬁ cult economic 
climate and mitigate currency-related 
inﬂ ation resulting from Sterling weakness. 
A new Group Destination Management 
function was set up to co-ordinate strategy 
and hotelier negotiations with our top 75 
hotel partners and in our fastest-growing 
destinations of Turkey and Egypt. With 
direct control of more than £1bn of 
accommodation spend, the new function 
has been instrumental in reducing Group 
accommodation costs as a percentage of 
sales by 120 basis points to 32.5%. The new 
function will also support more exclusive 
access to hotel properties and consolidate 
inbound agency relationships and in-
destination support staff across the Group.
Airline synergies
On aviation, we began implementation of 
an ambitious synergy plan to unlock savings 
of £35m per annum. By working more 
closely together, our airlines had delivered 
£19m of incremental savings during the year 
through a combination of fuel efﬁ ciency 
measures and improved purchasing of fuel, 
crew accommodation, ground handling and 
maintenance services. Plans are in place to 
purchase catering and rotables support more 
effectively which will deliver the balance of 
savings in this, and the following, ﬁ nancial 
years. 
Product mix and trading margin gains 
Product mix is a key factor in driving 
margins and we have already made good 
progress by recalibrating our programmes 
towards medium haul destinations, all 
inclusive resorts and more 4 and 5 star 
holidays. As part of this, we also work to 
increase the proportion of differentiated, 
unique-concept holidays and exclusive 
hotels we offer.
This year, the French market had particular 
success with a new concept, Club Jumbo. 
Club Jumbo turns the perceived pricing 
model for package holidays on its head, 
offering low prices to early bookers and 
increasing prices close to departure. With 
its lively entertainment programme, 
this new concept attracted a total of 
30,000 customers, 5% of the total French 
customer base, taking more than 60% of 
bookings online.
Overall, our West & East Europe segment 
increased sales of differentiated and 
exclusive product from 41% to 45%, the UK 
segment from 32% to 35% and Central Europe 
from 24% to 28%.
Distribution gains
During the year, the Group increased in-
house distribution of mainstream product to 
52% (2009: 51%) and online distribution to 
23% (2009: 22%)
2 TRAVEL-RELATED FINANCIAL SERVICES
Our key objective in ﬁ nancial services is to 
drive sales through cross selling of foreign 
exchange and travel insurance products. In 
the period, ﬁ nancial services contributed 
around 14% of Group adjusted underlying 
operating proﬁ t. In the UK, we increased our 
share of the retail foreign exchange market 
from 13% to 15% and established ourselves 
as the number one global provider of cash 
passports supplied by Travelex, with a 150% 
increase in sales.
3 INDEPENDENT TRAVEL
Our objective with independent travel is to 
grow both the top and bottom line, largely 
through the development of our European 
Online Travel Agent (OTA). During the year, 
independent travel continued to grow 
strongly, increasing to 27% of Group revenue 
from 25% last year, with passengers up by 5%.
Online Travel Agent (OTA) 
Unlike the US, the European OTA market 
remains relatively fragmented and Thomas 
Cook has the opportunity to achieve a top 
three market position. Accordingly, we 
are targeting gross bookings with a value 
of around £3.5bn over the medium term 
(although sales will be accounted for on a net 
commission basis).
We already have many of the capabilities 
to succeed as an OTA: a strong travel brand, 
a large customer base, an existing online 
platform, in-house expertise and market-
leading sun inventory.

Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010 13
During the year, we brought those capabilities 
together in a central OTA organisation, 
headquartered in London, and gave that 
organisation responsibility for driving forward 
our main OTA and branded tour operator sites 
in the UK, Germany, France, the Netherlands 
and Belgium. The new structure combines 
regional directors with responsibility for 
delivering the online plan for each of the ﬁ ve 
markets with a strong central organisation, 
spanning key commercial, infrastructure and 
business support functions. Comprising some 
180 employees in total, the new organisation 
brings together specialists from within 
Thomas Cook with new talent from across 
the online industry.
Signiﬁ cant progress was made in enhancing 
the presentation and streamlining the 
booking path on our main websites and, in 
the current year, we will upgrade the invisible 
but crucial technology platform. This will 
enable us to increase the inventory and 
improve the presentation we offer to our 
customers. In parallel with the technology 
upgrade, we are also focused on building up 
our city hotel inventory to complement our 
current strength in sun and beach hotels.
Taken together, the sites within the scope of 
the OTA delivered gross bookings with a value 
of £1bn in the ﬁ nancial year just ended, an 
increase of 22% on the previous year. 
In its initial stages, the results of the OTA will 
continue to be reported within our existing 
segments but we will give more visibility to

Through M&A and partnerships, our objective 
is to capitalise on consolidation opportunities 
in our current markets and leverage our 
expertise to capture growth opportunities 
in emerging markets.
Consolidation opportunities in 
current markets
During the year and following the year 
end, we have announced three transactions 
in our existing markets.
In the UK, we announced the merger 
of our high street retail travel and foreign 
exchange network with that of The 
Co-operative Group and Midlands 
Co-operative. On completion, the merger 
will create the UK’s largest high street 
travel network with over 1,300 stores. 
By bringing together two complementary 
brands and geographic networks, the 
merged entity will reach more customers 
than either company could achieve 
independently. It is planned to unlock 
synergies of at least £35m in the merged 
entity and a further £10m upstream 
synergies within Thomas Cook from 
additional sales of our mainstream and

independent travel products. Thomas 
Cook will hold 66.5% of the merged entity, 
The Co-operative Group will hold 30% and 
Midlands Co-operative will hold 3.5%. Whilst 
the merger is still subject to competition 
clearance, we are working with the relevant 
authorities to achieve an expedited clearance.
In Germany, we acquired Öger Tours, a tour 
operator specialising in package holidays to 
Turkey. This acquisition, which completed 
in October 2010, strengthens our position as 
the second largest travel group in Germany 
and further increases our presence in Turkey, 
a strategically important destination for the 
entire Group. Today, Öger Tours carries some 
400,000 passengers. By bringing Öger into 
the Thomas Cook family, we estimate we 
can generate synergies in excess of €8m per 
annum through operational savings, more 
in-house ﬂ ying with Condor and combined 
accommodation purchasing.
Finally, in ﬁ nancial services, we boosted our 
capability by acquiring Essential Travel, a 
leading provider of online travel insurance 
and ancillary products in the UK.
Growth in emerging markets
Alongside these transactions in our 
established markets, in November 2010 we 
reached agreement to enter the fast-growing 
Russian travel market in a joint venture with 
VAO Intourist, one of Russia’s oldest and 
most renowned travel companies. The joint 
venture will include Intourist’s outbound, 
domestic and inbound tour operating 
operations as well as its retail travel network. 
It will focus on expansion in Russia and the 
other CIS countries. 
The Russian market has strong demand for 
beach and family holidays, particularly to 
Turkey and Egypt. Over six million Russians 
went on overseas, packaged holidays last year 
and the market is expected to grow strongly 
in the coming years given increasing wealth 
amongst Russia’s population of 142 million 
and strong economic growth driven by the 
natural resources sector.
Thomas Cook will initially acquire a 50.1% 
stake in the new joint venture company, 
for a maximum consideration of US$45m. 
The joint venture is conditional upon 
anti-trust clearance in Russia and certain 
other conditions and is expected 
to complete in or before February 2011.

The Spring of 2010 saw unprecedented disruption and travel chaos 
resulting from the widespread closure of airspace over many 
European countries when the Eyjafjallajökull volcano in Iceland 
erupted. Clouds of ash reached heights of more than 30,000 feet and 
understandably there was uncertainty on an international level as to 
how these exceptional conditions could affect aircraft. 
The initial uninterrupted shutdown over much of northern Europe 
lasted for almost six days, from 15 April to 20 April, and was followed 
by further intermittent, isolated closures in April and May.
The airspace closures meant 180,000 Thomas Cook customers were 
stranded in resort and a further 190,000 customers were unable to 
depart on holiday.
Thanks to the commitment of our international team and our 
strong supplier relationships all over the world, Thomas Cook 
customers were well looked after during this difﬁ cult time. 
Moreover, the Group was back operating its full tour operating 
programme within 36 hours of the ban being lifted and we were 
able to repatriate all of our customers who were stranded overseas 
within ﬁ ve days of the airspace reopening.
THE VOLCANIC ASH CLOUD:
OUR RESPONSE TO CUSTOMERS
• we immediately invoked our tried and tested emergency 
procedures and set up specialised incident rooms from 
which to organise our response to the crisis
• communication with our customers was paramount in 
this ever-changing situation and we set up telephone 
hotlines as well as continuously updating our websites
• we employed a variety of alternative methods of 
transport to repatriate stranded customers, chartering 
coaches and even a cruise ship to get people home
• all 180,000 stranded customers arrived home within 
ﬁ ve days of the airspace being reopened
• feedback from customers was hugely positive with a  
large number taking the time to write to thank us

ONLINE TRAVEL AGENCY
CREATING A 
TOP THREE 
EUROPEAN 
ONLINE TRAVEL 
AGENT
Alongside our more established 
sales channels, e-Commerce is an 
increasingly important channel for 
our business and one of our key 
drivers for growth.
During the year, we announced our ambitious plans to develop a full service 
Online Travel Agent (OTA), where our ultimate aim is to achieve a top three 
position in Europe, rivalling the likes of the current market leaders Expedia 
and Opodo.
The OTA is a major strategic objective for the Group as we see potential for 
transactions with a gross booking value of c. £3.5bn and signiﬁ cant proﬁ t. 
Unlike the American market, which is already dominated by two main 
players, the European OTA landscape is relatively fragmented and 
growing fast.
We already have many of the capabilities to succeed; a strong brand, 
a large customer base, an existing online presence and market leading 
sun inventory. Our OTA team is building our portfolio of city hotels and 
enhancing our technology platform, both key to being successful in 
this market.
As one of the world’s best known and most trusted travel brands, we’re 
uniquely placed to become a truly leading site. This is one of the most 
exciting and revolutionary developments in our recent history.

UNLOCK VALUE THROUGH GREATER 
GROUP COORDINATION
Market-leading customer service will continue to be at the 
forefront of everything we do.
Our Group-wide approach to destination management will:
• create and embed a ‘united as one team’ overseas culture
• deliver consistently high standards of customer service 
in resort
• capitalise on market strengths and further share 
best practice
• increase in-resort revenue
• remove duplication and drive greater efﬁ ciency
• minimise costs

As an international travel group transporting customers to more 
than 40 countries worldwide, Thomas Cook has an unrivalled 
opportunity to make the most of the scale of its business by 
working together across its markets. 
During the year, we made real progress in the establishment of a 
Group Destination Management function, which aims to leverage 
our Group buying power and standardise customer service in our 
resorts around the world. 
Most signiﬁ cantly, the new function will take the lead in 
coordinating strategy and hotelier negotiations with the Group’s 
key international hotel chains and in our fastest growing 
destinations of Turkey and Egypt. Not only is this approach 
designed to reduce accommodation costs, but to support top 
line growth by negotiating exclusivity on properties that are 
in demand from our customers.
In addition, Group Destination Management will streamline the 
number of incoming agents we work with in each of our key 
destinations and introduce a single management structure to 
coordinate in-resort customer service and sales from across most
of the Group. The function will also build a central accommodation 
content database that our source markets can share.

AIRLINE SYNERGIES
REALISING 
BENEFITS 
FROM OUR 
INTERNATIONAL 
AIRLINES
Working together, our airlines 
are achieving signiﬁ cant savings 
by improving fuel efﬁ ciency and 
consolidating suppliers.
Thomas Cook Group operates a ﬂ eet of 93 aircraft, carrying 17 million 
passengers each year and employing 6,800 people. The ﬂ eet is split into 
four airlines: the UK airline, the German airline ﬂ ying under the Condor 
brand, the Scandinavian and Belgian airlines.
By joining forces to share best practice and leverage their combined 
buying power, the airlines identiﬁ ed £35m of annual savings that 
could be made in aviation operating costs. By the end of the year, 
£19m of incremental savings within that target had been achieved. 
These savings come on top of the £34m of synergies already 
achieved prior to 2009.

Principal risks and uncertainties
Thomas Cook Group plc, like all businesses, faces risks and 
uncertainties as we conduct our operations and execute our 
strategy. We place great importance on internal control and risk 
management, and the system and framework that the Board has 
put in place is described in the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 57 to 58. 
The table below lists the principal risks and uncertainties that may affect the Group and also highlights the mitigating actions that are 
being taken. The content in the table, however, is not intended to be an exhaustive list of all the risks and uncertainties which may arise.

ﬂ eet, allowing further ﬂ exibility to cut capacity without affecting our own airline 
–  Changes in capacity can be accommodated late into the booking season
• Utilising our buying power to manage accommodation costs across the Group 
• Tight cost discipline throughout the organisation with ability to cut costs further 
if necessary. Cost synergies identiﬁ ed between our various airlines

The UK has experienced a tough year against

with adjusted underlying operating proﬁ t 
falling to £123.9m (2009 restated: £162.0m) 
and underlying operating margin down to 
3.4% (2009: 5.2%).
In anticipation of the difﬁ cult trading 
conditions, management reduced the overall 
capacity on sale by 4.9%, with winter down 
13% and summer held reasonably ﬂ at in 
light of signiﬁ cant capacity reductions in the 
previous summer. 
Despite the reduced capacity and the 
impact of the volcanic ash cloud, revenue 
was slightly up year-on-year as a result of 
higher selling prices in both the Mainstream 
and Independent businesses and the full 
year effect of acquisitions made this year 
and last year (mainly Essential Travel and 
Gold Medal). 
The volcanic ash cloud and resultant closure 
of airspace had a signiﬁ cant impact on the 
April ﬂ ying programme, but also a knock-on 
effect on demand throughout the summer 
season. Lost sales as a result of the volcanic 
ash cloud are estimated to be around £55m 
with margin adversely affected by £16.4m. 
The direct costs of the volcanic ash cloud 
incident, which have been included within 
exceptional operating items, were £24.3m. 
The volcanic ash cloud, good early summer 
weather across much of the UK, and the 
uncertain economic outlook meant that 
summer trading was softer than expected 
and the increases we achieved in selling 
prices were not sufﬁ cient to compensate for 
other trading challenges. 
One such challenge was the weakness 
of Sterling which management estimate 
led to an increase in our foreign currency 
denominated costs, mainly fuel, aircraft lease 
costs and accommodation costs, of around 
£160m year-on-year. Just over half of this 
was compensated for by lower underlying 
Dollar fuel prices and our successful supplier 
negotiations, most notably with hoteliers. 
In addition, we realised £10m of airline 
synergies which helped to partly offset some 
of the trading downside. 
The performance of our independent 
businesses during the year has been mixed. 
Gold Medal and Hotels4U have traded 
reasonably, but other areas have found 
conditions difﬁ cult.
Our businesses in India and Egypt (which are 
included in the UK segment for reporting 
purposes) ended the year well, showing signs 
of recovery from the global recession that 
impacted in the prior year and the ﬁ rst half 
of this year. 
Our share of controlled distribution grew by 
3.4% in the year to 72.0%. The main driver 
for this increase was our share of internet 
distribution which grew by 8.7% to 32.6%.
MARKET DYNAMICS
The UK economy began a slow 
recovery from recession and the 
market was characterised by 
demand softness. Euro and US Dollar 
denominated accommodation and 
ﬂ ying costs were adversely affected by 
weak Sterling. 
Over 42,000 customers enjoyed one of our Aquamania holidays, a new 
product concept featuring 15 fabulous hotels each with its own integrated 
water park.

SEGMENT PERFORMANCE
Our Central European segment has delivered 
a good result this year and experienced strong 
trading in the late summer months. The 
adjusted underlying proﬁ t from operations 
was £60.9m (2009 restated: £50.4m), up 21% 
on the prior year. The underlying margin also 
improved signiﬁ cantly, from 2.3% to 3.0%. 
The overall margin we achieved in Germany 
(including Airlines Germany) improved from 
3.4% to 4.1%.
Currency-adjusted revenue was down 7% 
year-on-year largely as a result of lower 
non-ﬂ ight inclusive passengers and lower 
selling prices, particularly in the ﬂ ight-
inclusive mainstream business, reﬂ ecting 
lower hotel and ﬂ ight costs. Our dynamic 
packaging business successfully grew volume 
at increased prices. 
Lost sales as a result of the volcanic ash 
cloud are estimated to be around £13m 
with margin adversely affected by £2.3m. 
The direct costs of the volcanic ash cloud 
incident, which have been included within 
exceptional operating items, were £5.6m.
Despite lower revenue, underlying gross 
proﬁ t, excluding the impact of volcanic 
ash and changes in translation rates, was 
broadly ﬂ at year-on-year as we successfully 
negotiated with suppliers to reduce hotel 
and ﬂ ying costs and improved our utilisation 
of purchased ﬂ ight capacity. 
The overall improvement in adjusted 
underlying proﬁ t from operations of £10.5m 
(which includes £1.2m adverse impact from 
exchange translation) is therefore largely 
attributable to savings in overhead costs, 
following the restructuring programmes we 
undertook last year and our continued focus 
on driving down costs. 
Controlled distribution fell slightly in the year 
to 23.7% as sales through in-house shops 
were adversely impacted by the collapse of 
Arcandor which resulted in the closure of the 
Neckermann Technik Center shops and many 
of the Karstadt shops, with the remaining 
Karstadt shops no longer being under our 
control. Our proportion of internet sales 
stayed broadly similar to last year, at 7.2%. 
MARKET DYNAMICS
The German economic environment 
improved markedly through the year, 
with GDP and consumer sentiment 
showing good growth and helping to 
lift demand in the second half. 
Turkey continues to grow in popularity as a holiday destination for customers of our Central Europe 
segment. This year, we strengthened our offering to Turkey through the acquisition of the Turkish 
specialist tour operator, Öger Tours.

SEGMENT PERFORMANCE
Our West & East European segment has 
delivered a robust performance this year 
despite the difﬁ cult economic conditions 
that prevail in some of their markets. The 
adjusted underlying proﬁ t from operations, 
at £86.7m (2009 restated: £85.7m), increased 
by £1.0m and the underlying margin 
improved from 4.6% to 4.8%.
Currency-adjusted revenue was down 7% 
year-on-year as a result of lower volumes and 
selling prices. In France, we made a strong 
recovery from the slow ﬁ rst half trading 
performance with a volume increase in short 
haul in the second half. We ended the year 
with volumes 5% down and selling prices ﬂ at. 
Volumes were down 13% in Belgium where 
recovery from the global recession has been 
slower than in many European markets, 
and selling prices were up slightly. In the 
Netherlands, passenger numbers increased 
year-on-year by 4% but selling prices were 
down 3%. In Poland, the largest of the 
Eastern markets, passengers were down 9%, 
but selling prices were strong, up 7%.
Lost sales as a result of the volcanic ash 
cloud are estimated to be around £21m 
with margin adversely affected by £4.7m. 
The direct costs of the volcanic ash cloud 
incident, which have been included within 
exceptional operating items, were £14.0m.
Adjusted underlying proﬁ t from operations 
was £1.0m higher than the prior year. 
However, this includes an adverse exchange 
translation impact of £5.5m. Adjusting for 
this, the proﬁ t increased by £6.5m, largely as 
a result of savings in overhead costs following 
the extensive restructuring programmes 
we have undertaken across all the Western 
markets. These restructuring programmes 
and our continued focus on driving down 
costs resulted in approximately £24m of 
overhead savings year-on-year. 
Following a concerted effort, the West & 
East segment has experienced strong growth 
in the year in exclusive and differentiated 
products and controlled and internet 
distribution. Controlled distribution now 
stands at 56.9%, whereas the proportion 
of sales through the internet grew by some 
36.3% to 21.4%. 
MARKET DYNAMICS
In the West European markets, the 
economic environment in France and 
the Netherlands improved towards 
the end of the year, although Belgium 
remains challenging. The East 
European markets are now beginning 
to show signs of improvement.
The earlier you book, the less you pay! That’s the central promise of our new concept, Club Jumbo. 
Spanning ﬁ ve clubs across four countries, with a streamlined online booking platform, Club Jumbo 
attracted 30,000 customers in its ﬁ rst year of operation.

SEGMENT PERFORMANCE
Our Northern European segment has 
delivered another strong result this year, 
despite a slow start to the year. The adjusted 
underlying proﬁ t from operations was 
£93.9m (2009 restated: £86.6m), up 8% 
on the prior year. The underlying proﬁ t 
margin, which remains industry-leading, 
also improved from 8.2% to 9.0%. 
Currency-adjusted revenue was down 3% 
year-on-year largely as a result of capacity 
reductions. Average selling prices in local 
currencies were up 3% year-on-year. 
Lost sales as a result of the volcanic ash cloud 
are estimated to be around £7m with margin 
adversely affected by £2.2m. The direct costs 
of the volcanic ash cloud incident, which 
have been included within exceptional 
operating items, were £5.9m.
Underlying gross proﬁ t, excluding the impact 
of volcanic ash and changes in translation 
rates, was slightly down year-on-year as 
underlying rate reductions in hotel and 
ﬂ ying costs were not quite enough to offset 
the adverse impact of foreign currency 
on those hotel and ﬂ ying costs and the 
reduced volumes.
However, a continued cost focus together 
with a favourable exchange translation effect 
(from SEK to Sterling) of £6.6m ensured the 
adjusted underlying proﬁ t from operations 
improved by £7.3m. 
Northern Europe continues to lead the 
Group with regards controlled and internet 
distribution and has, yet again, experienced 
strong growth in this key area. Controlled 
distribution now accounts for some 84.4% of 
sales, up from 82.7%, and the proportion of 
internet sales grew 12.2% to 60.7%.
Improvements to our Ving website have been instrumental in 
increasing internet distribution by a further 12.2% to 60.7%.
MARKET DYNAMICS
Demand for summer holidays was 
affected by unseasonably warm 
weather and the volcanic ash cloud 
in key booking months. Consumer 
sentiment has been resilient in most 
markets and continues to improve 
in Sweden and Norway. Recovery is 
slower in Denmark.

SEGMENT PERFORMANCE
Our North American segment has endured 
a challenging year, with continued over-
capacity in the Mainstream market severely 
impacting margins. Despite these challenges, 
however, we were able to achieve an 
adjusted underlying proﬁ t from operations 
of £9.7m (2009: £17.9m). The underlying 
margin was 2.6% (2009: 4.8%). 
Currency-adjusted revenue was down 14% 
year-on-year. This reduction largely reﬂ ects 
lower average selling prices achieved, mainly 
in the Mainstream business, together with 
a reduction in tour operator capacity. In 
addition, the disposal of Alumni Holidays in 
the prior year accounted for 3% of the year-
on-year revenue reduction. Lost sales as a 
result of the volcanic ash cloud are estimated 
to be around £1m with margin adversely 
affected by £0.6m. 
The underlying gross proﬁ t decreased year-
on-year in our Mainstream business as rate 
reductions achieved on hotel and lower fuel 
costs were not sufﬁ cient to offset the impact 
of reduced capacity, lower average selling 
prices and the adverse impact of foreign 
currency on hotel costs. The collapse of our 
largest aircraft seat provider, Skyservice, 
also had a detrimental impact on the 
Mainstream business.
The Independent business, which now 
accounts for more than 70% of passengers 
in the North America segment, performed 
reasonably well in the year. Some price 
pressure was experienced as a result of 
the economic climate, but greater product 
diversiﬁ cation and lower volatility meant that 
the impact was much less than that felt in 
the Mainstream sector.
Overhead cost savings stemming from the 
restructuring and integration programmes we 
undertook in the previous years ensured that 
some of the margin deterioration was offset. 
However, as a result of the deterioration 
in trading performance, management is 
conducting a further review of the cost base 
and organisation structure with the intention 
of substantially reducing overheads.
Controlled distribution in our Mainstream 
business has remained broadly similar to the 
prior year at 14.3%. Whilst our share of total 
sales over the internet fell slightly to 36.7%, 
we anticipate a reversal of this trend when 
we launch our new website in January. 
TravelGenie, our dynamic packaging engine, continues to revolutionise the booking process, 
offering travel agents and consumers more choice at the best possible price. TravelGenie has 
exceeded all expectations and now accounts for more than 20% of our independent tour sales.
MARKET DYNAMICS
The Canadian economy has been 
relatively resilient throughout the 
economic downturn and consumers 
continue to show strong interest 
in leisure travel. However, there 
is substantial overcapacity in the 
mainstream market which is why our 
focus is on the growing independent 
travel sector.

Drivers of margin 
improvement 
• Signiﬁ cantly increased load factors
• High productivity in the summer season 
• Strong long haul sales
• Ongoing efﬁ ciency programmes
• Elimination of unproﬁ table routes
SEGMENT PERFORMANCE
Our Airlines Germany segment has delivered 
a good set of results this year and, in 
line with our German tour operator, has 
experienced strong trading in the late 
summer months. The adjusted underlying 
proﬁ t from operations was £54.1m (2009: 
£47.4m), up 14% on the prior year. The 
underlying margin also improved, from 
4.5% to 5.1%. 
Currency-adjusted total revenue was down 
5% year-on-year. Revenue was adverse due 
to lower seat prices achieved, especially from 
internal and third-party tour operators, due 
to reduced fuel surcharges and competitive 
pricing in the market. In addition, in 
anticipation of tough market conditions, 
particularly in winter, we reduced our share 
of more expensive long haul ﬂ ying. In 
the mainstream business, total seats sold 
increased slightly year-on-year, with lower 
in-house volume being more than offset by 
increased third-party tour operator sales. 
As a consequence of the overall capacity 
reduction and the increased tour operator 
allotments, volumes in the Independent seat-
only business were down 3% year-on-year. 
Utilisation of the aircraft ﬂ eet was improved 
signiﬁ cantly, leading to an increase in the 
seat load factor of 2%.
Lost sales as a result of the volcanic ash cloud 
are estimated to be around £7m with margin 
adversely affected by £3.0m. The direct costs 
of the volcanic ash cloud incident, which 
have been included within exceptional 
operating items, were £3.1m.
At the gross margin level, we beneﬁ ted 
from lower Dollar-denominated fuel costs. 
However, this beneﬁ t was not sufﬁ cient to 
offset all of the adverse yield variance, due to 
the nature of our hedging strategy compared 
to some of the competition. In addition, 
the underlying Dollar fuel price beneﬁ t 
was reduced substantially by the adverse 
translation impact as the Euro weakened 
against the Dollar. 
This gross margin downside was, however, 
more than offset by a £14m year-on-year 
beneﬁ t achieved as a result of a Condor-
speciﬁ c cost saving programme that 
commenced in 2009; £7m of beneﬁ t from 
the Group-wide airline synergies programme; 
and a net reduction of £12m in depreciation 
costs, largely as a result of a Group-
wide review and re-alignment of aircraft 
depreciation estimates, which was partly 
offset by a £5m decrease in deferred income 
related to aircraft. As a result, the adjusted 
underlying proﬁ t from operations in the year 
increased by £6.7m (despite a £1.8m adverse 
impact from exchange translation). 
Condor achieved greater efﬁ ciency in its fuel costs by switching its fuel supply arrangements at all major 
German airports. 
MARKET DYNAMICS
In the ﬁ rst half, competitors who were 
not as extensively hedged beneﬁ ted 
from lower fuel costs resulting in 
lower market yields. As the year 
progressed, Condor’s relative cost 
position and the German economic 
environment improved, lifting 
demand and yields.

CONTINUING TO 
INVEST IN OUR FUTURE
W
hen Thomas Cook created 
the ﬁ rst package holiday 
nearly 170 years ago in 
1841, he did so with a sense of social 
responsibility. His determination to 
improve the lives of working people 
by giving them opportunities to 
learn through travel was pioneering. 
Today, the business of being a 
socially responsible travel company 
is more complex.
Longevity is one of our key business 
objectives and to be a successful business 
today we need to be economically, 
environmentally and socially sustainable. 
For the Thomas Cook Group, that means 
addressing a wide range of long-term 
challenges, including maintaining a 
committed and engaged workforce, 
providing a great holiday experience for 
customers whilst ensuring their security 
and safety, improving fuel efﬁ ciency and 
monitoring the carbon emissions from 
our planes; and encouraging sustainable 
practices within a global supply chain. 
Our achievements in 2010 include our 
UK airline becoming the country’s ﬁ rst 
to receive accreditation to the ISO 14001 
international standard for environmental 
management. This accomplishment 
is testimony to Thomas Cook Airlines’ 
investment in improving environmental 
performance across every area of its 
operations, from onboard recycling to 
saving energy in the hangar. We also rolled 
out our employee Sharesave scheme to 
the Group, giving everyone who works 
with us the opportunity to share in our 
success. In addition, we maintained our 
commitment to the Travelife Sustainability 
System for hotels and other tourism 
companies: more hotels have been audited 
against the Travelife criteria.
Particularly close to my heart is the support 
we can give to those less fortunate than 
ourselves. I continue to chair the Board 
of Trustees of the Thomas Cook Children’s 
Charity and insist that our Company pays 
all administration costs so that every penny 
donated goes directly to help children. When 
the devastating earthquake hit Haiti in 
January, we donated space on our planes to 
the Disasters Emergency Committee, ﬂ ying 
out surgical teams, medical kits and portable 
water supply equipment. We also provided 
ﬁ nancial support from customer donations 
to Just A Drop, a charity who developed a 
speciﬁ c project helping displaced families 
in Haiti return to their homes.
Tourism today is very different from 
when Thomas Cook started out, but his 
socially responsible spirit lives on in our 
company; and I believe our commitment to 
sustainability makes us a stronger business 
helping us to ensure that the Thomas Cook 
Group is still here in another 170 years’ time.

A SINGLE GROUP CULTURE
Our people strive to deliver the highest 
standards of service as expected by our 
customers. It is therefore our people 
which mark us out as different from our 
competitors. By embedding our vision and 
values in our people strategy and people 
processes, we have created a single culture 
across the Group which supports our people 
to make a real difference to the success of 
our business.
Our vision and values
Our vision “We go further to make dreams 
come true”, is embedded amongst our people 
through promotion of the PROUD values, a 
set of ﬁ ve values which are the cornerstone 
of the actions of our people. We embed these 
values through the PROUD awards, which 
reward individuals or teams who have really 
gone further to make dreams come true for 
our business and our customers. Our values 
are reinforced in all our people processes.
In this way, we have developed a single group 
culture, which is shared by our 31,000 people 
across the 21 countries in which we operate.
For more information, please see our sustainability 
report Travel the World without Costing the Earth
which is published annually and sets out our 
policies, focus areas, activities and performance. To 
conserve resources, this will be available only online

Our people strategy 
– guiding principles
• We believe that engaging and motivating 
our 31,000 people will give us a greater 
and more sustainable competitive 
advantage than anything else we do.
• Providing all our people with inspiring 
and visible leadership, strategic 
direction, and effective performance-
based reward and recognition are 
amongst the top priorities of the senior 
management team. 
• Our Vision and Values provide clarity 
on our ambitions for the business, and 
deﬁ ne the way we work together, as 
one Group, to achieve our goals.
• We believe our top 100 managers (the 
key leadership group) are critical to our 
success. We focus particular attention 
on personal development, succession 
planning and incentives for this group.
• We track the success of our people 
strategy via a number of feedback 
mechanisms, including an annual 
Group-wide employee engagement 
survey, and act on what we learn.
Our people processes
We embed the PROUD values through all our 
people processes.
Recruitment and retention: We aim to recruit 
and retain exceptional people who subscribe 
to our values.
Learning and development: We invest 
appropriately to ensure our people maximise 
their potential and contribution to our 
business. For example, in the UK, our 
Academy is a learning environment which 
provides access to a variety of development 
and learning activities (both online and face-
to-face) to assist our people to go further in 
their career with Thomas Cook.
Performance review: We have robust 
performance review processes embedded 
across the Group which are underpinned 
by our values, and guide how we coach our 
people to get the best from themselves 
and others.
Reward: Our people share in our success. 
We recognise and reward both the 
achievement of results and the manner 
in which they are accomplished. Certain 
parts of the business, speciﬁ cally UK and 
India, also reward individual performance 
which is in line with the PROUD values. 
Through participation in our international 
share plan, Sharesave, all employees have 
the opportunity to share in potential 
long-term rewards linked to the growth 
in our share price.
Employee communication and 
engagement
Thomas Cook places a great deal of 
importance on internal communications to 
create universal understanding of the Group’s 
agenda. The Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer 
visits the business segments throughout the 
year and communicates regularly to update 
Group employees on the Company’s progress 
and performance.
Regular communications within the segments 
keep our people up-to-date on the latest 
business and market developments. In 
addition, our key markets also host annual 
conferences to review the previous year’s 
performance and set out the priorities for 
the coming year.
Employee engagement survey 
We want to ensure that Thomas Cook 
remains a great place to work and there’s 
nobody better placed to tell us how we’re 
doing than our people. For the third year, 
we have conducted a Group-wide employee 
engagement survey run by Expert Training 
Systems (ETS), an independent specialist 
third-party.
The survey gives everyone across Thomas Cook 
and our family of brands the opportunity to 
share their open and honest views on how 
they feel about working for the Company, 
what we’re doing well and how they believe 
we could improve.
The feedback from the survey shapes our 
action plans for change over the coming year.
• annual survey – results and action plans 
shared with our people
• standard set of questions across all 
segments, focusing on people engagement
• 24,224 responses (76% of employees)
• results benchmarked internationally
• Group result for 2009 of 3.83 out of 
5 which ETS class as excellent¹
• employee satisfaction has increased year-
on-year since the Group was created three 
years ago
• identiﬁ ed areas for action are business 
segment speciﬁ c
Inspiring and visible leadership
In 2010, we conducted a comprehensive 
review of Group talent and succession 
covering the top 100 executive positions in the 
Group. This gave the Group Executive Board 
the opportunity to assess the strength of the 
talent pipeline across our key leadership 
positions, and work together to identify our 
rising talent so we can give them development 
opportunities across our segments. This 
process will be repeated early in 2011.
The Group has established a series of 
Leadership Behaviours which clearly 
articulate what it takes to be a great leader 
in Thomas Cook. The behaviours, which are 
designed for the ‘top 100’, are underpinned 
by the PROUD values and ensure that leaders 
are assessed and developed to a common 
standard, no matter where they are in the 
Group. Executive development is supported 
through a broad range of activities including 
secondments, coaching, mentoring and 
international business school programmes.
Our Executive reward offering provides a 
direct link between performance and reward. 
Short-term incentive plans are underpinned 
by stretching ﬁ nancial and personal objectives 
and longer-term share-based plans are 
dependent on Group ﬁ nancial performance 
and shareholder return. These incentives are 
designed to attract, retain and reward the 
strongest performers in the industry. See the 
Remuneration report on pages 59 to 69 for 
further information.
Employment policies
Thomas Cook Group is committed to treating 
everyone fairly and reasonably according 
to their individual merits and abilities 
measured against our justiﬁ able business 
needs. Therefore, any form of unlawful 
discrimination, directly or indirectly, on 
the grounds of sex, gender reassignment, 
pregnancy, colour, race, nationality, ethnic or 
national origins, sexual orientation, disability, 
age, religion or belief, or because someone is 
married or is a civil partner is not tolerated.
Thomas Cook Group also aims to reﬂ ect 
the diversity of the community in which it 
operates because it values the individual 
contribution of all employees and recognises 
its legal and social responsibilities.
Thomas Cook Group is committed to 
promoting equality and all employees have a 
duty to contribute towards ensuring that the 
PROUD values are upheld and that the culture 
and working environment are free from 
harassment and discriminatory treatment.

CUSTOMERS
Through our vision, “We go further to 
make dreams come true”, we demonstrate 
our commitment to the highest levels of 
customer service. We measure our success 
through local customer satisfaction surveys: 
for further information see page 7. The 
unique set of circumstances caused by the 
volcanic ash cloud enabled us to demonstrate 
the lengths we go to look after our customers 
as set out on pages 7, 16 and 17. 
HEALTH & SAFETY
We made good progress against our Group 
health and safety objectives during the year. 
We implemented ‘Thomas Cook Preferred 
Practice’, a programme of continuous 
improvement in health & safety requiring 
the global co-ordination of information and 
reporting systems with some local policies and 
decision-making. Supplier hotels must sign 
up to these standards and all properties were 
audited against them in 2010. Our reporting 
of incidents has improved which allows us to 
pick up trends, anticipate issues and cascade 
that knowledge across our destinations.
ENVIRONMENT
We realise that the main impact of our 
business on the environment comes from 
aviation and therefore we continue to focus 
our efforts on increasing efﬁ ciency, more 
effective environmental management and 
the reduction of emissions from our aircraft.
As reported in our Operating Review on pages 
26 to 37, Thomas Cook airlines achieve some 
of the highest load factors in the industry 
meaning that each aircraft departs with a 
high occupancy. On a per passenger basis, 
Thomas Cook airlines are already relatively 
efﬁ cient. However, over the past year, a 
number of environmental and fuel saving 
initiatives have been implemented across our 
Group airlines. 
The installation of extensions known as 
winglets to the wings of three of the UK’s 
B767-300 aircraft and on nine of Condor’s 
B767-300 Boeing ﬂ eet during 2010 has 
generated fuel savings of 5%, through 
improved aerodynamics and reduced drag. 
The UK airline has further demonstrated 
its commitment to the environment 
by achieving a certiﬁ ed environmental 
management system to the international 
standard ISO14001. It is the ﬁ rst airline in the 
UK to achieve this standard and has enabled 
the airline to identify, control and improve 
its environmental impact and performance 
through set objectives and targets. Thomas 
Cook Northern Europe’s airline is also 
implementing ISO14001 and is aiming to 
become certiﬁ ed before the end of 2010. 
Other environmental initiatives include 
eco-labels being placed on every UK aircraft 
by the boarding doors to show passengers 
the impact of their ﬂ ight in emissions and 
noise, as well as onboard recycling.
The Group is continuing to collect and 
analyse data on emissions in preparation 
for the potential introduction of mandatory 
carbon reporting in 2012. The UK 
business is also affected by the Carbon 
Reduction Commitment Energy Efﬁ ciency 
Scheme (CRC) and is developing a carbon 
management strategy to meet these further 
legislative requirements.
For the second year, Thomas Cook Group 
responded to the Carbon Disclosure Project. 
This voluntary reporting scheme, which is 
backed by 534 investors representing US$64 
trillion of funds under management, requires 
respondents to report on their climate 
change governance and strategy, risks and 
opportunities and their greenhouse gas 
emission footprint.
SUPPLY CHAIN MANAGEMENT
Thomas Cook UK adopted the Travelife 
Sustainability System in 2007 as a means 
of engaging in sustainable supply chain 
management with accommodation providers 
in destinations. Since then, our team of 
trained Travelife auditors has assessed 
our highest volume properties against the 
environmental and social criteria. In 2010, 
we now have over 41% of our UK mainstream 
customers staying in hotels audited against 
Travelife. Of these, 18% of passengers are 
staying in hotels which have achieved award 
level status of Bronze, Silver or Gold.
We are now focusing on building a united 
approach to developing sustainable supply 
chain management in destinations, as 
Thomas Cook Belgium and Northern Europe 
are also members of the Travelife system. 
By rolling this out across the Group, we hope 
to create a consistent set of standards, create 
better partnerships with our suppliers and 
raise awareness of sustainability, enabling 
customers to make a more informed choice 
at the time of booking.
THOMAS COOK CHILDREN’S CHARITY
MAKING DREAMS COME TRUE FOR SICK AND DISADVANTAGED CHILDREN 
Funds for the Thomas Cook Children’s Charity are raised through customer donations, 
when booking a holiday and by donating unwanted coins on return ﬂ ights, together with 
employee fundraising. The UK provides administration services for the charity free of charge 
meaning that all income directly beneﬁ ts sick and disadvantaged children. Funds raised 
amounted to £1,015,783 in 2009/2010.
Successful grants have included:
• in Cancun, Mexico funds were used to build a Kindergarten for disadvantaged 
children with running water and toilets - facilities the children had not had before;
• computers, wide HD screens and ﬂ ight simulator software installed in 10 children’s 
hospices across the UK to provide children with the pleasure of ﬂ ying a virtual plane;
• a project in Kenya giving blind and visually impaired children the chance to lead 
a normal life; and
• a cottage hospital in Goa for abandoned street children.
Working with one of its charity partners, Happy Days Children’s Charity, funds enabled 
more than 2,000 sick and disadvantaged children to experience a day trip or a holiday. 
The charity also purchased two mini buses for its second charity partner CHICKS (Country 
Holidays for Inner-City Kids).

in a prior year adjustment increasing the

• During the year, the Group also adopted 
the amendments to IAS 39 – Eligible 
hedged items. As a result of the 
implementation of this amendment, the 
Group policy with regards the time value 
element of option costs has changed 
to one of immediate recognition in the 
income statement. This has resulted in 
the following pre-tax adjustments for the 
year: 2010: credit of £2.0m; 2009: charge 
of £8.1m. This item has been separately 
disclosed in the income statement. 
To improve consistency further in this area, 
the forward points on our foreign exchange 
hedging, which were previously shown in 
the underlying net ﬁ nance charges, have 
also been separately disclosed. This has 
resulted in the following amounts being 
reclassiﬁ ed from net ﬁ nance charges to 
IAS 39 fair value re-measurement for the 
year: 2010: credit of £7.3m; 2009: credit 
of £10.0m. 
• During the year, the Group also adopted 
IFRS 8 – Segmental reporting. As a result 
of this adoption, the previously presented 
‘Continental Europe’ segment has been 
split into two separate segments, being 
‘Central Europe’ and ‘West & East Europe’ 
reﬂ ecting the revised management and 
reporting structure in these geographic 
regions. The prior year segmental analysis 
has been restated accordingly. 
• During the year, the Group also 
implemented IFRS 3 Revised - Business 
combinations. As a result of this adoption, 
£5.7m of acquisition costs related to the 
acquisitions concluded in the year or likely 
to be concluded in the foreseeable future 
were expensed to the income statement. 
These costs have been separately disclosed 
as part of exceptional operating items.
BASIS OF PREPARATION
The ﬁ nancial information included in the 
Directors’ Report reﬂ ects audited statutory 
information for Thomas Cook Group plc and 
has been prepared in accordance with the 
accounting policies set out in Note 2 to the 
ﬁ nancial statements on pages 79 to 87. The 
notable changes from the Annual Report & 
Accounts 2009 are: 
• During the year, the Group implemented 
the amendments to IAS 38 – Intangible 
assets. As a result of the implementation 
of this amendment, the Group policy 
with regards the recognition of brochure 
production costs has changed to one of 
immediate write off when the brochures 
are ready for distribution. This has resulted 
ROBUST FINANCIAL 
PERFORMANCE IN A
CHALLENGING YEAR
During the year, there has been a concerted 
effort across the Group to produce a 
sustainable improvement in cash ﬂ ow. 
As a result of this, and despite the difﬁ cult 
trading environment, the Group achieved 
a £121m increase in operating cash ﬂ ow.

• During the year, further new or 
amended standards and interpretations 
have been adopted by the Group. 
Their adoption has not had a signiﬁ cant 
impact on the amounts reported in the 
ﬁ nancial statements.
In addition to the above, changes have 
also been made to the prior year ﬁ nancial 
information to reﬂ ect adjustments to 
the accounting for certain prior period 
acquisitions. Further details of these 
changes are given in notes 2 and 15 to 
the ﬁ nancial statements.
INCOME STATEMENT HIGHLIGHTS
Revenue and proﬁ t from operations
The Group has reported a robust set of results 
given the uncertain economic environment 
and the signiﬁ cant adverse impact of weak 
Sterling on our UK business.
Group revenue for the year decreased by 
4% to £8,890.1m, (5% reduction at constant 
currency). The decrease year-on-year mainly 
reﬂ ects a planned reduction in winter capacity 
in anticipation of challenging market and 
economic conditions. Trading in April 2010 
(the last month of the winter season) was also 
severely disrupted by the closure of airspace 
over much of Europe as a result of the 
volcanic ash cloud. Management estimates 
the lost revenue associated with the volcanic 
ash cloud to be around £100m. Summer 
capacity was broadly ﬂ at across our markets. 
The Group adjusted underlying proﬁ t from 
operations was £391.4m, a reduction of 
£23.7m on the prior year. Trading conditions 
remained extremely tough throughout 
the year in all our markets, but the UK 
and North America were particularly badly 
affected. The effect of the weaker Sterling 
against Euro and Dollar on input costs 
in our UK segment, as well as the impact 
of the weaker Euro against Dollar in our 
Continental European airline businesses also 
meant that Group input costs increased by 
£269m. Some of the increases were passed 
through to customers and a signiﬁ cant 
amount was mitigated by rate reductions 
achieved through negotiations with suppliers  
and lower underlying fuel costs. However, 
these were not enough to prevent some 
margin decline.
As a mitigation measure, we have continued 
to take actions to address our cost base. 
As well as the savings in underlying 
accommodation costs realised following 
negotiations with hoteliers, the airline 
synergies programme has delivered £19m 
of incremental beneﬁ ts in the current year, 
and restructuring and other cost initiatives 
in all segments contributed a further £75m 
of year-on-year cost reductions. 
Separately disclosed items
Separately disclosed items consist of 
exceptional operating and ﬁ nance items, IAS 
39 fair value re-measurement, proﬁ t/loss on 
disposal of associate and the amortisation 
of business combination intangibles. These 
are costs or proﬁ ts that have arisen in the 
year which management believes are not the 
result of normal operating performance. They 
are therefore disclosed separately to give a 
fairer view of the year-on-year comparison of 
underlying trading performance.
The table above summarises the separately 
disclosed items which have been included in 
the full year accounts.
Exceptional operating items
Net exceptional operating items in the 
year amounted to £166.3m, a reduction of 
£49.6m on the prior year despite the impact 
of the volcanic ash cloud (cost of £52.9m).
The direct costs associated with the volcanic 
ash cloud in April amounted to £52.9m and 
included additional accommodation and 
subsistence costs for customers stranded in 
resort and the costs of customer repatriation 
when the airspace was eventually re-opened.
Of the remaining £113.4m of exceptional 
operating items, £26.0m relates to the 
impairment of assets and establishment 
of onerous lease provisions in Hi Hotels, a 
Spanish hotel chain operating 19 properties 
in the Balearics. On 31 March 2010, 
Skyservice, a Canadian airline that provided 
ﬂ ying capacity to our Canadian tour operator 
was placed in court-appointed receivership. 
As a result of the collapse of Skyservice, we 
suffered signiﬁ cant disruption to our ﬂ ying 
programme in April, the last month of the 
high season for our Canadian tour operator. 
The direct costs of the disruption, together 
with the write down of certain receivables 
from Skyservice, amounted to £15.3m. 
Of the remaining exceptional operating 
costs of £72.1m, £35.4m relates to 
the continuation of the restructuring 
programmes we commenced and reported 
on in 2009 and a further £23.3m relates 
to the ﬁ nal element of the fuel-related 
exceptional items which will not recur in 
future. The remaining operating exceptional 
items, amounting to £13.4m, include 
acquisition costs relating to the purchase of 
Öger Tours in Germany and the joint venture 
agreement with The Co-operative Group and 
Midlands Co-operative, and the net impact 
of some aircraft-related items. 
IAS 39 fair value re-measurement
The Group has adopted the amendment to 
IAS 39 for the ﬁ rst time in the 2010 ﬁ nancial 
accounts. As part of the provisions of the 
amendment, the time value element of 
options used for hedging the Group’s fuel and 
foreign currency exposure must be written 
off to the income statement as incurred. As 
this is purely a timing issue and can give rise 
to signiﬁ cant, unpredictable gains and losses 
in the income statement, management has 
decided to separately disclose the impact 
in the income statement to assist readers 
of the accounts in better understanding 
the underlying business development. 
For consistency we have also reclassiﬁ ed 
the timing effect of marking to market the 
forward points on our foreign currency 
hedging to this category.
As a result of the above changes, we have 
separately disclosed a gain of £2.0m in 
the operating result and a gain of £7.3m 
in net ﬁ nance charges in the current year.

The prior year comparatives have also been 
restated to include a loss of £8.1m separately 
disclosed in the operating result. In addition, 
£10.0m of forward point gains which were 
included in the net ﬁ nance charges in 2009 
have been reclassiﬁ ed to IAS 39 fair value 
re-measurement.
Amortisation of business combination 
intangibles
During the year, we incurred non-cash costs 
of £30.9m (2009 restated: £34.4m) in relation 
to the amortisation of business combination 
intangibles. £21.7m of the amortisation 
relates to the merger of Thomas Cook and 
MyTravel and represents the amortisation 
of brand names, customer relationships 
and computer software. The remaining 
£9.2m relates to other acquisitions made
post-merger.
Exceptional ﬁ nance charges
As noted in the Group Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer’s statement, during the year, we 
successfully replaced our previous bank 
facility (£1,300m) with new funding. As a 
result of the reﬁ nancing, unamortised set-up 
and related costs of the previous facilities, 
which were due to expire in May 2011, had 
to be immediately expensed to the income 
statement. Due to the size and nature of 
this write-off, management has included 
this as a separately disclosed exceptional 
ﬁ nance charge.
Income from associates and joint 
venture
Our share of the results of associates 
and joint venture was a proﬁ t of £3.2m 
(2009: loss of £3.8m). The improvement 
year-on-year largely reﬂ ects a signiﬁ cant 
reduction in our share of the losses in our 
Barclaycard joint venture. In addition, 
following improvements in the underlying 
performance of our Central Europe hotel 
associates, we also booked a net reversal 
on impairment of £2.0m. 
Net investment (loss)/income
The net investment loss in the year was 
£1.5m (2009: income of £1.4m). The 
reduction year-on-year reﬂ ects a partial write 
down of the carrying value of one of our 
Central Europe hotel participations.
Net ﬁ nance costs
Net ﬁ nance costs (excluding separately 
disclosed items) in the year amounted to 
£116.1m (2009 restated: £117.8m). The 
small reduction year-on-year reﬂ ects lower 
interest rates applicable to our cash and debt 
in the ﬁ rst half of the year, which has been 
partly offset by higher net interest payable 
in relation to the Group’s deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension schemes. 
Tax
The tax charge for the year was £38.9m 
(2009 restated: £35.6m). Excluding the effect 
of adjustments to tax provisions made in 
respect of previous years, separately disclosed 
items, and the margin impact of the volcanic 
ash cloud, this represents an effective tax rate 
of 27.6% on the adjusted underlying proﬁ t 
for the year.
Cash tax paid was £24.7m, which is lower 
than the income statement tax charge as 
a result of being able to utilise the losses 
available in the UK and Germany. Total 
losses available to carry forward in the 
Group at 30 September 2010 were £1.8bn. 
As at 30 September 2010, deferred tax assets 
were recognised in respect of £0.9bn 
of this amount. 
Earnings per share and dividends
The adjusted underlying basic earnings per 
share was 22.8 pence (2009 restated: 25.0 
pence). Basic loss per share was 0.3 pence 
(2009 restated earnings per share: 0.8 pence).
The Board is recommending a ﬁ nal dividend 
of 7.0 pence per share which brings the total 
dividend per share for the full year to 10.75 
pence, unchanged from the previous year. 
The ﬁ nal dividend, if approved, will be paid 
on 7 April 2011 to shareholders who are on 
the register as at 18 March 2011. 
CASH AND LIQUIDITY
The Group’s operating cash ﬂ ow performance 
has improved signiﬁ cantly this year following 
a co-ordinated effort across the Group to 
improve working capital management 
by raising deposit levels and accelerating 
holiday balance payments. This was partly 
offset by a reduction in creditors and an 
increase in hotelier deposits during the year 
as the Group sought to secure more exclusive 
properties. Nevertheless, operating cash 
ﬂ ow was improved by £121.3m to £299.4m 
and within this, working capital improved 
by some £124.3m, such that we reported 
a working capital outﬂ ow of only £30.3m 
in the year.
Net expenditure on ﬁ xed assets and 
intangibles increased by £78.9m to £266.1m. 
However, £66.2m relates to payments made 
to acquire two aircraft which were previously 
on operating leases. The main reason for 
the remainder of the increase was the 
investments we have made, and continue 
to make, into the launch of the Group’s 
OTA proposition and our IT programme.
Expenditure on business acquisitions was 
£27.2m (2009: £71.2m). The outﬂ ow in the 
year includes the acquisition of Essential 
Travel and scheduled payments made under 
the Gold Medal and Hotels4U acquisitions.
The net cash outﬂ ow on interest was £59.1m 
(2009: £87.1m). The reduction year-on-year 
is a result of the timing of interest payments 
with respect to the bonds which results 
in only one annual payment being made. 
The ﬁ rst interest payments on the bonds are 
due to be paid in April 2011. The outﬂ ow in 
respect of dividend payments was £59.7m 
(2009: £87.4m). The reduction year-on-year 
is a result of a change made to the interim 
dividend payment date to October 2010 
(paid in September in the previous year).
Net debt (being cash less borrowings, 
overdrafts and ﬁ nance leases) at 
30 September 2010 was £803.6m 
(30 September 2009: £675.3m). This 
comprised £339.6m of cash, £1,062.7m 
of borrowings and overdrafts, and £80.5m 
of ﬁ nance lease liabilities.
As noted in the Group Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer’s statement, during the year, we 
successfully replaced our previous bank 
facility (£1,300m) with new funding totalling 
£1,700m. Headroom under the new banking 
facilities at 30 September 2010 was £846m.
SEGMENTAL PERFORMANCE REVIEW
Segmental performance presented in the 
table on page 45 is based on underlying 
ﬁ nancial performance before separately 
disclosed items. To assist readers, the 
segmental underlying proﬁ t from operations 
has also been presented excluding the 
estimated margin impact of the volcanic 
ash cloud and the segmental narrative in 
the Operating Review on pages 26 to 37 is 
provided on this adjusted underlying basis.
TREASURY ACTIVITIES
The Group’s Treasury Department has primary 
responsibility for treasury activities and these 
are reported regularly to the Board. The 
Group Treasury function is subject to periodic 
independent reviews and audits, which are 
then presented to the Audit Committee.
Treasury policies
The Group is subject to ﬁ nancial risks in 
respect of changes in fuel prices, foreign 
exchange rates and interest rates. It is also 
exposed to counterparty credit risk and 
availability of credit facilities within its 
business operations. To manage these risks, 
the Board has approved clearly deﬁ ned 
treasury policies covering hedging activities, 
responsibilities and controls. The policies 
are reviewed regularly to ensure that they 
remain appropriate for the underlying 
commercial risks. The policies also deﬁ ne 
which ﬁ nancial instruments can be used 
by the Group to hedge these risks. The 
use of derivative ﬁ nancial instruments for 
speculative purposes is strictly prohibited.

Management of liquidity risk 
and ﬁ nancing
Group Treasury’s primary objective is to 
ensure that the Group is able to meet its 
ﬁ nancial commitments as they fall due. This 
involves preparing a prudent, medium-term 
cashﬂ ow forecast using the annual budget 
and three-year plan and ensuring that the 
Group has sufﬁ cient cash and headroom 
under its committed facilities to provide 
against any unexpected cashﬂ ows. In 
addition, a rolling 13-week cashﬂ ow forecast 
is used to manage the Group’s short-term 
cash and borrowing positions. At the year 
end, the Group had undrawn committed 
debt facilities available to it of £846m 
(2009: £667m*).
Borrowing facilities
In April 2010, the Group issued a €400m 
bond maturing in June 2015 and a £300m 
bond maturing in June 2017. Proceeds of 
these issues were used to repay debt drawn 
under the existing bank facilities. In May 
2010, the Group entered into a £1,050m 
committed bank facilities agreement with 
a number of banks, maturing in May 2013. 
The previous bank facilities were cancelled. 
The new facilities comprise a £200m term 
loan, repayable in annual instalments of 
£50m commencing October 2011, and a 
revolving credit facility of £850m to support 
the seasonal liquidity requirements and the 
general corporate purposes of the Group. At 
the year end, the average remaining maturity 
of the bond and committed bank facilities 
was 3.7 years (2009: 1.8 years).
Guarantee facilities
In addition to debt facilities, the Group has 
a requirement for guarantee and bonding 
facilities, principally for consumer protection 
guarantees. In May 2010, the Group entered 
into a total of £200m of new committed 
guarantee facilities with seven banks and, 
at the same date, the previous committed 
guarantee facilities totalling €200m (£174m) 
were cancelled. The new guarantee facilities 
mature in May 2012.
Counterparty credit risk
The Group deposits surplus cash with 
approved banks and ﬁ nancial institutions 
with strong credit ratings. Each counterparty 
has a credit limit authorised by the Board 
and the credit risk is reduced by spreading 
the deposits and derivative contracts across 
a number of counterparties. At the year end, 
the Group reported total cash of £340m 
(2009: £550m).

Directors’ Report
Corporate governance report
Dear Shareholder
The Board of Directors of Thomas Cook Group plc recognises 
the importance of applying the highest standards of corporate 
governance. This enables effective and efﬁ cient decision making 
and gives a structural aid for the Directors to discharge their duty 
to promote the success of the Company for the beneﬁ t of
its shareholders. 
The Board is committed to the principles of corporate 
governance in the Combined Code on Corporate Governance (‘the 
Code’) and the UK Corporate Governance Code (the ‘new Code’). 
In the ﬁ rst full year of leading a fully independent company, the 
Board has embraced the standards expected of a UK listed plc.
During the year, the Board has made considerable progress 
against the targets that it set itself as a result of the 2009 Board 
evaluation. In the year ahead, the Board will track progress 
against the actions that it has set following the output from our 
recent evaluation. All of this is fully described in the governance 
report, but some areas are worthy of comment here:
• the Board has been strengthened during the year by 
the appointment of Dawn Airey and Peter Middleton 
as Non-Executive Directors, and Sam Weihagen and 
Paul Hollingworth as Executive Directors. In the current year, 
Peter Marks, Group Chief Executive of The Co-operative Group, 
will join the Board upon completion of the UK retail joint 
venture with The Co-operative Group and Midlands 
Co-operative;
•  Roger Burnell has been appointed as the Senior 
Independent Director;
• during the course of the year ahead, Roger Burnell will lead 
the Nominations Committee through a process to ﬁ nd my 
successor in time for an induction and orderly handover ahead 
of my intended retirement at the 2012 AGM; and
• the Board has spent considerable time on executive succession 
and, in addition to focused discussion on that subject, has 
also orchestrated ongoing exposure to members of the Group 
Executive Board and their senior management teams, during 
debate on strategic and operational matters.
Each of the Board’s Committees has made progress in their areas 
of responsibility as described in the report below.
In line with our usual practice, I will engage with our major 
shareholders to discuss these developments and to address 
any questions ahead of and at the AGM on 11 February 2011.
Michael Beckett
Chairman
30 November 2010
This report sets out how the Company applied the principles of 
the Code and the extent to which the Company complied with the 
provisions of Section 1 of the Code in the year to 30 September 2010. 
The only area of non compliance with the Code’s provisions during 
the ﬁ nancial year was in respect of the period up to 4 August 2010 
when the Board had not appointed a Senior Independent Director. 
This is explained in the relevant section on page 51. 
The Company will report against the new Code in the Annual Report 
& Accounts 2011.

on pages 46 and 47.

THE CHAIRMAN 
Michael Beckett was the Chairman of the Company throughout the year. 
The roles of the Chairman and Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer are 
separate and distinct and each has a written statement of his 
respective responsibilities, a summary of which can be found on the 
Company’s corporate website at www.thomascookgroup.com.
THE SENIOR INDEPENDENT DIRECTOR
Roger Burnell was appointed Senior Independent Director on 4 
August 2010 and, as such, is available to shareholders should they 
have concerns that cannot be resolved through the normal channels 
involving the Executive Directors or the Chairman. As reported last 
year, a number of governance changes were made in September 
2009 upon the termination of the Relationship Agreement with 
Arcandor AG, which had previously held a majority shareholding 
in the Company. The decision was taken at that time to defer the 
appointment of a Senior Independent Director until such time as 
the Board had been strengthened and had settled into leading 
a fully ﬂ oated, independent Company. This decision to defer the 
appointment of a Senior Independent Director resulted in the 
Company not being in compliance with provision A.3.3 of the 
Code for the period 1 October 2009 until 4 August 2010.
CHANGES TO THE BOARD
Changes to the Board during the year were as follows: Sam Weihagen, 
Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, Northern Europe, was appointed as a Director 
and as Deputy to the Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer on 6 November 
2009; Paul Hollingworth was appointed to the Board as Group Chief 
Financial Ofﬁ cer on 1 January 2010. He replaced Jürgen Büser who 
stepped down from the Board and the position of Group Chief 
Financial Ofﬁ cer on 29 November 2009, following a period of ill 
health. Nigel Northridge resigned from the Board as an Independent 
Non-Executive Director on 25 March 2010. 
In order to strengthen the Board, a process commenced at the start 
of the year to appoint two additional Independent Non-Executive 
Directors. This process resulted in Peter Middleton and Dawn Airey 
being appointed to the Board on 30 November 2009 and 12 April 
2010 respectively. Peter Marks, Group Chief Executive of The 
Co-operative Group, will join the Board upon completion of the 
UK retail joint venture with The Co-operative Group and Midlands 
Co-operative.  
The search, selection and appointment process in respect of both 
the new Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and new Independent 
Non-Executive Directors is fully described in the section on the 
Nominations Committee on page 55. 
Ludger Heuberg carried out the role of Acting Group Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer in the period up to 31 December 2009. Ludger Heuberg had 
previously been the Group’s Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer between June 
2007 and June 2008 and was a member of the Group Executive Board. 
During the period he was Acting Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, he was 
not a Director of the Company.

DIRECTOR INDEPENDENCE 
At its September 2010 Board meeting, as part of its annual review 
of corporate governance against the Code, the Board considered the 
independence of the Non-Executive Directors against the criteria 
speciﬁ ed in the Code and determined that Dawn Airey, David 
Allvey, Roger Burnell, Bo Lerenius, and Peter Middleton remained 
independent. The Board recognises that Peter Marks, as Group Chief 
Executive of The Co-operative Group, which will be a partner in the UK 
retail joint venture (announced in October 2010), is not independent. 
The Board reached its determination of independence in respect 
of Peter Middleton, notwithstanding the receipt by him of a pension 
of £60,500 per year from the  Thomas Cook Pension Plan, a deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t pension scheme. This pension is fully funded and accrued 
in the period 1987 to 1992 when he was CEO of Thomas Cook. 
The Board recognises that being in receipt of a pension from the 
Group’s pension scheme gives rise to a potential conﬂ ict, which it 
has authorised as permitted by the Company’s Articles of Association, 
subject to the condition that he does not participate in any discussion 
or decision regarding any of the Group’s pension schemes. The Board 
believes that Peter Middleton is independent in all other respects 
and also believes that this condition is sufﬁ cient to maintain 
his independence.
RE-APPOINTMENT OF DIRECTORS
In accordance with the Code and the Company’s Articles of Association, 
all Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the ﬁ rst Annual 
General Meeting (‘AGM’) following their appointment to the Board and 
thereafter are subject to re-election every third AGM. Non-Executive 
Directors are initially appointed for a three-year term and, subject to 
rigorous review by the Nominations Committee and re-election by 
shareholders, can serve up to a maximum of three such terms.
Upon the recommendation of the Nominations Committee, Michael 
Beckett and Bo Lerenius will be proposed for re-election; and Dawn 
Airey and Peter Marks will be proposed for election by shareholders 
at the 2011 AGM. 
Tenure includes previous directorships of MyTravel Group plc and Thomas Cook AG.
TH017_p49_59.indd 51 TH017_p49_59.indd   51 24/12/2010 08:54 24/12/2010   08:54 52 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010
Michael Beckett has signalled his intention to retire at the 2012 AGM 
and the Nominations Committee, under the leadership of the Senior 
Independent Director, has initiated a process to ﬁ nd his successor in 
time for an orderly handover and induction. This is further explained 
in the Nominations Committee section on page 55.
OPERATION OF THE BOARD
Senior executives below Board level attended relevant parts of 
Board meetings in order to make presentations on their areas of 
responsibility. This gives the Board access to a broader group of 
executives and helps the Directors make assessments of the Group’s 
succession plans.
In addition to the papers circulated prior to each meeting, Directors 
were provided between meetings with relevant information on 
matters affecting the business. Such updates were carried out by 
a variety of methods, including conference calls amongst the full 
Board or between the Chairman and the Non-Executive Directors, 
and by way of the Group Company Secretary circulating papers and 
updates on relevant issues. The Chairman has held meetings with 
the Non-Executive Directors without the Executive Directors present.
The Group Company Secretary, who was appointed by the Board, 
is responsible for advising and supporting the Chairman and the 
Board on company law and corporate governance matters as well as 
ensuring that there is a smooth ﬂ ow of information to enable effective 
decision making. All Directors have access to the advice and services 
of the Group Company Secretary and, through him, have access to 
independent professional advice in respect of their duties at the 
Company’s expense. The Group Company Secretary acts as secretary to 
the Board, the Group Executive Board, the Finance & Administration 
Committee, the Disclosure Committee, the Audit Committee, the 
Nominations Committee and the Remuneration Committee. The 
Deputy Group Secretary acts as secretary to the Health, Safety & 
Environmental Committee.
In accordance with its Articles, the Company has granted a deed of 
indemnity, to the extent permitted by law, to each Director and the 
Group Company Secretary. The Company also maintains Directors’ 
and Ofﬁ cers’ liability insurance.
BOARD EVALUATION
The Board recognises the beneﬁ t of a thorough evaluation process 
as a useful tool to highlight issues, track progress against targets and 
to determine and shape the focus of Board attention in the future.
A thorough evaluation of the Board and its Committees was 
conducted during the year. This was facilitated by the Group Company 
Secretary under the direction of the Chairman. The process involved 
each of the Directors completing a comprehensive questionnaire, 
which was structured to encourage both graded responses and 
narrative feedback in respect of a range of questions that focused 
on the following areas:
• Board and Committee composition and dynamics;
• knowledge and information;
• agenda and time management;
• Board support;
• strategic development and oversight;
• delegation of authority;
• risk management;
• corporate responsibility;
• human resource management;
• executive remuneration;
• performance of Executive and Non-Executive Directors;
• committee structure and performance; and
• priorities for change.
Board evaluation process
Detailed questionnaire
Effectiveness report
(Compiled by the Group Company Secretary and agreed 
with the Chairman)
Discussed at September Board meeting
Priorities and improvements agreed
Upon receipt of the completed forms, the Group Company Secretary 
compiled a report, drawing out the key themes and issues that were 
raised and formulated a number of recommendations to further 
enhance the overall effectiveness of the Board and its Committees. 
The report also highlighted the achievements against the objectives 
that had been agreed by the Board a year earlier following the 
conduct of the 2009 evaluation. This report was developed and 
agreed with the Chairman and circulated to the Board for debate 
at the September 2010 Board meeting.
The results of the evaluation concluded that the operation of the 
Board and its Committees had improved during the year and 
considerable progress had been made against the previously set 
targets including Board composition, the ongoing programme of 
strategic presentations and debate, the Board’s exposure to members 
of the Group Executive Board (which helped build an understanding 
of succession plans) and improvement of regular Board reports, 
including shareholder feedback and monthly ﬁ nancial reports 
following the appointment of the new Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer.
The evaluation also recognised a small number of issues that arose 
and had been remedied during the year. Whilst recognising that 
progress had been made, the evaluation highlighted a small number 
of areas that the Board felt should be given additional focus in the 
year ahead, including succession, strategy and risk management.
The Board debated the output from the evaluation and agreed the 
recommended actions and a forward agenda of additional key issues 
for review. The Board and Committee evaluation to be carried out 
in the current ﬁ nancial year will cover the same areas as listed above 
and will be designed to track progress against the agreed actions 
set in 2010.
The Non-Executive Directors, under the leadership of the Senior 
Independent Director, conducted a performance evaluation 
of the Chairman. This was carried out in accordance with the 
Code and involved a similar process to that described above. 
The Independent Non-Executive Directors met separately to discuss 
the evaluation and feedback was given to the Chairman by the 
Senior Independent Director.
The Company’s performance management system applies 
to management at all levels across the Group. The individual 
performance of the Executive Directors is reviewed by the 
Remuneration Committee.

BOARD TRAINING AND INDUCTION
An induction programme tailored to meet the needs of individual 
Directors is provided for each new Director. Overall, the aim of the 
induction programme is to introduce new Directors to the Group’s 
business, its operations and its governance arrangements. Such 
inductions typically include meetings with senior management, visits 
to the Company’s business segments, and the receipt of presentations 
on key business areas and relevant documentation.
Directors also receive training throughout the year, both at Board and 
Committee meetings and by way of attendance at external conferences 
and seminars. At Board meetings and, where appropriate, Committee 
meetings, the Directors receive regular updates and presentations on 
changes and developments to the business, and to the legislative and 
regulatory environments. During the year, the Board was provided with:
• updates on the economic and business environment in each of 
the segments;
• a brieﬁ ng on competition law and the Group’s competition 
compliance and employee education programme; 
• brieﬁ ngs on the ﬁ nal implementation of the Companies Act 
2006, the Financial Reporting Council’s review of the Combined 
Code on Corporate Governance and the impact on the Company’s 
governance arrangements following the planned introduction of 
the new Code; and
• a brieﬁ ng on the development of carbon emissions legislation in 
each source market.  
DIRECTORS’ CONFLICTS OF INTEREST
From 1 October 2008, the Companies Act codiﬁ ed the Directors’ duty 
to avoid a situation in which they have, or can have, an interest that 
conﬂ icts, or possibly may conﬂ ict, with the interests of the Company. 
A Director will not be in breach of that duty if the relevant matter has 
been authorised in accordance with the Articles of Association by the 
other Directors. 
The Board has established a set of guiding principles on managing 
conﬂ icts and has agreed a process to identify and authorise conﬂ icts. 
As part of that process, it has also agreed that the Nominations 
Committee should review the authorised conﬂ icts every six months, 
or more frequently if a new potential conﬂ ict situation materialises. 
The Nominations Committee and Board applied the above principles 
and process throughout the year to 30 September 2010 and conﬁ rm that 
these have operated effectively. When authorising a potential conﬂ ict 
in respect of Peter Middleton, the Board speciﬁ ed a condition that he 
should not participate in any discussion or decision regarding any of the 
Group’s pension schemes. The potential conﬂ ict is more fully described in 
the section on Director independence on page 51.
THE GROUP GOVERNANCE STRUCTURE
The Board has delegated authority to its Committees on speciﬁ c aspects of management and control of the Group. The papers in respect of 
the Audit, Remuneration, Nominations, Health Safety & Environmental, and Disclosure Committees are circulated to all the Non-Executive 
Directors, regardless of Committee membership. Matters discussed and agreed at those Committees, the Group Executive Board and the 
Finance & Administration Committee are reported to the next Board meeting.

Composition of the Committee
There have been no changes to the composition of the Committee 
during the year.
Role of the Committee
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for 
overseeing the ﬁ nancial reporting, internal risk management and 
control functions and for making recommendations to the Board 
in relation to the appointment of the Company’s internal and 
external auditors.
In accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee, which 
reports its ﬁ ndings to the Board, is authorised to:
• monitor the integrity of the annual and half-year results and 
interim management statements, including a review of the 
signiﬁ cant ﬁ nancial reporting judgements contained in them;
• review the Company’s internal ﬁ nancial controls and internal 
control and risk management systems;
• monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s internal 
audit function;
• establish and oversee the Company’s relationship with the external 
auditors, including the monitoring of their independence; and
• monitor matters raised pursuant to the Company’s 
whistleblowing arrangements.
To enable it to carry out its duties and responsibilities effectively, 
the Committee relies on information and support from management 
across the business.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on 
www.thomascookgroup.com or from the Group Company Secretary 
at the registered ofﬁ ce.
Principal activities during the year
At its meetings during the year, the Committee discharged its 
responsibilities as listed above and in particular, it reviewed:
• the full and half-year results (including accounting issues
and judgements) and the interim management statements 
issued during the year;
• information in support of the statements in relation to going 
concern and disclosure of information to the auditors;
• the Group’s system of internal control, receiving reports from 
management, the external auditors and the internal auditors 
(see section headed ‘risk management and internal control’ on page 57);
• the reports from audits conducted by the internal auditors;
• the annual work plan for each of the internal and external auditors;
• the Group’s main risks and mitigating actions;
• the Group’s business continuity plans and the work plan and 
timetable for further development;
• the Group’s taxation strategy and policies, including the 
management of related risk;
• the prevention, detection and reporting of fraud;
• security in relation to IT and retail shops;
• the performance of the internal auditors, leading to the 
re-appointment of E&Y as the Group’s internal auditors;
• proposals for engaging the external auditors to carry out 
non-audit related work (see below); and
• the Committee’s work plan for the year ahead and a review 
of historic activity against the Committee’s terms of reference.
External auditors
There is a policy in place which requires all material non-audit 
work proposed to be carried out by the external auditors to be 
pre-authorised by the Committee in order to ensure that the 
provision of non-audit services does not impair the external auditors’ 
independence or objectivity. The policy, which is appended as a 
schedule to the Audit Committee’s terms of reference, is published 
on the Company’s website at www.thomascookgroup.com. The 
Committee is pleased to report that for a third successive year there 
has been a signiﬁ cant reduction to the amount of non-audit fees paid 
to the external auditors. An analysis of the fees earned by the Group’s 
auditors for audit and non-audit services is disclosed in Note 8 to 
the ﬁ nancial statements. PwC were re-appointed by shareholders 
at the AGM held on 25 March 2010. Upon the recommendation 
of the Audit Committee, PwC will be proposed for re-election by 
shareholders at the AGM to be held on 11 February 2011. PwC have 
conﬁ rmed their independence as auditors of the Company in a 
letter addressed to the Directors.

Role of the Committee
The Board has delegated to the Committee responsibility for reviewing 
and proposing appointments to the Board and for recommending 
any other changes to the composition of the Board or the Board 
Committees. The principal responsibility of the Committee is to make 
recommendations to the Board on all new appointments to the Board, 
as well as Board balance and composition. The Committee ensures 
that there is clarity in respect of the role description and capabilities 
required for such appointments. The Committee is also responsible for 
reviewing, at least every six months, or more frequently if required, the 
Directors’ potential conﬂ icts and for making recommendations to the 
Board in respect of authorising such matters.
The full terms of reference of the Committee are available on 
www.thomascookgroup.com or from the Group Company Secretary 
at the registered ofﬁ ce.
Composition of the Committee
The Chairman and all of the Independent Non-Executive Directors 
are members of the Committee. Peter Middleton and Dawn Airey 
were appointed members of the Committee on being appointed 
to the Board on 30 November 2009 and 12 April 2010 respectively. 
Nigel Northridge left the Committee upon his resignation from the 
Board on 25 March 2010.
Board appointments
Appointments to the Board are made on merit and against objective 
criteria. This process is led by the Committee which, after evaluating 
the balance of skills, knowledge and experience of each Director, 
makes recommendations to the Board.
Principal activities during the year
At its meetings during the year, the Committee discharged its 
responsibilities as listed above and in particular:
• recommended the appointment of Sam Weihagen to the Board 
as Deputy to the Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer;
• monitored the process in respect of the search and selection of a 
new Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, leading to a recommendation 
for the appointment of Paul Hollingworth;
• considered the re-appointment of the Directors subject to 
retirement by rotation, before making a recommendation to 
the Board regarding their re-election;
• commenced and monitored the process to recruit additional 
Non-Executive Directors, leading to recommendations for the 
appointments of Peter Middleton and Dawn Airey;
• recommended the appointment of Roger Burnell as the Senior 
Independent Director;
• considered the process and indicative timing in relation to 
the succession of Michael Beckett as Chairman; and
• considered Directors’ potential conﬂ icts (see page 53).
Chairman succession
Michael Beckett has indicated that he will retire from ofﬁ ce at 
the AGM in 2012. The Committee has considered the process 
to appoint his successor in line with the Code, which it will 
commence after the AGM in 2011 with a view to ensure that 
there will be sufﬁ cient time for induction of the Chairman 
elect and a smooth succession into the role.
Appointment process
In respect of the appointment of a new Group Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer, the Committee engaged Spencer Stuart (an external search 
ﬁ rm) and the Chairman of the Audit Committee was also involved 
with the interviews of the short-listed candidates. In respect of the 
process to appoint two new Non-Executive Directors to the Board, 
the Committee formulated a set of criteria, including the required 
skills and attributes for suitable candidates. This took account of 
the comments from the Board evaluation process and considered 
the current composition of the Board and the skills and attributes 
required in the future. The Committee considered candidates brought 
to their attention from a wide range of professional ﬁ rms and other 
sources. The conditional appointment of Peter Marks has been 
monitored and recommended by the Committee but was brought 
about due to the proposed retail joint venture with The Co-operative 
Group and Midlands Co-operative and, as such, an external search 
agent was not used. The process to identify and appoint a new 
Chairman will be conducted by the Committee under the leadership 
of the Senior Independent Director. An external search and selection 
ﬁ rm will be appointed to assist the Committee with this appointment.

Finance & Administration Committee 
To facilitate swift and efﬁ cient operational management decisions, 
the Board has established the Finance & Administration Committee 
(comprising any two Directors, one of whom must be an Executive Director) 
which has delegated authority, within clearly identiﬁ ed parameters, 
in relation to day-to-day ﬁ nancing and administrative matters.
Disclosure Committee 
The Board has established a Disclosure Committee which is 
responsible for implementing and monitoring systems and controls 
in respect of the management and disclosure of inside information 
in accordance with the Company’s obligations under the UK Listing 
Authority’s Disclosure and Transparency Rules. The Committee 
comprises the Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, who is the Chairman, 
the Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and the Group Company Secretary.
SHAREHOLDER COMMUNICATION
The Board promotes open communication with shareholders. This is 
formalised within a framework of an investor relations programme 
conducted by the Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, the Group Chief 
Financial Ofﬁ cer and the Investor Relations team. The programme 
included the presentation of preliminary and half-year results and 
a strategy day, which can be accessed on the Thomas Cook Group 
website at www.thomascookgroup.com along with ﬁ nancial reports, 
interim management statements, investor presentations and trading 
updates. The management team conducts regular meetings with 
institutional investors, and welcomes the dialogue that this 
enables with shareholders. The Company makes every effort 
to ascertain investor perceptions of the Company and regular 
reports of investor and analyst feedback are provided to the Board. 
Additionally, the Board responds to ad hoc requests for information 
and all shareholders are entitled to attend the AGM, where they 
have an opportunity to ask questions of the Board.
The Chairman and the Chairman of the Remuneration Committee 
met a number of major institutional shareholders during the year 
to discuss the Group’s remuneration policy and proposed changes 
to the performance targets for the Group’s executive long-term 
incentive plans. The Chairman met separately with a number of 
major institutional shareholders to discuss governance arrangements 
and to gain a ﬁ rst-hand understanding of any issues or concerns they 
may have had. 
At its 2008 AGM, a resolution was passed allowing the Company to use 
its website and email as the primary means of communication with 
its shareholders. This arrangement provides signiﬁ cant beneﬁ ts for 
shareholders and the Company in terms of timeliness of information, 
reduced environmental impact and cost. Shareholders may still opt 
to receive their communications in a paper format. The Company’s 
corporate website was upgraded during the year and contains 
information for shareholders, including share price information and 
news releases. It can be found at www.thomascookgroup.com.
Risk identiﬁ cation & reporting
Each of the six segments has a risk management committee, which 
meets regularly. By implementing the risk management policy, the 
segments are responsible for:
• maintaining and updating risk reporting;
• managing risk action implementation and measurement 
systems; and
• maintaining and reviewing risk performance and 
measurement systems.
Risk registers are compiled and submitted by each segment for 
review quarterly. In addition, a central risk register is maintained and 
updated by risk owners. The GRMC prepares a half-yearly risk report 
for the attention of the Audit Committee based on the feedback from 
the segment risk management committees and also a top down 
review of the risk register.
The report and the risk register identify the principal risks to the 
business and assess the adequacy of controls and procedures in place 
to mitigate the likelihood and the impact of these risks. There are also 
RISK MANAGEMENT AND INTERNAL CONTROL
The Board recognises its ultimate accountability for maintaining an effective system of internal control and risk management that is appropriate 
in relation to both the scope and the nature of the Group’s activities and complies with the Turnbull Committee Guidance on the Combined 
Code (the ‘Turnbull Guidance’) and has approved the framework and the standards implemented. Such a system is designed to manage rather 
than eliminate the risk of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only reasonable, but not absolute, assurance against material 
misstatement or loss. The Board has delegated responsibility for the implementation of the Group risk management policy to the Group Risk 
Management Committee (‘GMRC’), which is chaired by the Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer and comprises senior executives from across the Group.
TH017_p49_59.indd 57 TH017_p49_59.indd   57 21/12/2010 22:38 21/12/2010   22:38 58 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010
reports to the GRMC by speciﬁ c risk owners on the effectiveness of 
actions taken to mitigate risks. The regular risk reporting regime has 
created an environment for the development and improvement of 
risk management procedures across the Group. The Audit Committee 
reviews the reports of the GMRC and makes recommendations to 
improve risk management and internal control. This process of risk 
identiﬁ cation, measurement and reporting provides a comprehensive 
ongoing assessment of the signiﬁ cant risks facing the Group and the 
mitigating actions taken in respect of those risks. This process ensures 
that the Group complies with relevant corporate governance best 
practice in relation to risk management, including the guidance issued 
under the Turnbull Guidance. The Group’s internal audit function 
reports directly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee. Internal 
audit makes recommendations to that Committee in relation to the 
maintenance of a sound control environment throughout the Group.
A schedule of the Group’s principal risks and uncertainties, likely 
impacts on the Group and mitigating actions being taken by 
management is set out on pages 24 to 25 of the Directors’ Report - 
Business Review.
Whistleblowing
The Group encourages employees to report any concerns which they 
feel need to be brought to the attention of management and has 
adopted a whistleblowing policy and theft and fraud reporting policy. 
These are published on the Group’s intranet sites, allowing such 
matters to be raised in conﬁ dence through the appropriate channels.
Code of ethics
The Group has a code of ethics which deals with:
• prohibitions on employees using their position for personal gain; 
• prohibitions on improper business practices;
• a requirement for compliance with all internal approval and 
authorisation procedures and legal requirements; and
• a requirement to disclose potential conﬂ icts of interest and 
potential related party contracts.
This code of ethics is contained within the Group’s internal policies 
guide, which is available to all employees and, in particular, those 
with responsibility for procurement or other dealings with third-party 
suppliers. In addition, the Group Company Secretary is available for 
advice on any matter which may give rise to cause for concern in 
relation to the code of ethics.
The Group code of ethics has been further reinforced during the year 
by the introduction of a disclosure of interests and beneﬁ ts policy, 
which applies to Senior Executives in the Group. This supplements 
similar policies that are in place in each of the segments.
Review of Group system of internal control
During the year, the Board, through the work of the Audit Committee, 
has conducted a review of the Group’s system of internal control. 
There is an ongoing process for the identiﬁ cation and evaluation of 
risk management and internal control processes which has been in 
place throughout the year and remains in place up to the date of the 
ﬁ nancial statements. This includes the process by which management 
prepares consolidated accounts. The work conducted by management 
and described on pages 57 to 58 is complemented, supported and 
challenged by the controls assurance work carried out independently 
by the external auditors, PwC, and the internal auditors, E&Y. Regular 
reports on control issues are presented to the Audit Committee by 
PwC and E&Y. The Board, in reviewing the effectiveness of the system 
of internal control, can conﬁ rm that necessary actions have been, 
or are being, taken to remedy any signiﬁ cant failings or weaknesses 
identiﬁ ed from that review.
GOING CONCERN
After making appropriate enquiries, the Directors have a reasonable 
expectation that the Company and the Group have adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements.
STATEMENT OF DIRECTORS’ RESPONSIBILITIES IN RESPECT 
OF THE ANNUAL REPORT, THE DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION 
REPORT AND THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report, 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the ﬁ nancial statements 
in accordance with applicable law and regulations. Company law 
requires the Directors to prepare ﬁ nancial statements for each 
ﬁ nancial year. Under that law, the Directors have prepared the 
Group and the Company ﬁ nancial statements in accordance with 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the 
European Union. The ﬁ nancial statements are required by law to give 
a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company and the 
Group and of the proﬁ t or loss of the Group for that period.
In preparing those ﬁ nancial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and 
prudent; and
• state that the ﬁ nancial statements comply with IFRSs as adopted by 
the European Union.
The Directors conﬁ rm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the ﬁ nancial statements.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records 
that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the ﬁ nancial 
position of the Company and the Group, and for ensuring that the 
ﬁ nancial statements and the Directors’ Remuneration Report comply 
with the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the Group ﬁ nancial 
statements, Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. They are also responsible 
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence 
for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the 
Company’s website, and legislation in the United Kingdom governing 
the preparation and dissemination of ﬁ nancial statements may differ 
from legislation in other jurisdictions.
DISCLOSURE OF INFORMATION TO AUDITORS
Each of the Directors who held ofﬁ ce at the date of approval of 
this Directors’ report conﬁ rms that: so far as they are aware, there 
is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditors 
are unaware; and that they have taken all steps that they ought to 
have taken as a Director to make them aware of any relevant audit 
information and to establish that the Company’s auditors are aware 
of that information.
RESPONSIBILITY STATEMENT OF THE DIRECTORS IN RESPECT 
OF THE ANNUAL FINANCIAL STATEMENTS
Each of the Directors, who were in ofﬁ ce at the date of this report, 
whose names and responsibilities are listed on pages 46 and 47 
conﬁ rm that, to the best of their knowledge:
• the Group ﬁ nancial statements, which have been prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU, give a true and fair 
view of the assets, liabilities, ﬁ nancial position and proﬁ t of the 
Group; and
• the Directors’ Report contained on pages 3 to 71 includes a fair 
review of the development and performance of the business 
and the position of the Group, together with a description of the 
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

Directors’ Report
Remuneration report
Dear Shareholder
On behalf of the Board, I am pleased to present the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report for the year to 30 September 2010. This 
report explains the Group’s remuneration policy and provides 
details of the remuneration of the Executive and Non-Executive 
Directors for services to the Company during the year. 
As the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer indicated 
in their statements, the current economic climate and a number 
of other signiﬁ cant challenges during the year created a very 
difﬁ cult operating environment. Despite this, many of our 
segments have delivered increased ﬁ nancial results and there 
has been a strong improvement in cash ﬂ ow. Also, management 
have taken positive actions to reinforce our UK business and have 
continued to progress a number of strategic initiatives. 
Against this difﬁ cult backdrop, we must still attract, retain 
and motivate high calibre senior executives to manage the 
businesses and deliver against our strategy. With this objective, 
the Committee made changes to the short-term and long-term 
incentive targets within the structure of the remuneration policy, 
which itself remains unchanged. 
Part of the annual bonus arrangement for the year was 
structured to drive improvements to cash generation. In view 
of the success of this targeted approach, we are incentivising a 
reduction in exceptional items as well as a further improvement 
to cash generation for the year just started. 
In November 2009, the Committee conducted a review of the 
long-term incentive performance targets to ensure that they 
were in line with the Group’s strategic and ﬁ nancial plans and 
that they were sufﬁ ciently stretching. Following that review and 
a thorough consultation with shareholders, new targets were 
adopted at the 2010 AGM before being applied to awards made 
during the year.
During the consultation referred to above, shareholders were 
informed that the EPS targets for the 2008 and 2009 awards 
under the Performance Share Plan and Co-Investment Plan 
were misjudged and unachievable. In line with shareholder 
feedback, the Committee has not exercised any discretion and, 
unfortunately, I have to conﬁ rm that despite a compound 
annual growth rate in EPS over the three years to September 
2010 of 10.1%, the Company has not met the original EPS target 
in respect of the 2008 awards. Therefore, these elements of 
management’s compensation packages have lapsed.
The Committee is mindful of shareholders’ views in relation 
to executive base pay and has agreed for the second consecutive 
year that our Executive Directors will not receive 
an increase to their base salaries in the year ahead.
I was appointed Chairman of the Committee in March 2010 
and since then I have met with major shareholders and their 
representative bodies to discuss remuneration issues. The 
Committee continues to be committed to the principles of good 
governance as set out in the Combined Code and will continue 
our programme of engagement in the future. 
The Board will be submitting this Report for approval by 
shareholders at our Annual General Meeting on Friday 
11 February 2011.

The terms of reference of the Committee are available on
www.thomascookgroup.com or from the Group Company Secretary 
at the registered ofﬁ ce.
Principal activities during the year

Report. Matters discussed by the Committee during the Year included:
• the Group’s remuneration policy;
• key trends in executive remuneration;
• the market competitiveness of the remuneration packages for 
Executive Directors and the appropriateness of comparative criteria 
used for the purpose of pay benchmarking;
TH017_p59_69.indd 59 TH017_p59_69.indd   59 23/12/2010 19:39 23/12/2010   19:39 60 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010
• reward arrangements for the newly appointed Group Chief Financial 
Ofﬁ cer and the Deputy to the Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer;
• achievement of the annual bonus targets for Executive Directors 
in respect of the previous ﬁ nancial year;
• the structure and targets of the annual bonus arrangements 
for the Year; 
• review of the performance targets attached to the long-term 
incentive schemes;
• the granting of awards under the Thomas Cook Group plc 2007 
Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’) and the Thomas Cook Group plc 
2008 Co-Investment Plan (‘COIP’);
• vesting of awards made in 2007 under the PSP; 
• treatment of executive incentive arrangements following the 
volcanic ash cloud;
• pension provision for the Executive Directors;
• appointment of new remuneration advisers; and
• institutional shareholder and governance body pre-AGM voting 
recommendations.
Committee evaluation
The Committee evaluated its own performance, which took place at 
the time of the Board evaluation, details of which are on page 52.
Committee’s advisers
The Committee invites individuals to attend meetings as it deems 
beneﬁ cial to assist it in reviewing matters for consideration. During 
the Year, these individuals included the Chairman of the Company, 
the Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, the Group Director, Human 
Resources and the Group Company Secretary. The Chairman of the 
Audit Committee also usually attends meetings to ensure that there is 
coordination on risk and accounting issues.
No Director or senior executive is present at meetings when his or her 
own remuneration arrangements are being discussed.
In the performance of its duties, the Committee seeks assistance from 
external advisers, where necessary, to ensure it is suitably advised. During 
the Year, Kepler Associates (‘Kepler’) and Hewitt New Bridge Street (‘HNBS’) 
provided advice to the Committee in the following areas:
• trends in executive remuneration;
• achievement of long-term incentive performance targets, in 
respect of the 2007 PSP Award;
• review of current and introduction of new long-term incentive 
performance targets;
• pension provision in respect of the Executive Directors; and 
• the benchmarking of salaries and beneﬁ ts for Executive Directors.
Linklaters LLP (‘Linklaters’) provided advice speciﬁ cally relating to 
the vesting of the award made in 2007 under the PSP and the AGM 
resolution in respect of the change in long-term incentive performance 
targets. Linklaters are not appointed by the Committee as advisers. 
Neither Kepler nor HNBS advise the Company in any other capacity. 
Linklaters act as legal advisers to the Trustee and the Company in 
respect of the Thomas Cook Pension Plan and to the Company in 
respect of the Group’s share plans.
Remuneration policy
The Group’s remuneration policy is to ensure that Executive Directors 
and senior executives are rewarded in a way which attracts and 
retains management of the highest quality and motivates them to 
achieve the highest level of performance consistent with the best 
interests of the Group. In developing its remuneration policy, the 
Committee has had regard to the fact that the Group has signiﬁ cant 
international operations and, in order to compete in the global 
environment for the recruitment, retention and incentivisation of 
high quality Executive Directors and senior executives, it must offer 
signiﬁ cant rewards for excellent performance.
The Committee has therefore set its remuneration policy applying 
the following principles:
• the Group’s objective is to deliver ﬁ nancial results which 
consistently outperform the average of the industry sector;
• the Group will look to retain and attract Executive Directors 
and senior executives with above-average skills and proven 
leadership qualities;
• the remuneration of each Executive Director will be based on 
performance (both of the Group and the individual Executive Director), 
potential (i.e. the Executive Director’s potential to grow in responsibility 
and performance) and scarcity (i.e. the availability of candidates to 
replace the Executive Director should he leave the Group); and
• the proportion between ﬁ xed and variable remuneration will 
typically be targeted at 30% ﬁ xed and 70% variable – see the table 
opposite for the range between target and stretch performance.
The Committee has determined that its policy for the design of 
remuneration arrangements for Executive Directors is that the ﬁ xed 
elements of remuneration shall be set in line with the median of a 
speciﬁ ed comparator group of companies and that total earnings 
(made up of base salary, pension supplement, bonus and any 
other performance-related elements of reward, such as long-term 
incentive arrangements) shall be targeted at the upper quartile of 
the comparator group subject to the attainment of upper-quartile 
performance as gauged by appropriate and challenging performance 
criteria. An exception to this policy was agreed for the Group Chief 
Executive Ofﬁ cer in September 2008, details of which are given below.
The remuneration of Executive Directors is highly geared towards 
performance with the proportion of ‘at risk’ pay increasing 
disproportionately according to:
• the level of personal performance; and
• the seniority of the Executive Director and his/her ability to 
inﬂ uence results.
The performance related portion of remuneration rewards short-term 
and long-term performance separately, with the potential level of 
payment being heavily weighted in favour of the long term.
In benchmarking the remuneration of Executive Directors, the 
Remuneration Committee looks at pay levels at other travel and 
leisure sector companies and takes a broader view by considering pay 
at other companies of a similar size to Thomas Cook. Where specialist 
functions are concerned, the Committee may have reference to other 
comparator groups as it considers appropriate.
The relative importance of the ﬁ xed and variable elements of the 
remuneration packages of Executive Directors in circumstances of 
target and stretch performance, is shown in the chart opposite.

Remuneration arrangements
The remuneration of the Executive Directors in respect of the Year 
is set out in the audited section of this report.
2008 to the upper quartile of the comparator group. This recognised 
his appointment as sole Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer (from June to 
December 2007 he was joint Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer) and operational, 
ﬁ nancial and strategic achievements. At the time of awarding this 
increase, the Committee agreed that the Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer’s 
base salary should next be reviewed in December 2009, and thereafter 
at annual intervals, and an increase would only be made if it was 
required to bring his base salary in line with the remuneration policy. 
The Committee reviewed the base salary of the Group Chief Executive 
Ofﬁ cer in November 2009 and agreed that it should remain at its 
current level. A review of market rates of base salary was conducted in 
November 2009 prior to the appointment of Sam Weihagen as Deputy 
to the Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer and agreeing to appoint Paul 
Hollingworth as Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer. 
The Committee reviewed the base salaries for all of the Executive 
Directors in November 2010 and agreed that they should remain 
at their current level. They will be reviewed again in 2011.
The annual rates of base salary, as at 30 November 2010, for the 
Executive Directors are shown in the table below:

1   Paul Hollingworth was appointed on 1 January 2010.
2   Sam Weihagen was appointed on 6 November 2009. He receives a base salary of 5.6 million Swedish 
Krona per annum. As at 30 September 2010, this equated to a base salary of £496,000.
Annual bonus
The Committee believes that it is important to incentivise Executive 
Directors on a short-term basis with an annual cash bonus, earned 
on the attainment of stretching performance targets. These targets 
are set by the Committee at the start of the ﬁ nancial year and are 
individually tailored for each Executive Director. Should all objectives 
be achieved in full, the maximum annual bonus opportunity for all 
Executive Directors is 175% of base salary. Of the maximum bonus 
payable in respect of the Year:
(i) 50% was linked to the attainment of Group ﬁ nancial targets and 
is earned on a pro rata basis by reference to the achievement of 
those targets; 
(ii) 25% was linked to the attainment of quarterly Group cumulative 
free cash ﬂ ow targets; and
(iii) 25% was linked to the attainment of individual and other 
non-ﬁ nancial criteria which included targets in the areas of 
strategy, customer satisfaction, employee engagement, executive 
succession planning, government affairs, corporate reﬁ nancing 
and health and safety.
The Committee determines the extent to which it considers the objectives 
have been met and the annual bonus payable. For the Year, the Committee 
also took account of the signiﬁ cant progress against a number of strategic 
initiatives and awarded the following percentages of the maximum bonus 
achievable:

For the Year, the remuneration of the Executive Directors comprised 
base salary, annual bonus, participation in the PSP and the COIP , 
other beneﬁ ts including the provision of pensions, private health 
insurance, disability cover, personal accident cover, death in service 
beneﬁ t and a car allowance. The only component of executive 
remuneration which is pensionable is base salary.
The remuneration arrangements for Sam Weihagen, Deputy to the 
Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer, (appointed 6 November 2009), and
Paul Hollingworth, the new Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, (appointed 
on 1 January 2010), were set by the Committee in line with the 
remuneration policy, having regard also for market rates of pay 
for these positions.
During the Year, the Committee considered whether the current 
remuneration structures were likely to drive unacceptable behaviours 
or attitudes to risk on the part of Executives Directors. The Committee 
concluded that it was satisﬁ ed with the current remuneration 
structure, policy and performance targets in relation to risk. 
Base salary
In accordance with the Group’s remuneration policy, the base salary of 
Executive Directors reﬂ ects the size and scope of their responsibilities. 
As an exception to the policy to set base salaries at median, the base 
salary of the Group Chief Executive Ofﬁ cer was increased in September 
TH017_p59_69.indd 61 TH017_p59_69.indd   61 21/12/2010 22:39 21/12/2010   22:39 62 Thomas Cook Group plc Annual Report & Accounts 2010
It is intended that the annual bonus for the year ended 30 September 
2011 will be structured in the following way:
(i) 50% to be linked to Group ﬁ nancial targets, including 12.5% 
linked to the reduction in exceptional items;
(ii) 25% to be linked to the attainment of quarterly Group cumulative 
free cash ﬂ ow targets; and
(iii) 25% to be linked to the attainment of individual and 
non-ﬁ nancial objectives.
Pensions
The Committee believes that the Executive Directors should be 
provided with competitive post-retirement beneﬁ ts. In respect 
of Manny Fontenla-Novoa and Paul Hollingworth, the Company 
contributes each year into a pension scheme or other arrangement 
for each of them to an amount equivalent to 25% of base salary. 
The Company also contributes to a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme 
in respect of Sam Weihagen. Under his pension arrangement, Sam 
Weihagen is entitled to a bridging pension payable between the ages 
of 60 and 65 of 70% of his ﬁ nal salary and a lifetime pension payable 
from 65 of 30% of his ﬁ nal salary less the Swedish state pension.
From age 60, when the Company’s contributions to the above pension 
ceased, Sam Weihagen was paid a salary supplement of 25% of his 
base pay. Since reaching age 60, Sam Weihagen has not drawn any of 
his bridging pension, which will be subject to actuarial adjustment 
once it is drawn. The table on page 69 discloses these arrangements.
Long-term incentive plans
The Committee believes that inﬂ uencing long-term performance and 
the close alignment of Executive Directors’ remuneration with the 
interests of shareholders is an important element of the Company’s 
remuneration policy. Therefore, the following two share-based 
long-term incentive plans, both of which have been approved by 
shareholders, have been designed to reward and retain Executive 
Directors and key senior executives over the longer term whilst also 
aligning with the interests of the Company’s shareholders.
In line with market practice, awards vest three years after the award 
date, providing the participant is still employed by a company within 
the Group and to the extent that the performance target has been 
met. Unless there are exceptional circumstances, awards are made 
annually within 42 days of the Company’s annual ﬁ nancial results 
being announced. No award can be made under either plan later 
than ten years after the anniversary of the adoption date and options 
are not exercisable later than ten years after the date of the award. 
Neither plan has a performance target retest provision. 
Thomas Cook Group plc 2007 Performance Share Plan (‘PSP’)
During the Year, PSP awards equal to the following percentages of 
base salary were made to the Executive Directors:
Name Percentage of base salary
Manny Fontenla-Novoa 175
Paul Hollingworth
1
200
Sam Weihagen 150
1   As an exception to the remuneration policy the Committee agreed that Paul Hollingworth would 
receive an award equal to 200% of base salary for the ﬁ rst two years following his appointment. 
Thereafter, his awards will revert to 150% of base salary.
Awards with a value of 100% or less of base salary were also made 
to other senior executives. The Committee currently intends to make 
awards in January 2011 on the same basis as above. 
Thomas Cook Group plc 2008 Co-Investment Plan (‘COIP’)
Under the COIP , Executive Directors and key executives must purchase 
the Company’s shares out of their bonus. If the bonus paid is below 
100% of salary, 10% of the participant’s net base salary (or the whole 
of the net bonus if less) must be invested. If the bonus paid is above 
100% of base salary, all of the bonus payable above 100% of base 
salary (subject to the minimum investment of 10% of net base salary) 
must be used to acquire shares. Participants can also choose to 
invest a further part of their bonus to purchase shares. The shares 
purchased, either on a voluntary or mandatory basis, are referred 
to as Lodged Shares. Participants may receive up to three and a 
half Matching Shares for every one Lodged Share at the end of the 
performance period subject to the satisfaction of the performance 
target. The requirement for compulsory investment under the COIP 
will cease once the value of all shares held by a participant reaches 
a value equal to 200% of base salary. This level of shareholding must 
be maintained. The number of Lodged Shares held by each Executive 
Director and the percentage of base salary that represents (based on 
a market value of 171.8p as at 30 September 2010) is detailed below:

1   Paul Hollingworth invested £150,000 and £40,000 in February and May respectively of his own funds into 
the COIP as he did not qualify for a bonus payment, having only joined the Company on 1 January 2010.
Review of performance conditions attached to long-term 
incentive plans
In November 2009, the Committee conducted a detailed review 
of the performance targets attached to the PSP and COIP awards. 
This was to ensure that they were in line with the Group’s strategic 
and ﬁ nancial plans, that they were sufﬁ ciently stretching and that 
they also provided realistic incentives for executives. As a result of 
the review, the Committee concluded that the performance targets 
did not satisfy the above criteria and consulted with the Company’s 
major shareholders and their representative bodies regarding the 
following proposals: 
• to change the Earnings Per Share (‘EPS’) target for both the PSP 
and the COIP from an absolute target stated in pence for each cycle 
to a standard compound annual growth rate in EPS of 6% to 14% 
over the three-year period. The Committee believed that changing 
the way the target is measured would improve the credibility with 
participants because a new rate would not have to be set for each 
cycle of awards; 
• to introduce a Total Shareholder Return (‘TSR’) component to the 
COIP . This would mean that both plans would have a performance 
target which is 50% EPS and 50% TSR;
• to introduce a second TSR comparator group, for both the PSP 
and the COIP , consisting of a tailored peer group of international 
travel operators. This would be equally balanced with the 
previously used comparator group based on the 50 companies 
at the bottom of the FTSE 100 and the 50 companies at the top 
of the FTSE 250. The Committee believed that the introduction of 
this second TSR comparator group would improve the relevance 
of the performance target to participants; and
• the Return On Invested Capital (‘ROIC’) measure would remain in 
respect of the COIP .
Following the consultation, the Board decided that it was appropriate, 
in view of the new methodology being proposed, to seek shareholder 
approval for the new performance targets, even though it was not 
required. A resolution put to the AGM on 25 March 2010 to approve 
the new performance targets was passed with 99.8% of the vote.

adjusted EPS of 33 pence or above. Zero vesting for EPS below 
28 pence. Vesting will increase on a straight line basis from 
0.5 Matching Shares to 2.5 Matching Shares for EPS between 
28 pence and 33 pence subject to the ROIC ratchet (see below). 
January, June and August 2009 awards: The same vesting 
schedule applies as for the June 2008 awards but the EPS target 
is 35 pence to 40 pence.
2010 50% – Earnings Per Share Vesting of up to 2.5 Matching Shares for EPS growth of 14% or 
greater. Zero vesting for EPS growth of less than 6%. Vesting will 
increase on a straight line basis from 25% to 100% of the EPS 
linked part of the award for EPS growth between 6% and 14%.
50% – Total Shareholder Return ranked equally 
against the following comparator groups:
•  the 50 companies at the bottom of the FTSE 
100 and the 50 companies at the top of the  
FTSE 250; and
•  sector speciﬁ c comparator group.

Vesting of up to 2.5 Matching Shares for upper quartile 
ranking. Zero vesting for sub-median ranking. Vesting will 
increase on a straight line basis from 25% to 100% of the TSR 
linked part of the initial award for ranking between median 
and upper quartile. Each comparator group determines 25% 
of the award.
2008, 2009 and 2010 Return On Invested Capital achievement If ROIC is below 4% no Matching Shares will vest. If ROIC is 
between 4% and 6%, a reduction of up to 40% is applied on 
a straight-line basis. If ROIC is between 6% and 10%, Matching 
Shares vest according to EPS performance only (EPS and TSR 
performance for the 2010 award) (overall opportunity of up to 
2.5 times a participant’s investment). If ROIC is between 10% and 
14%, an uplift of up to 40% is applied on a straight line basis, 
subject to a maximum uplift of 40% for ROIC in excess of 14%. 
This will increase the matching ratio to 3.5 Matching Shares for 
every one Lodged Share.

Selection of long-term incentive performance conditions 
A further explanation of each performance target element is 
given below:
• TSR in relation to the PSP and COIP: TSR has been chosen by the 
Committee as it is considered by the Committee to be aligned 
with shareholder interests. The TSR element is divided into two 
comparator groups:
– PSP 2007, 2008, 2009 and PSP and COIP 2010: the ﬁ rst 
comparator group consists of the 50 companies at the bottom 
of the FTSE 100 and the 50 companies at the top of the FTSE 
250. This was chosen as it is a broad group of companies of 
similar size and against which the performance of the Company’s 
management should be judged. This comparator group excludes 
investment companies; and
– PSP and COIP 2010: the second comparator group consists of a 
tailored peer group of international travel operators (see details 
opposite). The Committee believes that this second comparator 
group improves the relevance of the performance target to 
participants.
The constituent members of both of the comparator groups are 
determined on the date the awards are made. At the end of the 
performance period, TSR calculations will be performed by the 
Company’s external advisers using the 90 day average share price 
at the start and end of the performance period. 
• EPS in relation to the PSP and COIP: EPS was chosen as it is 
regarded as a good reﬂ ector of business performance. 
– PSP and COIP 2007, 2008 and 2009: the Committee was advised 
that an absolute target was considered more appropriate than a 
percentage growth target as there was little historic data for the 
Company, having only been established in 2007. The EPS target 
range was set by reference to early consensus forecasts.
– PSP and COIP 2010: the EPS target was set as a compound 
annual compound growth rate over a three-year period. 
EPS will be derived from the income statement for the last 
ﬁ nancial year ending prior to the end of the performance period.
• ROIC in relation to the COIP: ROIC was chosen to measure the 
efﬁ ciency of the use of the Group’s capital in achieving the 
underlying earnings target. The ROIC ranges were set by reference 
to the Weighted Average Cost of Capital used by the Group for the 
purposes of impairment testing. ROIC will be calculated over the 
three-year performance period by taking the post tax operating 
proﬁ t over the performance period and dividing this by the sum 
of the opening capital for each year in the period.
The Committee will review the performance conditions attached to 
any future awards to ensure they are stretching and that the interests 
of the Executive Directors and senior management are aligned 
with shareholders. 
It is currently intended that further awards will be made in 
January 2011 with the same performance targets used in 2010 
attached to them.
Details of the performance targets attached to each PSP and COIP 
award are detailed in the table on page 63.

Committee action in respect of the 2007 PSP Award
The PSP award made in July 2007, reached the end of its three-year 
performance period during the Year. In relation to the EPS element 
of the award, the Committee wanted to ensure that EPS was 
calculated on a like-for-like basis at the beginning and at the end of 
the performance period. Accordingly, the Committee used its power, 
allowed under the PSP rules, to adjust the EPS ﬁ gure for the year 
ended 30 September 2009 in so far as it applied to the 2007 PSP 
award vesting as the earnings had been adversely affected by: 
• the decision (approved by the Board) to fully draw the ﬁ nancing 
facility in October 2008 to avoid the risks from the market 
interruption caused by the Lehman Brothers insolvency and the 
subsequent banking crisis;
• the decision (approved by the Board) to only invest liquidity 
overnight to avoid bank insolvencies; and
• a net interest charge arising from the mismatch of assumed interest 
received on pension asset and interest paid on pension liabilities. 
This item is non-cash and beyond management control in the 
short-term.
The Committee also determined that the adjusted EPS ﬁ gure would 
be the starting ﬁ gure for the EPS element of the 2010 PSP and COIP 
performance targets. 
The result was that the EPS element of the performance target vested 
at 98%. The participants were permitted to exercise the EPS element in 
March 2010 as the level of performance had already been agreed by 
the Committee. To the extent that the EPS element of the award was 
exercised prior to 12 July 2010, the participants were required to retain 
the resulting shares (after the sale of sufﬁ cient shares to cover the 
income tax and social security contributions arising on the exercise) 
until 12 July 2010, the third anniversary of the date of award.
In relation to the TSR element of the award, the Committee agreed 
that the volcanic ash cloud (further information on the VAC can be 
found on page 7) was an exceptional event and had a distorting effect 
on the share price. Therefore, having received advice from external 
advisers, the Committee agreed that it was appropriate to end the TSR 
measurement period on 15 April 2010 (the ﬁ rst date when UK and 
European airspace was closed). Accordingly, the TSR element of the 
2007 award vested at 37%. This meant that the total level of vesting 
for the 2007 PSP award was 67.5%.
Participants were not allowed to exercise the TSR element of the 2007 
PSP award prior to 12 July 2010, the third anniversary of the date of 
award. From that date to the date of this report, the Company has been

in a prohibited period then a close period. Therefore, at the date of this 
report, participants, including Executive Directors, have not been able 
to exercise the TSR element of their 2007 PSP award nor have they been 
able to sell the net number of shares received from the early exercise of 
the EPS element of the award.
2008 PSP and COIP awards 
During the consultation referred to above, shareholders were informed 
that the EPS targets for the 2008 and 2009 awards under the PSP 
and COIP Awards were misjudged and unachievable. In line with 
shareholder feedback, the Committee has not exercised any discretion 
and, unfortunately, despite a compound annual growth rate in EPS over 
the three years to September 2010 of 10.1%, the Company has not met 
the original EPS target in respect of the 2008 awards. Therefore these 
elements of management’s compensation packages have lapsed.
Change of control and other circumstances
In the event of a change of control, the awards under both the PSP 
and COIP shall vest at the Committee’s discretion taking into account 
the period of time for which the award has been held by participants 
and the extent to which performance conditions have been achieved 
since the award date after an independent valuation of performance 
to date. Where options have been granted, participants would have six 
months following the change of control to exercise their options, to the 
extent permitted by the Committee. On the death of a participant or in 
the case of early termination of a participant’s employment where the 
Committee has used its discretion, participants (or their representatives) 
would have twelve and six months respectively to exercise their options, 
to the extent permitted by the Committee.
Funding of share plans
It is the Company’s current intention to satisfy the requirements 
of its share plans in the method best suited to the interests of 
the Company, either by acquiring shares in the market or, subject 
to institutional shareholder guidelines, issuing new shares. The 
Committee has agreed that it is prudent and appropriate to hedge the 
shares awarded under the PSP and the matching element awarded 
under the COIP . As at 30 September 2010, 4,282,801 shares were held 
in the Thomas Cook Group plc 2007 Employee Beneﬁ t Trust, which 
represents 17% of share incentive awards held on that date and 
0.5% of the total issued share capital. The level of hedging will be 
kept under review. Subject to the rules of the plans, awards cannot 
be made if awards under any discretionary employee share plan 
operated by Thomas Cook Group plc in the preceding ten-year period 
would exceed 5% of the Company’s issued share capital at that time.
The Trustee would not normally vote at general meetings on the 
Thomas Cook Group plc shares held in the Employee Beneﬁ t Trust 
and did not vote at the AGM held in March 2010.
Pay and conditions across the Group
The Group operates in a signiﬁ cant number of different countries and 
has many employees who do a diverse range of jobs. Therefore, it is 
difﬁ cult to take into account pay and employment conditions across 
the Group speciﬁ cally when setting the remuneration of the Executive 
Directors. However: 
• all employees, including the Directors, are paid by reference to the 
market rate;
• quality performance is rewarded through a number of performance 
related bonus schemes across the Group;
• the Group offers internal promotion opportunities;
• the Group offers employment conditions which are commensurate 
with a large UK listed company including high standards of health 
and safety and equal opportunity policies;
• the Group offers a range of beneﬁ ts depending on employee 
location including pension, ﬂ exible beneﬁ ts, paid annual leave and 
healthcare insurance; and 
• the Company believes that share plans are important to align the 
interests of employees and shareholders. Therefore, the Company 
offers the following two employee share plans:
– Sharesave operates in 21 countries and offers employees, including 
the Executive Directors, the opportunity to purchase shares at a 
discount to the market value on the invitation date; and
– The Buy As You Earn Scheme is open to all UK-based employees 
who have been employed for at least six months, including 
UK-based Executive Directors. Participants may contribute 
up to £125 per month, which the trustee of the plan uses to 
purchase shares on their behalf. For every 10 shares purchased, 
participants are awarded one Matching Share.
Service contracts
Each of the Executive Directors, who served during the Year, has a 
service contract with the Company or one of its subsidiary companies.

Director are set out below:

The notice period for Executive Directors is 12 months. The Committee 
believes that this is appropriate given the need to retain the specialist 
skills that the Executive Directors bring to the business and to achieve 
continuity in the Company’s senior management. Either the Executive 
Director or the Company may terminate employment by giving one 
year’s written notice and the Company may pay compensation in lieu of 
notice. Under its terms of reference, it is the Committee’s responsibility 
to determine the basis on which the employment of an Executive 
Director is terminated. The Committee aims to avoid rewarding poor 
performance and to take a robust line on reducing compensation to 
reﬂ ect any obligation to mitigate loss on the part of the departing 
Executive Director. There is no clause in the Executive Directors’ 
contracts providing them with additional protection in the form 
of compensation for severance as a result of change of control.
External appointments
The Company recognises the beneﬁ ts to the individual, and to the 
Group, of Executive Directors taking on external appointments as 
non-executive directors. Subject to the approval of the Committee and 
to such conditions as the Committee may, in its discretion, attach, an 
Executive Director may accept such appointments at other companies 
or similar advisory or consultative roles. The Committee has set a 
limit of one external appointment for each Executive Director, to a 
FTSE 100 or FTSE 250 company, or an international company of a 
similar size, unless there is justiﬁ cation for a further appointment. 
Paul Hollingworth, Group Chief Financial Ofﬁ cer, is a non-executive 
director of Electrocomponents plc. For the period from his 
appointment as a Director of the Company to the end of the Year he 
received a fee of £39,375 from Electrocomponents plc, which he is 
allowed to retain.
Non-Executive Directors
The Committee is responsible for determining the fees for the Chairman 
of the Company. The fees for the other Non-Executive Directors are set 
by the Board. No Director votes on his or her own remuneration.

The Non-Executive Directors’ fees were reviewed during the Year. The fees 
were benchmarked against other companies in the FTSE 350 and following 
the review, it was agreed that no increase in the fees should be made, 
but a further review will take place in 2011. Non-Executive Directors do 
not participate in any bonus plans, are not eligible to participate in any 
long-term incentive plans and no pension contributions are made on 
their behalf. 
The annual rates of Non-Executive Director fees are shown in the 
table below.

Performance graph
The graph below shows the TSR for holders of Thomas Cook Group plc €0.10 ordinary shares for the period since listing on 19 June 2007, 
measured against the FTSE All Share Travel & Leisure Index. This index was chosen as a comparator because the Company has been a constituent 
of it throughout the period since listing. The calculation of TSR follows the provisions of the Regulations and is broadly the change in market 
price together with reinvestment of dividend income. This graph shows the spot value of £100 invested in Thomas Cook Group plc on 19 June 
2007 compared with the value of £100 invested in the FTSE All Share Travel & Leisure Index. The intermediate points are the spot values on the 
Company’s Financial Year ends.

Share options and share awards under long-term incentive plans
The following tables show in respect of each person who served as a Director at any time during the Year the number of ordinary shares of 
€0.10 each that were the subject of a share option or a share award at the start of the Year (or on the date of appointment) and at the end 
of the Year (or on the date of resignation). Holdings relate to the COIP and PSP . Where a Director is awarded an option, it is awarded as ‘nil cost’.

During the period Jürgen Büser was a Director, none of his awards were exercised or lapsed.
Manny Fontenla-Novoa exercised options over 139,054 ordinary shares on 17 March 2010. On the same day, he sold 57,128 shares at a price 
of 243.0642p, to cover income tax liability and NICs and commission costs. The total gain on exercise was £337,990. He retained the remaining 
81,926 shares after exercise.

For UK participants £30,000 of awards can be made and held under a HMRC approved Company Share Option Sub-Plan (‘CSOSP’). The following 
table gives details of awards made under the CSOSP in conjunction with the PSP:

Earliest exercisable date 9 January 2012 12 February 2013
Expiration date 9 January 2019 12 February 2020
At the date of exercise, to the extent that there is a gain on the HMRC approved options, PSP options will be forfeited to the same value.
Vesting of awards made under the PSP in 2007, 2008 and 2009 (including the HMRC approved options) is dependent on 50% Total Shareholder 
Return ranked against the FTSE 50 to 150 comparator group and 50% growth in Earnings Per Share. Between the end of the Year and the date of 
this report, it became apparent that the EPS target in respect of the 2008 PSP award had not been achieved. Therefore, the EPS element of this 
award has lapsed. Vesting of awards made under the PSP in 2010 (including the HMRC approved options) is dependent on 25% TSR ranked against 
the FTSE 50 to 150 comparator group, 25% TSR ranked against the sector speciﬁ c comparator group and 50% growth in Earnings Per Share. Further 
information on the performance conditions is detailed on page 63.

* During the period Jürgen Büser was Director, none of his awards lapsed.
On 11 February 2010, Manny Fontenla-Novoa reallocated 135,000 Lodged Shares from his 2009 COIP award to his 2010 award. Accordingly, the 
corresponding award of 472,500 options granted in 2009 to provide the Matching Share element for those Lodged Shares lapsed. The reallocated 
Lodged Shares were those bought on a voluntary basis in 2009. The mandatory element (267,700 Lodged Shares acquired with bonus paid in 
excess of 100% of base salary) remains invested in the COIP in respect of the 2009 award.
Vesting of Matching Shares awarded under the COIP in 2008 and 2009 is dependent on growth in EPS and Return on Invested Capital
achievement. Between the end of the Year and the date of this report, it became apparent that the EPS target in respect of the 2008 COIP award 
had not been achieved. Therefore, the Matching Shares in respect of the 2008 award have lapsed. Vesting of Matching Shares awarded under the 
COIP in 2010 is dependant on growth in EPS, TSR ranked against the comparator groups and Return on Invested Capital achievement. Further 
information on the performance conditions is detailed on page 63.

None of the Directors of the Company held any interest in any other securities of Thomas Cook Group plc during the Year. In the period between 
30 September 2010 and 30 November 2010, there were no changes in the Directors’ interests referred to above.
The mid-market price of the Company’s ordinary shares at the close of business on 30 September 2010 was 171.8p and the range during the 
Year was 272.0p to 171.7p. These mid-market prices are as quoted on the London Stock Exchange.

Directors’ pensions
The Company contributes each year into a pension scheme, or other arrangement, for each of the Executive Directors to an amount equivalent to 
25% of their annual base salary. Manny Fontenla-Novoa and Jürgen Büser are active members of the Thomas Cook Pension Plan, a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t 
pension scheme. For salary above that which is pensionable Manny Fontenla-Novoa and Jürgen Büser were paid the balance as a salary supplement. 
Paul Hollingworth is paid 25% of his base salary as a salary supplement. The Company also contributes to a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension scheme in respect 
of Sam Weihagen. Under his pension arrangement, Sam Weihagen is entitled to a bridging pension payable between the ages of 60 and 64 of 70% 
of his ﬁ nal salary and a lifetime pension payable from 65 of 30% of his ﬁ nal salary less the Swedish state pension. From age 60, when the Company’s 
contributions to the above pension ceased, Sam Weihagen was paid a salary supplement of 25% of his base pay. Since reaching age 60, Sam Weihagen 
has not drawn any of his bridging pension, which will be subject to actuarial adjustment once it is drawn. The table below discloses these arrangements.
The pay in lieu of pension salary supplements paid to the Executive Directors are disclosed in the Directors’ remuneration table above.

SHARE CAPITAL
The Company has the following two classes of shares in issue: 
Class of share
Number of 
shares in issue
Ordinary shares of €0.10 each 858,292,947
Deferred shares of £1 each 50,000
The ordinary shares carry the right to the proﬁ ts of the Company 
available for distribution and to the return of capital on a winding 
up of the Company. The ordinary shares carry the right to attend 
and speak at general meetings of the Company; each share holds the 
right to one vote. The ordinary shares are admitted to trading on the 
Ofﬁ cial List of the London Stock Exchange. The deferred shares carry 
no right to the proﬁ ts of the Company. On a winding up, the holders 
of the deferred shares would be entitled to receive an amount equal 
to the capital paid up on each deferred share. The holders of the 
deferred shares are not entitled to receive notice, attend, speak or 
vote (whether on a show of hands or on a poll) at general meetings 
of the Company.
AUTHORITY TO PURCHASE SHARES
The Company currently does not have authority to purchase its own shares.
SHARE TRANSFER RESTRICTIONS
The Articles of Association (the ‘Articles’) are designed to ensure that 
the number of the Company’s shares held by non-EEA nationals does 
not reach a level which could jeopardise the Company’s entitlement 
to continue to hold or enjoy the beneﬁ t of any authority, permission, 
licence or privilege which it, or any of its subsidiaries, holds or enjoys 
and which enables an air service to be operated (each an “Operating 
Right”). In particular, EC Council Regulation 1008/2008 on licensing of 
air carriers requires that an air carrier must be majority-owned and 
effectively controlled by EEA nationals.
The Articles allow the Directors, from time to time, to set a “Permitted 
Maximum” on the number of the Company’s shares which may be owned 
by non-EEA nationals at such level as they believe is in compliance with 
the Operating Rights, provided that the Permitted Maximum shall not be 
less than 40% of the total number of issued shares.
The Company maintains a separate register (the “Separate Register”) 
of shares in which non-EEA nationals, whether individuals, bodies 
corporate or other entities have an interest (such shares are referred 
to as “Relevant Shares” in the Articles). An interest in this context 
is widely deﬁ ned (see below). The Directors may require relevant 
members or other persons to provide them with information to 
enable them to determine whether shares are, or are to be treated 
as, Relevant Shares. If such information is not provided then the 
Directors will be able, at their discretion, to determine that shares to 
which their enquiries relate be treated as Relevant Shares. Registered 
shareholders will also be obliged to notify the Company if they are 
aware either (a) that any share they hold ought to be treated as a 
Relevant Share for this purpose; or (b) that any share they hold which 
is treated as a Relevant Share should no longer be so treated. In this 
case, the Directors shall request such information and evidence as 
they require to satisfy themselves that the share should not be treated 
as a Relevant Share and, on receipt of such evidence, shall remove 
particulars of the share from the Separate Register. If the Directors 
determine that such action is necessary to protect any Operating 
Right due to the fact that an Intervening Act (an “Intervening Act” 
being the refusal, withholding, suspension or revocation of any 
Operating Right or the imposition of materially inhibiting conditions 
or limitations on any Operating Right in either case, by any state or 
regulatory authority) has taken place or is contemplated, threatened 
or intended, or the aggregate number of Relevant Shares is such 
that an Intervening Act may occur or the ownership or control of 
the Company is such that an Intervening Act may occur, the Directors 
may, among other things:
• identify those shares which give rise to the need to take action and 
treat such shares as affected shares (“Affected Shares”) (see below); or
• set a Permitted Maximum on the number of Relevant Shares which 
may subsist at any time (which may not, save in the circumstances 
referred to below, be lower than 40% of the total number of issued 
shares) and treat any Relevant Shares in excess of this Permitted 
Maximum as Affected Shares (see below). The Directors may serve 
a notice (an “Affected Share Notice”) in respect of any Affected 
Share. An Affected Share Notice can, if it so speciﬁ es, have the effect 
of depriving the registered holder of the right to attend, vote and 
speak at general meetings which he would otherwise have had 
as a consequence of holding such shares. Such an Affected Share 
Notice can, if it so speciﬁ es, also require the recipient to dispose 
of the Affected Shares (so that the Relevant Shares will then cease 
to be Affected Shares) within 21 days or such longer period as the 
Directors may determine. The Directors are also given the power to 
sell such Affected Shares themselves where there is non-compliance 
with an Affected Share Notice at the best price reasonably 
obtainable at the relevant time on behalf of the shareholder. 
In deciding which shares are to be dealt with as Affected Shares 
the Directors, in their sole opinion, will determine which Relevant 
Shares may give rise to the fact of risk of an Intervening Act occurring 
and, subject to any such determination, will have regard to the 
chronological order in which particulars of Relevant Shares have been, 
or are to be, entered in the Separate Register unless to do so would in 
the sole opinion of the Directors be inequitable. If there is a change 
in any applicable law or the Company or any subsidiary receives 
any direction, notice or requirement from any state or regulatory 
authority, which, in either case, necessitates such action to overcome, 
prevent or avoid an Intervening Act, then the Directors may either:
• lower the Permitted Maximum to the minimum extent that they 
consider necessary to overcome, prevent or avoid an Intervening Act; or
• resolve that any Relevant Shares shall be treated as Affected Shares 
and the Conversion Permitted Maximum. The rights of the Directors 
referred to above apply until such time as the Directors resolve 
that grounds for the making of a determination have ceased to 
exist, whereupon the Directors must withdraw such determination. 
The Permitted Maximum is set at 40%. This Permitted Maximum 
may be varied by the Directors. If the Directors resolve to vary 
the Permitted Maximum to deal with shares as Affected Shares 
or relax the ownership limitations, they shall publish in at least 
one national newspaper in the United Kingdom (and in any other 
country in which the shares are listed) notice of the determination 
and of any Permitted Maximum.
The Directors shall publish, from time to time:
• information as to the number of shares particulars of which have 
been entered on the Separate Register; and
• any Permitted Maximum which has been speciﬁ ed.
As at 30 September 2010, 146,755 ordinary shares (0.017%) were held 
on the Separate Register.

We have audited the ﬁ nancial statements of Thomas Cook Group 
plc for the year ended 30 September 2010, which comprise the 
Group income statement, the Group statement of comprehensive 
income, the Group and Company cash ﬂ ow statement, the Group 
and Company balance sheet, the Group and Company statement 
of changes in equity and the related notes. The ﬁ nancial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable 
law and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union and, as regards the parent company 
ﬁ nancial statements, as applied in accordance with the provisions 
of the Companies Act 2006.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
As explained more fully in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities, 
the Directors are responsible for the preparation of the ﬁ nancial 
statements and for being satisﬁ ed that they give a true and fair view. 
Our responsibility is to audit the ﬁ nancial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing 
Practices Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. 
This report, including the opinions, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body in accordance with Chapter 3 
of Part 16 of the Companies Act 2006 and for no other purpose. We do 
not, in giving these opinions, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is shown 
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by our 
prior consent in writing.
Scope of the audit of the ﬁ nancial statements 
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and 
disclosures in the ﬁ nancial statements sufﬁ cient to give reasonable 
assurance that the ﬁ nancial statements are free from material 
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an 
assessment of: whether the accounting policies are appropriate to 
the Group’s and the parent company’s circumstances and have been 
consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness 
of signiﬁ cant accounting estimates made by the Directors; and the 
overall presentation of the ﬁ nancial statements.
Opinion on ﬁ nancial statements 
In our opinion: 
• the ﬁ nancial statements give a true and fair view of the state of 
the Group’s and of the parent company’s affairs as at 30 September 
2010 and of the Group’s proﬁ t and Group’s and parent company’s 
cash ﬂ ows for the year then ended;
• the Group ﬁ nancial statements have been properly prepared in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union; 
• the parent company ﬁ nancial statements have been properly 
prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European 
Union and as applied in accordance with the provisions of the 
Companies Act 2006; and
• the ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with 
the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as regards the 
Group ﬁ nancial statements, Article 4 of the lAS Regulation. 
Opinion on other matters prescribed by the Companies Act 2006 
In our opinion: 
• the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has 
been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
2006; and
• the information given in the Directors’ Report for the ﬁ nancial year 
for which the ﬁ nancial statements are prepared is consistent with 
the ﬁ nancial statements. 
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
We have nothing to report in respect of the following: 
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report to you if, 
in our opinion: 
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the parent 
company, or returns adequate for our audit have not been received 
from branches not visited by us; or 
• the parent company ﬁ nancial statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not in agreement 
with the accounting records and returns; or 
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration speciﬁ ed by law are 
not made; or 
• we have not received all the information and explanations we 
require for our audit; or
• a Corporate Governance Statement has not been prepared by the 
parent company. 
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review: 
• the Directors’ statement in relation to going concern; and
• the parts of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the June 2008 
Combined Code speciﬁ ed for our review.

Other reserves consist of the merger reserve, the capital redemption reserve and own shares held.
The merger reserve arose on the reverse acquisition of Thomas Cook Group plc and MyTravel Group plc by Thomas Cook AG. In the case of 
Thomas Cook Group plc, the merger reserve represents the difference between the existing share capital and share premium of Thomas Cook AG 
and the share capital of Thomas Cook Group plc issued in exchange, and in the case of MyTravel Group plc, the merger reserve represents the 
difference between the fair value and the nominal value of the share capital issued by Thomas Cook Group plc.
The capital redemption reserve was created as a consequence of the share buy back. Further details of the share buy back are included in note 28.
Details of changes in hedging and translation reserves are set out in note 29.
The put option of £11.0m recognised during the year was issued to the non-controlling interest of a subsidiary undertaking during the year 
ended 31 October 2007. This is not considered material for restatement of comparative information.

1 General information
Thomas Cook Group plc is a limited liability company incorporated and domiciled in England and Wales under the Companies Act 2006 and 
listed on the London Stock Exchange. The address of the registered ofﬁ ce is 6th Floor South, Brettenham House, Lancaster Place, London,     
WC2E 7EN. The principal activities of the Group are discussed in the Directors’ Report – Business Review on pages 3 to 45.
These consolidated ﬁ nancial statements were approved for issue by the Board of Directors on 30 November 2010.
2 Accounting policies
These ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared in accordance with IFRS and IFRIC interpretations and with those parts of the Companies Act 
2006 applicable to groups reporting under IFRS. The ﬁ nancial statements have also been prepared in accordance with IFRS adopted for use in 
the European Union and therefore comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation.
The ﬁ nancial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except for revaluation of certain ﬁ nancial instruments and 
investment property.
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of the ﬁ nancial information presented in this document are set out below. These 
policies have been applied consistently to the periods presented unless otherwise stated.
Basis of preparation
During the year, a restatement of prior year comparatives was required due to adjustments to the accounting for certain prior year acquisitions.  
The business combination intangibles, deferred tax liability and deferred and contingent consideration related to the Gold Medal acquisition 
have been revised. Refer to note 15 for the restated balance sheet as at the date of acquisition of Gold Medal.
In addition, the prior year income statement and balance sheet have been restated to reﬂ ect the unwinding of the discount on contingent and 
deferred consideration for the acquisition of Gold Medal and Hotels4U, which was previously omitted. In accordance with IAS 8 “Accounting 
policies, changes in accounting estimates and errors” the year ended 30 September 2009 has been restated.
The unwinding of the discount on contingent on deferred consideration has had the following impact on the prior year income statement and 
balance sheet:
Year ended 
30 September 2009

Loss for the year (3.5)
Loss attributable to equity holders of the parent (3.5)
Decrease in total equity (4.5)
Basic loss per share (0.4)p
Diluted loss per share (0.4)p
The prior year operating lease disclosures have been restated to include arrangements previously omitted. Refer to note 8 and 32 for the 
restated disclosures. 
Adoption of new or amended standards and interpretations in the current year
In the current year, the following new or amended standards have been adopted and have affected the amounts reported or the disclosure and 
presentation in these ﬁ nancial statements:
IAS 1 Revised  “Presentation of Financial Statements” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 
2009. The amendments require a number of presentational changes, including the introduction of a statement of 
comprehensive income and the requirement to present a statement of changes in equity as a primary statement. The 
statement of comprehensive income represents all items of recognised income and expense in either one statement or 
two linked statements. Management has elected to present two statements.
IAS 38 Amendment  “Intangible assets” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. The amendment 
requires advertising or promotional expenditure to be expensed when the Group has the right to access the goods or 
has received the service. In particular, brochure costs are to be expensed as and when the brochures are available to be 
sent to customers or retail outlets. Under the previous policy, brochure costs were expensed when delivered to the retail 
outlets or customer. The comparative ﬁ gures have been restated to reﬂ ect the change in accounting policy. Adoption of 
the standard has had the following impact:

IAS 39 Amendment  “Eligible hedged items” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009. The amendment 
prohibits the time value component of derivative options being designated as an effective hedge. The comparative 
ﬁ gures have been restated to reﬂ ect the change in accounting policy and the movement in time value recognised in 
the income statement in the current and prior year is included as a separately disclosed item under the description 
“IAS 39 fair value re-measurement”. Adoption of the standard has had the following impact:

Basic earnings/(loss) per share 0.2p (0.7)p
Diluted earnings/(loss) per share 0.2p (0.7)p
IFRS 3 Revised  “Business combinations” is effective prospectively for business combinations with acquisition dates on or after the 
beginning of the ﬁ rst annual reporting period commencing on or after 1 July 2009. The amendment changes the 
way in which step acquisitions are to be accounted for and requires acquisition costs to be expensed in the income 
statement and adjustments to contingent consideration to be recognised in the income statement after a speciﬁ ed 
period. Furthermore, in accordance with the transition requirements, the recognition of deferred tax assets from past 
acquisitions is reﬂ ected in the income statement, and not in goodwill. The impact on the current year from adopting 
the amendment principally relates to the recognition of deferred tax assets from the Thomas Cook/MyTravel merger 
and expensing acquisition costs related to acquisitions concluded in the current year or likely to be concluded in the 
foreseeable future. These acquisition costs are included as separately disclosed items in the income statement, under 
the description “Exceptional operating items”. Adoption of the standard has had the following impact: 
Year ended 
30 September 2010
£m
Loss for the year (5.0)
Loss attributable to equity holders of the parent (5.0)
Decrease in total equity (5.7)
Basic loss per share (0.6)p
Diluted loss per share (0.6)p
IFRS 8   “Operating segments” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. The standard 
requires reporting segments to be identiﬁ ed based on the information used by management to run the business. 
As a result, the Group’s reportable segments have changed. In particular, the segment previously referred to as 
“Continental Europe” has been split into two segments, “Central Europe” and “West & East Europe”. The reportable 
segments of the Group now consist of six geographic operating divisions – UK, Central Europe, West & East Europe, 
Northern Europe, North America and Airlines Germany. We also report Corporate, which consists of certain residual 
businesses and corporate functions. These reportable segments are consistent with how information is presented to 
the Group Chief Executive (chief operating decision maker) for the purpose of resource allocation and assessment 
of performance.
IFRS 7 Amendment  “Financial instruments: disclosure” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 July 2009. The 
amendment requires enhanced disclosure for fair value and measurement risk. The amendment has had an impact 
on the disclosures in note 22.
In the current year, the following new or amended standards and interpretations have also been adopted. Their adoption has not had a 
signiﬁ cant impact on the amounts reported or the disclosure and presentation in these ﬁ nancial statements, but may impact the accounting 
or the disclosure and presentation for future transactions and arrangements.
IAS 23 Revised  “Borrowing costs” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. The amendment 
requires the capitalisation of borrowing costs related to assets requiring a substantial amount of time to be ready for 
their intended purpose.
IAS 28 Amendment  “Investment in associates” and amendment to IAS 31 “Interest in joint ventures” (with consequential amendments 
to IAS 32 “Financial instruments: presentation” and IFRS 7 “Financial instruments: disclosure”) are effective for annual 
reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. The amendments change the disclosure requirements 
for investments in associates or joint ventures accounted for under IAS 39 “Financial instruments: recognition and 
measurement” and clariﬁ es the allocation of losses from impairing an investment in associate.

IAS 27 Revised   “Consolidated and separate ﬁ nancial statements” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after          
1 July 2009. The amendment gives entities the option to recognise on a transaction-by-transaction basis non-controlling 
interests (previously known as minority interest) at the value of their proportion of identiﬁ able assets and liabilities or 
at full fair value. 
IFRS 2 Amendment  “Share-based payments” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. The 
amendment provides a deﬁ nition of vesting conditions and speciﬁ es the accounting treatment for non-vesting 
conditions. 
IAS 32 Amendment  “Financial instruments: presentation” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. 
The amendment clariﬁ es the treatment of puttable ﬁ nancial instruments, whereby puttable instruments meeting 
certain criteria are treated as equity as opposed to ﬁ nancial liabilities. 
IFRIC 13  “Customer loyalty programmes” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. The 
interpretation explains how entities who grant loyalty award credits to customers should account for their obligations.
IFRIC 14  “IAS 19 – The limit on a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t asset, minimum funding requirements and their interaction” is effective 
for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2009. The interpretation provides guidance on the 
amount of pension scheme surpluses that can be recognised as a deﬁ ned beneﬁ t asset and when minimum funding 
requirements may give rise to additional liabilities.
Other changes – IAS 39 fair value re-measurement
During the year, it was decided to separately disclose the movement in forward points on foreign exchange cash ﬂ ow hedging contracts and time 
value of options. Both items are subject to market ﬂ uctuations and unwind when the options or forward contracts mature, and therefore are not 
considered to be part of the Group’s underlying performance.
The prior year comparatives have been restated to reﬂ ect this change.
Change in accounting estimates
During the year, the Group conducted a review of the estimated useful economic lives of its aircraft. This has resulted in a change in the 
expected useful lives of aircraft from 12-20 years to 18 years.
The change in estimate has been implemented as of 1 April 2010 and has resulted in a decrease in depreciation in the current year of £15.6m, 
the beneﬁ t of which will be offset by increased depreciation in future periods.
New or amended standards and interpretations in issue but not yet effective
The following new standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that are expected to impact the Group, which have not been 
applied in these ﬁ nancial statements, were in issue, but are not yet effective:
IAS 24 Amendment  “Related parties” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2011. The amendment 
clariﬁ es the deﬁ nition of related parties.
IFRS 2 Amendment  “Share-based payments” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2010. 
This amendment clariﬁ es the scope and accounting for Group cash-settled share-based payments.
IAS 32 Amendment  “Classiﬁ cation of rights” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 February 2010. 
The amendment clariﬁ es the treatment of rights, options or warrants issued to acquire a ﬁ xed number of 
an entity’s own equity instruments for a ﬁ xed amount of consideration.
IFRS 9   “Financial Instruments” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or after 1 January 2013. 
The standard will eventually replace IAS 39 but currently only details the requirements for recognition and 
measurement of ﬁ nancial assets.
IFRIC 14 Amendment  “Prepayments of a minimum funding requirement” is effective for annual reporting periods commencing on or 
after 1 January 2011. The amendment remedies one of the consequences of IFRIC 14, whereby an entity under 
certain circumstances is not allowed to recognise an asset for the prepayment of a minimum funding requirement.
Management is currently assessing the impact of adopting these new or amended standards and interpretations.

Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements continued
2 Accounting policies continued
Basis of consolidation
The Group’s ﬁ nancial statements consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiary undertakings. The results of subsidiaries acquired, or 
disposed of, are consolidated for the periods from, or to, the date on which control passed. Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Company. 
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern the ﬁ nancial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to obtain 
beneﬁ ts from its activities.
Acquisitions are accounted for under the purchase method. Where a transaction is a business combination amongst entities under common 
control, the requirements of IFRS 3(R) are applied. The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries 
by the Group. The cost of an acquisition is measured at fair value of the assets given, equity instruments issued, contingent consideration 
arrangements entered into, and liabilities incurred or assumed at the date of exchange. Directly attributable transaction costs are expensed as 
incurred. Identiﬁ able assets acquired and liabilities and contingent liabilities assumed in a business combination are measured initially at their 
fair values at the acquisition date. When the ownership of an acquired company is less than 100%, the non-controlling interest is measured as 
the proportion of the recognised net assets attributable to the non-controlling interest. The excess of the cost of acquisition over the fair value 
of the Group’s share of identiﬁ able net assets acquired is recorded as goodwill.
Where audited ﬁ nancial accounts are not coterminous with those of the Group, the ﬁ nancial information is derived from the last audited 
accounts available and unaudited management accounts for the period up to the Company’s balance sheet date.
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses are eliminated on consolidation.
Interpretation guidance included within SIC Interpretation 12 “Consolidation – special purpose entities”, indicates that certain special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are involved in aircraft leasing arrangements with the Group, should be interpreted as being controlled by the Group, 
and therefore subject to consolidation, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities. As a consequence, 
the Group has consolidated three (2009: three) SPEs that own four (2009: four) aircraft operated by the Group on operating leases. In addition, 
during the prior year the operations of the German airline were placed in a holding company in which the Group owns a 50.0023% direct 
interest. All risks and rewards continue to be held by the Group and, in accordance with accounting standards, the entity has been treated 
as being 100% controlled and fully consolidated by the Group.
Associates and joint ventures
Entities, other than subsidiaries, over which the Group exerts signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence, but not control or joint control, are associates. Entities 
which the Group jointly controls with one or more other party under a contractual arrangement are joint ventures.
The Group’s share of the results of associates and joint ventures is included in the Group income statement using the equity accounting 
method. Investments in associates and joint ventures are included in the Group balance sheet at cost, as adjusted for post-acquisition changes 
in the Group’s share of the net assets of the entity, and including any goodwill identiﬁ ed on acquisition, net of any accumulated impairment 
loss. When the Group’s shares of losses in an associate or joint venture equals or exceeds its interest in the associate or joint venture, including 
any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred obligations or made payments on behalf 
of the associate or joint venture. Unrealised gains on transactions between the Group and its associates are eliminated to the extent of the 
Group’s interest in the associates. Unrealised losses are also eliminated unless the transaction provided evidence of an impairment of the 
asset transferred.
Intangible assets – goodwill
Goodwill arising on an acquisition represents any excess of the fair value of the consideration given over the fair value of the identiﬁ able assets 
and liabilities acquired. Goodwill is recognised as an asset, and is reviewed for impairment at least annually. Any impairment is recognised 
immediately in the Group’s income statement and is not subsequently reversed. For the purposes of assessing impairment, assets are grouped 
at the lowest levels for which there are separately identiﬁ able cash ﬂ ows (cash-generating units). The allocation of goodwill is made to those 
cash-generating units that are expected to beneﬁ t from the business combination in which the goodwill arose. The Group allocates goodwill 
to each segment in which it operates.
On disposal of a subsidiary, joint venture or associate, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the determination of the proﬁ t or loss 
on disposal.
Intangible assets – other
Intangible assets, other than goodwill, are carried on the Group’s balance sheet at cost less accumulated amortisation. Intangible assets with 
indeﬁ nite useful lives are not amortised. For all other intangible assets, amortisation is charged on a straight-line basis over the asset’s useful 
life, as follows:
Brands 10 years to indeﬁ nite life
Customer relationships 1 to 15 years
Computer software 3 to 10 years
Other acquired intangible assets are assessed separately and useful lives established according to the particular circumstances.

Indeﬁ nite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are 
expected to generate net cash inﬂ ows. These are considered to have an indeﬁ nite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the 
level of marketing support. The nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common, if appropriately supported 
by advertising and marketing spend.
Intangible assets with indeﬁ nite useful lives are tested for impairment at least annually by comparing their carrying amount to their recoverable 
amount. All other intangible assets are assessed at each reporting date for indications of impairment. If such indications exist, the recoverable 
amount is estimated and compared to the carrying amount. If the recoverable amount is less than the carrying amount, the carrying amount is 
reduced to the recoverable amount and the impairment loss is recognised immediately in the income statement. 
Property, plant and equipment
Except for investment property, property, plant and equipment is stated at cost, net of straight-line depreciation and any provision for impairment. 
Where costs are incurred as part of the start-up or commissioning of an item of property, plant or equipment, and that item is available for 
use but incapable of operating in the manner intended by management without such a start-up or commissioning period, then such costs are 
included within the cost of the item. Costs that are not directly attributable to bringing an asset to the location and condition necessary for it 
to be capable of operating in the manner intended by management are charged to the income statement as incurred. 
Depreciation on property, plant and equipment, other than freehold land, upon which no depreciation is provided, is calculated on a straight-
line basis and aims to write down their cost to their estimated residual value over their expected useful lives as follows:
Freehold buildings 40 to 50 years 
Leasehold properties Shorter of remaining lease period and 40 years 
Aircraft 18 years (or remaining lease period if shorter) 
Aircraft spares 5 to 15 years (or remaining lease period if shorter) 
Other ﬁ xed assets 3 to 15 years
Estimated residual values and useful lives are reviewed annually.
Investment property comprises land and buildings which are held for long-term rental yields and capital growth. It is carried at fair value with 
changes in fair value recognised in the income statement. Investment property is valued annually by external qualiﬁ ed professional valuers in 
the countries concerned. In the event of a material change in market conditions between the valuation date and balance sheet date, an internal 
valuation is performed and adjustments made to reﬂ ect any material changes in fair value.
Non-current assets held for sale
The Group classiﬁ es non-current assets as held for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered principally through a sale transaction rather 
than through continuing use. To be classiﬁ ed as held for sale, the assets must be available for immediate sale in their present condition subject 
only to terms that are usual and customary for the sale of such assets, and their sale must be highly probable. Sale is considered to be highly 
probable when management are committed to a plan to sell the assets and an active programme to locate a buyer and complete the plan has 
been initiated at a price that is reasonable in relation to their current fair value, and there is an expectation that the sale will be completed 
within one year from the date of classiﬁ cation.
Non-current assets classiﬁ ed as held for sale are carried on the Group’s balance sheet at the lower of their carrying amount and fair value less 
costs to sell. 
Aircraft overhaul and maintenance costs
The cost of major overhauls of owned and ﬁ nance leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes is capitalised and then amortised over 
between two and ten years until the next scheduled major overhaul, except where the maintenance of engines and auxiliary power units is 
carried out under ﬁ xed rate contracts, in which case the cost is spread over the period of the contract. Provision is made for the future costs 
of major overhauls of operating leased engines, auxiliary power units and airframes by making appropriate charges to the income statement, 
calculated by reference to hours ﬂ own and/or the expired lease period, as a consequence of obligations placed upon the Group under the terms 
of certain operating leases. 
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost represents purchase price. Net realisable value represents the estimated 
selling price less all costs to be incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

Revenue recognition and associated costs
Revenue represents the aggregate amount of gross revenue receivable from inclusive tours, travel agency commissions receivable and other 
services supplied to customers in the ordinary course of business. Revenue and direct expenses relating to inclusive tours arranged by the Group’s 
leisure travel providers, including travel agency commission, insurance and other incentives, are taken to the income statement on holiday 
departure. Revenue relating to travel agency commission on third-party leisure travel products is also recognised on holiday departure. The costs 
attributable to producing brochures are expensed when the brochures are available to be sent to customers or retail outlets. Other revenue and 
associated expenses are taken to the income statement as earned or incurred. Revenue and expenses exclude intra-group transactions.
Income statement presentation and separately disclosed items
Proﬁ t or loss from operations includes the results from operating activities of the Group, before its share of the results of associates and 
joint ventures.
The Group separately discloses in the income statement: exceptional items; amortisation of business combination intangibles; and IAS 39 fair 
value re-measurement.
Exceptional items are items that are unusual because of their size, nature or incidence and which the Group’s management consider should be 
disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results.
Material business combination intangible assets were acquired as a result of the merger between Thomas Cook AG and MyTravel Group plc and 
other business combinations made in subsequent years. The amortisation of these intangible assets is signiﬁ cant and the Group’s management 
consider that it should be disclosed separately to enable a full understanding of the Group’s results.
IAS 39 fair value re-measurement includes movements in forward points related to foreign exchange forward contracts and time value of options 
in cash ﬂ ow hedging relationships. Both items are subject to market ﬂ uctuations and unwind when the options or forward contracts mature and 
therefore are not considered to be part of the Group’s underlying performance.
Finance income and costs
Finance income comprises interest income on funds invested, expected return on pension plan assets, changes in the fair value of held for 
trading interest-related derivatives and the movement in forward points on outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts in cash ﬂ ow 
hedging relationships.
Finance costs comprise interest costs on borrowings and ﬁ nance leases, unwind of the discount on provisions, interest cost on pension plan 
liabilities, changes in the fair value of held for trading interest-related derivatives and the movement in forward points on outstanding foreign 
exchange forward contracts in cash ﬂ ow hedging relationships. 
The movement in forward points on outstanding foreign exchange forward contracts in cash ﬂ ow hedging relationships is included as a separately 
disclosed item in the income statement under the description “IAS 39 fair value re-measurement”. 
Tax
Tax represents the sum of tax currently payable and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to an item 
recognised directly in equity, in which case the associated tax is also recognised directly in equity.
Tax currently payable is provided on taxable proﬁ ts based on the tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted at the 
balance sheet date. Provision is made for deferred tax so as to recognise all temporary differences which have originated but not reversed 
at the balance sheet date that result in an obligation to pay more tax, or a right to pay less tax, in the future, except as set out below. This is 
calculated on a non-discounted basis by reference to the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the relevant jurisdictions and for the 
periods in which the temporary differences are expected to reverse. The deferred tax is not accounted for if it arises from the initial recognition 
of an asset or liability in a transaction other than a business combination that at the time of the transaction does not affect either accounting 
or taxable proﬁ t or loss.
Deferred tax assets are assessed at each balance sheet date and are only recognised to the extent that their recovery against future taxable 
proﬁ ts is probable. Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for the temporary differences of overseas subsidiaries, joint ventures and associates 
unless the Group is able to control the timing of the distribution of those earnings and it is probable that they will not be distributed in the 
foreseeable future.

Pensions
Pension costs charged against proﬁ ts in respect of the Group’s deﬁ ned contribution schemes represent the amount of the contributions 
payable to the schemes in respect of the accounting period.  
The Group also operates a number of deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes. The pension liabilities recognised on the balance sheet in respect of these 
schemes represent the difference between the present value of the Group’s obligations under the schemes (calculated using the projected 
unit credit method) and the fair value of those schemes’ assets. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised in the period in which they arise within 
the statement of comprehensive income and expense. The current service cost, representing beneﬁ ts accruing over the year, is included in the 
income statement as a personnel expense. The unwinding of the discount rate on the scheme liabilities and the expected return on scheme 
assets are presented as ﬁ nance costs and ﬁ nance income respectively. Past service costs are recognised immediately in the income statement 
in personnel expenses.
Foreign currency
Average exchange rates are used to translate the results of all subsidiaries, associates and joint ventures that have a functional currency other 
than Sterling. The balance sheets of such entities are translated at period end exchange rates. The resulting exchange differences are recorded 
through a separate component of equity.
Transactions in currencies other than the functional currency of an entity are translated at the exchange rate at the date of the transaction. 
Foreign currency monetary assets and liabilities held at the period end are translated at period end exchange rates. The resulting exchange gain 
or loss is recorded in the income statement. 
When a foreign entity is partially disposed of or sold, exchange differences that were recorded in equity are recognised in the income statement 
as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Leases
Leases under which substantially all of the risk and rewards of ownership are transferred to the Group are ﬁ nance leases. All other leases 
are operating leases.
Assets held under ﬁ nance leases are recognised at the lower of the fair value of the asset and the present value of the minimum lease payments 
within property, plant and equipment on the balance sheet and depreciated over the shorter of the lease term or their expected useful lives. 
The interest element of ﬁ nance lease payments represents a constant proportion of the capital balance outstanding and is charged to the 
income statement over the period of the lease.
Operating lease rentals are charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the lease term.
Borrowing costs
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets requiring a 
substantial amount of time to be ready for the intended purpose.
Derivative ﬁ nancial instruments
Derivatives are recognised at their fair value. When a derivative does not qualify for hedge accounting as a cash ﬂ ow hedge, changes in fair 
value are recognised immediately in the income statement. When a derivative qualiﬁ es for hedge accounting as a cash ﬂ ow hedge, changes 
in fair value that are determined to be an effective hedge are recognised directly in the hedging reserve, except to the extent that it relates to 
movements in forward points on forward contracts and time value of options. Any ineffective portion of the change in fair value is recognised 
immediately in the income statement along with the forward points and time value. 
If a hedged transaction subsequently results in the recognition of a non-ﬁ nancial asset or a non-ﬁ nancial liability, the associated cumulative 
gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and is included in the initial cost or other carrying amount of the asset or liability. For all other 
cash ﬂ ow hedges, the associated cumulative gain or loss is removed from the hedging reserve and recognised in the income statement in the 
same period, or periods, during which the hedged forecast transaction affects the income statement.
When a derivative qualiﬁ es for hedge accounting as a fair value hedge, changes in fair value of the derivative are recognised in the income 
statement when the offsetting changes in the fair value of the hedged asset or liability, attributable to the hedged risk, occur.
Non-derivative ﬁ nancial instruments
Financial assets and liabilities are recognised when the Group becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets 
are derecognised when the Group transfers the ﬁ nancial asset or when the contractual rights expire. Financial liabilities are derecognised when 
the obligation is discharged, cancelled or expires. The measurement of particular ﬁ nancial assets and liabilities is set out below:
Trade and other receivables
Trade and other receivables are recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method 
as reduced by allowances for estimated irrecoverable amounts. An allowance for irrecoverable amounts is established when there is objective 
evidence that the Group will not be able to collect all amounts due according to the original terms of the receivables. The amount of allowance 
is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount and the present value of estimated future cash ﬂ ows.

2 Accounting policies continued
Available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets
Available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value. Gains or losses (except for impairment losses and
foreign exchange gains and losses) are recognised directly in equity until the ﬁ nancial asset is derecognised. At this point, the cumulative gain or 
loss previously recognised in equity is recognised in the income statement. Any impairment losses, foreign exchange gains or losses or dividends 
receivable are recognised in the income statement.
Held for trading investments
Short-term investments are classiﬁ ed as held for trading and are recognised and subsequently recorded at their fair value. Gains or losses are 
recognised in the income statement.
Other non-current asset investments 
The fair value of investments in equity instruments that do not have a quoted market price in an active market are measured using an 
appropriate valuation technique. Where a fair value cannot be reliably measured, the investment is measured at cost. Loans and receivables 
are initially recognised at fair value plus any directly attributable transaction costs and are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method. Any impairment losses are recognised in the income statement.
Trade and other payables
Trade and other payables are initially recognised at their fair value and subsequently recorded at amortised cost using the effective 
interest method.
Borrowings
Interest bearing borrowings are initially recognised at their fair value net of any directly attributable transaction costs. They are subsequently 
recorded at amortised cost using the effective interest method.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation as a result of a past event, if it is probable that an outﬂ ow of resources will 
be required to settle the obligation and a reliable estimate of the amount of the obligation can be made. 
Provisions are recognised at the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date. Where the 
effect of the time value of money is material, the provision is discounted to its present value. 
Termination beneﬁ ts
Termination beneﬁ ts are payable when employment is terminated by the Group before the normal retirement date, or whenever an employee 
accepts voluntary redundancy in exchange for these beneﬁ ts. The Group recognises termination beneﬁ ts when it is demonstrably committed 
to: either terminating the employment of current employees according to a detailed formal plan without possibility of withdrawal; or providing 
termination beneﬁ ts as a result of an offer made to encourage voluntary redundancy.
Share-based payments
The Group issues equity-settled share options to certain employees as part of their total remuneration. The fair values of the share options are 
calculated at the date of grant, using an appropriate option pricing model. These fair values are charged to the income statement on a straight-
line basis over the expected vesting period of the options, with a corresponding increase in equity.
Insurance contracts and reinsurance contracts
Premiums written relate to business incepted during the year, together with any differences between the booked premiums for prior years and 
those previously accrued, less cancellations. Premiums are recognised as revenue (earned premiums) proportionally over the period of coverage. 
Premiums are shown after the deduction of commission and premium taxes where relevant.
Claims and loss adjustment expenses are charged to the income statement as incurred based on the estimated liability for compensation owed 
to policyholders or third parties damaged by policyholders. The Group does not discount its liabilities for unpaid claims. Liabilities for unpaid 
claims are estimated using the input of assessments for individual cases reported to the Group and statistical analysis for the claims incurred 
but not reported.
Contracts entered into by the Group with reinsurers, under which the Group is compensated for losses on one or more contracts issued by the 
Group, and that meet the classiﬁ cation requirements for insurance contracts, are classiﬁ ed as reinsurance contracts held. The beneﬁ ts to which 
the Group is entitled under its reinsurance contracts held are recognised as receivables from reinsurers. The Group assesses its reinsurance assets 
for impairment on an annual basis.
Receivables and payables are recognised when due. These include amounts due to and from insurance policyholders.

Critical judgements in applying the Group’s accounting policies
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies, described above, management has made the following judgements that have 
the most signiﬁ cant effect on the amounts recognised in the ﬁ nancial statements.
Residual values of tangible ﬁ xed assets
Judgements have been made in respect of the residual values and useful economic lives of aircraft included in property, plant and equipment. 
Those judgements determine the amount of depreciation charged in the income statement.
Recoverable amounts of goodwill and intangible assets with an indeﬁ nite life
Judgements have been made in respect of the amounts of future operating cash ﬂ ows to be generated by certain of the Group’s businesses in 
order to assess whether there has been any impairment of the amounts included in the balance sheet for goodwill or intangible assets with an 
indeﬁ nite life in relation to those businesses.
Special purpose entities
The nature of the relationship with certain special purpose entities involved in leasing aircraft to the Group shows that they should be interpreted 
as controlled by the Group, and therefore consolidated, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
The key assumptions concerning the future and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date that have a signiﬁ cant 
risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next ﬁ nancial year are discussed below.
Impairment of goodwill and intangible assets with an indeﬁ nite life
Determining whether goodwill or intangible assets with an indeﬁ nite life are impaired requires an estimation of the value in use of the 
cash-generating units to which goodwill has been allocated. The value in use calculation requires the Group to estimate the future cash ﬂ ows 
expected to arise from the cash-generating unit at a suitable discount rate in order to calculate present value. 
Recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments
Estimates have been made in respect of the volumes of future trading with hoteliers and the credit-worthiness of those hoteliers in order to 
assess the recoverable amounts of deposits and prepayments made to those hoteliers.
Aircraft maintenance provisions
Provisions for the cost of maintaining leased aircraft and spares are based on forecast aircraft utilisation, estimates of future maintenance 
costs and planned rollover and renewal of the aircraft ﬂ eet.
Tax
The Group operates in many tax regimes and the tax implications of its operations are complex. It can take several years for tax liabilities to be 
agreed with the relevant authorities. Tax assets and liabilities represent management’s estimates of tax that will be payable or recoverable in the 
future and may be dependent on estimates of future proﬁ tability.
In addition, estimates have been made in respect of the probable future utilisation of tax losses, and deferred tax assets have been recognised 
as a result. The recoverability of these assets is dependent on the agreement of the losses with the relevant authorities and the estimates of 
future proﬁ tability.
Retirement beneﬁ ts
The consolidated ﬁ nancial statements include costs in relation to, and provision for, retirement beneﬁ t obligations. The costs and the present 
value of any related pension assets and liabilities depend on such factors as life expectancy of the members, the salary progression of current 
employees, the returns that plan assets generate and the discount rate used to calculate the present value of the liabilities. The Group uses 
previous experience and impartial actuarial advice to select the values of critical estimates. The estimates, and the effect of variances in key 
estimates, are disclosed in note 35.

3 Segmental information
For management purposes, the Group is currently organised into six geographic operating divisions: UK, Central Europe, West & East Europe, 
Northern Europe, North America and Airlines Germany. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment 
information. Certain residual businesses and corporate functions are not allocated to these divisions and are shown separately as Corporate. 
The primary business of all of these operating divisions is the provision of leisure travel services and, accordingly, no separate secondary 
segmental information is provided.
Segmental information for these activities is presented below:

The direct costs associated with the volcanic ash cloud in April 2010 amounted to £52.9m and included additional accommodation and 
subsistence costs for customers stranded in resort and the costs of customer repatriation when the airspace was eventually re-opened.
The £35.4m (2009: £112.8m) relates to the integration of acquisitions and other restructuring projects that have been undertaken across the 
Thomas Cook Group. The restructuring projects largely reﬂ ect changes made to underlying business processes and systems in the UK, Germany, 
the Western Europe markets and Canada to improve efﬁ ciency and cost leadership across the Group.
The £26.0m asset impairment and onerous lease provisions in Hi Hotels relates to the long-term hotel operating leases within Hi Hotels 
(acquired as part of the MyTravel Group), which were entered into at a time when market conditions in the Spanish holiday destinations 
were very favourable. The emergence of alternative holiday destinations, the strong Euro and the global recession have resulted in signiﬁ cant 
margin pressure in the Spanish destinations such that many of the leases are now considered to be onerous. We continue to pursue arbitration 
proceedings with the owner of the hotels which will potentially result in a reduction in the hotel rental costs. However, it remains too early to 
predict whether these proceedings will be successful. Of the £26.0m, £14.8m relates to ﬁ xed assets impairment and is disclosed in note 13.
On 31 March 2010, Skyservice, a Canadian airline that provided ﬂ ying capacity to our Canadian tour operator was placed in court-appointed 
receivership. As a result of the collapse of Skyservice, we suffered signiﬁ cant disruption to our ﬂ ying programme in April, the last month of 
the high season for our Canadian tour operator. The direct costs of the disruption, together with the write down of certain receivables from 
Skyservice, amounted to £15.3m.
The run-off of fuel-related exceptional items amounted to £23.3m (2009: £20.7m). These items were speciﬁ c to our fuel hedging for 2009 
and 2010 and, as such, are not expected to recur in future years.
Other exceptional operating items of £7.7m (2009: £21.9m) include acquisition costs and losses resulting from other exceptional operating 
events that are not expected to recur in future years.

at 28% (2009: 28%) of the estimated assessable proﬁ t for the year. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in the 
respective jurisdictions.
Surplus losses not recognised in deferred tax of £888.2m (2009: £679.9m) are available in the UK and Germany for offset against future proﬁ ts.

Final dividend paid for 2009 of 7p per share (2008: 6.5p) 59.7 55.8 
Interim dividend for 2010 of 3.75p per share (2009: 3.75p) 32.0 31.6 
91.7 87.4 
The interim dividend for 2010 was paid to shareholders in October 2010.
Subsequent to the balance sheet date, the Directors have proposed a ﬁ nal dividend in respect of the year ended 30 September 2010 of 7p per 
share which, subject to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting, will be paid on 7 April 2011, to holders of relevant shares 
registered on 18 March 2011. The ﬁ nal proposed dividend amounts to £59.8m and will, subject to shareholder approval, be recognised in the 
consolidated ﬁ nancial statements for the year ending 30 September 2011. The ﬁ nal dividend of 7p per share, together with the interim dividend 
of 3.75p per share, makes a total dividend of 10.75p per share relating to the year ended 30 September 2010.

potentially dilutive. The remainder of the share schemes will be satisﬁ ed by the purchase of existing shares in the market and will therefore not result in any dilution of earnings 
per share.

In accordance with accounting standards, the Group annually tests the carrying value of goodwill for impairment. At 30 September 2010, the 
review was undertaken on a value in use basis, assessing whether the carrying value of goodwill was supported by the net present value of 
future cash ﬂ ows derived from those assets, using cash ﬂ ow projections discounted at pre-tax rate of 10% to 12%  (2009: 9% to 13%) and 10% 
(2009: 9% to 10%) for the UK and other segments respectively, reﬂ ecting speciﬁ c risks relating to the relevant cash-generating units. The UK 
segment includes India and Egypt, which are discounted at a higher rate than the remainder of the UK segment.
The key assumptions used in the value in use calculations are those regarding the discount rates, revenue and cost growth rates and the level of 
capital expenditure required during the year. The Group prepares cash ﬂ ow forecasts derived from the most recently approved annual budgets 
and three year plans of the relevant businesses. The cash ﬂ ow forecasts reﬂ ect the risk associated with each asset. Cash ﬂ ow forecasts for years 
beyond the three year plan period are extrapolated based on estimated growth rates which do not exceed the average long-term growth rates 
for the relevant markets.
There were no impairment losses recognised on goodwill during the year (2009: £nil) and no reasonable change to the assumptions would lead 
to a material impairment.

The initial valuation of business combination intangibles is based on applicable projected future cash ﬂ ows discounted at an appropriate 
discount rate. Customer relationships are being amortised over periods of 1 to 15 years and computer software over a period of 4 years. Order 
backlog has been amortised over the period from acquisition to departure. Other includes fair value attributed to a foreign exchange licence 
from the acquisition of Thomas Cook India, which is being amortised over 25 years.
Indeﬁ nite-lived intangible assets principally comprise those trademarks for which there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which they are  
expected to generate net cash inﬂ ows. These are considered to have an indeﬁ nite life, given the strength and durability of our brands and the 
level of marketing support. The nature of the industry we operate in is such that brand obsolescence is not common if appropriately supported 
by advertising and marketing spend. The Group annually tests the carrying value of indeﬁ nite-lived intangibles for impairment on a value in use 
basis consistent with that disclosed for goodwill earlier in this note.
The carrying value of brands with an indeﬁ nite life is analysed by business segment as follows:

During the year, the Group reversed impairment losses of £2.9m in respect of its 25% interest in Hotelera Adeje S.L. and recognised impairment 
losses of £0.9m in respect of its 25% interest in COPLAY 95 S.L, both hotel companies. The net impairment reversal of £2.0m has been included 
in “Share of results of associates and joint venture” in the income statement.

The ﬁ nancial statements of the associates are made up to 31 December each year, being their ﬁ nancial reporting date. For the purposes of 
applying the equity method of accounting for 2010, the ﬁ nancial statements of these undertakings for the year ended 31 December 2009 have 
been used together with management accounts for the period from 1 January 2010 to 30 September 2010.
Other investments
Available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets include £3.7m in respect of a 24.9% interest in Aldiana GmbH, a German tour operator. During the year, the 
Group recognised an impairment loss of £1.7m on its investment in Aldiana. This is shown in Net Investment Income in the income statement. 
Aldiana is not accounted for under the equity method as the Group does not have signiﬁ cant inﬂ uence over its activities. 
During the year ended 30 September 2010, the Group recognised interest on other ﬁ xed asset investments of £0.2m (2009: £1.4m). There is no 
active market for the available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets, consequently they are recorded at cost.
Loans and receivables of £13.9m are in respect of the Group’s investment, as a member of Airline Group, in the UK National Air Trafﬁ c Services 
(NATS). The investment comprises ordinary shares accruing interest at 8% in the Airline Group.

15 Subsidiaries and acquisitions
A list of the signiﬁ cant investments in subsidiaries, including the name, country of incorporation and proportion of ownership interest, is given 
in note 17 to the Company’s separate ﬁ nancial statements. All of the subsidiary undertakings have been consolidated in the Group accounts.
Interpretation guidance included within SIC Interpretation 12 ‘Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities’ indicates that certain special purpose 
entities (SPEs), which are involved in aircraft leasing arrangements with the Group, should be interpreted as being controlled by the Group, 
and therefore subject to consolidation, even though the Group has no direct or indirect equity interest in those entities. As a consequence, 
the Group has consolidated three (2009: three) SPEs that own four (2009: four) aircraft operated by the Group on operating leases. In addition, 
during the prior year the operations of the German airline were placed in a holding company in which the Group owns a 50.0023% direct 
interest. All risks and rewards continue to be held by the Group and, in accordance with accounting standards, the entity has been treated 
as being 100% controlled and fully consolidated by the Group.
Acquisitions made during the year
During the year, the Group concluded two acquisitions, as follows: 
• 30 April 2010, 100% of Think W3 Ltd (trading as Essential Travel); and 
• 5 July 2010, the remaining 51% of Thomas Cook Services (Cyprus) Ltd, a business formerly accounted for as an associate.
Details of the net assets acquired are set out in the table below:

The purchase price of each asset component of the acquisition represents its provisional fair value, based on management’s best estimates. 
The amount indicated above for trade and other receivables represents the fair value of the acquired receivables and is equal to the gross 
contractual cash ﬂ ows, all of which is expected to be recoverable.
The acquired businesses contributed revenue of £1.5m and net proﬁ t of £0.6m to the Group for the period from acquisition to 30 September 2010.
If the acquisitions had occurred on 1 October 2009, they would have contributed £2.9m to consolidated revenue and £1.2m to consolidated 
net proﬁ t.
The provisional goodwill of £15.2m reﬂ ects anticipated beneﬁ ts from gaining control of the Thomas Cook brand in Cyprus and increased market 
share in the case of Essential Travel.
Changes to the prior period acquisitions 
Triwest
During the year, management reassessed the contingent consideration attributable to the Triwest Travel Holdings Limited acquisition based on 
the ﬁ nancial performance during the year. This has resulted in a £1.5m reduction in contingent consideration and goodwill.
Gold Medal
During the year, the fair value adjustments related to the Gold Medal acquisition were ﬁ nalised and the contingent and deferred consideration 
was amended for changes in the expected timing and amount of cash ﬂ ows. As these changes have been made within 12 months of the 
acquisition date, in accordance with IFRS 3 (issued 2004) ‘Business Combinations’, the fair value adjustments and the adjustments to the 
contingent and deferred consideration have been recognised from the date of acquisition and the comparative ﬁ gures have been restated.

Notes to the ﬁ nancial statements continued
17 Trade and other receivables continued 
The average credit period taken on invoicing of leisure travel services is 13 days (2009: 14 days). No interest is charged on the receivables. The 
credit risk in respect of direct receivables from customers is limited as payment is required in full before the services are provided. In the case 
of travel services sold by third-party agents, the credit risk depends on the creditworthiness of those third parties, but this risk is also limited 
because of the relatively short period of credit.
Deposits and prepayments include amounts paid in advance to suppliers of hotel and other services in order to guarantee the provision of those 
supplies. The Group’s current policy is that deposits and prepayments will normally be made for periods of up to two years in advance. There 
is a credit risk in respect of the continued operation of those suppliers during those periods. Deposits and prepayments also include £47.5m 
(2009: £65.0m) of deposits on aircraft lease arrangements which are primarily attributable to the UK airline.
Securities include money market securities amounting to £2.7m (2009: £4.0m) purchased as collateral against liabilities arising from part-time 
retirement contracts at Thomas Cook AG, which are classiﬁ ed as available-for-sale ﬁ nancial assets.
The amounts presented in the balance sheet are net of allowances for doubtful receivables. An allowance for impairment is made where there 
is an identiﬁ ed loss event which, based on previous experience, is evidence of a reduction in the recoverability of the cash ﬂ ows.
Allowances for doubtful debts in respect of trade receivable balances are managed in the business units where the debts arise and are based 
on local management experience. Factors that are considered include the age of the debt, previous experience with the counterparty and local 
trading conditions. Trade receivables arise from individual customers as well as businesses in the travel sector. The Directors do not consider 
there to be signiﬁ cant concentration of credit risk relating to trade and other receivables.

Included within the above balance are the following amounts considered to be restricted: 
• £46.3m (2009: £46.2m) held within escrow accounts in Canada, Switzerland and the UK in respect of local regulatory requirements;
• £17.1m (2009: £13.6m) of cash held by White Horse Insurance Ireland Limited, the Group’s captive insurance company; and
• £11.1m (2009: £5.7m) of cash held in countries where exchange control restrictions are in force (India, Egypt, Tunisia and Morocco), 
net of cash available to repay local debt in those countries.
The Directors consider that the carrying amounts of these assets approximate to their fair value.

In April 2010, the Group issued a €400m bond with an annual coupon of 6.75% maturing in June 2015 and a £300m bond with an annual 
coupon of 7.75% maturing in June 2017. Proceeds of these issues were used to repay debt drawn under the existing bank facilities.
In May 2010, the Group entered into a new committed bank facilities agreement with a number of banks, totalling £1,050m maturing in 
May 2013. The previous bank facilities were cancelled. The new facilities comprise a £200 million term loan, repayable in annual instalments 
of £50m commencing October 2011, and a revolving credit facility of £850 million. As at September 2010, the £200m term loan was drawn 
down and £4.2m was drawn under the revolving credit facility.
The Directors consider that the fair value of the Group’s borrowings with a carrying value of £1,062.7m is £1,081.6m (2009: carrying value 
£940.0m; fair value £943.9m). The fair values quoted were determined on the basis of the interest rates for the corresponding terms to maturity 
or repayment as at the year end. For items maturing in less than one year, the Directors feel that the fair value is equal to the carrying amount.
Borrowing facilities
As at 30 September 2010, the Group had undrawn committed debt facilities of £846m (2009: £374m). Whilst these facilities have certain 
ﬁ nancial covenants they are not expected to prevent full utilisation of the facilities if required. The Group has complied with its covenants 
throughout the year.

(2009: carrying value £285.5m; fair value £294.5m). The fair values quoted were determined on the basis of the interest rates for the corresponding 
terms to repayment as at the year end.
The Group’s obligations under ﬁ nance leases are secured by the lessors’ rights over the leased assets.

22 Financial instruments continued 
The Group uses derivative instruments to hedge against signiﬁ cant future transactions and cash ﬂ ows denominated in foreign currencies. 
The Group enters into a variety of foreign currency forward contracts and options in the management of its exchange rate exposures.
Currency hedges are entered into between 12 to 24 months in advance of a tourist season and denominated in the underlying exposure currencies. 
The Group undertakes hedging transactions to mitigate the risk of unfavourable changes in the prices. As at 30 September 2010, the Group 
had in place hedging transactions for fuel out to April 2012.
The Group is also subject to risks arising from interest rate movements in connection with the ﬁ nancing of aircraft and other assets. Interest rate 
swaps and cross currency interest rate swaps are designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges of the interest rate and the Euro, US Dollar and Sterling currency 
risk on such borrowings. The Group also holds a collar which is designated as held for trading. Cross currency interest rate swaps are reported 
within interest rate derivatives. The maturities of interest rate derivatives extend out to February 2017.
The fair values of the Group’s derivative ﬁ nancial instruments set out above have been determined by reference to prices available from the 
markets in which the instruments are traded.
During the year, a loss of £69.4m (2009 restated: £42.6m gain) was transferred from the hedging reserve to the income statement following 
recognition of the hedged transactions. The amount included in each line item in the income statement is shown below. In addition, a 
gain of £7.3m was recognised in the income statement in respect of the forward points on foreign exchange cash ﬂ ow hedging contracts 
(2009: £21.4m gain) and a gain of £2.0m in respect of the movement in the time value of options in cash ﬂ ow hedging relationships 
(2009: £8.1m loss).

23 Financial risk
The Group is subject to risks related to changes in interest rates, exchange rates, fuel prices, counterparty credit and liquidity within the 
framework of its business operations. 
Interest rate risk
The Group is subject to risks arising from interest rate movements in connection with its bank debt, aircraft ﬁ nancing and cash investments. 
Interest rate swaps and interest rate collars are used to manage these risks and are usually designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges of the interest rate.
Currency risk
The Group has activities in a large number of countries and is therefore subject to the risk of exchange rate ﬂ uctuations. Currency risks arise in 
connection with the sourcing of services from destinations outside the source market. In addition, US Dollar exposure arises on the procurement 
of fuel and operating supplies for aircraft, as well as investments in aircraft.
The Group requires subsidiaries to identify and appropriately hedge all trading exposures in line with established policies.
The Group uses currency forwards, currency swaps and plain vanilla currency options to manage currency risks and these are usually designated 
as cash ﬂ ow hedges of forecast future transactions.
Fuel price risk
Exposure to fuel price risk arises due to ﬂ ying costs for the Group’s aircraft. Commodity derivatives are entered into to manage the risk of adverse 
changes in the price of fuel. The Group’s policy is to hedge a minimum of 80% of the fuel requirement for the ﬂ ight schedule concerned, with a 
maximum hedge tenor of 24 months prior to consumption. Hedging is implemented with a combination of ﬁ xed price contracts (swaps) and net 
purchased options and are usually designated as cash ﬂ ow hedges.
The market risks that the Group is subject to have been identiﬁ ed as interest rate risk, exchange rate risk and fuel price risk. The impact 
of reasonably possible changes in these risk variables on the Group, based on the period end holdings of ﬁ nancial instruments have been 
calculated and are set out in the tables below. In each case it has been assumed that all other variables remain constant. As at 30 September 
2010, the sensitivity of these risks to the deﬁ ned scenario changes are set out below:

Liquidity risk
The liquidity position of the Group is signiﬁ cantly inﬂ uenced by the booking and payment pattern of customers. As a result, liquidity is at its 
lowest in the winter months and at its highest in the summer months. The Group manages the seasonal nature of its liquidity by making use 
of its bank revolving credit facility.
Short-term liquidity is primarily invested in bank deposits.
Financial liabilities are analysed below based on the time between the period end and their contractual maturity. The amounts shown are 
estimates of the undiscounted future cash ﬂ ows and will differ from both carrying value and fair value.

Estimated undiscounted future cash ﬂ ows are disclosed above in respect of derivatives with a negative fair value at the year end. These cash 
ﬂ ows include amounts in respect of fuel derivatives which are based on the year end fair values. Estimated cash ﬂ ows relating to fuel option 
derivatives have all been reported in the “amount due in less than three months” category. Trade and other payables include non-ﬁ nancial 
liabilities of £208.2m (2009: £186.8m) which have not been analysed above.
Counterparty credit risk
The Group is exposed to credit risk in relation to deposits, derivatives with a positive fair value and trade and other receivables. The maximum 
exposure in respect of each of these items at the balance sheet date is their carrying value. The Group assesses its counterparty exposure in 
relation to the investment of surplus cash, fuel contracts, foreign exchange and interest rate hedging contracts and undrawn credit facilities. 
The Group uses published credit ratings, credit default swap prices and share price performance in the previous 30-day period to assess 
counterparty strength and therefore to deﬁ ne the credit limit for each counterparty. 
The Group’s approach to credit risk in respect of trade and other receivables is explained in Note 17.

24 Insurance
Management of insurance risk
Incidental to its main business, the Group, through its subsidiary White Horse Insurance Ireland Limited, issues contracts that transfer signiﬁ cant 
insurance risk and that are classiﬁ ed as insurance contracts. As a general guideline, the Group deﬁ nes as signiﬁ cant insurance risk, the possibility 
of having to compensate the policyholder if a speciﬁ ed uncertain future event adversely affects the policyholder.
Business written includes standard commercial risks for the Group and travel insurance for both Group and non-Group customers.
The principal nature of travel insurance risks is one of short-term, low value and high volume. Underwriting performance is monitored on 
an ongoing basis and pricing reviewed annually for each individual contract. Exposure is capped by speciﬁ c limits within the insurance policy 
and by using reinsurance contracts for any claims in excess of these retention limits. Commercial policies with the Group are subject to policy 
excesses and single event and aggregate limits.
Insurance risk is spread across several European countries where the Group operates including the UK, Ireland and Continental Europe.
When estimating the cost of claims outstanding at the year end, the principal assumption underlying the estimates is the Group’s past 
development pattern. This includes assumptions in respect of historic claims costs, average claims handling expenses and market developments. 
The Group also uses an independent actuary to review its liabilities to ensure that the carrying values are adequate. Any changes to these 
variables are not expected to have a material effect on the Group ﬁ nancial statements.
The Group operates a reinsurance policy approved by the White Horse Insurance Ireland Ltd Board of Directors which ensures that reinsurers 
have a ﬁ nancial stability rating of B+ (A M Best) or above. The Group has assessed these credit ratings as being satisfactory in diminishing the 
Group’s exposure to the credit risk of its insurance receivables.

At the balance sheet date, the Group had unused tax losses of £1,820m (2009: £1,441m) available for offset against future proﬁ ts. Deferred tax 
assets have only been recognised where there is sufﬁ cient probability that there will be future taxable proﬁ ts against which the assets may be 
recovered. The increase in recognised tax losses in the year relates to non-recurring exceptional costs. The UK and German businesses generated 
taxable proﬁ ts before exceptional items which support the recognition of losses in these territories. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in 
respect of tax losses of £888.2m (2009: £679.9m) due to the unpredictability of future proﬁ t streams.
Other temporary differences on which deferred tax has been provided primarily relate to the difference in book to tax value on qualifying 
tax assets, provisions for which tax relief was not originally available, and fair value accounting on properties acquired as part of the merger.
In addition, the Group had unused other temporary differences in respect of which no deferred tax asset has been recognised amounting 
to £186.1m (2009: £59.0m), also due to the unpredictability of future proﬁ t streams. 
Deferred tax liabilities were offset against the corresponding deferred tax assets where both items fell within the responsibility of the same 
tax authority.
The deferred tax assets and liabilities at the year end, without taking into consideration the offsetting balances within the same jurisdiction 
are £458.9m and £163.9m respectively. 
The Finance Act 2009 introduced new rules in relation to the UK taxation of dividend income. Under the new rules, no UK tax liability is 
expected to arise on the dividend income from undistributed proﬁ ts of subsidiaries. The new rules were effective from 1 July 2009. As a 
result, no deferred tax liability is expected on the undistributed proﬁ ts of subsidiaries at the balance sheet date (2009: nil).
A number of changes to the UK corporation tax system were announced in the June 2010 Budget Statement. The Finance (No 2) Act 2010 
included legislation to reduce the main rate of corporation tax from 28% to 27% from 1 April 2011 and the effect of this change has been 
to reduce the deferred tax assets by £8.6m as at 30 September 2010.
The proposed reduction of the main rate of corporation tax in the UK by 1% per year to 24% by 1 April 2014 are expected to be enacted separately 
each year. The overall effect of the further changes from 27% to 24%, if these applied to the deferred tax balance at 30 September 2010, would be 
to reduce the deferred tax asset by approximately £25.2m.

The aircraft maintenance provisions relate to maintenance on leased aircraft and spares used by the Group’s airlines in respect of leases which 
include contractual return conditions. This expenditure arises at different times over the life of the aircraft with major overhauls typically 
occurring between two and ten years (see accounting policies for more details).
Other provisions relate to provisions for off-market leases, onerous contracts, deferred and contingent consideration and future obligations, 
including those arising as a result of reorganisation and restructuring plans that are irrevocably committed, including severance payments 
and provisions for social security compensation plans.
Provisions included in non-current liabilities are principally off-market lease provisions, that are expected to be utilised over the term of 
those contracts which extend up to ten years from the balance sheet date, and deferred and contingent consideration arising on acquisitions.
During the year, £22.1m of deferred and contingent consideration on the Gold Medal acquisition was converted to a loan note, and has 
accordingly been reclassiﬁ ed to borrowings.
The unused amounts released in the year of £31.0m includes £11.7m of maintenance reserves in Northern Europe following the acquisition 
of two aircraft which were previously accounted for as operating leases. This release has been treated as an exceptional item in the 
income statement.
27 Non-current assets classiﬁ ed as held for sale
In the prior year the Group gained legal title to a hotel property in Mexico as settlement of an outstanding loan for CAD 16.6m. The carrying 
amount at 30 September 2010 is £10.5m (2009: £9.1m). This property is being actively marketed for sale and is expected to be disposed of 
within the next ﬁ nancial year and has therefore been classiﬁ ed as held for sale.

As at 30 September 2010, options to subscribe for ordinary shares were outstanding with respect to the Thomas Cook Group plc 2007 
Performance Share Plan, the Thomas Cook Group plc 2008 Co-Investment Plan and the Thomas Cook Group plc 2008 Save As You Earn Scheme. 
For further details refer to note 34. On exercise, the awards of shares under the plan will be satisﬁ ed by either purchases in the market of 
existing shares or, subject to institutional guidelines, issuing new shares.
Own shares held in trust
Shares of the Company are held under trust by EES Trustees International Limited in respect of the Thomas Cook Group plc 2007 Performance 
Share Plan and the Thomas Cook Group plc 2008 Co-Investment Plan and are held by Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited in connection with 
the Thomas Cook Group plc Buy As You Earn Scheme. In accordance with IFRS, these are treated as Treasury Shares and are included in “other 
reserves” in the balance sheet. 
The number of shares held at 30 September 2010 by EES Trustees International Limited and Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited was 4,282,801 
(2009: 5,090,822) and 69,602 (2009: 37,963) respectively. The cumulative cost of acquisition of these shares was £13.3m (2009: £13.1m) and the 
market value at 30 September 2010 was £7.5m (2009: £11.9m). Shares held by the trust have been excluded from the weighted average number 
of shares used in the calculation of earnings per share.
Share buy back
In the prior year the Group purchased 12,934,387 shares for cancellation. No shares were acquired in the year ended 30 September 2010.
Capital management
The Group’s objectives when managing capital are to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern in order to provide returns 
for shareholders and beneﬁ ts for other stakeholders and to maintain an optimal capital structure to reduce the cost of capital.
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital to 
shareholders, sell assets to reduce debt or issue new shares.
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt, cash and cash equivalents (as shown in note 31) and equity attributable to equity holders of 
the parent (as shown in the Group balance sheet). At the balance sheet date the Group had total capital of £2,522.2m (2009 restated: £2,376.0m).

Contingent liabilities 118.8 136.1
Contingent liabilities primarily comprise guarantees, letters of credit and other contingent liabilities, including contingent liabilities related 
to structured aircraft leases, all of which arise in the ordinary course of business. The amounts disclosed above represents the Group’s 
contractual exposure.
The Group complies with all the standards relevant to consumer protection and formal requirements in respect of package tour contracts and 
has all the necessary licences for the various sales markets. The customers’ right to reimbursement of the return travel costs and amounts paid 
in case of insolvency or bankruptcy on the part of the tour operator or travel agency is guaranteed in all Thomas Cook sales markets in line 
with local legislation and within the various guarantee systems applied. In the United Kingdom, there is a fund mechanism whereby travel 
companies are required to collect and remit a small charge for each protected customer upon booking. Customer rights in relation to Thomas 
Cook Group in Germany, Belgium and Austria are guaranteed via an insolvency insurance system, in Ireland, Scandinavia and France via

34 Share-based payments
The Company operates ﬁ ve equity-settled share-based payment schemes, as outlined below. The total expense recognised during the year 
in respect of equity-settled share-based payment transactions was £8.1m (2009: £8.3m).
The Thomas Cook Group plc 2007 Performance Share Plan (PSP) and the HM Revenue & Customs Approved Company Share Option
Sub-Plan (CSOSP)
Executive Directors and senior executives of the Company and its subsidiaries are granted nil-cost options to acquire, or contingent share
awards over, the ordinary shares of the Company. Each award will vest three years after the date of award, to the extent the performance 
targets have been met. The performance targets for each award are based on adjusted earnings per share (EPS) and total shareholder return 
(TSR). Subject to the performance targets being met and the participant still being employed by the Group, the options are exercisable up 
to ten years after the date of grant.
The Thomas Cook Group plc 2008 Co-Investment Plan (COIP)
Executive Directors and key executives purchase the Company’s shares out of their net bonus (Lodged Shares). Participants may, at the end of 
the three-year performance period, receive 3.5 Matching Shares (awarded as nil-cost options or contingent share awards) for each Lodged Share 
purchased, subject to the achievement of the performance targets. The performance targets for awards made in 2008 and 2009 are based on 
adjusted EPS and Return On Invested Capital (ROIC). The performance targets for the 2010 awards are based on adjusted EPS, TSR and ROIC. 
Subject to the performance targets being met and the participant still being employed by the Group, the options are exercisable up to ten 
years after the date of grant.
The Thomas Cook Group plc 2008 Save As You Earn Scheme (SAYE)
Eligible employees across the Group were offered options to purchase shares in the Company by entering into a three or four-year savings 
contract. The option exercise price was set at a 10% (2010 grant) or 20% (2008 grant) discount to the market price at the offer date. Options 
are exercisable during the six months after the end of the savings contract.
The Thomas Cook Group plc 2008 HM Revenue & Customs Approved Buy As You Earn Scheme (BAYE)
Eligible UK tax-paying employees are offered the opportunity to purchase shares (Partnership Shares) in the Company by deduction from their 
monthly gross pay. For every ten Partnership Shares an employee purchases, the Company purchases one Matching Share on their behalf. Both 
Partnership and Matching Shares are held by Equiniti Share Plan Trustees Limited. ‘As at 30 September 2010, 69,604 (2009: 37,963) Matching 
Shares were held by the Trustee.

35 Retirement beneﬁ t schemes
Pension schemes for the employees of the Thomas Cook Group consist of deﬁ ned contribution plans and deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans, with the deﬁ ned 
beneﬁ t plans being both funded and unfunded. The obligations arising from deﬁ ned contribution plans are satisﬁ ed by contribution payments 
to both private and state-run insurance providers.
Unfunded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension obligations
Unfunded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension obligations primarily relate to the Group’s employees in the German businesses of Thomas Cook AG and the 
Condor Group. Provisions are established on the basis of commitments made to those employees for old-age and transitional pensions based 
on the legal, tax and economic circumstances of the individual countries and on the period of employment and level of remuneration of the 
respective employees.
Provisions for pensions and similar obligations totalling £205.6m (2009: £179.0m) were attributable to the pension commitments of the Condor 
Group (Condor Flugdienst GmbH and Condor Berlin GmbH). For employees who joined a Condor Group company prior to 1995, the total pension 
commitment of the pensions authority of the German federal government and regional states was adjusted and maintained in the form of a 
company pension scheme. 
The ﬂ ight crews were additionally entitled to a transitional provision for the period between the termination of their in-ﬂ ight employment and 
the time they became eligible for a state-run or company pension. In both cases, the beneﬁ t commitment depended on the ﬁ nal salaries of the 
employees concerned prior to the termination of their in-ﬂ ight employment (ﬁ nal salary plan). Employees who joined a Condor Group company 
from 1995 onwards participate in a company pension scheme under which the pension entitlements are based on the average salaries of those 
employees (average salary plan). The Condor Group also has retirement obligations arising from individual commitments and transitional 
provisions. In accordance with IAS 19, all these commitments are classiﬁ ed as unfunded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligations and classiﬁ ed as such 
in these ﬁ nancial statements.
The Condor Group deﬁ ned beneﬁ t plans have been closed to new entrants (with the exception of pilots) since 2004.
There are additional unfunded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligations comprising individual commitments to executive staff at Thomas Cook Group 
and obligations in respect of past service for employees in Sweden.
The unfunded pension schemes are accounted for as part of liabilities for retirement beneﬁ t obligations in the balance sheet.

The mortality tables 2005 G drawn up by Prof. Dr. Klaus Heubeck were used as the basis for the mortality assumptions used in arriving at the 
present value of the pension obligations at 30 September 2010. These assume a life expectancy for members currently aged 60 of 22.9 years 
for men and 27.4 years for women.

Funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension obligations
The pension entitlements of employees of Thomas Cook UK and employees in Norway are provided through funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t schemes, 
where pension contributions are paid over to the schemes and the assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the Group in funds 
under the control of trustees. Pension costs are assessed in accordance with the advice of qualiﬁ ed actuaries in each country. The fair value 
of the pension assets in each scheme at the year end is compared with the present value of the retirement beneﬁ t obligations and the net 
difference reported as a pension asset or retirement beneﬁ t obligation as appropriate. Pension assets are only recognised to the extent that 
they will result in reimbursements being made or future payments being reduced.
Funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t pension obligations have been determined on the basis of assumptions relevant to each country. The weighted averages 
of these were:
2010
%
2009
%
Discount rate for scheme liabilities 4.97% 5.49%
Inﬂ ation rate 3.20% 3.48%
Expected return on scheme assets 6.07% 6.53%
Expected rate of salary increases 4.68% 4.72%
Future pension increases 3.20% 3.48%
The Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan accounts for approximately 97% (2009: 98%) of the total funded deﬁ ned beneﬁ t obligations. The mortality 
assumptions used in arriving at the present value of those obligations at 30 September 2010 are based on PXA92 (year of birth) tables with 
medium cohort improvements and a minimum future longevity improvement per year of 1%, adjusted for recent mortality experience. The 
mortality assumptions adopted for the plan liabilities indicate a further life expectancy for members currently aged 60 of 27.5 years for men 
and 28.8 years for women. 
The Thomas Cook UK Pension Plan has been closed to new entrants since April 2003. Employees who have joined since that date participate in 
a new deﬁ ned contribution scheme.

2010 (2009: £17.4m), and will make quarterly payments during the 3 years thereafter totalling £68.5m, with the last payment from the Company

Öger Tours
On 1 October 2010, the acquisition of Öger Tours GmbH was concluded after receiving antitrust clearance from the European Commission. Öger Tours 
specialises in the sale of package holidays to Turkey from Germany and was acquired for approximately €20m, consisting of cash consideration and 
liabilities assumed. As the acquisition was concluded recently it is not practical to provide a breakdown of net assets to be acquired.
The Co-operative Travel
On 8 October 2010, the Group announced that it will merge its UK high street travel agency and foreign exchange business with that of The 
Co-operative Group. On 29 October 2010, the Group signed an agreement under which Midlands Co-operative Society will also contribute its 
travel agency business. The Group will hold 66.5% of the new company, The Co-operative Group will hold 30% and Midlands Co-operative 
Society will hold 3.5%. Both transactions are subject to anti-trust clearance and certain other conditions. Given that the transactions have not 
yet completed, it is not practical to provide a breakdown of the net assets to be acquired.
Joint venture in Russia
On 25 November 2010, Thomas Cook announced that it had reached agreement to form a joint venture with VAO Intourist, one of Russia’s most 
renowned travel companies. Thomas Cook will initially acquire a 50.1% stake in the new joint venture company for a maximum consideration 
of US$45m (subject to an adjustment for net debt and working capital). The initial consideration will be satisﬁ ed by a cash payment of US$10m, 
and by the issue of US$35m of Thomas Cook shares. The joint venture will include Intourist’s outbound, domestic and inbound tour operating 
operations as well as its travel retail network. The joint venture provides Thomas Cook with an entry into the fast-growing Russian market which 
has strong demand for beach and family holidays, particularly to Turkey and Egypt. The joint venture is conditional upon anti-trust clearance in 
Russia and certain other conditions and is expected to complete in, or before, February 2011. Given the timing of the completion of this deal, it 
is not practical to provide a breakdown of the net assets to be acquired.
Aircraft ﬂ eet replacement
Thomas Cook Group operates a ﬂ eet of 93 aircraft with an average age of 12 years. The Group has identiﬁ ed signiﬁ cant operational savings, 
particularly from maintenance and improved fuel efﬁ ciency, that can be achieved by renewing and harmonising its 71 narrow body aircraft 
into a common ﬂ eet. Following a comprehensive review, the Group has selected the Airbus 320 family of aircraft. Accordingly, the Group will 
begin a ﬁ ve year narrow body aircraft replacement programme, starting in December 2012 and phased in line with the planned retirement of 
the existing ﬂ eet. The replacement programme will deliver optimum ﬂ exibility by sourcing new narrow body aircraft through a combination 
of ﬁ rm and ﬂ exible orders direct with the manufacturer and through accessing the aircraft leasing market. A review of the wide body ﬂ eet 
replacement requirements will be undertaken during the 2010/11 ﬁ nancial year.
As part of the replacement programme, the Group has reached a memorandum of understanding with Airbus for 12 new Airbus 321 aircraft 
scheduled to be delivered in 2014, with a list price of $96 million each, together with options to purchase further aircraft from 2015. These 
aircraft are subject to substantial price concessions from the list price. The Group will remain a heavy user of operating leases and it is 
anticipated that directly purchased aircraft will be ﬁ nanced through sale and leaseback agreements with third-party lessors.

10 Financial risk
The Company’s ﬁ nancial instruments comprise amounts due to/from subsidiary undertakings, cash and cash equivalents, and other payables 
and receivables. The Company’s approach to the management of ﬁ nancial risks is discussed on pages 24 to 25. The Company believes the value 
of its ﬁ nancial assets to be fully recoverable.
The carrying value of the Company’s ﬁ nancial instruments is exposed to movements in foreign currency exchange rates (primarily Sterling).    
The Company estimates that a 5% strengthening in Sterling would increase loss before tax by £14.9m (2009: increase proﬁ t before tax by £1.1m), 
while a 5% weakening in Sterling would decrease loss before tax by £14.9m (2009: decrease proﬁ t before tax by £1.1m). 
The carrying value of the Company’s ﬁ nancial instruments is exposed to movements in interest rates. The Company estimates that a 0.5% 
increase in interest rates would decrease loss before tax by £1.7m (2009: 1% increase in interest rates decrease proﬁ t before tax by £2.0m), while 
a 0.5% decrease in interest rates would increase loss before tax by £1.7m (2009: 1% decrease in interest rates increase proﬁ t before tax by £2.0m).

At the balance sheet date, the Company had unused tax losses of £28.7m (2009: nil) and other deductible short-term timing differences of 
£6.5m (2009: £4.1m) available for offset against future proﬁ ts. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of unused tax losses of 
£28.7m (2009: nil) and other deductible short-term timing differences of £0.5m (2009: nil).

14 Contingent liabilities
At 30 September 2010, the Company had contingent liabilities in respect of counter-guarantees for bank funding, letters of credit and 
guarantees of amounts owed by subsidiaries amounting to £464.8m (2009: £1,162.1m). This predominantly relates to a guarantee on
the drawndown portion of the Group banking facility (detailed in note 20 of the Group ﬁ nancial statements). 
Also included are guarantees related to aircraft ﬁ nance lease commitments, estimated based on the current book value of the ﬁ nance 
lease liabilities £79.6m (2009: £96.8m).
The contingent liabilities have decreased since the prior year predominantly due to the bonds issued by the Company during the year. 
The bonds have replaced borrowings previously held elsewhere in the Group, which in the prior year had been guaranteed by the Company 
and included with contingent liabilities.
The Company complies with all the standards relevant to consumer protection and formal requirements in respect of package tour 
contracts and has all the necessary licences. In the UK the customer’s right to reimbursement of the return travel costs and amounts paid 
in case of insolvency or bankruptcy on the part of the tour operator or travel agency is guaranteed in line with legislation in the UK via a 
fund mechanism, whereby travel companies are required to collect and remit a small charge for each protected customer upon booking.
15 Related party transactions
Subsidiaries
The Company transacts and has outstanding balances with its subsidiaries. The Company enters into loans with its subsidiaries at both ﬁ xed and 
ﬂ oating rates of interest on a commercial basis. Hence, the Company incurs interest expense and earns interest income on these loans. 
The Company also received dividend income from its subsidiaries during the prior year.

have therefore not been re-presented here.

* Revenue for the Group and segmental analysis represents 
external revenue only, except in the case of the Airlines 
Germany segmental key performance analysis where revenue 
of £287.8m (2009 £320.4m) largely to the Central Europe 
division has been included.
** Underlying proﬁ t from operations is deﬁ ned as earnings 
before interest and tax, and has been adjusted to exclude all 
separately disclosed items. It also excludes our share of the 
results of associates and joint ventures. Adjusted underlying 
proﬁ t from operations is stated before the margin impact of 
the volcanic ash cloud (VAC).
*** Underlying operating proﬁ t margin is the proﬁ t from operations 
(as deﬁ ned above) divided by the external revenue, except in 
the case of the Airlines Germany segmental key performance 
analysis where total revenue has been used as the denominator 
to more accurately reﬂ ect the trading performance.  
† Passengers in the case of UK, Northern Europe and 
North America represents the total number of passengers 
(in thousands) that departed on a Thomas Cook Group plc 
holiday in the period. It excludes customers who booked 
third-party tour operator products through Thomas Cook 
retail channels and transfers only. For Central and West & East 
Europe, passengers represents all tour operator passengers 
departed in the period, excluding those on which only 
commission is earned.
 Mass Market Risk passengers in UK, Northern Europe and 
North America represent those holidays sold where the 
business has ﬁ nancial commitment to the product (ﬂ ights 
and accommodation) before the customer books. The 
analysis excludes accommodation only passengers.
†† Capacity for UK, Northern Europe and North America 
represents the total number of holidays available to sell. This 
is calculated by reference to committed airline seats (both in-
house and third party).
 In the case of Airlines Germany, capacity represents the total 
number of available seat kilometres (ASK). ASK is a measure 
of an airline’s passenger carrying capacity and is calculated 
as available seats multiplied by distance ﬂ own.
††† For UK, Northern Europe and North America, load factor is 
a measure of how successful the tour operator was at selling 
the committed capacity. This is calculated by dividing the 
departed mass market passengers in the period (excluding 
accommodation only) by the capacity in the period.
 For Airlines Germany, seat load factor is a measure of how 
successful the airline was at selling the available capacity. 
This is calculated by dividing the revenue passenger kilometres 
(RPK) by the available seat kilometres (ASK – see capacity 
deﬁ nition above) and is the recognised IATA deﬁ nition of load 
factor used for airlines. RPK is a measure of the volume of 
passengers carried by an airline. One RPK is ﬂ own when 
a passenger is carried one kilometre.
# Average selling price for UK, Northern Europe and North 
America represents the average selling price (after discounts) 
achieved per mass market passenger departed in the period 
(excluding accommodation only passengers). For Central 
and West & East Europe, average selling price represents the 
average selling price (after discounts) achieved per passenger 
departed in the period.
## Brochure mix is deﬁ ned as the number of mass market holidays 
(excluding accommodation only) sold at brochure prices divided 
by the total number of holidays sold (excluding seat only) and is 
a measure of how successful a business was at selling holidays 
early. Holidays are generally discounted closer to departure.
‡‡ Controlled distribution is deﬁ ned as the proportion of 
passengers booking through our in-house retail shops, call 
centres and websites. Internet distribution is a sub-set of 
controlled distribution and is deﬁ ned as the proportion 
of passengers booking through in-house websites. Both 
performance indicators are calculated on departed passengers 
in the period.
‡‡‡ Sold seats in Airlines Germany represents the total number of 
one-way seats sold on aircraft (in thousands) that departed in 
the period.
### Yield in Airlines Germany represents the average price per seat 
departed in the period.

DIVIDENDS
As an alternative to having dividends paid by cheque, shareholders 
can, if they wish, have them credited directly into their bank or 
building society account on the dividend payment date. The beneﬁ ts are:
• funds are placed directly into the shareholder’s account on the 
payment date, so there is no waiting for the cheque to clear;
• it saves time, as there is no need to pay in each dividend cheque; and
• it avoids the inconvenience and cost of lost, stolen, spoiled or out 
of date cheques.
Shareholders wishing to set up a dividend mandate can do so by 
completing the dividend mandate form attached to the dividend 
cheque or by downloading a dividend mandate form from            
www.shareview.co.uk. Alternatively, the appropriate form can be 
requested from the Registrar (contact details below).
An interim dividend payment of 3.75 pence per share was paid on 
8 October 2010, to all ordinary shareholders on the register at 5.00pm 
on 10 September 2010. The Directors recommend the payment of a 
ﬁ nal dividend of 7.0 pence per share, to be paid on 7 April 2011 to 
all shareholders on the register at 5.00pm on 18 March 2011.
SHARE REGISTER AND SHAREHOLDER ENQUIRIES
The Company’s share register is maintained by Equiniti. Queries 
relating to Thomas Cook Group plc shares should be addressed to:
The Registrar
Equiniti
Aspect House
Spencer Road
Lancing
West Sussex BN99 6DA
Tel: 0871 384 2154* (international telephone number: +44 (0)121 415 7047)
* Calls to this number cost 8p per minute from a BT landline, other providers’ costs 
may vary. Lines are open 8.30am to 5.30pm, Monday to Friday.
Shareholders should quote the Company reference number 3174 and 
their shareholder reference number (which can be found on their share 
certiﬁ cate and dividend documentation), when contacting the Registrar.
SHAREVIEW
To be able to access information about their shares and other 
investments online, shareholders can register with Shareview        
(www.shareview.co.uk).  Registration is free; shareholders will 
need their shareholder reference number which is shown on 
their form of proxy and share certiﬁ cate. By registering for this 
service shareholders will:
• help reduce paper, print and postage costs;
• help the environment; and
• be able to manage their shareholding quickly and securely online.
Once registered, whenever shareholder documents are available 
shareholders will be sent a link to the appropriate website, where 
the documents will be available to view or download. Receiving 
documents online does not affect shareholders’ rights in any way.
MULTIPLE ACCOUNTS ON THE SHARE REGISTER
If a shareholder receives two or more sets of the documents 
concerning the Annual General Meeting (“AGM”) this means that 
there is more than one account in their name on the shareholder 
register, perhaps because either the name or the address appear on 
each account in a slightly different way. For security reasons Equiniti 
will not amalgamate the accounts without the shareholder’s written 
consent. Therefore, if a shareholder would like their multiple accounts 
to be combined they should write to Equiniti, at the address above, 
detailing the different shareholder reference numbers and request 
that they be combined into one account.
WEBSITE
The Company’s corporate website, www.thomascookgroup.com, 
provides information including:
• news, updates, press releases and regulatory announcements;
• investor information, including the Annual Report, investor 
presentations and share price information;
• biographies of the Board of Directors and the senior executive team;
• the Company’s Articles of Association and the terms of reference for 
the Committees of the Board; and
• sustainability reporting.
ELECTRONIC COMMUNICATIONS
At the AGM on 10 April 2008, the Company passed a resolution allowing 
the Thomas Cook Group plc website to be used as the primary means of 
communication with its shareholders. A consultation card was sent to 
shareholders enabling them to choose either to:
• receive notiﬁ cation by email when shareholder documentation is 
available on the website; or
• continue to receive shareholder documentation in hard copy.
Shareholders who did not respond were deemed, in accordance 
with the Companies Act 2006, to have agreed to receive shareholder 
documentation via the Thomas Cook Group plc website. These 
arrangements for electronic shareholder communications provide 
shareholders with the opportunity to access information in a timely 
manner and help Thomas Cook Group plc to reduce both its costs and 
environmental impact.
VOTING ELECTRONICALLY
All shareholders can submit their proxy vote for the AGM electronically 
at www.sharevote.co.uk. To register their vote shareholders will need 
the numbers detailed on their form of proxy.
Alternatively, shareholders who have already registered 
with Shareview can submit their proxy vote by logging on to                  
www.shareview.co.uk and clicking on company meetings.

THOMAS COOK AG / MYTRAVEL GROUP PLC MERGER
Thomas Cook Group plc was formed in June 2007 upon the merger of 
Thomas Cook AG and MyTravel Group plc.
MyTravel Group plc shareholders received one Thomas Cook Group 
plc ordinary share for every one MyTravel Group plc share previously 
held. MyTravel Group plc share certiﬁ cates are no longer valid and can 
be destroyed. Replacement Thomas Cook Group plc share certiﬁ cates 
were sent to shareholders, who held shares in certiﬁ cated form, on 
or around 19 June 2007. If a replacement certiﬁ cate(s) has not been 
received, please contact the Registrar.
UNSOLICITED TELEPHONE CALLS AND CORRESPONDENCE
Shareholders are advised to be wary of any unsolicited advice, 
offers to buy shares at a discount, or offers of free reports about the 
Company. These are typically from overseas based ‘brokers’ who target 
US or UK shareholders, offering to sell them what often turns out 
to be worthless or high risk shares. These operations are commonly 
known as ‘boiler rooms’ and the ‘brokers’ can be very persistent 
and extremely persuasive. If shareholders receive any unsolicited 
investment advice, they can check if the person or organisation is 
properly authorised by the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) at   
www.fsa.gov.uk/register/ and the matter can be reported to the FSA 
by visiting www.moneymadeclear.fsa.gov.uk Details of any share 
dealing facilities that the Company endorses will be included in 
Company mailings or on our website.
SHAREGIFT
Shareholders with a small number of shares, the value of which 
make it uneconomical to sell, may wish to consider donating them 
to the charity ShareGift (Registered Charity Number 1052686), 
which specialises in using such holdings for charitable beneﬁ t. 
Find out more about ShareGift at www.sharegift.org or by telephoning 
+44 (0)20 7930 3737.

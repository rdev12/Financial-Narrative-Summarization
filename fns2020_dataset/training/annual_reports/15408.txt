CHAIRMAN’S STATEMENT
“TATE & LYLE HAS HAD ANOTHER YEAR
OF STRONG PERFORMANCE DRIVEN
SUBSTANTIALLY BY OUR VALUE
ADDED BUSINESSES”
Results
Tate & Lyle has had another good year 
with profit before tax, exceptional items 
and amortisation of £295 million (2005 – 
£254 million) representing a 16%
improvement over the prior year. There 
was a positive exchange translation effect 
of £8 million. The improvement was driven
mainly by growth in SPLENDA
®
Sucralose
and strong performances from Food &
Industrial Ingredients, Americas and sugar
trading. The operating performance at the
end of the year was particularly good,
notably from Food & Industrial Ingredients,
Americas and sugar trading, with additional
benefit from mark-to-market adjustments
and certain one-off items.
Growth was delivered despite increased
energy costs across the business, the
adverse effect of the oversupply of sugar 
in the EU, and consequences arising 
from reform of the EU sugar regime. 
Sales increased to £3,720 million 
(2005 – £3,339 million). 
Diluted earnings per share before 
exceptional items and amortisation for 
the year to 31 March 2006 were up 11% 
at 41.7p (2005 – 37.4p). After exceptional
items and amortisation the diluted loss per
share was 6.3p (2005 – earnings of 30.6p).
The net charge for exceptional items before
tax totalled £248 million (2005 – £45 million).
In our announcement of 29 March 2006 
we stated that we would be reviewing the 
carrying value of our European assets 
affected by changes to the EU sugar regime.
The outcome of this review is the principal
element of the total impairment charge of
£272 million (the details of which, including
the effect on the future depreciation charge,
are set out in the Operating and Financial
Review). This has been partially offset by a
£24 million release of provisions relating to
US healthcare liabilities following changes 
to the funding of these costs announced 
by the US government.
Profit before tax after exceptional items 
and amortisation was £42 million (2005 –
£205 million). 
After an increase in investment and capital
expenditure to £344 million (including
significant expenditure on SPLENDA
®
Sucralose), and an increase of £58 million
06 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 Outlook
This has been another strong financial
performance from Tate & Lyle, driven
substantially by our value added businesses
and benefiting from a good operating
performance and certain one-off items 
at the end of the year. These results have
been achieved despite absorbing significantly
increased energy costs across the business.
In addition, our European operations were
adversely affected by an oversupply of sugar
in the EU market and other factors arising
from the reform of the EU sugar regime. 
In our announcement of 29 March 2006 
we stated that we would be reviewing the
carrying value of those of our European
assets affected by changes to the EU sugar
regime. The outcome of this review is the
principal element of the total impairment
charge of £272 million, the details of which
are set out in the Operating and Financial
Review. Fundamental options to mitigate 
the impact of the sugar regime are 
being examined.
Our strategy to grow the profit contribution
from value added products continues to 
be successful and we have set as our target 
for the current year an increase in profit
contribution of 30% from this activity. In part,
our target derives from the exciting prospect
of new value added product facilities
(including capacity for SPLENDA
®
Sucralose)
being completed and commissioned during
the year to 31 March 2007. This time last
year we said that we viewed the future with
confidence. The success of our value added
strategy makes it entirely appropriate to
repeat that message.
Sir David Lees
Chairman
24 May 2006
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   07
reflecting the adoption of IAS39 on 1 April
2005, net debt increased by £387 million to
£858 million (2005 – £471 million). Interest
cover was 9.9 times (2005 – 11.6 times).
Dividend
In line with its stated dividend policy, the
Board proposes an increase of 0.6p (3.1%)
in the total dividend for the year to 20.0p.
This is covered 2.1 times by earnings 
before exceptional items and amortisation. 
The proposed final dividend of 14.1p 
(2005 – 13.7p) will be due and payable 
on 27 July 2006 to all shareholders on 
the register at 30 June 2006.
Directors
As stated in last year’s Annual Report, 
Allen Yurko retired from the Board on 28 July
2005 and Dr Barry Zoumas was appointed
as a non-executive director from 1 May
2005. He has agreed to chair our newly
formed Research Advisory Group, of which
more details are set out in the Chief
Executive’s Review.
Carole Piwnica will be retiring as a non-
executive director at the Annual General
Meeting on 19 July 2006, having served 
on the Board for approaching ten years. 
The Board thanks her for her commitment 
to the Company and her considerable
contribution to its strategic development.
Robert Walker was appointed as a non-
executive director from 1 January 2006. 
He is currently Chairman of WH Smith
and brings to the Board an in-depth
knowledge of the food and beverage 
sector, having spent much of his earlier
career working for companies such as
Procter & Gamble and PepsiCo.
Corporate Social Responsibility
For Tate & Lyle, corporate social
responsibility means applying our four 
core values – safety, integrity, knowledge 
and innovation – to the way we run our
business. This involves continuous progress
in achieving the highest standards of safety;
considering the environmental impact of
every aspect of what we do; and treating our
employees, suppliers and the communities
in which we work as long-term partners. 
The Group continues to be a constituent 
of FTSE4Good, the UK corporate social
responsibility index. It is pleasing to report 
a third consecutive calendar year of
improvement in the Group Safety Index, this
year by 39.4% and that energy consumption
per unit of production showed a useful
reduction of 3.6%, beating our Group target
of 3% per annum.
Tate & Lyle’s UK occupational health
programme has also been acknowledged 
as a model of excellence by the UK National
Health Service. The Department of Health 
is interested in using our programme (which
includes health promotion activities, an
occupational health clinic, advice on healthy
eating and counselling services) as an
example of best practice to launch the
Department’s new initiative, Business
Communities of Health. 
Board Effectiveness
During the year, the Board once again
carried out a review of its effectiveness 
and that of its Committees led by myself.
The 2006 evaluation, based on one-to-one
interviews with the directors, the Company
Secretary and the Group Human Resources
Director, followed a similar process to the
one held in 2005 and, as in the previous
year, the 2006 evaluation concluded that 
the Board and its Committees were
operating effectively. Recommendations,
such as improvements to the format of
strategic papers provided to the Board and
the content of the agenda for the annual full
day strategy review, have been implemented.
A full session of the Board is planned for
July 2006 to consider other outputs of the
effectiveness review.
Strategy
Our strategy remains to increase the value
added component of our business, which
has grown substantially over recent years
both in absolute profit terms and as a
proportion of the Group’s total profit. 
Growth continues to be driven by a good
performance from our global food
ingredients business, through innovative
marketing, and the successful expansion 
of SPLENDA
®
Sucralose manufacturing
capacity and sales. 
This has in many respects been a year of
transition where one of our objectives has
been to invest for growth. We have made
significant progress towards the completion
of several key investments to facilitate 
that objective.  08 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW
“THE SPLENDA
®
SUCRALOSE BUSINESS
AGAIN PERFORMED STRONGLY AND 
WE SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED THE
CONTRIBUTION FROM OUR CORE VALUE
ADDED INGREDIENT PRODUCTS”
Overview
Tate & Lyle performed well in the 2006
financial year and achieved good profit
growth despite a challenging environment.
The SPLENDA
®
Sucralose business again
performed strongly, benefiting during the
year from the first stage of expansion to the
McIntosh, Alabama facility. We significantly
increased the contribution from our core
value added ingredient products and it was
also pleasing to note the margin gains we
achieved on commodity products in the
2006 calendar year’s sweetener pricing
round in the US.
A number of factors have partially offset
these positive performances. Firstly, higher
global energy prices added £30 million 
to our energy costs and also increased
ingredient and transport costs. Secondly,
profits were depressed by lower margins 
for sugar and related products in the EU 
and higher export licence costs at Sugars,
Europe. These arose as a consequence of
oversupply as the market begins to adapt 
to the changes resulting from reform of the
EU sugar regime. 
All our expansion projects, which will
promote longer term value added growth
across the business, are progressing
satisfactorily. The capital projects to double
the McIntosh, Alabama sucralose production
capacity acquired under the realignment 
of the SPLENDA
®
Sucralose activities have
been completed and commissioning is
under way. The new Singapore sucralose
facility and our new joint venture plant with
DuPont to produce Bio-PDO
TM
from
renewable resources should both begin to
come on stream in our financial year ending
31 March 2007. The project to increase
value added capacity in our Sagamore
facility in the US is also scheduled to be
completed in that year, and the Loudon
expansion is due for completion in the year
to 31 March 2008. 
In line with our value added growth strategy,
we completed two bolt-on acquisitions
during the year. The acquisition of the Italian
based Cesalpinia Foods was completed in
December 2005 and that of US speciality
food ingredients company Continental
Custom Ingredients Inc. was completed in
January 2006 for a combined consideration
of £72 million. Both businesses have been
customers of Tate & Lyle for a number of
08 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   09
years and together we will be more
responsive in developing distinctive and
innovative solutions for the food industry. 
The acquisitions made profits in line with 
our expectations in the final months of the
financial year. These acquisitions represent 
a further step in broadening our product mix,
technology and customer base in rapidly
expanding areas such as blends and
fortification and may be supplemented by
the acquisition of further bolt-on businesses. 
In April 2006, just after the year-end, 
we completed the acquisition of the assets 
and intellectual property of Hycail BV and 
its Finnish subsidiary Hycail Finland OY. 
Hycail develops polylactic acid polymers 
and resins, a biodegradable plastic made
from renewable resources. This modest 
£2 million initial investment strengthens 
Tate & Lyle’s knowledge and resources 
in the field of industrial ingredients from
renewable resources.
This investment supplements our internal
research and development capability, 
which we consider a key differentiator 
for Tate & Lyle. We continue to invest
substantially in this area, increasing
headcount by 45 and cost by 5% in the 
year to 31 March 2006. To improve oversight
and give an external perspective, we have
established a Research Advisory Group,
chaired by Dr Barry Zoumas, one of our
non-executive directors. The Committee
comprises external experts and senior 
Tate & Lyle people. It will review our research
and development portfolio and provide
insight into how leading edge technologies
could apply to future developments.
We have also established Tate & Lyle
Ventures, our fund to invest in new products
and technologies that are closely aligned
with our strategy. It will complement our
existing research and development and
partnering activities and will be formally
launched once the necessary regulatory
approvals have been obtained.
We are consolidating the global marketing 
of Tate & Lyle’s current range of value added
and functional food ingredients into one
team, our new Global Food Ingredients
Group. This team will take Tate & Lyle 
into new ingredient areas and growth
opportunities. This change to the structure
and leadership of Tate & Lyle’s businesses
reflects the acceleration of the Group’s
growth strategy and our continuing
commitment to delivering excellence 
in customer service. 
Under the new European sugar regime
proposals our Greek corn processing plant
(part of Food & Industrial Ingredients,
Europe) is not viable. We therefore propose
to close the plant, which has an isoglucose
quota of 13,000 tonnes, by September
2008. We have entered an information 
and consultation phase with employees.
Proceeds from the surrender of quota will
mitigate the cash closure costs. 
As part of our commitment to vigorously
defend and enforce our sucralose patents,
we announced on 23 May 2006 that we 
had filed suit in the US District Federal Court 
for Central Illinois against a Chinese
manufacturing group based in Hebei
province as well as six importers of
sucralose into the US. The proceedings
allege infringement of patented sucralose
manufacturing technology in respect of
sucralose manufactured in China. 
Group profit before tax, exceptional items
and amortisation of £295 million was a 
16% improvement on the prior year (2005 –
£254 million). Group profit before tax after
exceptional items and amortisation was 
£42 million (2005 – £205 million).
Net debt has risen from £471 million 
at 31 March 2005 to £858 million at 
31 March 2006. 
Group Targets
Despite the growth in profits outlined above
this has, in many ways, been a year of
transition as we invest for growth.
■ We have increased the contribution of
total value added products to Group
profit before interest, exceptional items
and amortisation from £132 million to
£161 million. The changes to the EU
sugar regime will, however, reduce the
contribution from the commodity, quota
constrained and consumer branded
segments over the next few years. 
This makes our current target of a
contribution from total value added 
of 60% of Group profit before interest,
exceptional items and amortisation
achievable for the wrong reasons. 
Given uncertainty over how the EU sugar
regime will impact the Group over the
next few years, and the number of capital
projects that are coming to fruition, we
have decided to replace this target with
a new one-year target for profit before
interest, exceptional items and
amortisation from total value added
products to increase by 30% in the 
2007 financial year.
■ The net debt to EBITDA (earnings before
exceptional items and before interest, 
tax, depreciation and total amortisation)
multiple has increased from 1.2 times 
to 1.9 times. Our maximum target for 
net debt to EBITDA is 2.5 times.
■ Interest cover was 9.9 times. This
remains robust, underpinning our
investments in future growth and our
progressive dividend policy. Our minimum
target remains 5.0 times.
■ All businesses have a target on both
economic and environmental grounds 
to reduce energy consumption on a per
unit basis by 3% per year. It is pleasing 
to report that in the 2005 calendar year 
the Group beat this target, achieving 
a reduction of 3.6%. At prevailing energy
prices, we would expect energy costs 
to increase by £45 million in the year
ending 31 March 2007 and the total
energy bill for the year (after taking into
account increased production) to exceed
£250 million. We have in place contracts
and hedges that cover around two-thirds
of our estimated energy usage for the
2007 financial year.
Segmental Reporting
This is the first full year under our new basis
for segmental financial reporting. This analysis
is presented along product lines, rather than
the geographic analysis previously reported,
and we believe that this will give a more
meaningful analysis of our activities.
Performance of Main Businesses
Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas
produced a very strong performance, 
with all of its major operations showing 
net gains despite higher energy and other
manufacturing costs. Sales were up 9% 
at £1,127 million and profit before interest,
exceptional items and amortisation of 
£125 million was up 30%.  10 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
Food and industrial products improved 
due to higher volumes and increased gross
margins, increasing the contribution from
core value added products. Sweetener
volumes were higher. Overall sweetener
gross margins improved following the 2006
calendar year sweetener pricing round. 
Net corn costs were lower. Ethanol benefited
from increased margins due to higher
gasoline prices and benign corn costs. 
The recovery of the citric acid product line
continued with increased profitability,
although this was constrained by higher
input costs. Tate & Lyle Custom Ingredients
(the former Continental Custom Ingredients
Inc. business acquired in January 2006)
made a modest profit in the final months 
of the financial year, in line with our
expectations. 
All major capital expansion projects are 
on schedule. Construction continues to
progress satisfactorily at the Bio-PDO
TM
plant in Loudon, Tennessee, and also at
Loudon and Sagamore where expansion of
the value added food ingredient and ethanol
facilities is taking place. The Bio-PDO
TM
facility is expected to commence
commissioning during the middle of the
2006 calendar year.
At Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe
sales were down 6% at £719 million with
higher volumes offset by lower prices
reflecting the calendar 2005 pricing round.
Profit before interest, exceptional items and
amortisation was up 5% at £46 million.
Selling prices for isoglucose have been
squeezed due to an oversupply of sugar in
the market and impending changes to the
EU sugar regime. Favourable raw material
costs, and improved selling prices for value
added and most other products in the 2006
calendar year pricing round, partially
mitigated the impact of higher energy costs
and lower isoglucose prices. Tate & Lyle
Cesalpinia (the former Cesalpinia Foods
business acquired in December 2005),
performed in line with our expectations and
made a small profit in the last quarter of the
financial year. 
In response to oversupply in the market, 
the EU has withdrawn 2.5 million tonnes 
of quota from the sugar year ending in
September 2007. Whilst we support this
action as an appropriate measure to correct
the balance of supply and demand, it will
reduce isoglucose volumes. However, one 
of the provisions of the reform is the granting
of an additional isoglucose quota of almost
20%, effective from October 2006. This will
partially offset the lower volume resulting
from the withdrawal.
SPLENDA
®
Sucralose has continued to
enjoy buoyant demand across all major
food, beverage and pharmaceutical
categories and performed strongly with 
sales of £142 million, up 23%. Profit before
interest, exceptional items and amortisation
of £68 million was 48% higher despite 
higher manufacturing costs (mainly due to
increased energy and ingredient costs and
expansion related operational constraints),
and start-up costs of £5 million (2005 –
transitional costs £3 million). 
The first McIntosh, Alabama plant expansion
has now been commissioned. The second
phase of the expansion is also mechanically
complete and will be fully commissioned by
the middle of the 2006 calendar year. These
two expansions will result in a doubling of
the McIntosh capacity compared to the
capacity of the plant when we acquired it 
in April 2004. With this increased production
capacity we will have additional product
available to build the customer base and
SPLENDA
®
Sucralose brand. 
In 2004, when we decided to more than
triple the SPLENDA
®
Sucralose capacity 
we acquired under the business realignment
with McNeil Nutritionals, we took into
account our customers’ views of potential
demand. With the first expansion to the
McIntosh facility completed and the second
expansion due to come on stream, we are
building up production and accelerating our
work with customers on innovation and
reformulation. Construction of the new
Singapore facility is on schedule to be
completed by January 2007 , and has been
designed with the potential for capacity to
be expanded if necessary. Based on our
ongoing discussions with our customers
about their future plans, we remain confident
of our ability to meet market growth in the
foreseeable future.
Sugars, Americas & Asia sales were up 
15% to £273 million and profit before
interest, exceptional items and amortisation
was up 35% to £27 million. Our sugar
operation in Canada has performed as
expected despite the effect of increased
imports and higher energy prices. The
results benefited from a mark-to-market gain
on raw sugar inventory of £7 million due to
the higher prevailing world sugar price. Our
sugar business in Vietnam achieved slightly
higher profits as higher selling prices more
than offset lower production due to a
drought. Results at Occidente in Mexico
were satisfactory, although lower than the
previous year due to a change in sales mix
with higher export and lower domestic sales.
At Sugars, Europe sales were up 23% 
at £1,459 million but profit before interest,
exceptional items and amortisation of 
£62 million was down 14%. Profitability 
in our EU sugar refining business has 
been substantially reduced, impacted by
oversupply in the EU market coupled with
the expected higher cost of export licences
and higher energy costs. Both London and
Lisbon refineries reported lower results than
the prior period. The impact on the Group
has been partially mitigated by a strong
performance from sugar trading, achieving
an increase in profit before interest,
exceptional items and amortisation of 
£13 million in what has been a volatile sugar
market. This was also the main cause of the
increase in sales of the division. Sugar
trading has enjoyed two years of well above
average profits. We believe that it is likely to
achieve a lower contribution in the 2007
financial year. The Eastern Sugar joint
venture business continues to improve,
although the quota reduction outlined above
will also impact this business in the 2007
financial year. 
CHIEF EXECUTIVE’S REVIEW CONTINUED
“All our expansion projects which will promote
longer term value added growth across the
business are progressing satisfactorily” Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   11
European Sugar Regime
The EU Commission published a press
release on 24 November 2005 outlining the
final proposals for the reform of the EU sugar
industry. Tate & Lyle fully understands the
need for reform of the EU sugar regime. 
We welcome the proposals, and in particular
the action by the Commission to address
the imbalance of the impact on the cane
refining sector (contained in earlier proposals)
through the granting of transitional aid, and
the extended period of stability until the end
of September 2015, contained therein.
Tate & Lyle published its estimates of the
impact on the Group on 25 November 2005.
These estimates excluded other factors
which impact operating results such as the
effect of market forces during the transition
period to the new sugar regime and higher
energy prices. Since then our European
businesses have been affected by
oversupply of sugar within the EU with a
consequent effect on sugar pricing premia.
This has reduced the profitability of those
businesses in the year to 31 March 2006
and is expected to depress margins for
sugar and related products further in the
year to 31 March 2007.
As mentioned above, the EU has announced
the withdrawal of 2.5 million tonnes of quota
for the sugar year ending in September
2007. This should have a beneficial impact
on pricing for sugar and related products but
the extent cannot be evaluated at this time.
Future quota withdrawals or cuts by the
Commission cannot be discounted. The
need for these will depend on supply and
demand which will be influenced by a
number of factors, in particular the amount
of quota surrendered by manufacturers.
As advised in our announcements of 
25 November 2005 and 29 March 2006,
one consequence of the EU sugar regime
reform has been a review of the carrying
value of our European assets affected by 
the reform. This is the principal element of
the total exceptional impairment charge of
£272 million, the details of which are set out
in the Operating and Financial Review. We
propose to close our Greek corn processing
plant, which is part of Food & Industrial
Ingredients, Europe, by September 2008.
The final detailed legislation resulting from
reform of the EU sugar regime may be
concluded only just before the start of the
new regime on 1 July 2006. Although these
implementing regulations are not expected
to materially alter the key elements of the
new regime, they will set the rules for the
day-to-day running of the EU sugar market.
As previously stated, we anticipate that 
the impact of the reform on the results 
of the Group will be at least offset by our
successful strategy to grow the total value
added component of our business, 
a consistent objective since 1999.
Safety
Tate & Lyle has no higher priority than safety,
which we believe is fundamental to running 
a successful business. Every year we
strengthen our commitment to ensure safe
and healthy conditions for our employees,
contractors and visitors. For the third
consecutive year, safety performance across
Tate & Lyle has improved in all categories,
reflecting our commitment to providing 
a safe workplace for all our employees.
Community Involvement
Tate & Lyle aims to play a positive role in all
the communities in which we operate. Over
the years we have developed a Group-wide
community involvement policy that forms
one of the core components underpinning
our ethical behaviour. Our programme
involves building long-term relationships with
local partners to deliver a shared objective:
establishing strong, safe and healthy
communities by investing time and 
resources into projects that directly 
address local needs.
Our community partnerships are very well
supported by employees, many of whom
take part in programmes. Tate & Lyle’s
community involvement benefits our
employees by enhancing their own local
community, offering significant personal
development opportunities and making 
Tate & Lyle a company for which they are
proud to work. The community involvement
policy is reviewed annually by the Board. 
Conclusion
Tate & Lyle performed well in the 2006
financial year. We have seen continued
success in our strategy of growing the total
value added component of our business. 
This performance has been achieved despite
a challenging environment and we could not
have produced such a satisfactory outcome
without considerable effort and commitment
from our people around the world. I would
like to take this opportunity to thank them 
for their dedication and contribution.
Looking forward, management will 
be focused on three principal areas. 
Firstly, to progress expansion projects, under
way in the US and Asia, which will facilitate
continued value added growth across both
the food and industrial activities of the
business. These projects will involve
substantial commissioning time and cost 
in the 2007 financial year. They are central 
to our value added strategy and are
progressing satisfactorily. 
Secondly, we will continue to build the
SPLENDA
®
Sucralose customer base 
and brand. SPLENDA
®
Sucralose is a key
component in many of our new solution
sets, developed for the food and beverage
industry. We will also maintain our vigilance
in defending the brand and our intellectual
property. 
And thirdly, we are examining fundamental
options to mitigate the impact of the EU
sugar regime reform on the Group.
We continue to view Tate & Lyle’s future 
with confidence.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW
Business description
Tate & Lyle is a world leading maufacturer 
of renewable food and industrial ingredients.
Founded in the UK in 1921, Tate & Lyle is 
a global company with more than 65
production facilities in 29 countries
predominantly throughout Europe, the
Americas and South East Asia.
Tate & Lyle has its roots in a number of 
well-established companies, focused on
sugars in Europe and Canada, wheat and
corn milling in Europe and corn milling in 
the US. All our ingredients are produced
from renewable crops, predominantly corn
(maize), wheat and sugar, but on a smaller
scale incorporating other agricultural
products. We take these renewable crops
and transform them through the use of
innovative technology into value added
ingredients and solutions for food, beverage
and industrial customers across the world.
The Group operates through five divisions:
■ Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas;
■ Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe;
■ Sucralose;
■ Sugars, Americas & Asia; and
■ Sugars, Europe.
These divisions are supported by a number
of global business groups and the corporate
Head Office in London. 
A description of the performance of the 
Tate & Lyle Group and each of its five
divisions for the year ended 31 March 2006,
and significant developments which
occurred during the year, is set out in the
Chief Executive’s Review on pages 8 to 11
and on pages 26 to 34 of this OFR.
Strategy and objectives
Tate & Lyle’s purpose is to create the world’s
leading renewable ingredients business. 
In order to grow our business and create
value for our shareholders, our strategic
objectives are to:
■ grow the contribution from value 
added products;
■ invest in acquisitions and partnerships;
■ unite our business;
■ operate efficiently;
■ invest in technology and people; and 
■ serve our customers.
Each of these strategic objectives is
explained in more detail below.
Grow our value added products
We are committed to continuing to grow 
the contribution from our value added
products such as our speciality food
starches and sweeteners and SPLENDA
®
Sucralose and to develop other products
such as Bio-PDO™. By providing distinctive, 
high-value products and solutions for our
customers, we will benefit from higher
margins and greater earnings stability.
Invest in acquisitions and partnerships
Tate & Lyle has expanded its business
through selected acquisitions. We continually
evaluate opportunities that would add
strategic value by enabling us to enter new
markets or add products, technologies and
knowledge more efficiently than we could
organically.
We also expect to grow our business by
forming joint ventures and partnerships to
develop and distribute new products, and 
to enhance the capabilities of our existing
ingredient portfolio. As we have found with
our global alliance with McNeil Nutritionals
for SPLENDA
®
Sucralose and with our joint
venture with DuPont for Bio-PDO™, using
alliances and joint ventures can be an
efficient way to lower our cost of investing 
in new areas and markets and help secure
access to new and complementary
technology and expertise. 
Unite our business
Tate & Lyle has a customer-focused global
approach to marketing. To support this
approach, all of our divisions operate
together under the ‘Tate & Lyle’ name. This
enables us to present a consistent global
portfolio of distinctive, profitable, high-value
products and services to our customers.
To accelerate our growth strategy, we have
formed a new Global Food Ingredients
Group. This new group will focus on
coordinating our customer-focused activities
so as to maximise the profitability and
market reach of our range of value added
and functional food ingredients, as well as
taking us into new ingredient areas and
growth opportunities in the future.
Operate efficiently
We are committed to being a low-cost
producer. Through our expertise in high-
volume process management, our focus on
technical and manufacturing excellence and
the efficient use of services such as logistics
and utilities, we are continually working to
improve the efficiency of our operations.
Invest in technology and people
We are increasing our investment in our
research and development capabilities to
underpin our strategy to grow our value
added products. We believe this is a key
differentiator for Tate & Lyle. We are
recruiting more scientists and increasing
expenditure to help us develop innovative
solutions that meet our customers’ product
challenges. We are also leveraging our
research and development capabilities
through business and technology
partnerships, university collaborations and
investments in start-up companies.
To develop talent, improve leadership and
help our employees succeed, we are
implementing ‘The Tate & Lyle People
Strategy’. This consists of various
programmes designed to ensure we have the
right skills at all levels to grow our business
and to enable our employees to meet new
challenges as their careers progress.
Serve our customers
Delivering excellent customer service is 
at the core of everything we do and we
consistently monitor our performance using
a variety of measures. Our Global Quality
Service and Standards set consistent high
levels of service and quality which are
expected to apply across the Group. 
This enables us to fulfil our customers’
requirements efficiently wherever we 
operate in the world.
Our aim is to ensure that we can help our
customers develop more successful and
innovative consumer products. Tate & Lyle’s
strategy is to be the partner of choice in our
customers’ innovation processes. At the
highest level this involves getting a better
understanding of our customers’ longer 
term strategic direction, and current
consumer trends, in order to strengthen 
our relationships. 
Introduction
This Operating and Financial Review (OFR)
provides a broader perspective of Tate &
Lyle’s business to enable a more informed
judgement to be made of the Group’s
financial performance and prospects.
Forward-looking statements
The OFR contains certain forward-looking
statements with respect to the financial
condition, results, operations and
businesses of Tate & Lyle. These
statements and forecasts involve risk and
uncertainty because they relate to events
and depend upon circumstances that will
occur in the future. There are a number 
of factors that could cause actual results
or developments to differ materially from
those expressed or implied by these
forward-looking statements and forecasts. ■ Tate & Lyle ENRICH
®
– enhancing the
nutritional benefits of foods and beverages
without compromising on taste.
During the year, we commercialised
solutions for a wide range of products
including flavoured waters, yoghurts, 
ice creams, breakfast cereals and dressings. 
Our solutions-based approach has also
changed the way we take our products to
market and the way we work with and are
perceived by our customers, providing us
with new opportunities to sell our products
and grow our business.
Customers
We principally sell our ingredients, solutions
and services to food, beverage and industrial
manufacturers. We also sell end-products
directly through retail distribution channels 
to retail customers. We serve about 6,000
customers at 13,000 locations around the
world and our customer base includes many
of the major global food, beverage and
industrial companies. They purchase our
ingredients to manufacture their consumer
and industrial products.
As shown in the table below, our renewable
ingredients portfolio can be broadly split into
ten segments serving a customer base that
extends from branded and own-label foods
and beverages to household and industrial
products, paper and animal feeds. 
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   21
To develop our customer relationships
further throughout our business, we have 
set up cross-functional teams consisting 
of people drawn from research and
development, marketing, sales, finance 
and customer service. These teams work
with our customers to provide both
consumer and customer insights and 
to look at support and product 
innovation opportunities.
Operating environment
Markets
Tate & Lyle participates in diverse markets:
■ Food and food ingredients – from refined
sugar and simple starches to higher value
products such as complex starches and
functional sweeteners, including the no
calorie sweetener SPLENDA
®
Sucralose.
■ Industrial bio-materials – from basic 
bio-materials such as paper starches 
and fuel ethanol to more advanced 
bio-materials such as Bio-PDO
TM
, 
a monomer made from corn which can
be polymerised by DuPont into a textile
called Sorona
®
.
■ Other non-food markets such as
pharmaceuticals and personal care
where, for example, we produce high
value modified starches which can be
used to provide texture and stability in
facial lotions. 
■ Animal nutrition ingredients – from feed
molasses to Aquasta™ astaxanthin, 
an essential nutrient for farm-raised fish
produced through a unique fermentation
process from renewable resources.
Currently, the most important driver of
growth for our business is value added food
ingredients. In this market, Tate & Lyle
operates primarily within the categories of
sweeteners, functional foods, fat replacers,
hydrocolloids, emulsifers and acidulants.
Solutions
Alongside our broad range of distinctive high-
quality sweeteners and food ingredients, we
also offer tailored solutions for our customers.
These are unique combinations of ingredients
or services that allow food manufacturers to
achieve certain goals, such as nutritional
reformulation, cost reduction or enrichment
without compromising on taste and texture.
Tate & Lyle’s solutions are marketed under
four services, namely:
■ Tate & Lyle CREATE
®
– innovations 
in shape, structure, taste and texture.
■ Tate & Lyle OPTIMIZE
®
– maximising
efficiency and added value services 
to help our customers meet their cost
and margin targets.
■ Tate & Lyle REBALANCE

Competition
The starch industry is concentrated around 
a small number of large participants who
operate in many different application areas,
including food, beverage, paper and
pharmaceuticals. The US accounts for over
half of global starch production. Our main
competitors in the US for corn wet milling
and starch-based products are Archer
Daniels Midland Company, Corn Products
International and Cargill. National Starch (a
subsidiary of ICI PLC) is another significant
competitor in the US, particularly in relation
to higher value modified food and industrial
starches, as well as Penford Corporation in
the North American paper starch industry. 
In Europe, our main competitors in the
starch industry are Cargill and Roquette
Frères. Competition for our European sugar
business comes mainly from British Sugar 
(a subsidiary of Associated British Foods
plc), Südzucker, Nordzucker and Tereos. 
The main competitors for our global food
ingredients business are Cargill, Danisco,
Kerry and National Starch.
Governmental regulation
Some of the markets in which Tate & Lyle
operates are subject to significant influence
from legislation or regulation. The main
regulatory development during the year
related to the reform of the EU sugar regime.
More information on the impact of this
reform on the Group is explained in the 
Chief Executive’s Review on page 11.
Another development during the year
occurred in November 2005 when the anti-
dumping and countervailing duties which
provide protection to the Canadian domestic
sugar industry (in which Tate & Lyle operates)
were renewed for a period of five years.
Products and their uses
Tate & Lyle’s major products together with
information about the ways they are broadly
used are detailed below. The table on pages
4 and 5 shows the regions from which these
products are manufactured and distributed.
Cereal Sweeteners and Starches
Cereal Sweeteners
We believe we are one of the leading
producers of cereal sweeteners and starches
in the world. We believe we are among the
top three producers of sweeteners and
starches in the European Union (EU) and 
we hold the largest share of the current EU
quota for isoglucose (the European name 
for high fructose corn syrup – HFCS). This
aspect of our business involves the
production and marketing of ingredients
produced from corn and wheat for the food
and industrial sectors. Our corn sweeteners,
such as HFCS, glucose syrup, fructose,
dextrose and maltodextrins, are widely
employed in the production of soft drinks
and as feedstocks in the brewing and
fermentation industry. 
Starches
Our highly functional value added food
starches add texture and body to food as
well as bind together ingredients offering
stability and moisture retention. Our starches
can also improve the shelf-life of processed
foods and snacks and are used to produce
the texture and other quality features of
consumer products such as chewing gum,
cosmetics, toothpaste and pharmaceutical
applications. We are also a key player in 
the production of non-food starches for
industrial markets. We supply textile, 
paper, corrugated board and plasterboard
manufacturers and the building industry with
industrial starches. In the paper industry,
native and speciality starches are used to
increase dry paper strength and improve
surface conditions. Speciality starches are
used in the manufacturing of corrugated
board to bond the different layers of paper.
Starches are used in adhesive and building
product applications, and in the textile
industry to increase weaving efficiencies.
Sugar and Related Products
We are a world leading producer of sugar,
processing cane and beet both for industrial
customers and retail sale. We also produce
value added and consumer branded sugar
products such as Lyle’s Golden Syrup and
Tate & Lyle Light Cane (a sugar and
sucralose blend). We have strengthened 
this core business by adding a variety of
other products which are produced from
natural by-products of the refining or
processing of sugar.
Cane and Beet Sugar
Sugar is produced from either sugar cane 
or sugar beet. Refined sugar, syrups and
treacles are used to provide natural
sweetness, texture, colour and flavour
across a full range of food and drink
applications. We are the largest producer 
of cane sugar in the EU. We are the UK’s
sole cane sugar refiner, and produce over 
1.3 million tonnes of cane sugar per annum
from our refineries in London, England and
Lisbon, Portugal. We are a leading retail
brand in the UK, supplying a full range of
retail and domestic sugars as well as more
specialised products including Lyle’s Golden
Syrup. We operate cane sugar refineries in
Canada and Vietnam and a joint venture in
Mexico which supply customers in those
regions. We also operate a joint venture
processing beet sugar in Central and
Eastern Europe. In addition to refining sugar,
our global trading operation purchases and
trades sugar in markets across the world. 
In general, we purchase sugar from major
sugar producing regions such as Brazil and
sell it into countries with sugar deficits.
Molasses
Molasses is the versatile by-product of cane
and beet sugar production. It offers various
benefits as an animal feed, provides a raw
material for fermentation and is also used in
a diverse range of other industrial processes.
We have been able to leverage our position
as a leading sugar manufacturer to become
a market leader in the international trading,
distribution and storage of molasses with
operations in over 20 countries. We have
developed the expertise we gained from
storing molasses to establish an ancillary
business of storing for our customers other
commodities in bulk liquid storage facilities
around the world.
SPLENDA
® 
Sucralose
SPLENDA
®
Sucralose is a no calorie, high
intensity sweetener that is made from sugar.
SPLENDA
®
Sucralose offers the taste of
sugar without the calories. As a food
ingredient, its proven stability means that
products using SPLENDA
®
Sucralose will
retain their sweetness over time, helping to
preserve the optimal balance of sweetness
and flavour. SPLENDA
®
Sucralose can 
be used successfully in high temperature
processing, such as sterilisation,
pasteurisation, canning and extrusion. 
It is used today to sweeten more than 
4,000 foods and beverages worldwide.
Acidulants, Alcohol, Polyols and Proteins
Acidulants
From a base of sugar, dextrose or molasses,
we produce acidulants such as citric acid,
fumaric acid, malic acid, potassium citrate
and sodium citrate. We are one of the
world’s leading producers of citric acid. 
Citric acid is used as a flavour enhancer and
to retard spoilage in a wide range of foods
and beverages, as well as forming the basis
of detergents and pharmaceuticals.
Alcohol
We have expanded our product offering by
using the raw ingredients of corn, wheat and
sugar to become a producer and distributor
of a range of alcohol products. These are
used in the manufacture of beverages and
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   23
vinegar, as well as industrial products such
as paint, or blended with gasoline and used
as a fuel. We produce fuel-grade alcohol
(ethanol) in both Europe and the US and, 
in Europe, our potable grain alcohol is found
in some of the UK’s leading brands of spirit-
based drinks.
Polyols
Polyols, such as sorbitol, are used by 
both food and pharmaceutical companies 
to sweeten and retain moisture and can 
be found in toothpaste and chewing gum.
Proteins
In addition to starches and sweeteners, 
the processing of corn and wheat produces
proteins. Wheat proteins such as vital wheat
gluten and soluble wheat proteins can be
employed in a variety of food and animal
feed products to provide valuable functional
and nutritional benefits. For example, vital
wheat gluten is used in baking to reinforce
the flour, guarantee stable dough processing
and improve loaf volume.
Biogums
We produce biogums such as xanthan gum
used by the food industry to provide texture
and viscosity to sauces and dressings and
as low calorie fat replacers and stabilisers.
Our STANZAN X
®
industrial-grade xanthan
gum is used in the oil-well drilling industry 
as a lubricant and coolant. Our gum range
has recently been expanded through the
acquisition of Cesalpinia Foods to include
locust bean and guar gums. 
Advanced Bio-Materials
Textile polymer ingredient Bio-PDO
TM
, 
made from corn by DuPont Tate & Lyle
BioProducts, will be commercially available 
in the financial year ending 31 March 2007.
It is used by DuPont to produce Sorona
®
which has a wide range of textile
applications from swimwear to carpets.
Other products
We also produce Alleggra™ and Aquasta™.
Alleggra™ is a unique, soy-based alternative
to liquid and powdered eggs and can be
used for a variety of sweet and savoury
product applications. Aquasta™ is an
essential nutrient for farm-raised fish which
we manufacture in joint venture partnership
with Igene Biotechnology Inc.
Key performance
indicators
Tate & Lyle’s Board and Group Management
Committee monitor a range of financial 
and non-financial performance indicators,
reported on a periodic basis, to measure the
Group’s performance over time. Of these,
the key performance indicators (KPIs) are:
■ contribution from value added products;
■ the net debt to EBITDA (earnings before
exceptional items and before interest, tax,
depreciation and total amortisation)
multiple;
■ interest cover;
■ energy reduction; and
■ the safety index (score).
Targets are set anually for these KPIs in 
line with the Group’s strategic objectives.
Performance data in relation to the KPIs for
the year ended 31 March 2006 and for the
prior year can be found in the table above.
The targets which have been set 
for the year ending 31 March 2007 are
explained in the Chief Executive’s Review 
on page 9 and set out in the table above.
Resources
The Group has a number of key resources
that help it achieve its strategic objectives.
People
Tate & Lyle employs 7,000 people in its
subsidiaries with a further 4,800 employed in
joint ventures. Our workforce encompasses
a broad range of skills and experience in
areas such as food science, sales and
marketing, engineering and business
support services.
It is a key objective for the Group to attract
and retain top quality recruits, and to ensure
that our employees develop and grow in
their roles and meet new challenges as their
careers progress. To help achieve these
objectives, we have developed and are
implementing ‘The Tate & Lyle People
Strategy’. This consists of four main
components:
■ Behaviours for Success – this
encourages our people to display 
strong leadership at all stages of 
seniority by exhibiting identified key
characteristics and behaviours we 
need for success, such as a focus 
on excellent customer service.
■ Talent Management – this is a system
which addresses key business issues
such as succession planning and filling
development gaps to ensure we have the
right skills to grow the Group at all levels.
■ Leadership Programme – this provides
managers and supervisors across the
Group with the opportunity to improve
their skills and expand their knowledge
through a number of tailored
programmes, seminars and courses.
■ Graduate Recruitment – a Group-wide
graduate recuitment programme to
attract and develop top talent building
on the existing successful programmes
already operated by our business
divisions.
Tate & Lyle’s remuneration polices are
designed to attract, retain and reward
employees of the highest calibre and
experience to help execute the 
Group’s strategy.

Research and development
To underpin our strategy to grow the
contribution from our value added products,
we are continuing to invest in research and
development. We believe this is a key
differentiator for Tate & Lyle. In the year
ended 31 March 2006, we employed a
further 45 qualified scientists and associated
staff and the cost of research and
development increased by 5%. We also
established Tate & Lyle Ventures, a fund 
to invest in new products and technologies
that are closely aligned with Tate & Lyle’s
strategic objectives.
Patents
Tate & Lyle maintains a significant number 
of patents to support its businesses 
and protect its competitive advantage. 
Much of the product innovation and
development work carried out by our
research and development teams results 
in patentable new technology. We monitor
market developments closely to identify 
any potential violations of our patents 
and take appropriate legal action where
considered necessary.
Risk factors
Tate & Lyle may be affected by a number of
risks, not all of which are within our control.
Outlined below is a description of some of
the risk factors that may affect our business
and share price. Other factors besides those
listed below may also adversely affect the
Group. The process Tate & Lyle has in place
for managing these risks is described in the
Corporate Governance report on page 52. 
There are inherent risks and uncertainties
behind all the forward-looking statements
contained in this section which could have 
a material impact on the future results. Along
with those discussed in the financial review,
the following section contains our perception
of particular important risks and uncertainties
facing the Group. 
Failure to act safely could have a
detrimental impact on Tate & Lyle’s
operations
The safety of our employees, contractors,
suppliers, the communities in which we
operate and the consumers of our products,
is of paramount importance for Tate & Lyle.
Around the world, the Group is subject to
supranational, national, federal, state and
local laws, regulations, rules and ordinances
relating to health, safety and the environment
including pollution, the protection of the
environment and the generation, storage,
handling, transportation and disposal of
waste materials. The Group recognises the
negative impacts that could arise from a
major safety or environmental incident which
include:
■ fines or penalties for breach of safety
laws;
■ interruptions in operations or loss of
licence to operate;
■ liability payments and costs to employees
or third parties arising from injury or
damage; and
■ damage to reputation.
Our success depends upon our
employees and the recruitment and
retention of key personnel
Central to the success of Tate & Lyle’s
growth strategy is the performance,
knowledge and skill-sets of our key 
personnel and employees around the world.
We recognise the need to attract, integrate
and retain the talent required to fulfil our
ambitions and understand the negative
impact on results that could arise from 
an inability to retain key knowledge and
adequately plan succession. 
Non-compliance with legislation can lead
to financial and reputational damage
The Group is aware of the importance of
complying with all applicable legislation
affecting its business activities and of the
potential damage to reputation and financial
impact which can result from any breach.
Fluctuations in prices and availability 
of raw material, energy, freight and other
operating inputs may affect our margins 
All our finished products are derived from
renewable agricultural raw materials. All of
these materials are subject to fluctuations 
in price due to factors such as harvest and
weather conditions, crop disease, crop
yields, alternative crops and by-product
values. In particular the ongoing changes 
in the EU sugar regime will increase the
importance of gaining access to adequate
supplies of raw sugar for our European
refineries. Energy usage in our production
facilities represents one of our main
production costs. The Group primarily
purchases coal, oil and natural gas, each 
of which is subject to price volatility due 
to fluctuations in both global and regional
supply and demand. In some cases, due to
the basis for pricing in our sales contracts,
or due to competitive markets, we may not
be able to pass on to our customers the full
amount of raw material price increases 
or higher energy, freight or other operating
costs to our customers and this could
reduce our profitability.
Changes in consumer dietary
requirements and preferences, or new
scientific evidence could decrease
demand for our products
A decline in consumption of one or more
product categories could occur in the future
due to a variety of factors (such as concerns
about obesity and diabetes resulting in a
consumer preference for lighter, lower calorie
beverages and foods) or could occur in the
future if new scientific research or studies
were to raise material issues regarding the
adverse safety or health effects of food
products which are currently considered safe
and healthy. Although our product offering
contains alternative products to meet these
preferences and concerns we may not be
able to adapt our production and research
and development as rapidly as market
changes occur in the mix of products used.
If there were found to be any long-term
detrimental effects to any of Tate & Lyle’s
products this could impact the Group’s
future profitability.
Tate & Lyle relies on the continued 
safe operation and the sufficiency 
of our geographically dispersed
manufacturing facilities
The Group’s revenues are dependent 
on the continued operation of our various
manufacturing facilities and the consistent
production of finished products that meet
our customers’ specifications. The operation
of our plants involves many risks, including
the breakdown, failure or substandard
performance of equipment, explosion due 
to the flammable nature of some substances
used in production, the improper installation
or operation of equipment, natural disasters,
potential product contamination and the
need to comply with environmental and
other directives of governmental agencies.
Any significant manufacturing disruptions 
or product contamination could adversely
affect our ability to make and sell products
which could cause our sales and operating
profits to decline.
Competitors may achieve significant
competitive advantage through
technological step change or higher
service levels
If our competitors were able to identify,
develop and introduce on a commercial
basis a major technological step change,
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   25
such as significantly improving the efficiency
of the production process and lowering
costs or introducing a new product with
better functionality, we may not be able 
to introduce a comparable change in 
our production process. Similarly, we 
must ensure we at least match or 
exceed competitors’ service and quality
performance. If we cannot compete
effectively with such innovation or 
service levels, our sales and profitability
could decline. 
We may not be able to protect our
intellectual property
Our commercial success depends, in 
part, on obtaining and maintaining patent
protection on certain of our products and
successfully defending these patents against
third party challenge or infringements. Our
technology is protected from unauthorised
use by others only to the extent that it is
covered by valid and enforceable patents or
effectively maintained as trade secrets. Our
patents or patent applications, if issued, may
be challenged, invalidated or circumvented.
Our patent rights may not provide us with
proprietary protection or competitive
advantages against competitors with similar
technologies. Others may independently
develop technologies similar to ours or
independently duplicate our technologies.
Due to the extensive time required for
development, testing and regulatory review
of certain potential products, our patents
may expire or remain in existence for only 
a short period following commercialisation.
This would reduce or eliminate any
advantage of the patents. We may face
litigation to assert claims of infringement,
enforce our patents, protect our trade
secrets or know-how, or determine the
scope and validity of others’ proprietary
rights. We may be unable to enforce our
patents or otherwise protect our proprietary
rights, which could have a material adverse
effect on our business, financial condition
and results of operations.
Failure to deliver on major projects could
impact Tate & Lyle’s ability to maximise
both profitability and return on capital 
The successful completion of major projects
such as significant capital expenditure
projects, acquisitions, and establishing new
partnerships or joint ventures is important to
Tate & Lyle’s ability to both sustain and grow
the business. 
The commoditisation of value added
products or a failure to achieve
appropriate margins could lead to 
greater price volatility
The natural life cycle of many products
means that value added products that
currently generate higher margins could
become commoditised in the future. 
The relatively higher margins of value added
products compared to commodities could
attract new entrants or existing competitors
into our product markets which could in turn
lead to a decline in our sales or margins.
Equally, a failure to recognise the true value
which the market places on our value added
products may mean that we do not sell at
the appropriate price and fail to achieve their
full profitability. 
Failure to manage joint venture or
partnership relationships effectively could
be detrimental to Tate & Lyle’s business
The Group recognises that joint ventures
(such as Bio-PDO
TM
with DuPont) and other
commercial arrangements (such as the
global alliance with McNeil Nutritionals on
SPLENDA
®
Sucralose) must be managed
effectively to ensure that both partners’
objectives are aligned and to maximise
financial and operational performance. 
At the same time, the Group is aware of 
the importance of selecting new partners
carefully so as to avoid the potential negative
impacts on growth or profit levels of an
unsuccessful relationship.
Fostering the correct conditions for
growth is critical to Tate & Lyle’s success
The Group acknowledges the significance 
of identifying appropriate markets in which 
to grow the business, and in fostering the
correct conditions within the business to
achieve growth and to ensure that we
maximise returns. We also understand the
importance of the low-cost focus within our
manufacturing facilities (which provides a
sound base for this growth) and the need 
to proactively respond to new market trends
and conditions. Failure to identify these
trends, opportunities and potential threats
and then carry out proper evaluation and
execution could have an adverse effect on
our business.
Failure to maintain an effective system 
of internal financial controls could lead 
to financial irregularities and loss 
Without its effective internal financial
controls, the Company could be exposed 
to financial irregularities and loss from
intentional or accidental acts which could
have a significant impact on the ability of the
business to operate. This covers a variety of
areas ranging from safeguarding the assets
of the business to the accuracy and reliability
of its records and financial reporting.
As a public company Tate & Lyle must
provide accurate and timely information
to the market to deliver long-term
shareholder value
The share price on the stock market is
based on the expectations of a wide variety
of market participants such as analysts,
brokers, investment funds and other
investors. Media stories or rumours can
influence these expectations. Failure to
provide accurate and timely information,
failure to meet Group targets, or failure to
respond in an appropriate way could lead 
to uncertainty and volatility in the share price
and the erosion of shareholder value.
Exchange rate fluctuations could create
earnings and balance sheet volatility 
The Group operates in many different
countries and is subject to currency
fluctuations arising on transactional foreign
currency exposures and the translation of
overseas subsidiaries’ results. For example,
a weakening of the US dollar and euro
against sterling would have a negative
impact on the sterling reported net assets
and shareholders’ funds.
Volatile capital markets could create a
shortfall in funding of retirement benefits
The Group maintains various retirement
benefit plans for employees that are funded
through investments in equities, bonds and
other investments, the value of which is
dependent on world markets that can be
volatile. The Group may be required to
provide additional funding to cover any
shortfalls in our benefit plan funding arising
from falls in the value of these investments.
Any significant additional funding
requirements could adversely impact the
Group’s financial position.
These risks could have a material adverse
effect on our business. Accordingly, our
overall success as a global business
depends, in part, upon our ability to succeed
in different economic, social and political
environments and to manage and to mitigate
these risks. 26 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
Basis of preparation
These financial statements are presented 
for the first time on the basis of International
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS), having
previously been reported under UK GAAP .
The comparative information in respect of
the year to 31 March 2005 has been
restated, other than accounting for Financial
Instruments, for which IAS32 and IAS39
were adopted from 1 April 2005.
Summary of financial results
Sales of £3,720 million were £381 million 
or 11% above the prior year. Exchange rate
translation increased sales by £88 million.
Underlying sales growth was driven by an
increase of £74 million from sales of value
added products, including SPLENDA
®
Sucralose, and £232 million relating to higher
volumes and prices within the sugar trading
business. These increases were partially
offset by the impact of lower selling prices 
in Europe.
Profit before interest, tax, exceptional 
items and amortisation increased by 18%
from £278 million to £328 million reflecting
increased profits from SPLENDA
®
Sucralose,
Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas and
sugar trading, partially offset by lower profits
from Sugars, Europe. Exchange impacts,
principally arising from the stronger US
dollar, increased profit before interest by 
£8 million. The margin of profit before
interest, tax, exceptional items and
amortisation as a percentage of sales
after exceptional items and amortisation 
was 6.3p (2005 – earnings of 30.6p).
The Board is recommending a 0.4p per
share increase in the final dividend from
13.7p to 14.1p to bring the total dividend for
the year to 20.0p per share (2005 – 19.4p).
The proposed dividend is covered 2.1 times
by earnings before exceptional items and
amortisation, 0.2 times higher than the
previous year.
Net debt increased by £387 million from
£471 million to £858 million due to capital
expenditure and an increase in working
capital.
Exceptional items and amortisation
Exceptional items before tax totalled a net
charge of £248 million (2005 – £45 million). 
An impairment charge of £272 million was
recognised comprising £263 million relating
to property, plant and equipment in Food &
Industrial Ingredients, Europe, due to the
expected impact of the new EU sugar
regime regulations, and £9 million relating 
to property, plant and equipment in the Citric
business in the UK (which is reported as 
part of the Food & Industrial Ingredients,
Americas division). There was an exceptional
credit of £24 million resulting from a
reduction in the Group’s US healthcare
liabilities following changes to the US
government’s federal healthcare provision.
There were no net gains on disposal of
operations and assets (2005 – £10 million
net gain). Net exceptional charges after tax
totalled £229 million (2005 – £29 million).
Amortisation of acquired intangible 
assets totalled £5 million in the year (2005 –
£4 million). This comprised £4 million relating 
to the patents acquired as part of the
SPLENDA
®
Sucralose realignment in 2004
(2005 – £4 million) and £1 million relating to
the intangible assets arising on acquisition
during the year of Continental Custom
Ingredients Inc. and Cesalpinia Foods.
Segmental analysis of profit before 
interest, exceptional items and 
amortisation 
The following paragraphs refer to profit
before interest, exceptional items 
and amortisation.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
increased from 8.3% to 8.8%. Exceptional
items amounted to a net charge before tax
of £248 million (2005 – £45 million) consisting
mainly of an impairment charge of £272
million as described below. Amortisation
amounted to £5 million (2005 – £4 million).
Profit before interest and tax, after net
exceptional charges of £248 million (2005 –
£45 million) and amortisation of £5 million
(2005 – £4 million) was £75 million,
compared with profit of £229 million in 
the year to 31 March 2005.
Net finance expense increased from 
£24 million to £33 million. Interest cover
before exceptional items and amortisation
reduced from 11.6 times to 9.9 times. After
exceptional items and amortisation, interest
cover reduced from 9.5 times to 2.3 times.
Profit before tax, exceptional items and
amortisation was £295 million, £41 million 
or 16% above the prior year’s profit of 
£254 million. Profit before tax, exceptional
items and amortisation at constant
exchange rates increased by 13%, after
adjusting for the £8 million favourable impact
of exchange translation. Profit before tax,
after exceptional items and amortisation was 
£42 million compared with £205 million in
the year to 31 March 2005.
Diluted earnings per share before
exceptional items and amortisation for 
the year to 31 March 2006 were 41.7p 
(2005 – 37.4p). The diluted loss per share

had a good year, with profits increasing by
£29 million to £125 million. The margin of
profit before interest, exceptional items and
amortisation over sales increased from 
9.3% to 11.1%. Exchange rate translation
increased profits by £4 million. The division
benefited from strong performances in both
the value added and sweetener businesses
which more than compensated for
significantly higher operating costs. Our main
plants were operating at capacity for much
of the year.
Value added food and industrial ingredients
achieved good growth in both volumes and
margins. Sales of food and industrial grade
xanthan gum commenced during the year.
Sweetener results were enhanced by
deliveries to Mexico and successful price
negotiations for the 2006 calendar year.
Ethanol benefited from a change in US
energy legislation that increased the
minimum usage requirement for ethanol in
fuel. Consequently profits increased due to
higher selling prices and increased demand. 
Lower corn prices, as carry-over stocks 
from the record harvest in 2004 were
supplemented by another good crop in
2005, led to reduced net corn costs.
Manufacturing expenses increased due 
to substantially higher costs of energy 
and ingredients.
At Almex, our joint venture in Mexico, profits
continued to improve. High fructose corn
syrup (HFCS) volumes increased due to
sales to non-soft drink markets and demand
from customers granted exemption from the
tax on soft drinks containing HFCS. Starch
volumes were also higher.
Citric Acid profits continued to benefit from
improved pricing and slightly higher volumes.
However, substantial raw material and
energy price increases limited the profit
improvement. The performance of the UK
business has resulted in an asset impairment
of £9 million at 31 March 2006. 
Our joint venture facility to produce
Aquasta™ astaxanthin, a natural 
nutrient and pigment for farm-raised fish,
successfully scaled up to designed capacity
during the year. Selling prices were in line
with expectations, but manufacturing costs
were impacted by higher energy and raw
material costs and the business reported 
a loss of £1 million for the year.
Integration of the recently acquired
Continental Custom Ingredients food
ingredient business has progressed
smoothly, with a contribution to 2006 
results in line with our expectations.
Construction of all major capital 
expansion projects remains on schedule.
Commissioning of the Bio-PDO™ joint
venture plant in Loudon, Tennessee 
is expected to commence in the middle 
of the 2006 calendar year. Start-up losses 
of £3 million during the year were slightly
above the comparative period. Key value
added projects announced during 2005,
relating to the Sagamore plant in Lafayette,
Indiana and the plant in Loudon, Tennessee
are on target for commissioning in January
2007 and October 2007 , respectively.

business in January 2006 28 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
Profits in our Food & Industrial Ingredients,
Europe business increased slightly, by 5%,
from £44 million to £46 million, mainly due 
to lower net raw material costs.
Sales volumes grew modestly and 
product mix improved due partly to recent 
investments in value added products. Selling
prices for much of the year were lower 
following the 2005 calendar year pricing
round. There was some recovery in prices in
the 2006 pricing round, although this will be
insufficient to recover higher energy prices.
Commodity sweetener prices were also
impacted by a significant drop in European
sugar prices during the second half of the
year in anticipation of the new sugar regime
regulations. Volumes were also impacted by
a temporary reduction to isoglucose quotas
during the year.
Both corn and wheat costs were lower as
the record European cereal harvest in 2004
was followed by another favourable crop in
2005. High production and high stocks 
carried forward from the previous year kept
the market at close to intervention price 
levels. By-product prices fell, in line with 
cereal prices as both compete in the animal 
feed markets.
Energy costs were higher than in previous
years despite the effect of a combination 
of forward cover and efficiency savings for
much of the year. The situation in the UK
gas market is of particular concern. Some
credit was obtained from the sale of carbon
dioxide emission rights. There was a small
reduction in other manufacturing costs.
The Eaststarch joint ventures in Central 
and Eastern Europe showed further 
improvement, mainly due to lower net raw
material costs and volume growth. This was
partially offset by a lower quota allocation 
for isoglucose/glucose in Turkey following 
a reallocation by the Sugar Board. 
The results for the division include a small
contribution, in line with expectations, 
from the acquisition of Cesalpinia Foods,
which was completed at the end of
December 2005.
The new sugar regime will come into effect
in July 2006 and will have an immediate 
and progressive adverse impact on the 
business over the four-year transition period.
This resulted in a £263 million impairment
charge to the asset base. Before the effect
of the impairment on the depreciation
charge, trading profits in the year ending 
31 March 2007 are expected to be 
significantly lower (particularly in the second
half-year) than in the year ended 31 March
2006. It is anticipated that the impact will 
be more than offset by the reduction of
approximately £25 million to the annual
depreciation charge, due to the impairment.

Our SPLENDA
®
Sucralose ingredient
business enjoyed another year of strong
growth with sales up 23% to £142 million
and profits of £68 million in the year to 
31 March 2006 (2005 – £46 million). Prior
year profits were adversely impacted by 
£4 million due to an IFRS stock adjustment.
Profits for the year ended 31 March 2006
included £5 million of start-up costs mainly
related to the new plant in Singapore (2005
– transitional costs of £3 million). Exchange
rate translation increased profits by £2 million.
Demand for SPLENDA

Sucralose
continued to exceed supply, despite a
gradual increase in capacity at our Alabama
plant as the first phase of the expansion
project was completed by the year-end.
Sales were actively managed throughout 
the period by close collaboration with our
existing global customer base. In spite of 
this restricted supply situation, our ingredient
customers launched a number of new
products in both the food and beverage
categories. Many of these products featured
the ‘Sweetened with SPLENDA
®
’ Brand
logo on their packaging and in the year to
31 March 2006 we approved over 750 new
packaging items displaying the SPLENDA
®
logo. In Europe we continued to grow our
UK ingredient business and witnessed the
first product launches in France containing
SPLENDA
®
Sucralose. January 2006 also
saw the launch of a reformulated Coke Light
in Norway and Sweden sweetened with
SPLENDA
®
Sucralose.
The first phase of the expansion project at
our Alabama facility was commissioned in
the first three months of calendar year 2006. 
The second phase has been completed and
commissioning has commenced. These two
expansions will result in a doubling of the
McIntosh capacity compared with the
capacity when the plant was acquired in
April 2004.
Construction of a second sucralose
manufacturing plant in Singapore remains 
on schedule. The administration building 
and the final product finishing and 
packaging areas are complete and will be
commissioned in 2006 in preparation for 
the main plant start-up in January 2007.

Profits increased by 35%, from £20 million 
to £27 million. Exchange rate translation
increased profits by £2 million.
Profits from Tate & Lyle Canada were above
the level of the comparative period due to 
a mark-to-market gain on raw sugar stocks
of £7 million (2005 – £2 million) following 
a significant increase in the world raw sugar
price. Energy costs were above the prior
year due to higher natural gas prices. 
Our blending and packaging operation 
in Niagara performed above the level of 
the prior year, due to manufacturing cost 
savings and improvements in supply chain
management. The anti-dumping and
countervailing duties, which provide
protection to the Canadian domestic sugar
industry, were renewed for a period of five
years in November 2005.
The sugar cane businesses had a mixed
year. Occidente, our Mexican joint venture
business, reported lower profits as domestic
competition from cereal sweeteners reduced
local demand for sugar, increasing the
volume of lower margin exports. 
In Vietnam, Nghe An Tate & Lyle’s profits
were marginally higher despite increased
input costs and a drought that caused a
reduction in sugar output to half of capacity.
The buoyant world and regional markets,
combined with Vietnam becoming a sugar
importer, led to firm prices. Further progress
was made in developing the ‘Melli’ brand.
The factory expansion was completed and
capacity is now 50% higher than when the
factory opened in 1998.

Sugars, Europe had a mixed year, with 
a difficult year in the refining businesses
partially offset by a strong performance 
in the sugar trading activity. Overall profits
declined by 14%, from £72 million to 
£62 million. 
The UK and Portuguese refining businesses
reported profits significantly lower than in the
comparative period. The businesses suffered
from fierce price competition driven both by
continuing oversupply, following accession 
of Eastern European countries to the EU, 
and general uncertainties in anticipation of
the EU sugar regime changes. EU sugar
regime reform is covered in detail in the 
Chief Executive’s Review. The excess of
sugar in the EU also resulted in increased
export licence costs which were £7 million
higher than in the prior year. The current cost
of licences is below €40 per tonne of sugar
from peaks in excess of €100 per tonne.
Profits were also impacted by record natural
gas prices in the UK and high gas prices in
the EU which increased energy costs by 
£6 million. The impact was mitigated
somewhat by a continued reduction in
manufacturing costs.
Lyle’s Golden Syrup Spreadable was
successfully launched during the year,
building on the strong Lyle’s Golden Syrup
heritage and giving the Tate & Lyle brand 
a greater presence in the retail environment.
Packaging of the Tate & Lyle retail sugar
product range was refreshed during the year
giving customers greater product and usage
differentiation. Light Cane, launched in 2005,
continues to perform well.
Sugar trading profits were £13 million higher
than the previous year, capitalising on the
volatility of sugar prices on the world market.
This is a result of the continued growth in
worldwide consumption of sugar at a time
when Brazil has been diverting sugar cane
production to ethanol because of high oil
prices, together with the planned reduction
in EU white sugar exports. Volumes traded
were higher and profits strengthened
particularly from the Brazilian market due 
to the high world prices.
Molasses improved its performance over 
the prior year, mainly through increased
profitability of its UK storage business.
Molasses prices have moved in line with
those of sugar and this has kept demand,
and trading margins, in Europe and Asia at
similar levels to the prior year.
Eastern Sugar, our European beet sugar 
joint venture operation in Hungary, Slovakia
and the Czech Republic, continued to see
benefits from accession to the EU, although
changes to the EU sugar regime are likely 
to result in lower profits in the next few
years. Significant focus on organisation and
costs, together with a very successful beet
campaign, saw the group make good
progress versus the comparative period.

Financial review
continued
Net finance expense
The net finance expense was £33 million
compared with £24 million in the year to 
31 March 2005, due principally to higher net
debt to fund both investments in capital and
acquisitions during the year. This includes 
a net charge of £3 million (2005 – £3 million)
relating to retirement benefits.
The interest rate in the year calculated as net
finance expense divided by average net debt
was 5.2% (2005 – 4.6%). Interest cover
based on profit before interest, exceptional
items and amortisation was 9.9 times 
(2005 – 11.6 times). 
Taxation
The Group taxation charge was £69 million
(2005 – £55 million). The effective rate of 
tax on profit before exceptional items and
amortisation was 30.2% (2005 – 28.4%).
The increase was mainly due to a higher
proportion of profits from the US,
exacerbated by a small charge relating 
to prior years.
Dividend
The Board is recommending a final dividend
of 14.1p as an ordinary dividend to be paid
on 27 July 2006 to shareholders on the
register on 30 June 2006. This represents an
increase in the total dividend for the year of
0.6p per share. An interim dividend of 5.9p
(2005 – 5.7p) was paid on 10 January 2006.
Earnings before exceptional items and
amortisation covered the proposed total
dividend 2.1 times.
Retirement benefits
Under IAS19 the income statement contains
two main elements: a service charge to
operating profit, representing the annual
ongoing cost of providing benefits to active
members; and a net finance cost or credit,
representing the difference between return
on the assets in the funds and interest on
servicing future liabilities, calculated using 
a corporate bond yield.
The charge to operating profit before
exceptional items for retirement benefits in
the year to 31 March 2006 was £20 million
(2005 – £21 million). An exceptional credit 
of £24 million resulted from a reduction in
the Group’s US healthcare liabilities following
changes to the US government’s federal
healthcare provision (2005 – £nil million).
Under IAS19 the net pension deficit
decreased by £62 million to £77 million, 
and the US healthcare provision decreased
by £10 million to £95 million. 
Contributions to the Group’s pension funds,
both regular and supplementary, totalled 
£40 million (2005 – £34 million).
Cash flow and balance sheet
Cash flow and debt
Operating cash flow before working capital
totalled £461 million compared with 
£355 million in the previous year. There 
was a working capital outflow of £211 million 
(2005 – £38 million outflow). This was
principally caused by the impact of higher
world sugar prices on the Group’s sugar
trading activities. A significant part of 
this outflow is expected to reverse in the
year ending 31 March 2007. In addition
supplementary payments were made to 
the Group’s pension funds of £17 million 
and payments of £12 million were made
against provisions. Net interest paid totalled 
£27 million. Net taxation paid was 
£98 million (2005 – £84 million).
Capital expenditure of £273 million was
more than double depreciation of 
£125 million and we expect similar
expenditure for the year to 31 March 2007.
Free cash outflow (representing cash
generated from operations after interest,
taxation and capital expenditure) totalled
£148 million (2005 – inflow £71 million).
Equity dividends were £93 million 
(2005 – £89 million). In total, a net 
£130 million (2005 – £111 million) was 
paid to providers of finance as dividends 
and interest.
Investment expenditure was £71 million,
primarily reflecting the acquisitions of
Cesalpinia Foods in December 2005 and
Continental Custom Ingredients Inc. in
January 2006. Proceeds from the sale 
of property, plant and equipment totalled 
£4 million (2005 – £4 million).
A net inflow of £16 million was received
relating to employees exercising share
options during the year. Exchange translation
increased net debt by £31 million.
The Group’s net debt increased from £471
million to £858 million. The adoption of IFRS
increased opening net debt of £451 million
at 31 March 2005, as previously reported
under UK GAAP , by £20 million due to the
proportional consolidation of joint ventures.
An additional increase of £58 million took
place on 1 April 2005 following the adoption
of IAS39. 
The ratio of net debt to earnings before
exceptional items, interest, tax, depreciation
and total amortisation (EBITDA) increased
from 1.2 times to 1.9 times. During the year
net debt peaked at £858 million in March
2006 (August 2004 during the year ended
31 March 2005 – £596 million). The average
net debt was £638 million, an increase of
£120 million from £518 million in the 
prior year.
Funding and liquidity management
The Group funds its operations through 
a mixture of retained earnings and borrowing
facilities, including capital markets and 
bank borrowings.
In order to ensure maximum flexibility in
meeting changing business needs, the
Group seeks to maintain access to a wide
range of funding sources. During the year
ended 31 March 2006, our Food & Industrial
Ingredients, Americas business arranged a
US$100 million receivables securitisation
programme, of which US$89 million was
drawn down at 31 March 2006, and 
Tate & Lyle European Finance s.a.r.l. arranged
and drew down a €50 million five-year term
loan. Capital market borrowings include the
€300 million 5.75% bond maturing in
October 2006, the €150 million Floating
Rate Note maturing in 2007, the £200 million
6.50% bond maturing in 2012 and the
US$500 million 5.00% 144(a) bond maturing
in 2014. At 31 March 2006 the Group’s 
long term credit ratings from Moody’s 
and Standard & Poor’s were Baa2 and 
BBB respectively.
The Group ensures that it has sufficient
undrawn committed bank facilities to provide
liquidity back-up for its US commercial 
paper programme and other short-term
money market borrowing for the foreseeable
future. The Group has committed bank
facilities of US$615 million which mature 
in 2009 with a core of highly rated banks.
These facilities are unsecured and contain
common financial covenants for Tate & Lyle
and its subsidiary companies that
subsidiaries’ pre-exceptional and
amortisation interest cover ratio should 
not be less than 2.5 times and the multiple
of net debt to EBITDA, as defined in our
financial covenants, should not be greater
than 4.0 times. The internal targets for these
items are a minimum of 5.0 times and a
maximum of 2.5 times, respectively. The
Group monitors compliance against all its
financial obligations and it is Group policy 
to manage the consolidated balance sheet
so as to operate well within covenanted
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   33
restrictions at all times. The majority of the
Group’s borrowings are raised through the
Group treasury company, Tate & Lyle
International Finance PLC, and are then 
on-lent to the business units on an arms-
length basis. 
The Group manages its exposure to liquidity
risk by ensuring a diversity of funding
sources and debt maturities. Group policy 
is to ensure that, after subtracting the total 
of undrawn committed facilities, no more
than 30% of gross debt matures within 
12 months and at least 50% has a maturity
of more than two and a half years. At the
end of the year, after subtracting total
undrawn committed facilities, there was 10%
of debt maturing within 12 months and 90%
of debt had a maturity of two and a half
years or more (2005 – 0% and 98%). The
average maturity of the Group’s gross debt
was 4.8 years (2005 – 5.8 years). 
At the year-end the Group held cash 
and cash equivalents of £158 million 
(2005 – £384 million) and had undrawn
committed facilities of £354 million 
(2005 – £327 million). These resources are
maintained to provide liquidity back-up and
to meet the projected maximum cash
outflow from debt repayment, capital
expenditure and seasonal working capital
needs foreseen for at least a year into the
future at any one time.
Funding not treated as debt
In respect of all financing transactions, the
Group seeks to optimise its financing costs.
Where it is economically beneficial, operating
leases are undertaken in preference to
purchasing assets. Leases of property, plant
and equipment where the lessor assumes
substantially all the risks and rewards of
ownership are treated as operating leases
with annual rentals charged to the income
statement over the term of the lease.
Commitments under operating leases to pay
rentals in future years totalled £229 million
(2005 – £212 million) and related primarily 
to railcar leases in the US.
Financial risk controls
Management of financial risk
The main financial risks faced by the Group
are liquidity risk, interest rate risk, currency
risk and certain commodity price risks. 
Tate & Lyle also faces risks which are non-
financial or non-quantifiable, for example,
country and credit risk. The Board of 
Tate & Lyle PLC regularly reviews these risks
and approves written policies covering the
use of financial instruments to manage these
risks and sets overall risk limits. 
All the Group’s material financial instruments
are categorised as being held either for
trading or risk management. Financial
instruments held for trading within the 
Group are severely limited, confined only 
to tightly controlled areas within the sugar
and corn pricing operations and reinsurance
activities. The derivative financial instruments
approved by the Board to manage financial
risks include swaps, both interest rate and
currency, swaptions, caps, forward rate
agreements, financial and commodity
forward contracts and options, and
commodity futures.
Control and direction of treasury
Tate & Lyle’s group treasury function
operates within a framework of clearly
defined Board approved policies and
procedures setting out permissible funding
and hedging instruments, exposure limits
and a system of authorities for the approval
of transactions. Most of the Group’s
financing, interest rate and foreign 
exchange risks and other treasury activities
are managed through the Group treasury
company, Tate & Lyle International Finance
PLC, whose operations are controlled by 
its Board. The treasury company is chaired 
by the Group Finance Director and has 
other Board members independent of the
treasury function. 
Group interest rate and currency 
exposures are concentrated either in 
the treasury company or in appropriate
holding companies through market-related
transactions with Group subsidiaries. These
acquired positions are managed by the
treasury company within its authorised limits. 
Interest rate risk
The exposure to fluctuating interest rates is
managed by fixing or capping portions of
debt using interest rate derivatives to achieve
a target level of fixed/floating rate net debt
which aims to optimise net finance expense
and reduce volatility in reported earnings.
The Group’s policy is that between 30% 
and 75% of Group net debt (excluding the
Group’s share of joint venture net debt) is
fixed or capped (excluding out-of-the-money
caps) for more than one year and that no
interest rate fixings are undertaken for more
than 12 years. At 31 March 2006 the longest
term of any fixed rate debt held by the
Group was until November 2014. The
proportion of net debt (excluding the Group’s
share of joint venture net debt) which was
fixed or capped for more than one year was
35% (2005 – 85%), excluding £147 million
(2005 – £145 million) of out-of-the-money
interest rate options capping euro rates at
4.83% (2005 – 4.83%). 
If the interest rates applicable to the Group’s
floating rate debt rise from the levels at the
end of March 2006 by an average of 1%
over the year to 31 March 2007, this would
reduce Group profit before tax by
approximately £5 million.
Management of foreign exchange risk
The Group has transactional foreign currency
exposures arising from sales and purchases
by subsidiaries in currencies other than their
functional currencies. The Group’s foreign
currency exposure management policy
requires subsidiaries to hedge transactional
currency exposures against their functional
currency once they are probable, mainly
through the use of forward foreign 
exchange contracts. 
The Group’s accounting policy is to translate
profits of overseas companies using average
exchange rates. It is the Group’s policy 
not to hedge exposures arising from 
profit translation. 
The Group has significant investment in
overseas operations, particularly in the
Americas and Europe. Movements in
exchange rates between balance sheet
dates can affect the sterling value of the
Group’s consolidated balance sheet. 
The currency profile of net debt is managed
to mitigate the effect of these translational
exposures arising on the Group’s net
investment in overseas operations. This is
achieved by borrowing in currencies, where
practicable and cost effective, which provide
a match for the Group’s foreign currency
assets and which can be serviced from
foreign currency cash flows. Given the
current profile of the Group’s net operating
assets and operating cash flows the Group
aims to maintain a target currency profile 
of net debt (excluding the Group’s share 
of joint venture net debt) such that US and
Canadian dollars combined should exceed
40%, euro should exceed 25%, sterling
should not represent more than 25% and
other currencies should not exceed 10%. 
At the year-end net debt (excluding the
Group’s share of joint venture net debt) 
was held in the following currencies: net
borrowings of US and Canadian dollars 
72% (2005 – 75%), euro 37% (2005 – 46%);
and other currencies 0% (2005 – 0%) with
sterling deposits of 9% (2005 – 21%). 
The weighted average exchange rate used
to translate US dollar profits was US$1.79
(2005 – US$1.85), compared with the year-
end rate of US$1.74 (2005 – US$1.88).  34 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
The only material risks from economic
foreign currency exposures are to the 
UK sugar refining business from sterling
appreciation against the euro.
Credit risk
The Group controls credit risk by entering
into financial instruments only with highly
credit-rated authorised counterparties which
are reviewed and approved regularly by the
Board of Tate & Lyle PLC. Counterparty
positions are monitored on a regular basis.
Price risk
Derivatives are used to hedge movements 
in the future prices of commodities in those
domestic and international markets where
the Group buys and sells sugar, corn and
wheat. Commodity futures and options are
used to hedge inventories and the costs of
raw materials for unpriced and prospective
contracts not covered by forward product
sales. The options and futures hedging
contracts generally mature within one year
and all are with organised exchanges.
Use and fair value of financial
instruments
In the normal course of business the Group
uses derivative financial instruments and
non-derivative financial instruments.
The fair value of Group net borrowings at
year-end was £869 million against a book
value of £858 million (2005 – fair value 
£503 million; book value £471 million).
Derivative financial instruments used to
manage the interest rate and currency of
borrowings had a fair value of £12 million
asset (2005 – £2 million liability). The main
types of instrument used are interest rate
swaps, interest rate options (caps or floors)
and cross-currency interest rate swaps.
The fair value of other derivative financial
instruments hedging future currency and
commodity transactions was £3 million
liability (2005 – £nil million). In currency
exposure management the instruments used
are spot and forward purchases and sales, 
and options.
The fair value of derivative financial
instruments held for trading was £71 million
asset (2005 – £1 million liability) arising in 
the commodity trading and reinsurance
operations. The net loss included in operating
profit from trading financial instruments was
£7 million (2005 – £3 million gain).
Fair value estimation
The fair value of derivative financial
instruments is based on the market price 
of comparable instruments at the balance
sheet date if they are publicly traded. The fair
value of the forward currency contracts has
been determined based on market forward
exchange rates at the balance sheet date.
The fair values of short-term deposits,
receivables, payables, loans and overdrafts
with a maturity of less than one year are
assumed to approximate their book values.
The fair values of bonds, bank and other
loans, including finance lease liabilities due 
in more than one year are estimated by
discounting the future contractual cash flows
at the current market interest rate available
to the Group for similar financial instruments,
adjusted for the fair valuation effects of
currency and interest rate risk exposures
where those instruments form part of a
related hedging relationship agreements,
financial and commodity forward contracts
and options, and commodity futures.
Going concern
After making enquiries, the directors have 
a reasonable expectation that the Company
and the Group have adequate resources 
to continue in operational existence for the
foreseeable future. For this reason they
continue to adopt the going concern 
basis in preparing the accounts.
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED Safety
Tate & Lyle has no higher priority than safety,
which we believe is fundamental to running 
a successful business. Every year we
strengthen our commitment to ensure safe
and healthy conditions for our employees,
contractors and visitors. By reporting,
recognising and rewarding safety
performance, we ensure that all our
operations focus on continuous
improvement.
Employee safety
Calendar year 2005 results
For the third consecutive year, safety
performance across Tate & Lyle improved 
in all categories, reflecting our commitment
to providing a safe workplace for all our
employees. Compared with the 2004
calendar year results:
■ Group safety index improved by 39.4%;
■ Recordable injury rate (injury requiring
treatment beyond first aid) improved 
by 12.9%;
■ Lost-time accident rate (recordable 
accidents sufficiently severe to result 
in lost workdays or to restrict the
employee’s ability to perform his/her 
job, counted from the first day of
incapacitation) improved by 22.6%; and
■ Severity rate (number of workdays lost
due to injuries) improved by 45.7%.
Rates are based on 200,000 employee
hours worked.
The Group Safety Index compares safety
performance across Tate & Lyle. This is a
weighted average of injuries sustained in 
the workplace, with more severe incidents
having greater impact. A decrease in the
index reflects improved performance. Our
target is zero for every Tate & Lyle operation.
Benchmarking results
The US and Europe compile safety statistics
differently and therefore it is difficult to
compare results. However, we can compare
the performance of each of our divisions 
with results from the US Bureau of Labor
Statistics. Again this year, our divisions are
outperforming the average reported standard
for their peers in their respective sectors and
in the US private sector as a whole. 
Managing safety
Maintaining a consistently safe and healthy
workplace for our people requires effective,
proactive management. Constantly
improving our safety results requires:
■ Changing behaviour by encouraging 
a safety culture at all of our locations;
■ Auditing safety performance;
■ Rewarding improved safety performance
with local safety awards, divisional ‘Most
Improved Plant’ and Group-wide ‘Safety
First’ awards;
■ Sharing information and best practice
amongst all our locations;
■ Improving communication on safety
issues throughout the Group; and
■ The active involvement of senior
executives in auditing and promoting
safety.
Corporate social responsibility
For Tate & Lyle, corporate social responsibility equates to applying our four core values 
– safety, integrity, knowledge and innovation – to the way we run our business. This 
means continuous progress in achieving the highest standards of safety; considering 
the environmental impact of every aspect of what we do; and treating our employees,
suppliers and the communities in which we work as long-term partners.
Putting these concerns at the centre of our business requires proactive management 
at the highest levels within the Company. The Board reviews Tate & Lyle’s policies and
performance annually, and the Chief Executive is the Board member accountable for all
aspects of corporate social responsibility.
This report covers our performance in calendar year 2005, sets out plans for the future
and explains how we manage corporate social responsibility to the benefit of both
Tate & Lyle and our partners.

OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Working together is very important for
improving standards, but ultimately we will
dismiss contractor organisations if they do
not demonstrate the same commitment to
improving safety as does Tate & Lyle.
Outlook
2005 has been a year of transition in terms
of developing programmes to improve
contractor safety. Our focus in 2006 will be
to bring contractor safety standards closer
to the high standards of employee safety 
we are achieving at Tate & Lyle. At the 
same time, while we are pleased with our
continuing progress in employee safety, 
we recognise that there is always room for
improvement. By continuing our drive for a
safe workplace as highlighted in this report,
we are determined to improve our record 
still further in future years.

Achievements and awards
Most of Tate & Lyle’s locations equalled or
improved their 2004 performance, including
29 that reported no lost-time accidents and
11 that reported no recordable injuries for
the year. An important part of managing
safety is our annual ‘World Class Safety
Excellence’ awards programme. To qualify
for entry, plants must:
■ Operate the entire year without lost-time;
■ Have active employee participation in
their safety programme; 
■ Have an active auditing programme; and
■ Demonstrate adherence to Tate & Lyle’s
standards during executive, management
and network audits. 
Calendar year 2005 winners were:
■ Large plant (over 250,000 employee
hours per year)
– Europe: Lisbon, Portugal
– Americas: McIntosh, USA.
■ Small plant (less than 250,000 employee
hours per year)
– Europe: Plaistow, UK
– Americas: Houlton, USA.
■ Most improved safety performance
– Europe: Nisasta, Turkey
– Americas: Sagamore, USA.
Tate & Lyle has also received external
recognition for safety: the state of Alabama
honoured our McIntosh, USA, plant with
their Safety Achievement Award for
outstanding safety performance in 2005.
Contractor safety
Calendar year 2005 results
2005 is the second year we have collected
contractor safety statistics so we can now
begin to assess progress. Compared with
the 2004 calendar year results:
■ Contractor safety index improved 
by 3.7%;
■ Recordable injury rate improved 
by 38.4%;
■ Lost-time accident rate improved 
by 19%; and
■ Severity rate increased by 1%.
Benchmarking results
Contractor safety continues to compare well
with the US Bureau of Labor Statistics 2004
(the most recent data available). The Bureau
reports the overall recordable injury rate per
200,000 employee hours for US contractors
to be 6.10 against 2.18 at Tate & Lyle, and
the overall lost-time accident rate to be
2.00 against our 1.32.
Managing safety
While there have been improvements in
some aspects of contractor safety this 
year, the standards are not yet on a par 
with those of Tate & Lyle employees. The
death of two contractors in October 2005 
in Razgrad, Bulgaria, is a reminder that we
can never let up on our drive for safety for 
all those who work at our sites. Improving
contractor safety is more of a challenge
because Tate & Lyle does not directly
supervise the employees of contractors;
however, many of our sites are beginning to
work more closely with contractors on safety
issues (see ‘Commercial partners/suppliers’
on page 38 for more details on how one 
of our divisions is working to improve
contractor safety), and we hope to see
improvements in contractor safety
performance in future years as a result.

Environment
Tate & Lyle’s environmental policy is for 
all our operations to be conducted in light 
of our responsibilities towards the natural
environment in which we live and work, and
to comply with relevant laws, regulations and
consents, which may vary from location to
location. The Board reviews environmental
performance and the policy annually.
Tate & Lyle continues to subscribe to the
principles of the International Chamber 
of Commerce’s Business Charter for
Sustainable Development. In accordance
with Group policy, all locations fully integrate
environmental management into their
operational systems and procedures.
Environmental impacts are many and varied.
When reviewing our environmental footprint,
it has always been Tate & Lyle’s policy to
focus particularly on those impacts which
have most effect on the environment and
over which we have direct control. Our three
most significant environmental impacts are,
in order of magnitude, energy use, water use
and non-hazardous solid waste production. 
Energy use is by far our most significant
impact, and we therefore give it the highest
priority. Managing our impacts for a positive
result is good for the environment and also
brings economic benefits to Tate & Lyle.
Calendar year 2005 results
■ Energy consumption reduced by 3.6%.
■ Water consumption increased by 1.3%.
■ Non-hazardous waste production
increased by 7.7%.
We focus our measurement and our
improvement efforts on the areas that have
most environmental and financial impact. 
For example, on the 2005 energy bill, every
1% improvement in our energy index offers 
a cost saving estimated at £1.9 million. 
An equivalent improvement in the water index
offers a saving of some £145,000, while 
a 1% improvement in the non-hazardous
waste index saves around £30,000.
We are therefore pleased to report that
energy consumption, our most significant
impact both environmentally and
economically, showed a good reduction on a
per unit basis of 3.6%, beating our Group
target of 3.0% per annum. Non-hazardous
waste production has increased this year
due to major construction projects under
way in a number of locations, for example,
our new plant in Singapore and expansions
at two of our plants in the US. Once these
projects are complete, we expect to return
to decreasing the amount of non-hazardous
waste we produce.
Violation, abatement and 
compliance orders
The vast majority of our operations
completed 2005 without incident. Where
Tate & Lyle inadvertently contravened
regulations, incidents were minor and we
reacted immediately to correct the problems.
Managing environmental impacts
Managing environmental impacts is very
important at Tate & Lyle. Environmental 
risks are included in the Group-wide risk
management process, and are reviewed 
and assessed regularly. For more
information, see the sections on Risk 
Factors on pages 24 and 25 and 
Corporate Governance on page 52.
Measuring data
To manage our environmental footprint to the
benefit of the environment and the Company
we collect detailed data and report results
from each operating unit quarterly, using 
a comprehensive system that has been
validated by our Internal Audit department.
We then normalise the data to reflect the
amount of product manufactured. This
protects the commercial sensitivities of the
data while allowing us to report publicly 
on our progress, and make comparisons
between years. The data is then aggregated
to create a single set of indices for the
Group, adjusted to take account of
acquisitions and disposals.
Training
Employees receive regular training on
managing environmental impacts and
changes in legislation, so that they are always
aware of the issues. Many operating units
have environmental management committees
that meet regularly to discuss progress.
Customers and suppliers
We work closely with our customers to
ensure our systems meet their requirements.
We brief all contractors on key environmental
issues to make sure that we are managing
our environmental impact effectively and, 
in the UK, we have begun working with
contractors to help them improve business
efficiency and decrease their impact 
on the environment (see ‘Commercial
partners/suppliers’ on page 38 for 
more details).

Outlook
The production of value added products 
for our customers consumes considerable
energy. Our ongoing challenge is to reduce
environmental impacts, energy in particular,
while growing the business and developing
these products. We will continue to manage
our environmental footprint as efficiently 
as possible, ensuring that we build
environmental concerns into our processes
as we develop new products. 38 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
Employee health and
wellbeing
At Tate & Lyle, we aim to lead the way in
employee health. Programmes will differ
across the Group according to local needs,
but all are based on the principle that the
Company has a role to play in helping
employees improve their health by providing
information and advice on all aspects of
health and wellbeing. 
Calendar year 2005 highlights
UK
Tate & Lyle’s UK occupational health
programme has been acknowledged as 
a model of excellence by the UK National
Health Service. The Department of Health 
is using our programme, which includes
health promotion activities, an occupational
health clinic, advice on healthy eating and
counselling services, as an example of best
practice to launch the Department’s new
initiative, Business Communities of Health. 
Our programme also won Silver in the
employee health and wellbeing initiatives
category at the UK’s Food and Drink
Federation Community Partnership Awards,
which recognise the UK food and drink
sector’s commitment to the community.
Europe
Many of our mainland Europe plants 
offer similar health programmes to the UK.
Programmes include Company-sponsored
fitness programmes; health and wellbeing
awareness campaigns; healthy menu
options in employee restaurants and annual
health and fitness check-ups. 
Americas
Throughout North America, Tate & Lyle 
offers an outsourced counselling service, 
the Employee Assistance Programme, 
to employees and their families. Many 
plants offer exercise facilities or Company-
sponsored fitness programmes. In Decatur,
Illinois for example, Tate & Lyle has a Healthy
Lifestyles Task Force run by employee
volunteers which plans and implements a
variety of activities to promote health and
fitness such as an annual health fair, 
flu vaccinations, exercise programmes 
and regular presentations on a variety 
of health-related topics.
Outlook
While our occupational health programmes
will continue to be managed locally to meet
employees’ needs, in 2006 we aim to share
ideas and best practice more widely across
Tate & Lyle.
Commercial
partners/suppliers
Long-term, good relationships with our
partners and suppliers are very important 
at Tate & Lyle. We have a consistent, 
Group-wide approach, based on our 
Code of Conduct, which covers purchasing
strategies at global, regional and local levels.
We pride ourselves on our supply chain
ethics, and are committed to sharing 
best practice and improving standards
amongst suppliers.
Calendar year 2005 highlights
Auditing
Managing supplier relationships for the
benefit of both parties requires regular,
consistent auditing. We continue to develop
our supplier audit system, paying closer
attention to supply chain ethics, while our
risk management programme focuses on
supply chain risks at a strategic level.
Raw materials suppliers
Across the Group we have long-standing 
and mutually beneficial relationships with 
our growers of sugar cane, sugar beet,
maize and wheat. We apply rigorous
standards to our raw materials suppliers,
and survey many of them on their ethical
commitment. We work closely with them to
ensure compliance with our needs,
implementing traceability and ensuring that
our customers’ requirements over issues
such as genetic modification are fully met. 
In June 2005, we strengthened our
commitment to improving practices in 
the raw sugar supply chain by hosting 
the first meeting of ‘Better Sugar, Better
Business’, a joint IFC (International Finance
Corporation)/WWF (Worldwide Fund 
for Nature) initiative on improving the
environmental and social impacts of cane
growing. Since that meeting, the initiative
has formed a steering group, of which 
Tate & Lyle is a member, and the group 
is now drafting its terms of reference.
In previous reports we have highlighted the
long-term relationship we have with suppliers
of raw sugar for our European Union (EU)
refining business, acting as a conduit for the
EU’s policy of providing advantageous prices
to these suppliers. Clearly, the reduction in
prices agreed by the EU under the new
sugar regime will significantly reduce this
benefit to our suppliers. The African,
Caribbean and Pacific (ACP) countries 
are currently in discussion with the EU
Commission on a package of accompanying
measures to help them adapt to these new
circumstances. This is a direct negotiation
between the countries themselves and the
Commission. However, we have stressed
that these packages must be wholly
adequate, correctly targeted, and efficiently
delivered in a timely way. 
Information about the impact on Tate & Lyle
of changes to the EU sugar regime are
described in the Chief Executive’s Review 
on page 11.
Safety and environment programmes
Reflecting our commitment to sharing best
practice and improving standards amongst
suppliers, Sugars, Europe, has begun to
involve commercial partners in both safety
and environment programmes. 
Safety
■ Monthly safety meetings: all contractors
are now invited to send a representative
to our monthly safety meetings, with each
contractor organisation taking it in turn 
to act as host. The host contractor gives
a presentation on how their organisation
manages safety, and explains what they
can offer Tate & Lyle in terms of good
practice. The meeting serves as a general
learning session for everyone, sharing
best practice between contractor
organisations as well as with Tate & Lyle. 
■ Behavioural auditing: Tate & Lyle has
introduced behavioural safety auditing 
for contractors, using our own system.
Each contractor group now performs
three audits per month. 
■ STOP: this year Tate & Lyle offered STOP
(Safety Training Observation Programme)
to contractors for the first time. One
contractor organisation will begin running
the programme as a pilot in 2006, and it
will then be rolled out to others, who will
run it with Tate & Lyle facilitating.
■ Awards: each month we have a
contractor award for safety, in addition 
to our employee award. We have also 
set up a contractors’ annual safety
league table to encourage them to
improve performance.
■ Contractor ‘passports’: Tate & Lyle has
signed up to the Construction Industry
Training Board’s ‘passport’ scheme,
which has been introduced as a
requirement for contractors in certain
construction and manufacturing roles.
Under the scheme, contractors complete
a training course on the fundamentals of
safety in construction and manufacturing,
and receive a passport to certify that they 
can work at any site that requires one. Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006  39
This system is an efficient way of
ensuring that each individual contractor
has the necessary safety training to 
work on our sites, and makes it easier 
for contractors to certify their suitability 
for a job. 
Environment
Tate & Lyle joined with UK organisation
Envirowise to set up a programme to help
suppliers improve their business efficiency 
by minimising waste and maximising cost
savings. A group of suppliers attended the
launch workshop at Thames Refinery, and
are now benefiting from practical plans for
their businesses covering a range of
subjects from waste management and
minimisation and packaging optimisation 
to environmental management systems 
and environmentally-driven procurement.
Sustainable procurement
We are reviewing procurement to look 
at how Tate & Lyle can encompass
sustainability more fully in our strategies. 
As part of that process, we have signed 
up to the Mayor of London’s Green
Procurement Code, an initiative to help
companies based in London to identify 
best practice in recycling waste and 
buying products manufactured from 
recycled materials. 
Managing suppliers: Tate & Lyle’s
Business Code of Conduct
Tate & Lyle’s Business Code of Conduct
applies unconditionally to all parts of the
wholly-owned Group, and we also aim to
apply the Code in those operations in which
we have a 50% stake or more. Where we
have a minority stake, we encourage our
partners to adopt the Code. In contracting
rounds with suppliers and when issuing
purchase orders, we attach the Code of
Conduct, and require them to notify us
immediately if they have any issues with it.
Every division within Tate & Lyle must
confirm twice a year that the Code is being
communicated to suppliers, and report any
contraventions. Suppliers who persistently
contravene the Code may be faced with
termination of their contracts.
Outlook
In 2006, we aim to continue to improve
standards in our supply chain through
developing our work on supply chain 
ethics, risk management and sustainable
procurement, and by working increasingly
closely with suppliers to share best practice 
on a range of issues. We will continue 
to develop our supplier audit programme 
to ensure consistently high standards across
the Group. 
Communities
Tate & Lyle aims to play a positive role in all
the communities in which we operate. Over
the years we have developed a Group-wide
community involvement policy that forms
one of the core components underpinning
our ethical behaviour. Our programme
involves building long-term relationships 
with local partners to deliver a shared
objective: establishing strong, safe and
healthy communities by investing time 
and resources into projects that directly
address local needs.
Our community partnerships are very well
supported by employees, many of whom
take part in local community programmes.
These benefit our employees by enhancing
their own local communities, offering
significant personal development
opportunities and making Tate & Lyle a
company for which they are proud to work.
Calendar year 2005 highlights
Charitable donations
Our Corporate Donations Committee
oversees community policy throughout the
world in order to improve internal standards,
select projects that target local needs and
deliver the most positive impact, and to
ensure that ultimately our community
involvement work reflects our broader
responsibilities as a company. Our guidelines
for funding and support are: Education –
50%; Environment – 25%; Health – 15%;
Arts – 10%.
In the financial year to 31 March 2006, 
Tate & Lyle’s total worldwide charitable
donations were £766,000. Our total 
global pro bono contribution in goods and 
services is estimated to have been £193,000,
up from £188,000 in the previous year.
We support many local organisations
involved in community activities all round 
the world. Listed here are the top three 
in each region in 2005:
■ UK: Tate Britain, London Bombings 
Relief Charitable Fund, Community Links;
■ Europe (excluding UK): Razgrad Disabled
Children’s Centre (Bulgaria), Telethon for
genetic disease research (France), Union
of Blind People (Slovakia);
■ Americas: American Red Cross, Millikin
University, Community Foundation of
Decatur; and
■ Vietnam: Road-building programme,
housing support programme for local
communities, ‘For the future’ support 
for schools programme.
Key achievements
Tate & Lyle employees around the world
make huge efforts to support their local
communities. Here we highlight just some 
of the great stories from each region.
■ UK
– Educational visits: 850 students, up
from 660 last year, and 95 teachers
visited our locations during 38
curriculum-based visits.
– Citizenship Week: 23 schools, up from
17 last year, participated in a range 
of citizenship activities during this 
Tate & Lyle-sponsored event.
– Ideas Factory at Tate Britain: 180
Newham primary school children
completed the six-month project that
uses original works of art to improve
language and literacy skills, supported
by 15 employee volunteers.
■ Europe (excluding UK)
– Bulgaria: Tate & Lyle continued 
to support the development of a
rehabilitation centre in Razgrad for
social integration of children needing
special care, donating further funds 
for its expansion.
– France: Tate & Lyle sponsored the
local Telethon, a one-day event in
France devoted to raising money 
for research into genetic diseases.
– Slovakia: Tate & Lyle donated money
to support local disabled people,
including wheelchair purchase and 
and guide dog sponsorship.
■ Americas
– ‘Project Success’: Tate & Lyle
supported this innovative programme
in Decatur and Macon County that
helps children succeed at school.
– University of Illinois: Tate & Lyle
supports a number of research
initiatives at the University of Illinois,
the state’s flagship university. 
– City of Loudon: Tate & Lyle provided
funding for the ‘Tate & Lyle Performing
Arts Center’ in Loudon’s Municipal
Park. The Center hosts a variety of
musical and theatrical performances. 40 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
OPERATING AND FINANCIAL REVIEW CONTINUED
■ Vietnam
– Support programmes for local

– Rural housing project to improve living
standards in local communities.
UK community survey results
Again this year we sent out a questionnaire
with our UK Community Involvement Report.
Responses from the questionnaire showed
that our performance continues at its
traditionally high level. Our willingness 
to support community partners was rated 
at 98%, while some 58% of respondents
reported an improved capability to help 
their target cause, with the same number
reporting an improvement in their facilities 
or environment.
Managing our impact
Our aim is to ensure that our Community
Involvement Policy, ratified by the Board, 
is followed wherever we operate. While 
we made progress in 2005 in developing
community activities in all our locations,
there remain different levels of community
activity in our various geographical locations,
reflecting the history of Tate & Lyle’s
involvement in the area.
Our global Corporate Donations Committee,
which oversees community policy, will
continue to share best practice and improve
internal standards and reporting across 
Tate & Lyle to ensure that in future, all parts
of the Group develop mutually beneficial
long-term community partnerships.
Employee volunteering
The time and effort our employees spend 
on community involvement work is vital to
maintaining the long-term good relationships
we have developed with the communities in
which we operate: volunteering brings skills
and experience from the workplace into the
community that corporate funding alone
cannot achieve. Of the organisations we
support, several have been partners for 
over a decade and our employees join their
committees, advocate their causes in the
wider community and provide mentoring 
and business skills. 
Volunteering also brings benefits to 
Tate & Lyle. Employees tell us that they
benefit hugely from community work, which
helps them develop their skills and become
more rounded as individuals. A strong
volunteer network is vital to the success of
our community involvement programme, and
developing that network across Tate & Lyle 
is an important ongoing aim. 
Outlook
Our aim for the coming year continues to 
be to integrate our community efforts around
the world into one global programme. While
work continued in 2005 to share expertise
between locations where we have long-
running, successful partnerships with local
organisations with our newer operations,
there is still work to be done to ensure that
wherever we operate, Tate & Lyle makes 
a positive contribution and is a valued part 
of the local community.

Directors’ Responsibilities for the Accounts
The directors are responsible for preparing

Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the
European Union, and for preparing the
parent company financial statements and 
the Directors’ Remuneration Report in
accordance with applicable law and United
Kingdom Accounting Standards (United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting
Practice). 
The directors are responsible for preparing
financial statements for each financial 
year which give a true and fair view, in
accordance with IFRS as adopted by the
European Union, of the state of affairs of the
Group and of the profit or loss of the Group
and a true and fair view, in accordance 
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of affairs 
of the Company for that period. In preparing
those financial statements, the directors are
required to:
■ select suitable accounting policies and
then apply them consistently;
■ make judgements and estimates that 
are reasonable and prudent; and
■ state whether the Group financial
statements comply with IFRS as 
adopted by the European Union, and
with regard to the parent company
financial statements whether applicable
accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material
departures disclosed and explained

financial statements and the Directors’

Companies Act 1985. They are also
responsible for safeguarding the assets 
of the Company and the Group and hence
for taking reasonable steps for the
prevention and detection of fraud 
and other irregularities.
So far as each director is aware, there is no
relevant audit information (that is, information
needed by the Company’s auditors in
connection with preparing their report) of
which the Company’s auditors are unaware.
Each director has taken all the steps that 
he/she ought to have taken in his/her duty

Company is required to state whether 
it has complied with the provisions set

on Corporate Governance issued by the
Financial Reporting Council in July 2003 
(the Code) and, where the provisions have
not been complied with, to provide an

to explain how it has applied the principles
set out in the Code.
The paragraphs below, together with the
Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages

Company applies the principles and
complies with the provisions of the Code.
Compliance with the Combined Code
Throughout the year ended 31 March 2006,
the Company was in compliance with the
provisions and applied the principles of 
the Code except that, as a consequence 
of changes to the composition of the Board
described in the Directors’ Report on 
page 46, from the beginning of the year 
to 1 May 2005 and from the date of the
Annual General Meeting (AGM) on 28 July
2005 to 1 January 2006, at least half the
Board, excluding the Chairman, did not
consist of independent non-executive
directors. Since the appointment of Robert
Walker as an independent non-executive
director from 1 January 2006, the Board’s
composition has been in compliance with
the Code. 
At the date of this Annual Report, the 
Board considers that the Company is in
compliance with the applicable provisions 
of the Code.
Board of Directors
The Board is collectively responsible for
promoting the success of the Company 
and for providing entrepreneurial leadership
within a framework of prudent and effective
controls that enable risk to be assessed and
managed. It sets the Company’s strategic
aims and ensures that necessary financial
and human resources are in place to enable
these objectives to be met and undertakes
reviews of management performance. 
In addition, the Board sets the Company’s
values and standards and ensures that its
obligations to its shareholders and others 
are understood and met.
The Board has a formal schedule of matters
reserved to it for its decision. This schedule 
is reviewed annually and includes approval of:

or divestments;
■ annual and interim financial results; 
■ safety and environmental policies;
■ appointments to the Board and as
Company Secretary;

management; and
■ dividend policy.
Other specific responsibilities are delegated 
to Board Committees which operate within
clearly defined terms of reference. Details 
of the responsibilities delegated to the Board
Committees are given on pages 50 to 52. 
The Board meets at least eight times each
year. Two meetings usually take place at 
an operating subsidiary or joint venture
company. Board meetings are structured 
to allow open discussion and all directors
participate in discussing the strategy, 
trading and financial performance and 
risk management of the Company. The chart
below shows the approximate time the Board
has taken to consider agenda items during
the year separated into general categories.
All substantive agenda items have
comprehensive briefing papers which are
circulated five days before the meeting.
Members of executive management attend
Board meetings and make presentations 
to the Board on a regular basis. 
The Company Secretary is responsible for
ensuring that Board procedures are followed
and that applicable rules and regulations are
complied with. All directors have access to
the advice and services of the Company

and six non-executive directors. 
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   49
With the exception of the Chairman, who 
is presumed under the Code not to be
independent, the Board considers all the
non-executive directors to be independent
other than Carole Piwnica who is a former
Chairman of Amylum Europe N.V. and is
paid by the Group for consultancy services
which she performs in addition to her duties
as a non-executive director. Details of the
terms of her consultancy agreement are
given in the Directors’ Remuneration Report
on page 59.
In terms of the Code, at the date of 
this Annual Report, the Board currently
comprises five independent directors, five
non-independent directors (including the 
four executive directors) and the Chairman. 
Richard Delbridge is the Senior Independent
Director and is available to shareholders if
they have any issues or concerns. 
The non-executive directors have a wide
range of skills and knowledge and combine
broad business and commercial experience
with independent and objective judgement.
The names and biographical details of the
current directors are given on pages 42 
and 43. The Board is aware of the other
commitments of its non-executive directors
and is satisfied that these do not conflict
with their duties as directors of the
Company. Changes to the commitments 
of the non-executive directors are reported
to the Board. 
The terms and conditions of appointment 
of the non-executive directors are available
for inspection at the Company’s registered
office and will be available for inspection at
the AGM.
Re-election of directors
The Company’s Articles of Association
require the re-election of one-third of the
Board (or the nearest whole number below
one-third) at each AGM. All directors are
subject to re-election at least once every
three years. Any directors appointed by 
the Board since the last AGM must stand 
for re-election at the next AGM. Any non-
executive directors who have served for
more than nine years will be subject to
annual re-election.
The names of the directors retiring and
standing for re-election at the 2006 AGM 
are set out on page 46. Further details are
given in the letter from the Chairman to
shareholders in relation to the 2006 AGM. 
Information, induction and professional
development
The Chairman, with the assistance of the
Company Secretary, is responsible for
ensuring that the directors receive accurate,
timely and clear information on all relevant
matters.
On appointment to the Board, directors
receive a comprehensive induction
programme which includes site visits and
meetings with senior management across
the businesses and Group functions. New
directors also receive a pack of background
reading about the Group and details of
Board procedures and other governance-
related matters. Major shareholders have
been offered the opportunity to meet new
non-executive directors as part of their
induction programme. 
Training and updates on particular issues 
are arranged for directors, as appropriate, 
on an ongoing basis taking into account
their individual qualifications and experience. 
The Company Secretary also helps directors
to undertake any other professional
development they consider necessary or
desirable to assist them in carrying out their
duties as directors or as members of the
relevant Board Committees. During the year,
this included attendance by directors at
external training sessions and seminars run
by independent organisations on accounting
and governance-related matters.
Visits to external events or organisations 
are also arranged for the Board to help the
non-executive directors in particular to gain 
a deeper insight into the Group’s strategy
and business activities. During the year, the
Board visited the Food Ingredients Europe
Fair in Paris and also Leatherhead Food
International in the UK, a provider of
consumer research and sensory testing
services.
Performance evaluation
During the year, the Board carried out an
evaluation of the effectiveness of the Board
and its Committees. As in previous years,
this was an internal exercise led by the
Chairman. 
The 2006 evaluation involved the Chairman
holding one-to-one performance evaluation
meetings with each director, the Company
Secretary and the Group Human Resources
Director. A number of assessment areas,
both on an individual and a collective basis,
were identified by the Chairman in advance
of these meetings which were used as 
the framework for the discussions. 
The effectiveness of the changes made 
to the Board’s processes and procedures
following the evaluation in 2005 were one 
of the areas discussed. The Chairman
summarised the main themes and
comments arising from the meetings 
and presented a report to the Board for
discussion. The Board concluded that 
it was operating in an effective manner 
but identified some areas where further
improvements could be made such as to 
the format of strategic papers provided to
the Board and the content of the agenda for
the annual full day Board meeting to discuss
the Group’s strategy.
With regard to the performance of individual
directors, following the evaluation process,
the Chairman concluded that each director
continues to make an effective contribution
to the work of the Board, is well prepared
and informed concerning items to be
considered by the Board, has a good
understanding of the Group’s businesses
and their commitment to the role remains
strong (evidenced by the Board and
Committee attendance records set out 
in this report). 
During the year, the non-executive directors
met together without the Chairman present,
under the chairmanship of the Senior
Independent Director, to appraise the
Chairman’s performance (the Senior
Independent Director having first sought the
views of the executive directors). In addition,
the Chairman held a private meeting with the
non-executive directors to appraise the Chief
Executive’s performance and to address any
other matters the non-executive directors
wished to raise. The outcome of both
appraisals was highly positive. 
The Audit, Nominations and Remuneration
Committees each also held an evaluation of
their work and effectiveness during the year,
the results of which were reported to the
Board by the respective Committee
Chairmen. The reviews concluded that 
each Committee was operating in an
effective manner.
Shareholder communications
The Chief Executive, Group Finance Director
and Director of Investor Relations, with 
the support of the Chairman and Senior
Independent Director, maintain a regular
programme of visits and presentations to
major institutional shareholders. A detailed
report of these discussions and meetings 
is provided to the Board each time it meets.  50 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
In addition, all directors receive copies 
of reports issued by analysts and brokers 
on the Company. During the year, the 
Board received a briefing from one of the
Company’s financial advisers on investors’
perceptions of Tate & Lyle and its investor
relations activities.
The non-executive directors are encouraged 
to attend presentations to analysts and
shareholders, and in particular the
presentations that take place on the
publication of the Company’s interim 
and annual results. 
The Chairman provides feedback to the
Board on any matters raised with him by
major shareholders. 
Some 250 shareholders normally attend the
AGM and are invited to ask questions and
meet informally with the directors after the
formal proceedings have ended. The level 
of proxy votes lodged for and against 
each resolution, together with the level 
of abstentions, are announced at the AGM
following each vote on a show of hands. 
The Company aims to present a balanced
and understandable assessment in all its
reports to the public and to regulators. 
Key announcements, financial reports and
other information about the Group can 
be found on the Company’s website at
www.tateandlyle.com.
Board Committees
There are four main Board Committees:
Chairman’s; Nominations; Remuneration;
and Audit. The terms of reference of each
Committee are reviewed annually by the
Board, are available upon request from the
Company Secretary and are on the Group’s
website at www.tateandlyle.com.
The Committees are provided with sufficient
resources to undertake their duties through
access to the services of the Company
Secretariat and, if deemed necessary, can
obtain independent professional advice at
the Company’s expense. The Company
Secretary, Robert Gibber, is Secretary to
each Board Committee.

the appointment of a successor to the
Chairman of the Board when the Senior
Independent Director chairs the Committee).
In terms of the Code, at the date of this
Annual Report, the Committee comprises 
a majority of independent non-executive
directors. 
The main responsibilities of the Committee
are:
■ to review the size and composition of 
the Board including the planning of
succession to the Board and the
leadership needs of the Group generally;
■ to make recommendations to the Board
on candidates for appointment as
executive and non-executive directors
and as Company Secretary, taking into

proposed re-election of directors retiring
by rotation at the AGM.
During the year, two non-executive directors,
Dr Barry Zoumas and Robert Walker, were
appointed to the Board. In the case of each
appointment, the Committee first considered
the particular skills, knowledge and
experience that would most benefit the
Board. External recruitment consultants were
engaged who provided the Committee with
a shortlist of potential appointees from which
candidates were interviewed and then
selected for recommendation to the Board
for appointment.

Robert Walker (from 1 January 2006) 1/1
Allen Yurko (until 28 July 2005) 2/2
Dr Barry Zoumas (from 31 May 2005) 3/3
The Committee consists solely of
independent non-executive directors. 
All the Committee members have 
extensive management experience in 
large international organisations and the
Chairman, Richard Delbridge, who is a
chartered accountant, is a former group
finance director of a FTSE 100 company. 
The Committee meets four times each year.
The Chairman, Chief Executive, Group
Finance Director, Head of Internal Audit and
other members of the senior management
team (as invited by the Committee), together
with the external auditors, usually attend
meetings. Non-executive directors who are
not members of the Committee are also
invited to attend meetings to provide advice
as necessary. The minutes of each meeting
are circulated to all members of the Board.
Both the Head of Internal Audit and the
external auditors have access to the
Chairman of the Committee outside 
of formal Committee meetings. 
The Committee maintains a formal calendar
of items which are to be considered at each
Committee meeting and within the annual
audit cycle to ensure that its work is in line
with the requirements of the Code. 
The main responsibilities of the Committee
are:
■ to monitor the integrity of the interim and
annual financial statements and any
formal announcements relating to the
Company’s financial performance, paying
particular attention to significant reporting
judgements contained therein including
critical accounting policies and practices;
■ to review the Group’s internal financial
controls and its internal control and risk
management systems;
■ to review and monitor the external
auditors’ independence and objectivity
and the effectiveness of the audit
process, taking into consideration
relevant UK professional and regulatory
requirements; 
■ to make recommendations to the Board,
for submission to shareholders for their
approval in general meeting, in relation 
to the appointment, re-appointment and
removal of the external auditors and 
to approve the remuneration and terms 
of engagement of the external auditors;
■ to monitor and review the effectiveness 
of the Internal Audit function; 
■ to develop and implement a policy on 
the engagement of the external auditors
to supply non-audit services; and
■ to review arrangements by which
employees may, in confidence, raise
concerns about possible improprieties 
in matters of financial reporting, financial
control or other matters.
During the year the Audit Committee
discharged its responsibilities as set out 
in its terms of reference by undertaking 
the following work:
■ meeting prior to the Board meeting 
at which the annual report and financial
statements, and the interim report and
financial statements were approved. 
In doing so, the Committee reviewed
significant accounting policies, financial
reporting issues and judgements and
reports from the external auditors;
■ reviewing the effectiveness of the external
audit process, the external auditors’
strategy and plan for the audit, and the
qualifications, expertise, resources and
independence of the external auditors; 
■ agreeing the terms of engagement and
fee of the external auditors for the audit
and recommending to the Board that
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP be
proposed to shareholders at the Annual
General Meeting for re-appointment 
as external auditors to the Company;
■ reviewing the policy on auditor
independence and the provision of non-
audit services by the external auditors; 
■ receiving and considering regular reports
from the Head of Internal Audit on the
Group’s risk management system,
findings from internal audit reviews, 
and the remit, organisation, annual plan
and resources of the Internal Audit
function;
■ undertaking a review of the effectiveness
of the Internal Audit function. The
Committee’s review in 2006 concluded
that the Internal Audit function was
operating effectively;
■ reviewing the Committee’s terms of
reference and its effectiveness and
recommending changes to the Board as
a result of this review. The review in 2006
concluded that no recommendations to
amend the terms of reference were
required and that the Committee was
operating in an effective manner;
■ reviewing the Annual Report disclosure
items relevant to the Committee including
the going concern statement and the
reports on risk management and internal
control;
■ reviewing the potential impact on the
Group’s financial statements of significant
corporate governance and accounting
matters and reviewing the implementation
of International Financial Reporting
Standards; 
■ reviewing the findings of the external
auditors, their management letters 
on accounting procedures and internal
financial controls and audit representation
letters; 
■ meeting privately with the external
auditors and the Head of Internal Audit; 
■ reviewing procedures under which
employees may, in confidence, raise
concerns about possible improprieties 
in matters of financial reporting, financial
control or other matters; and
■ reviewing an annual report on the 
Group’s system of internal control and 
its effectiveness and reporting the results
of the review to the Board. 
During the year, training was also provided
to Board and Committee members outside
the scheduled meetings on subjects 
of particular relevance.
The Committee operates a policy to
safeguard the objectivity and independence
of the external auditors. This policy sets 
out certain disclosure requirements by 
the external auditors to the Committee,
restrictions on the employment of the
external auditors’ former employees, partner
rotation and procedures for the approval of
non-audit services by the external auditors.
During the year, the Committee reviewed the
processes which PricewaterhouseCoopers
LLP have in place to safeguard their 52 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
independence and received a letter from
them confirming that, in their opinion, they
remained independent. 
The procedure for the provision of non-audit
related services by the external auditors is
governed by a schedule appended to the
policy on auditor independence. This
schedule categorises such services
between:
■ those services which the external auditors
are permitted to provide; 
■ those services which the external auditors
are not permitted to provide; and
■ those services which require approval of
the Audit Committee before the external
auditors can be appointed. 
A report is made to the Committee each
time it meets setting out the non-audit
services provided by the external auditors
during the year and the fees charged. Details
of the amounts paid to the external auditors
for audit, audit-related work and non-audit
work is given in note 7 to the financial
statements on page 81.
Having undertaken a review of the 
non-audit related services provided during
the year, the Committee is satisfied that 
they did not prejudice the external 
auditors’ independence. 
Executive Committees
The senior management team operates
through two executive Committees, the
Group Management Committee and the
Group Operational Committee. 
The Group Management Committee, 
which is chaired by Iain Ferguson, Chief
Executive, oversees the development and
execution of the Group’s strategy and has
overall responsibility for achieving business
results. The Committee comprises the four
executive directors, the Group Human
Resources Director and the Company
Secretary (who is also the Group’s General
Counsel). Biographical details for members
of the Group Management Committee can
be found on pages 42 to 44.
The Group Operational Committee, which 
is chaired by Stanley Musesengwa, Chief
Operating Officer, is responsible for all
aspects of the day-to-day operations and
trading of the Group. The members of the
Group Operational Committee are set out
on page 45.
The two Committees meet regularly, either
in person or by video conference, and at
least four times a year both Committees
meet together.
Risk management
The Board of Directors has overall
responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and risk management. 
The schedule of matters reserved to the
Board ensures that the directors control,
amongst other matters, all significant
strategic, financial and organisational issues. 
The Group’s enterprise-wide risk
management and reporting process, 
which was developed, defined and rolled 
out across the Group by a dedicated risk
management team, assists management
throughout the Group to identify, assess and
mitigate risk. The process, which is designed
to deliver competitive advantage for the
Group, involves the identification and
prioritisation of key risks through an ongoing
programme of workshops, facilitated by the
risk management team, held around the
Group. During the year, over 325 employees
attended 34 risk workshops held throughout
the Group in order to identify risks to the
business. The identified risks then cascade
up through functional and divisional levels 
to the Group Operational and Group
Management Committees. This culminates
in the identification of the Group’s key
business, financial, operational and
compliance risks with associated action
plans and controls to mitigate them where
possible (and to the extent deemed
appropriate taking account of costs 
and benefits). 
Under the process, senior executive
management confirms to the Audit
Committee at least twice a year that these
key risks are being managed appropriately
within their operations and controls have
been examined and are effective.
Responsibility for managing each key risk
and the associated mitigating control is
allocated to an individual executive within
each division. Changes in the status of the
key risks and changes to the risk matrix are
reported quarterly to executive management
and to the Board. The Board reviews the
Group’s key risks quarterly.
Internal control
The Board of Directors has overall
responsibility for the Group’s system 
of internal control and for reviewing its
effectiveness. The Board delegates to
executive management the responsibility 
for designing, operating and monitoring both
the system and the maintenance of effective
internal control in each of the businesses
which comprise the Group. These systems
of internal control are designed to manage
rather than eliminate risk, and can only
provide reasonable and not absolute
assurance against material errors, losses,
fraud or breaches of laws or regulations. 
All the material joint ventures which the
Group are party to currently follow the
Group’s formal systems of internal control
and their internal control procedures are
regularly reviewed by the Group’s Internal
Audit function. The systems of internal
control are based on a process of
identifying, evaluating and managing risks
and include the risk management processes
set out above. These accord with the
guidance in the Turnbull Report and were 
in place throughout this year and up to the
date of the signing of this Annual Report.
The key risks that might hinder the
achievement of the Group’s business
objectives are managed, controlled and
monitored by the processes described
below:
■ the Group’s businesses operate under
mandatory written policies and
procedural manuals to provide an
appropriate control environment. The
Group Policies and Procedures set out
the Group’s commitment to competence,
integrity and ethical values. These policies
are reviewed by the Board annually and
changes are made as appropriate to
enhance existing control procedures;
■ key strategic risks are addressed through
the Group’s process of preparation of
plans by each operating unit and the
compilation of these risks in the Group’s
operating plan;
■ there is a comprehensive annual planning
and financial reporting system comparing
results with plan and the previous year 
on a monthly and cumulative basis. 
This process of planning, budgeting and
making short-term forecasts provides
early warning of potential financial risks.
Revised forecasts for the year are
produced at least quarterly. Reports
include a monthly cash flow statement
projected for 15 months;
■ the Chief Executive, Group Finance
Director and Chief Operating Officer
undertake regular financial and
operational reviews of the major 
operating units within the Group; 
■ the Chief Executive, Chief Operating
Officer and the Group Finance Director
submit written reports to each Board
meeting which include consideration of
changing threats and opportunities within
CORPORATE GOVERNANCE CONTINUED the business. The standard Board review
of investments and disposals includes
identification of major risks that could
affect the outcome of each project, with 
a sensitivity analysis;
■ the Company has defined procedures 
for the authorisation and project
management of capital expenditure 
and investment, granting of guarantees,
trading and hedging of currencies and
commodities and use of treasury
products; and 
■ formal annual reports and presentations
are received by the Board on certain
areas of special risk. These include
insurance, treasury management,
commodity trading, pensions, safety 
and environmental issues.
The Audit Committee periodically reviews the
effectiveness of the system of internal control
through reports from the external auditors
and the Internal Audit function. The Internal
Audit function follows a planned programme
of reviews that are aligned to the risks
existing in the Group’s businesses. They
have the authority to review any relevant
aspect of the business. 
The Board, with the assistance of the Audit
Committee, has conducted an annual
assessment of the effectiveness of the
systems of risk management and internal
control during the financial year and up to
the date of this Annual Report. The review,
which is co-ordinated by the Internal Audit
function, includes a Group-wide certification
that effective internal controls are in place
and being operated effectively. The Internal
Audit function monitors and selectively
checks the results of this exercise, ensuring
that the representations made are consistent
with the results of the department’s work
during the year. Where weaknesses have
been identified, plans for correcting them are
also reported. The results of this exercise are
summarised for the Audit Committee and
the Board. In the event that any significant
losses are incurred during the year as a
result of the failure of controls, a detailed
analysis would be provided to the Audit
Committee and the Board. The Board
confirms that no significant weaknesses
were identified in relation to the review
conducted during the year and accordingly
no remedial actions are required to be taken.

Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee (the
Committee) comprises all the independent
non-executive directors of the Company. 
The current members are: Evert Henkes
(Chairman), Richard Delbridge, Kai
Nargolwala, Robert Walker (appointed from
1 January 2006) and Dr Barry Zoumas
(appointed from 31 May 2005). Evert
Henkes succeeded Allen Yurko as Chairman
of the Committee on 28 July 2005.
The Committee met eight times during the
year. Individual members’ attendance record
at meetings during the year is given in the
table on page 50. The terms of reference 
of the Committee, a copy of which can 
be found on the Company’s website at
www.tateandlyle.com, are reviewed annually
to ensure they meet best practice. 
The Committee conducts a review of its
work and effectiveness each year and any
recommendations from this review are
reported to the Board. The 2006 review
concluded that the Committee had fulfilled
its role and responsibilities appropriately.
The Committee determines the individual
remuneration packages of each executive
director and other members of the Group
Management Committee. This includes base
salary, bonus, long-term incentives, benefits,
and terms of employment including those
upon which their service may be terminated.
Additionally, the Committee approves the
base salary, long-term incentives and
benefits of members of the Group
Operational Committee. In consultation 
with the Chief Executive, the Committee 
also determines the remuneration of 
the Chairman. 
The Chairman (Sir David Lees), Chief
Executive (Iain Ferguson), Group Human
Resources Director (Corry Wille) and
Company Secretary and General Counsel
(Robert Gibber), who acts as Secretary to
the Committee, are normally invited to attend
meetings, although not when their own
remuneration arrangements are discussed.
In addition, non-executive directors who 
are not members of the Committee (Carole
Piwnica) are invited to attend meetings 
to provide advice as required. 
To ensure that the Group’s remuneration
practices remain market competitive, the
Committee receives advice from independent
remuneration consultants. The Committee
operates a policy whereby an individual
consultant appointed to advise the
Committee on the remuneration of executive
directors and certain other senior executives
shall not also advise general management 
on the remuneration of any other executives
in the Group. In accordance with this policy,
during the year the Committee again
appointed Leslie Moss of Hewitt Bacon &
Woodrow Limited (Hewitt) to act as its
principal adviser on executive remuneration
arrangements. In addition to market
remuneration data provided by Hewitt, the
Committee is provided with data from a
survey published by Towers Perrin and has
appointed Kepler Associates to provide Total
Shareholder Return performance data and
ranking information for the Performance
Share Plan and Deferred Bonus Share Plan.
During the year, Hewitt also provided the
Group with consulting services in relation 
to retirement and other benefits, as well 
as general compensation advice and payroll
administration for the new plant in Singapore.
Towers Perrin and Kepler Associates
provided no other services to the Group.
Remuneration policy
The Remuneration Committee is responsible
for setting the remuneration of the executive
directors in accordance with a policy
determined by the Committee and agreed
with the Board. The remuneration policy 
for executive directors and senior executives
is to provide remuneration packages which
attract, retain and motivate high-calibre
individuals to ensure that the Group is
managed successfully to the benefit of
shareholders. To achieve this, the
remuneration package is designed:
■ to be competitive and commensurate
with other international businesses of
similar size;
■ to align the interests of executives and
shareholders by rewarding the creation 
of sustained growth in shareholder value;
■ to reward above average performance;
■ to ensure that performance-related
elements form a significant proportion 
of the total remuneration package; and
■ to take into account local country
practice.
It is intended that this policy continues to
apply for the year ended 31 March 2007 
and subsequent years.
Review of executive remuneration in 2005
In the 2005 Annual Report, we described
the review of the Company’s executive
remuneration arrangements that was
undertaken during the year ended 
31 March 2005.
Following this review, which included
consultation with the Company’s major
shareholders, a number of changes were
proposed to the executive remuneration
arrangements within the context of the
existing remuneration policy. No change was
proposed to the base salary policy but some
changes were proposed to the long-term
incentive elements of the executive
remuneration package. The changes
included: 
■ the cessation of awards under the 2000
Executive Share Option Scheme; 
■ an increase in the target and maximum
awards under the annual bonus scheme;
■ the introduction of a new Deferred Bonus
Share Plan; and 
■ an increase in the maximum award level
of the Performance Share Plan (this was
proposed to enable the overall value of
annual long-term incentive awards to 
be maintained through an increase of
performance shares to replace options).
The changes proposed in 2005 were
designed to make the remuneration package
more effective, promote executive share
ownership, aid executive retention and better
align the interests of executives and
shareholders by making a greater proportion
of the remuneration package dependent on
the success of management delivering
superior shareholder returns. The changes
were explained in the Directors’ Remuneration
Report for 2005 and details provided with the
2005 Notice of AGM. The changes were
approved by shareholders at the 2005 AGM
with over 96% of proxies’ votes lodged
supporting the appropriate resolutions.
The Committee believes that the existing
executive remuneration package, following
the changes approved by shareholders in
2005, remains appropriate and it does 
not propose making any changes to the
remuneration package for the year ending
31 March 2007. Accordingly, for the year
ending 31 March 2007, the annual bonus
scheme, Performance Share Plan and
Deferred Bonus Share Plan will operate 
on the same basis as for the year ended 
31 March 2006.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT Remuneration package
Composition
The current remuneration package for
executive directors consists of base salary,
annual bonus, long-term incentives,
pensions and other benefits. The Company’s
policy is to ensure that a significant
proportion of the total remuneration package
is performance-related, even at target levels. 
The relative proportions of an executive
director’s remuneration, when valued at both
on-target and stretch performance levels 
(on the basis of the expected value of the
long-term incentives but excluding post-
retirement benefits and allowances paid 
in lieu of pensions), are shown in the 
charts below.
Base salary
The Group’s policy is for base salaries 
to take account of the median relative to
similar companies and also to reflect job
responsibilities and the sustained level of
individual performance. The Committee
reviews the base salary of each executive
director annually.
The most recent annual review of executive
directors’ base salaries occurred on 1 April
2006. When undertaking this review, the
Committee considered external market data
supplied by its independent remuneration
adviser, individual performance and also 
the level of pay awards made to other
employees and executives throughout the
Group. The annual base salaries for each

Stanley Musesengwa £470,000 £447,000

Benefits
Benefits comprise principally a company car,
or a cash allowance in lieu, health insurance
and premiums paid on life assurance policies
in relation to pension arrangements. These
benefits do not form part of pensionable
earnings.
Annual bonus scheme
The Group operates an annual cash bonus
scheme for executive directors and senior
executives which is determined by reference
to the performance of the Group, or
appropriate division or subsidiary, primarily
against financial objectives. The Group’s
policy is that annual bonuses payable under
the scheme are capped at 100% of base
salary or lower, dependent on the executive’s
responsibilities. There is a threshold level
below which no bonus is paid. The
Committee reviews the attainment of the
financial targets and agrees the bonus
payments. Bonuses paid to executive
directors do not form part of pensionable
earnings.
For the year ended 31 March 2006, the
target award level for the Chief Executive
was 50% of base salary and for the other
executive directors was 45% of base salary. 
The maximum award level was 100% of
base salary for the Chief Executive and 90%
of base salary for the other executive
directors.
The performance criteria for the annual
bonus scheme are set by the Committee 
at the beginning of each financial year. 
For the year ended 31 March 2006, the
performance criteria consisted of a target
award payable on the achievement of a
predetermined level of Group profit before
tax, exceptional items and amortisation
(PBTEA), and a maximum award payable 
for the achievement of a PBTEA level
significantly in excess of target performance.
The level of PBTEA for target performance
set by the Committee at the beginning of 
the financial year was in line with the market’s
expectations at that time (as provided by
brokers’ forecasts). To ensure that bonuses
are not inflated or deflated as a result of
exchange rate movements during the year,
the PBTEA numbers for bonus purposes are
re-stated on the basis of the exchange rates
used for the Group’s annual business plan
agreed by the Board at the start of the year.
The PBTEA achieved by the Group for the
year ended 31 March 2006, re-stated on 
a constant exchange rate basis, was 13%
above the previous year and exceeded the
predetermined level of target performance,
reflecting the strong performance of the
Group’s value added businesses. As a result,
the Chief Executive received a bonus of 83%
of base salary and the other executive
directors received a bonus of 75% of 
base salary.
Executive directors and other selected senior
executives have the opportunity to invest up
to 50% of their cash bonus for the year
ended 31 March 2006 in Tate & Lyle shares
through the Deferred Bonus Share Plan,
details of which can be found on page 56.
Current long-term incentive arrangements
The Committee believes that performance-
based long-term incentive plans (LTIPs)
provide executive directors and senior
executives with long-term rewards that
closely align with shareholders’ interests 
and are an important component of the
overall executive remuneration package. 
The Company currently operates two LTIPs
being the Tate & Lyle 2003 Performance
Share Plan and the Tate & Lyle 2005
Deferred Bonus Share Plan. The
Remuneration Committee is responsible 
for the operation of both LTIPs.
(i) 2003 Performance Share Plan
Shareholders approved the Performance
Share Plan (PSP) at the AGM in July 2003.
Executive directors and other selected senior
executives are eligible to participate in the
PSP at the discretion of the Committee.
Participants are awarded annually 
a conditional right to receive a number 
of Tate & Lyle PLC ordinary shares in value 
up to a maximum of 175% of base salary
and calculated by reference to the average
of the daily closing prices of Tate & Lyle PLC
ordinary shares during the six months
preceding the beginning of the measurement
period. The number of shares that a
participant receives depends on the Group’s
performance during the measurement period
which is the three years commencing on 
1 April in the year of the award. 
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   55 56 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED
Performance is measured by comparing 
the Total Shareholder Return, or TSR (share
price growth plus reinvested dividends), from
Tate & Lyle PLC relative to a comparator
group of companies. The Committee chose
relative TSR for the PSP as it closely aligns
executives’ and shareholders’ interests and
is an objective measure of the value created
for shareholders. For awards made in 2003
and 2004, the comparator group consisted
of the FTSE 100 Index at the start of the
measurement period excluding companies 
in the telecommunications, media,
technology and financial services sectors.
For the award in 2005 and for this year’s
award, the comparator group consists of 
the companies occupying positions 50 to
130 of the FTSE index at the beginning of
the measurement period. The Committee
considers this to be an appropriate
comparator group for Tate & Lyle given 
the Company’s position in the FTSE 100, the
wide range of market capitalisation between
the lower and upper ends of the FTSE 100
Index, and the fact that the Company is
expected to remain within the proposed 
peer group for the foreseeable future. 
The Committee reviews the continued
validity of the comparator group annually. 
If, at the end of the measurement period,
Tate & Lyle ranks in the upper quartile of 
the comparator group, participants in the
PSP will receive all of the shares conditionally
awarded to them. If the ranking is at the
median level, 25% of the shares will be
received. No shares will be received for
below median performance. For intermediate
rankings between median and upper quartile,
participants will receive a proportionate
number of shares increasing on a straight-line
basis. This vesting scale is illustrated in the
graph at the top of this page.
Irrespective of Tate & Lyle’s TSR, before 
any shares become eligible for release the
Committee must be satisfied that this is
justified by the underlying financial
performance of the Group over the
measurement period.
At the end of the three-year measurement
period the conditional award is converted
into a deferred right to acquire the
appropriate number of shares which will not
be released to the participant for one further
year other than in the specific circumstances
set out in the rules of the PSP . Participants
benefit from dividends on shares which have
already vested during the retention period. 
If a participant resigns during the one-year
retention period, the deferred right to acquire
the appropriate number of shares will lapse.
Details of the measurement of the
performance condition for the PSP award 
in June 2003 are set out on page 59.
(ii) Deferred Bonus Share Plan
Shareholders approved the Deferred Bonus
Share Plan (DBSP) at the AGM in July 2005.
The Committee has the discretion to select
senior employees of the Group to participate
in the DBSP . Currently, participation is
restricted to the four executive directors 
and other key senior executives.
Under the DBSP , executives have the
opportunity to defer up to 50% of their
annual cash bonus (after deduction of tax,
national insurance or other social security
payment) and invest the amount deferred 
in the Company’s shares. Subject to the
satisfaction of employment conditions and 
a performance target over the performance
period, participants will receive awards of
matching shares based on the number of
shares which could have been acquired from
the gross bonus amount deferred by the
participant. Awards of matching shares are
not pensionable in any circumstances.
The performance target is linked to the
Company’s TSR relative to a comparator
group of companies over a three-year
Median 75th

period. Participants must also remain
employees of the Group throughout the
performance period. The Committee chose
relative TSR for the DBSP as it closely aligns
executives’ and shareholders’ interests and
is an objective measure of the value created
for shareholders. For the DBSP award in
2005 and for this year’s award, the
comparator group against which 
Tate & Lyle’s relative TSR performance is
measured is the same as for the PSP , being
companies at positions 50 to 130 of the
FTSE Index at the start of the performance
period. All share prices for the purposes 
of the TSR calculation are based on a
six-month average. The ratio of matching
shares awarded under the DBSP is:
■ If the shares are held throughout the
three-year performance period, and the
executive continues to be employed by
the Company, matching shares are
awarded on the basis of one matching
share for every three shares deferred.
■ Or, if Tate & Lyle’s relative TSR during 
the three-year performance period is
between median and upper quartile of
the comparator group of companies, one
matching share will be awarded for each
share deferred.
■ Or, if Tate & Lyle’s relative TSR during the
three-year performance period reaches
the upper quartile of the comparator
group, two matching shares will be
awarded for each share deferred.
There is no re-testing of the performance
target and no apportionment for intermediate
rankings in the comparator group between
median and upper quartile. During the
performance period, dividends are paid 
on the deferred shares (since the shares 
in effect already belong to the executive) 
but not on matching shares.
The Committee is responsible for the
operation of the DBSP and reviews the
continued appropriateness of the main
features of the DBSP annually. In its review
this year, the Committee discussed whether
it should continue to award participants one
matching share for every three shares
deferred based on continued employment
over the performance period. The Committee
concluded that this award, which would only
give rise to a relatively small number of
shares, remains an important retention
incentive for key executives as the Company
looks to continue to implement its strategy
to grow the contribution from value added
products. The Committee will continue to review the appropriateness of this and the
other main features of the DBSP annually.
Suspended 2000 Executive Share 
Option Scheme
Between August 2000 and June 2004,
options were granted under the Executive
Share Option Scheme (2000 Scheme) 
to executive directors and other senior
executives and employees. In 2005,
however, the Committee decided to
suspend granting options under the 2000
Scheme. Whilst the Committee retains the
discretion to make option grants in the future
in exceptional circumstances, for example, 
in hiring packages, there is no current
intention to make use of this discretionary
power. No options have been granted under
the 2000 Scheme since it was suspended 
in June 2005.
Before options can be exercised under the
2000 Scheme, earnings per share (EPS)
performance criteria need to be met. 
The performance condition attached to 
the exercise of options is scaled such that, 
if over the first three consecutive years, the
growth in the Company’s normalised EPS
has exceeded the growth in the UK Retail
Price Index excluding mortgage interest
payments (RPIX) by an average of:
■ at least 3% per year (9.3% over three
years), then 50% of options granted may 
be exercised;
■ at least 4% per year (12.5% over three
years), then 100% of options granted
may be exercised.
There is no apportionment between the two
fixed vesting points.
Options granted in June 2004 have no
rolling re-test and, accordingly, if they do not
meet the performance condition at the end
of the three-year performance period they
will lapse. Options granted prior to June
2004 which do not meet the performance
condition in the third year may be exercised
in subsequent years (up to ten years after
the date the options were granted) but only 
if the appropriate compound performance
condition is met. 
The achievement or otherwise of the
performance condition is assessed by 
the Committee.
The Committee has ensured that, following
the transition to International Financial
Reporting Standards, the EPS figures
required to carry out the calculation for 
the performance condition have been
calculated on a fair and consistent basis. 
This calculation has been reviewed by 
the Company’s external auditors.
Closed 1992 Executive Share Option
Scheme
Prior to the approval of the 2000 Scheme,
options were granted under UK and
International Executive Share Option
Schemes which were approved by
shareholders in 1992 (the 1992 Schemes).
The exercise of executive share options
granted since November 1995 under the
1992 Schemes is subject to the Group
achieving an increase in fully diluted EPS 
of 6% more than the increase in the UK
Retail Price Index during any period of three
consecutive financial years over the life of 
the option. Since the approval of the 2000
Scheme, no option grants have been 
made under the 1992 Schemes which 
are now closed.
Sharesave Scheme
The Company has a Sharesave Scheme that
is open to all employees in the UK including
executive directors. No performance
conditions are attached to options granted
under the Scheme as it is an all-employee
scheme. Options granted to Scheme
participants are normally set at a discount 
of 10% to the market value of the shares 
at grant.
Executive shareholding policy
To align the interests of executive directors
with those of shareholders, a policy is 
in place under which executive directors 
are expected to build and maintain a
shareholding in the Company equivalent 
to one times base salary. Executive directors
who have not met their target shareholding
are expected to retain a significant
proportion of shares acquired through the
Company’s long-term incentive plans in
order to meet their target.
External appointments
The Board believes that the Company 
can benefit from its executive directors
holding a non-executive directorship. 
Such appointments are subject to the
approval of the Board and are normally
restricted to one for each executive director.
Fees may be retained by the executive
director concerned. 
Stuart Strathdee is a non-executive director
of James Finlay Limited for which the fees
payable are £15,000 per annum. Iain
Ferguson was a non-executive director 
of Sygen International plc (until December
2005) for which the fees payable were
£30,000 per annum. Both directors retained
the fees paid to them during the year in
respect of these appointments.
Pensions
Policy
The Company’s policy is to provide
retirement and other benefits which reflect
local market practice at median levels.
Retirement benefits, in the form of pension
and/or lump sums, are provided through 
tax-approved schemes where possible
covering executives in the country and
business sector in which they perform their
principal duties. The Group’s largest pension
scheme is the UK-based Tate & Lyle Group
Pension Scheme (Group Scheme) which 
is a defined benefit arrangement. The
Company closed the Group Scheme to new
entrants from 1 April 2002 and since then
new employees have been offered defined
contribution type pension provision through
a Stakeholder Plan.
UK pensions tax simplification legislation
During the year, in advance of the
introduction of UK pensions tax simplification
legislation from 6 April 2006, the Committee
reviewed its policy and practices for the
provision of retirement benefits for those
employees who are members of the Group
Scheme, including executive directors.
Following this review, the Committee
decided that:
■ Executives covered under the defined
benefit scheme but not subject to the 
UK statutory Earnings Cap can choose 
to take either a cash allowance in lieu 
of future pension accrual or incur tax
above the lifetime allowance.
■ Executives covered under the defined
benefit scheme but who have been
subject to the UK statutory Earnings Cap,
and currently receive a cash allowance in
lieu of pension as a percentage of base
salary, can elect to give up the cash
allowance in exchange for future pension
accrual on full salary. The Earnings Cap
will not be lifted, however, for past
service.
The cost to the Company of the new
arrangements is broadly the same as for 
the existing pension provision and salary
supplement arrangements. 
Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   57 58 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
Individual executive directors
Stuart Strathdee is a member of the 
Group Scheme and is eligible at age 60 
for a pension equal to two-thirds of his 
basic salary in the highest of his last five
completed tax years. The benefit also
includes a widow’s pension payable on his
death and a lump sum on death in service.
Once in payment his pension (and any
subsequent widow’s pension) is increased
each year in line with the Retail Price Index
(RPI) up to a maximum of 5%, with a
minimum of 3%. Bonuses are not
pensionable. With effect from 6 April 2006,
Stuart Strathdee elected to continue with
future pension accrual and so potentially
may incur tax above the lifetime allowance
(no cash alternative will be paid).
During the year, Simon Gifford was a
member of the Group Scheme eligible 
for pension benefits on the same terms 
as Stuart Strathdee. On 31 March 2006,
however, he opted out of the Group Scheme
and requested that a transfer value of his
accrued pension benefits be paid to external
pension arrangements. The transfer value
was paid on 31 March 2006, details of
which are given on page 63. Following
payment of the transfer value he has
discharged the Group Scheme of all liability
in relation to his accrued pension benefits.
He is not being provided with any further
pension benefits from the Company but
remains covered for the lump sum death 
in service benefit.
Stanley Musesengwa is a member of the
Group Scheme and is eligible at age 62 
for a pension equal to 49.16% of his 
basic salary in the highest of his last five
completed tax years. Historically, his basic
salary for pension purposes has been 
limited to the UK statutory Earnings Cap.
The benefit also includes a widow’s pension
payable on his death and a lump sum on
death in service. Once in payment to him 
or his widow, the pension is increased each
year in line with the RPI up to a maximum of
5%, with a minimum of 3%. Bonuses are not
pensionable. With effect from 6 April 2006,
Stanley Musesengwa elected to forego his
cash allowance in lieu of pension and receive
future pension accrual on full base salary 
(the Earnings Cap will not be lifted, however,
for past service).
Iain Ferguson is not a member of the 
Group Scheme and accordingly accrues 
no pension benefits under this Scheme. 
The Group’s policy is that, to the extent 
that executive directors receive salary which
is not pensionable on a tax approved basis,
they are paid a cash allowance calculated as
a percentage of base salary from which they
make their own pension arrangements. 
Details of the accrued pension benefits for
those executive directors who participate in
the Group Scheme are given on page 63.
Details of amounts paid in lieu of pensions
are included in ‘Allowances’ in the table on 
page 60.
Service Contracts
Policy
The Company’s policy is that contracts for
executive directors should be terminable by
the Company on a maximum of one year’s
notice, except in special circumstances, 
and by the individual director on up to six
months’ notice. In the event of early
termination of an executive director’s
contract, the Company’s policy is to take
legally appropriate mitigation factors into
account in determining the amount of
compensation payable to an executive
director.
Executive directors
All the executive directors have contracts
which are terminable by the Company on
not more than one year’s notice and by the
individual director on six months’ notice. 
As regards mitigation, in a case where 
the Company seeks early termination of 
the contract (other than where summary
dismissal is appropriate), the service
contracts for Iain Ferguson and Stanley
Musesengwa, both signed in 2003, give 
the Company the right, but not the
obligation, to pay in lieu of notice the salary
and contractual benefits which the director
would have received during the notice
period. Accordingly, the Company may 
elect to make a reduced payment under
those service contracts, or require phased
payment, so as to ensure the relevant
director fulfils his obligation to mitigate 
his losses.
In the case of the older contracts of Simon
Gifford and Stuart Strathdee, if the Company
seeks early termination of the service
contract (other than where summary
dismissal is appropriate) the Company 
is contractually obliged to provide
compensation to the director equivalent 
to the value of the salary and contractual
benefits which he would have received
during the notice period. 
The details of the executive directors’ service
contracts as at 31 March 2006 are given in
the table below.
Chairman and non-executive directors
Chairman
Sir David Lees was appointed non-executive
Chairman on 1 October 1998 for an initial
period of three years. This appointment 
was extended by the Board upon the
recommendation of the Nominations
Committee until 30 September 2002, 
and continues thereafter terminable by the
Company or Sir David on not less than 
one year’s notice. His fees, which are
reviewed annually, are determined by the
Remuneration Committee in consultation
with the Chief Executive. Following the 
most recent review on 1 October 2005, 
the Remuneration Committee approved an
increase in the Chairman’s fee to £292,500
(2005 – £272,500).

she would have received during the relevant notice period.
2. In the event of early termination of the director’s service contract (other than where summary dismissal is
appropriate), the Company is liable to provide compensation to the director equivalent to the value of the
salary and contractual benefits which he or she would have received during the relevant notice period. Non-executive directors
The Company’s policy is that the fees 
of non-executive directors, which are
determined by the Board, are set at a 
level which will attract individuals with the
necessary experience and ability to make 
a substantial contribution to the Group’s
affairs. The fees paid are commensurate with
those paid by other UK listed companies. 
The non-executive directors do not
participate in the Group’s incentive or
pension schemes, nor do they receive other
benefits except as described below. The
non-executive directors do not have service
contracts or notice periods, but under the
terms of their appointment they are usually
expected to serve on the Board for between
three and nine years, with a review every
three years, subject to their re-election by
shareholders in general meeting. During the
year, on the recommendation of the
Nominations Committee and following a
rigorous review, the Board extended the
terms of appointment for both Richard
Delbridge and Evert Henkes for a further
three-year term. Non-executive directors
have no right to compensation on the early
termination of their appointment. 
The fees received by the non-executive
directors are determined by the Board 
and are reviewed annually. In addition to 
the basic fee for each non-executive 
director and the senior independent director,
supplements are paid to the Chairmen of 
the Audit and Remuneration Committees 
to reflect the extra responsibilities attached
to these positions. A supplement is also 
paid to Dr Barry Zoumas for chairing the
newly formed Tate & Lyle Research Advisory
Group. The most recent review of non-
executive directors’ fees occurred on 1 April
2006. The fees are shown in the table below.
As referred to on page 49, Carole Piwnica
has a consultancy agreement with the Group
which was entered into on 14 August 2000.
This agreement was for an initial three-year
period and thereafter until terminated by
either party giving not less than 12 months’
written notice. In recognition of her
consultancy services, she holds the 
position of ‘Non-Executive Vice-Chairman,
Government Affairs’ for Tate & Lyle and is
paid a fee of €321,000 (£218,933) per
annum. This consultancy agreement will
cease immediately following Carole Piwnica’s
retirement from the Board at the 2006 AGM.
No compensation in lieu of notice will be
paid in respect of the cessation of this
contract.

2003 PSP award TSR performance
As shown in the table below, for the
performance period from 1 April 2003 to 
31 March 2006 in relation to the PSP award
in June 2003, Tate & Lyle’s share price
growth and dividend yields resulted in a 
TSR that ranked Tate & Lyle at 21st position 
(70th percentile) in the comparator group of
companies. This is between the median and
upper quartile performance at which level
the performance condition specifies that
84% of the conditional award made in 2003
converts into a deferred right to acquire 
Tate & Lyle shares. Subject to the rules 
of the PSP , deferred shares will become 
eligible for release at the end of the 
one-year retention period.
The performance condition also specifies
that, before any deferred shares can be
released, the Committee must be satisfied
that the underlying financial performance 
of Tate & Lyle over the performance period
justifies the participants receiving their
shares. For the shares awarded in 2003
under the PSP , the Committee considers 
the underlying financial performance of 
Tate & Lyle over the performance period does
justify the participants receiving their shares.

1. Granted under the 1992 Scheme with an EPS growth performance condition attached (described on page 57) which has been met. These options are exercisable.
2. Granted in 2000 under the 2000 Scheme with an EPS growth performance condition attached (see page 57). The performance condition attached to 50% of these
options was met following the retest (from a fixed base) in 2005. The performance condition attached to the remaining 50% of these options was met at the retest in
2006 (from a fixed base). All these options are now exercisable.
3. Granted in 2001 under the 2000 Scheme with an EPS growth performance condition attached (see page 57) which has been met. These options are exercisable.
4. Granted in 2002 under the 2000 Scheme with an EPS growth performance condition attached (see page 57) which has been met. These options are exercisable.
5. Granted in 2003 under the 2000 Scheme with an EPS growth performance condition attached (see page 57). The performance condition attached to these options
was met at its first test and will be exercisable from 18 June 2006.
6. Granted in 2004 under the 2000 Scheme with an EPS growth performance condition attached (see page 57). These options are not exercisable as they are less than
three years old.
7. Options held, granted or exercised under the Sharesave Scheme. As this is an all-employee share scheme, no performance conditions are attached.
8. No options were granted or lapsed during the year under the 2000 Scheme, the 1992 Scheme and the Sharesave Scheme.
The aggregate of the theoretical gain made by directors on the exercise of options during the year was £66,176 (2005 – £513,118). This is
calculated by reference to the difference between the closing mid-market price of the shares on the date of the exercise and the exercise price
of the options, disregarding whether such shares were sold or retained on exercise, and is stated before tax. The market price of the
Company’s ordinary shares at the close of business on 31 March 2006 was 571p and the range during the year to 31 March 2006 was
449.75p to 616.5p.
DIRECTORS’ REMUNERATION REPORT CONTINUED Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   63
Directors’ pension provision
Iain Ferguson is not a member of the Tate & Lyle Group Pension Scheme (Group Scheme) and accordingly accrues no pension benefit.
Stanley Musesengwa is a member of the Group Scheme but for the year ended 31 March 2006 his pension benefit, as detailed in the 
table below, only relates to that part of his salary up to the UK statutory Earnings Cap (£105,600 per annum for the 2005/06 tax year). 
In accordance with the Company’s policy, because Iain Ferguson and Stanley Musesengwa receive salary which is not pensionable on 
a tax approved basis, they are paid cash allowances in lieu of pension calculated as a percentage of base salary from which they make 
their own pension arrangements (the amounts paid during the year are included in ‘Allowances’ in the table on page 60).
In light of changes to the taxation of UK pension benefits effective from 6 April 2006, benefits accrued by Stanley Musesengwa in respect 
of service after that date are no longer subject to a cap on pensionable earnings. As a consequence, from 6 April 2006 the cash allowance 
in lieu of pension previously paid to him ceased. A cap will continue to apply to benefits accrued in respect of his service prior to 6 April 2006.
During the year, Simon Gifford elected to transfer his benefits out of the Group Scheme and, as a result, at 31 March 2006 he was no longer
entitled to a benefit from the Group Scheme. The cash equivalent transfer value paid in respect of his benefits (excluding additional voluntary
contributions) amounted to £3,716,000. For comparison purposes, the transfer value of his benefits in the Group Scheme at 1 April 2005 
was £3,034,000.
The information below sets out the disclosures required under both the Listing Rules of the UK Listing Authority and Schedule 7A of the
Companies Act 1985.

Dilution
In order to satisfy options granted under the 1992 Executive Share Option Scheme (which was closed in July 2000) and the UK all-employee
Sharesave Scheme, the Company issues new shares. In the ten-year period to 31 March 2006, awards made under the Company’s share
schemes represented 2.9% (2005 – 2.9%) of the Company’s issued ordinary share capital, leaving an available dilution headroom of 7.1%
(2005 – 7.1%).
Employee benefit trust
The Group has an employee benefit trust which is administered by an independent trustee and which holds ordinary shares in the Company
to meet the various obligations under the Group’s long-term incentive plans (granted since August 2000). The trust held 11,533,914 ordinary
shares at 1 April 2005 and 9,028,813 ordinary shares at 31 March 2006.
Iain Ferguson, Simon Gifford, Stanley Musesengwa and Stuart Strathdee, together with all employees, are potential beneficiaries of the trust
and are deemed to be interested in all the shares held in the trust.

INDEX TO THE FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
FOR THE YEAR TO 31 MARCH 2006 66 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
We have audited the Group financial
statements of Tate & Lyle PLC for the year
ended 31 March 2006 which comprise 
the Consolidated Income Statement, the
Consolidated Statement of Recognised
Income and Expense, the Consolidated
Balance Sheet, the Consolidated Cash 
Flow Statement, and the Notes to the
Consolidated Financial Statements. 
These Group financial statements have 
been prepared under the accounting 
policies set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent
company financial statements of Tate & Lyle
PLC for the year ended 31 March 2006 
and on the information in the Directors’
Remuneration Report that is described 
as having been audited.
Respective responsibilities of directors
and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing
the Annual Report and the Group financial
statements in accordance with applicable
law and International Financial Reporting
Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the
European Union are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the Group
financial statements in accordance with
relevant legal and regulatory requirements
and International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland). This report, including the
opinion, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body 
in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion,
accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this
report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether
the Group financial statements give a true
and fair view and whether the Group
financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with the Companies
Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation.
We also report to you as to whether in 
our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the
Group financial statements. The information
given in the Directors’ Report includes 
that specific information presented in the
Operating and Financial Review that is cross
referred from the Business Review section of
the Directors’ Report. We also report to you
if, in our opinion we have not received all the
information and explanations we require 
for our audit, or if information specified by
law regarding directors’ remuneration and
other transactions is not disclosed.
We review whether the Corporate
Governance Statement reflects the
Company’s compliance with the nine
provisions of the 2003 FRC Combined Code
specified for our review by the Listing Rules
of the Financial Services Authority, and we
report if it does not. We are not required 
to consider whether the Board’s statements
on internal control cover all risks and
controls, or form an opinion on the
effectiveness of the Group’s corporate
governance procedures or its risk and
control procedures.
We read other information contained in 
the Annual Report and consider whether it 
is consistent with the audited Group financial
statements. The other information comprises
only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s
Statement, the Chief Executive’s Review, 
the Operating and Financial Review, the
Remuneration Report and the Corporate
Governance statement. We consider the
implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements or
material inconsistencies with the Group
financial statements. Our responsibilities 
do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing (UK
and Ireland) issued by the Auditing Practices
Board. An audit includes examination, 
on a test basis, of evidence relevant to 
the amounts and disclosures in the Group
financial statements. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates 
and judgements made by the directors 
in the preparation of the Group financial
statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Group’s
circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as
to obtain all the information and explanations
which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the Group
financial statements are free from material
misstatement, whether caused by fraud or
other irregularity or error. In forming our
opinion we also evaluated the overall
adequacy of the presentation of information
in the Group financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion:

CONSOLIDATED CASH FLOW STATEMENT  Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   71
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1 Presentation of financial statements
General information
The principal activities of Tate & Lyle PLC are the development, manufacture and marketing of food and industrial ingredients that have been
made from renewable resources. The Group operates more than 65 production facilities in 29 countries, and in numerous partnerships and
joint ventures, located predominantly in Europe, the Americas and in South East Asia. 
The Company is a public limited company incorporated and domiciled in the United Kingdom. The Company has its primary listing on the
London Stock Exchange.
Basis of preparation
These consolidated financial statements are presented for the first time on the basis of International Financial Reporting Standards (‘IFRS’)
adopted by the European Union and have been prepared in accordance with the Listing Rules of the UK Financial Services Authority, and 
the Companies Act 1985, as applicable to companies reporting under IFRS. 
Until 31 March 2005 the consolidated financial statements of the Group had been prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 
and applicable United Kingdom Accounting Standards (‘UK GAAP’). UK GAAP differs in certain respects from IFRS. When preparing the
Group’s consolidated financial statements, management has amended certain accounting, valuation and consolidation methods applied in 
the UK GAAP financial statements to comply with IFRS. To explain how the Group’s reported financial performance and position are affected
by these changes, restatements and explanations are included in notes 40 and 41. 
With the exception of the adoption on 1 April 2005 of IAS32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and IAS39 Financial
Instruments: Recognition and Measurement, the consolidated comparative information in respect of the year to 31 March 2005 has also been
restated to reflect these adjustments. The effects of the adoption of IAS32 and IAS39 on the Group’s equity as at 1 April 2005 are described
in note 41. The accounting policies summarised in note 2 have been applied in the preparation of these consolidated financial statements in 
all periods presented except where noted below. 
The following IFRSs, International Financial Reporting and Interpretations Committee (‘IFRICs’) requirements and amendments thereto have
been adopted earlier than required:
■ December 2004 amendment to IAS19 Employee Benefits permitting the recognition of actuarial gains and losses directly in equity 
(from 1 April 2004);
■ April 2005 amendment to IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement concerning cash flow hedges of forecast 
intra-group transactions (from 1 April 2005);
■ June 2005 amendment to IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement concerning the fair value option (from 1 April 2005).
These consolidated financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention, except in respect of certain financial
instruments and commodities.
These consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling which is the Group’s presentation currency.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates. It also requires management
to exercise its judgement in the process of applying the Company’s accounting policies. The areas involving a higher degree of judgement or
complexity and areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the consolidated financial statements are disclosed in note 3.
The following IFRSs and IFRICs have been issued but have not been early adopted by the Group:
■ IFRIC4 Determining whether an arrangement contains a lease (effective from 1 April 2006) requires the determination of whether an
arrangement contains a lease. The adoption is expected to result in the recognition of additional property, plant and equipment and the
related payables. The impact on the Group’s financial statements is still under review.
■ IFRIC7 Applying the restatement approach (effective from 1 April 2006) provides guidance on hyperinflation accounting. The adoption is
not expected to have a material impact on the Group’s financial statements.
■ IFRS7 Financial instruments: Disclosures (effective from 1 April 2007) introduces new disclosures for financial instruments. It replaces
requirements in IAS32 Financial instruments: Disclosure and Presentation and will introduce additional disclosures in the Group’s financial
statements for the year ended 31 March 2007.
The parent company, Tate & Lyle PLC has not adopted IFRS as its statutory reporting basis. Audited financial statements for the parent
company, prepared in accordance with UK GAAP , are set out on pages 124 to 132. 72 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
CONTINUED
2 Group accounting policies 
Basis of consolidation
(a) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are all entities over which the Group has the power to govern the financial and operating policies, generally accompanying 
a shareholding of more than one half of the voting rights and taking into account the existence of potential voting rights. Subsidiaries are 
fully consolidated from the date on which control is transferred to the Group. They are de-consolidated from the date that control ceases. 
The purchase method of accounting is used to account for the acquisition of subsidiaries by the Group. The recognised identifiable 
assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of a subsidiary are measured at their fair values at the date of acquisition. The interest of minority
shareholders is stated at the minority’s proportion of the fair values of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.
Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring the accounting policies used into line with those
used by the Group. All inter-company transactions and balances between Group entities are eliminated on consolidation.
(b) Joint ventures
An entity is regarded as a joint venture if the Group has joint control over its operating and financial policies. The Group’s interests in jointly
controlled entities are accounted for by proportionate consolidation, whereby the Group’s share of the joint ventures’ income and expenses,
assets and liabilities and cash flows are combined on a line-by-line basis with similar items in the Group’s financial statements. Where
necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of joint ventures to bring the accounting policies used into line with those used
by the Group. The Group recognises the portion of gains or losses on the sale of assets to the joint venture that is attributable to the other
venturers. The Group does not recognise its share of profits or losses from the joint venture that result from the Group’s purchase of assets
from the joint venture until it resells the assets to an external entity. 
(c) Associates
An entity is regarded as an associate if the Group has significant influence, but not control, over its operating and financial policies. Significant
influence generally exists where the Group holds more than 20% and less than 50% of the shareholders’ voting rights. Associates are
accounted for under the equity method whereby the Group’s income statement includes its share of their profits and losses and the Group’s
balance sheet includes its share of their net assets. Where necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of associates to bring
the accounting policies used into line with those used by the Group. When the Group’s share of losses in an associate equals or exceeds its
interest in the associate, including any other unsecured receivables, the Group does not recognise further losses, unless it has incurred
obligations or made payments on behalf of the associate. 
Foreign currency translation
(a) Functional and presentation currency
Items included in the financial statements of each of the Group’s entities are measured using the currency of the primary economic
environment in which the entity operates (the ‘functional currency’). The consolidated financial statements are presented in pounds sterling,
which is its presentation currency.
(b) Transactions and balances
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the transactions.
Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at period end exchange rates 
of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, except when deferred in equity 
as qualifying cash flow hedges and qualifying net investment hedges.
(c) Group entities
From 1 April 2004, the results and financial position of all the Group’s entities that have a functional currency different from the presentation
currency are translated into the presentation currency as follows:
(i) assets and liabilities, including goodwill and fair value adjustments for each balance sheet presented, are translated at the closing rate 
at the date of that balance sheet;
(ii) income and expenses for each income statement are translated at average exchange rates as a reasonable approximation to the rates
prevailing on the transaction dates; and
(iii) all resulting exchange differences are recognised as a separate component of equity.
Prior to 1 April 2004, exchange differences were recognised in retained earnings. Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   73
2 Group accounting policies (continued)
On consolidation exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and other
currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity.
When a foreign operation is sold, such exchange differences that have accumulated since 1 April 2004 are recognised in the income
statement as part of the gain or loss on sale.
Property, plant and equipment
Land and buildings comprise mainly manufacturing sites and administrative facilities. Certain items of land and buildings are carried 
at amounts based upon valuations recognised in accordance with UK GAAP prior to the Group’s adoption of IFRS.
All other property, plant and equipment is stated at historical cost less depreciation and impairment. Historical cost includes expenditure 
that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the items. Subsequent costs are included in the asset’s carrying amount or recognised as a
separate asset, as appropriate, only when it is probable that future economic benefits associated with the expenditure will flow to the Group
and the cost of the item can be measured reliably. All repairs and maintenance expenditures are charged to the income statement during the
financial period in which they are incurred.
Depreciation is calculated using the straight-line method to allocate the cost or revalued amount of each asset to its residual value over 
its useful economic life as follows:
Freehold land: No depreciation
Freehold buildings: 20 to 50 years
Leasehold property: Period of the lease
Bulk liquid storage tanks: 12 to 20 years
Plant and machinery: 3 to 28 years
The assets’ residual values and useful lives are reviewed at each balance sheet date and adjusted if appropriate. An asset’s carrying amount
is written down immediately to its recoverable amount if the asset’s carrying amount is greater that its estimated recoverable amount.
Gains and losses on disposals are determined by comparing the disposal proceeds with the carrying amount and are included in the income
statement.
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the construction of property, plant and equipment are capitalised as part of the cost of those assets.
Leased assets
Leases of property, plant and equipment where the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified 
as finance leases. Assets held under finance leases are capitalised at the lower of the fair value of the leased asset and the present value 
of the minimum lease payments. The corresponding leasing commitments, net of finance charges, are included in liabilities.
Leasing payments are analysed between capital and interest components so that the interest element is charged to the income statement
over the period of the lease at a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability outstanding.
Depreciation on assets held under finance leases is charged to the income statement.
All other leases are treated as operating leases with annual rentals charged to the income statement, net of any incentives granted to the
lessee, over the term of the lease.
Intangible assets
(a) Goodwill
Goodwill is calculated as the difference between the fair value of the consideration exchanged, including directly attributable acquisition 
costs, and the net fair values of the identifiable assets and liabilities acquired and is capitalised. Goodwill is tested for impairment annually 
and whenever there is an indication of impairment and is carried at cost less accumulated impairment losses.
Where the acquired interest in the net fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, 
the excess is recognised immediately in the income statement.
Contingent receipts represent amounts receivable under the terms of the 2004 realignment of the Sucralose business and are deducted 
from the related goodwill. When such goodwill is eliminated, receipts are recognised in the income statement.
Gains and losses on the disposal of a business component include the carrying amount of goodwill relating to the entity sold. 74 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
CONTINUED
2 Group accounting policies (continued)
(b) Patents and other intellectual property
Patents and other intellectual property are shown at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Where the assets
are acquired as part of a business combination, historical cost is based on their fair values as at the date of the combination. Amortisation 
of the assets is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit.
(c) Other acquired intangible assets
Other acquired intangible assets are intangible assets arising on consolidation of acquired businesses and include brands, recipes, customer
relationships and supplier networks. Amortisation of the assets is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit.
(d) Other intangible assets
Other intangible assets mainly includes certain development expenditure and software costs. Costs incurred on development projects (relating
to the design and testing of new or improved products) are recognised as intangible assets when the IAS38 recognition criteria are met.
Capitalised development costs are amortised from the commencement of the commercial production of the product on a straight-line basis
over the period of its expected benefit. Research and other development expenditures are recognised as an expense as incurred.
Development costs previously recognised as an expense are not recognised as an asset in a subsequent period.
Impairment
Assets that have an indefinite useful life are not subject to amortisation and are tested annually for impairment. Assets that are subject to
amortisation or depreciation are reviewed for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts
may not be recoverable. An impairment loss is recognised for the amount by which the asset’s carrying amount exceeds its recoverable
amount. The recoverable amount is the higher of an asset’s fair value less costs to sell and value in use. For the purposes of assessing
impairment, assets other than goodwill are grouped at the lowest levels for which there are separately identifiable cash inflows. Goodwill is
allocated to units representing the lowest level at which goodwill is monitored by the Group’s Board of Directors for internal management
purposes. Further details are given in note 3.
Financial instruments
As explained in note 1, the Group adopted IAS32 and IAS39 for the year ended 31 March 2006 onwards and elected not to restate
comparative information. The accounting policies applied to the Group’s financial instruments from 1 April 2005 are set out below. Prior to
adoption of IAS32 and IAS39 Financial Instruments were accounted for under UK GAAP . The accounting policy previously applied under 
UK GAAP is set out in note 41 which explains the impacts of the adoption of IAS32 and IAS39 on the Group’s equity as at 1 April 2005.
(a) Available-for-sale financial assets
Equity instruments held by the Group and designated as available-for-sale are carried at fair value, with movements in fair value recognised
directly in equity.
(b) Loans and receivables
Non-current receivables and loans granted are carried at amortised cost less provisions for impairment. Movements in carrying value are
recognised in the income statement.
(c) Borrowings
Borrowings are recognised initially at fair value, net of transaction costs incurred. Borrowings are subsequently stated at amortised cost; any
difference between the proceeds (net of transaction costs) and the redemption value is recognised in the income statement over the period 
of the borrowings using the effective interest method. Borrowings are classified as current liabilities unless the Group has an unconditional 
right to defer settlement of the liability for at least 12 months after the balance sheet date.
(d) Commodity trading instruments
Commodity instruments acquired for trading purposes are carried at fair value. Movements in fair value are recognised in the income
statement.
(e) Commodity and treasury hedging instruments
Under IAS39, hedging relationships are categorised by type and must meet strict criteria to qualify for hedge accounting.
(i) Cash flow hedges
Hedges of firm commitments and highly probable forecast transactions, including forecast intra-group transactions that are expected to
affect consolidated profit or loss, are designated as cash flow hedges. To the extent that movements in the fair values of these instruments
effectively offset the underlying risk being hedged they are recognised in the hedging reserve in equity until the period during which the
hedged forecast transaction affects profit or loss, at which point the cumulative gain or loss is recognised in the income statement,
offsetting the value of the hedged transaction. Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   75
2 Group accounting policies (continued)
(ii) Fair value hedges
Hedges against the movement in fair value of recognised assets and liabilities are designated as fair value hedges. To the extent that
movements in the fair values of these instruments effectively offset the underlying risk being hedged they are recognised in the income
statement by offset against the hedged transaction.
(iii) Hedges of net investments
Hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation are designated as net investment hedges. To the extent that movements in the fair
values of these instruments effectively offset the underlying risk being hedged they are recognised in the translation reserve until the period
during which a foreign operation is disposed of or partially disposed of, at which point the cumulative gain or loss is recognised in profit 
or loss, offsetting the cumulative difference recognised on the translation of the net investment.
Hedge accounting is discontinued at the point when the hedging instrument no longer qualifies for hedge accounting. In the case of cash flow
hedging relationships, the cumulative movement in the fair value of the hedging instrument previously recognised in equity up to that point is
retained there until the forecast transaction affects profit or loss, unless the hedged transaction is no longer expected to occur, in which case
the cumulative movement in fair value is transferred to profit or loss immediately. Movements in the fair value of hedging instruments where the
instrument failed to meet the IAS39 hedge accounting criteria or where the movement represents the ineffective portion of a qualifying hedging
relationship are recognised in the income statement immediately as other income and expense or net finance expense, as appropriate.
(f) Embedded derivatives
Where an embedded derivative is not closely related to the host contract and where the host contract itself is not already recognised at 
fair value, movements in the fair value of the embedded derivative are separated from the associated transaction and, except where the
embedded derivative is designated as a cash flow hedging instrument, recognised in the income statement.
(g) Fair valuation
Fair values are based on market values where they are available. For unlisted securities the Group establishes fair value using valuation
techniques. These include the use of recent arm’s length transactions, reference to other similar instruments and discounted cash flow analysis.
Inventories
Except for those items noted below, inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost comprises direct materials and,
where applicable, direct labour costs and those overheads that have been incurred in bringing the inventories to their present location and
condition. Cost is calculated using the ‘first in – first out’ or weighted average cost methods, appropriate to the materials and production
processes involved. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs to completion and costs to be incurred
in marketing, selling and distribution.
Certain items of merchandisable agricultural commodities are stated at market value, in line with regional industry accounting practices.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents include cash in hand, deposits held at call with banks, other short-term highly liquid investments with original
maturities of three months or less, and bank overdrafts which are not considered to be borrowings in nature.
Share capital
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly attributable to the issue of new shares or options are shown in equity 
as a deduction, net of tax, from the proceeds.
Where any Group company purchases the Company’s equity share capital and holds that share either directly as treasury shares or 
indirectly within an ESOP trust, the consideration paid, including any directly attributable incremental costs (net of income taxes), is deducted
from equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders until the shares are cancelled, reissued or disposed of. Where such shares are
subsequently sold or reissued, any consideration received, net of any directly attributable incremental transaction costs and the related 
income tax effects, is included in equity attributable to the Company’s equity holders. These shares are used to satisfy share options granted
to employees under the Group’s share option schemes. The trustee purchases the Company’s shares on the open market using loans made 
by the Company or other loans guaranteed by the Company. 
Provisions
Provisions for liabilities and charges are recognised when the Group has a present legal or constructive obligation as a result of past events,
it is more likely than not that an outflow of resources will be required to settle the obligation and the amount can be reliably measured. 
If the effect is material, provisions are measured using expected future cash flows discounted at a pre-tax rate that reflects current market
assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions are not recognised for future operating losses. A provision for onerous contracts is recognised when the expected benefits 
to be derived by the Group from a contract are lower than the unavoidable cost of meeting its obligations under the contract. 76 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
CONTINUED
2 Group accounting policies (continued)
Income taxes
The charge for current tax is based on the results for the year as adjusted for items which are non-taxable or disallowed. It is calculated using
rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is accounted for using the balance sheet liability method in respect of temporary differences arising from differences between the
carrying amount of assets and liabilities in the financial statements and the corresponding tax basis used in the computation of taxable profit.
In principle, deferred tax liabilities are recognised for all taxable temporary differences and deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that
it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such assets and liabilities are
not recognised if the temporary differences arise from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other
assets and liabilities in a transaction which affects neither the tax profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences arising on investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests 
in joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary
difference will not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax is calculated using the enacted or substantively enacted rates that are expected to apply when the asset or liability is settled.
Deferred tax is charged or credited in the income statement, except when it relates to items credited or charged directly to equity, in which
case the deferred tax is also dealt with in equity.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends 
to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a net basis.
Employee benefits
(a) Pension obligations
Group companies operate various pension schemes. The schemes are generally funded through payments to insurance companies or trustee
payments to insurance companies or trustee-administered funds, determined by periodic actuarial calculations. The Group has both defined
benefit and defined contribution plans.
A defined benefit plan is a pension plan that defines an amount of pension benefit that an employee will receive on retirement, usually
dependent on one or more factors such as age, years of service and compensation.
A defined contribution plan is a pension plan under which the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate entity. The Group has no legal 
or constructive obligations to pay further contributions if the fund does not hold sufficient assets to pay all employees the benefits relating to
employee service in the current and prior periods.
The amounts recognised in the balance sheet in respect of defined benefit pension plans are the difference between the present value of the
defined benefit obligation at the balance sheet date less the fair value of plan assets, together with adjustments for actuarial gains or losses
and past service costs charged or credited to equity. The defined benefit obligation is calculated annually by independent actuaries using 
the projected unit credit method. The present value of the defined benefit obligation is determined by discounting the estimated future cash
outflows using interest rates of high-quality corporate bonds that are denominated in the currency in which the benefits will be paid, and that
have terms to maturity approximating to the terms of the related pension liability. Past service costs are recognised immediately in income,
unless the changes to the pension plan are conditional on the employees remaining in service for a specified period of time (the vesting
period). In this case, the past service costs are amortised on a straight-line basis over the vesting period. The Group has elected to apply the
2004 amendment to IAS19, Employee Benefits, with effect from 1 April 2004. Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments
and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity immediately.
For defined contribution plans, the Group pays contributions to publicly or privately administered pension insurance plans on a mandatory,
contractual or voluntary basis. The Group has no further payment obligations once the contributions have been paid. The contributions are
recognised as employee benefit expense when they are due. Prepaid contributions are recognised as an asset to the extent that a cash
refund or a reduction in the future payments is available.
(b) Other post-employment obligations
Some Group companies provide post-employment healthcare benefits to their retirees. The entitlement to these benefits is usually conditional
on the employee remaining in service up to retirement age and the completion of a minimum service period. The expected costs of these
benefits are accrued over the period of employment using an accounting methodology similar to that for defined benefit pension plans.
Actuarial gains and losses arising from experience adjustments and changes in actuarial assumptions are charged or credited to equity
immediately. These obligations are valued annually by independent qualified actuaries. Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   77
2 Group accounting policies (continued)
(c) Share-based compensation
The Group operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of employee services received in exchange
for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by reference
to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, earnings targets). Non-market
vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. At each balance sheet
date, for options granted with non-market vesting conditions, the entity revises its estimates of the number of options that are expected to
become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the income statement, and a corresponding
adjustment to equity. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and share premium
when the options are exercised.
Revenue recognition
(a) Sales of goods and services
Sales comprise the amount receivable in the ordinary course of business, net of value added and sales taxes, for goods and services
provided. Sales are recognised at the point or points at which the Group has performed its obligations in connection with the contractual
terms of the sales agreement, and in exchange obtains the right to consideration.
(b) Interest income
Interest income is recognised on a time-proportion basis using the effective interest method.
(c) Dividend income
Dividend income is recognised when the right to receive payment is established.
Dividend distribution
A dividend distribution to the Company’s equity holders is recognised as a liability in the Group’s financial statements in the period in which 
the dividends are approved by the Company’s shareholders or, in the case of interim dividends, by the Board of Directors.
Exceptional items
Exceptional items comprise items of income and expense that are material in amount and unlikely to recur and which merit separate
disclosure in order to provide an understanding of the Group’s underlying financial performance. Examples of events giving rise to the
disclosure of material items of income and expense as exceptional items include, but are not limited to, impairment events, disposals 
of operations or individual assets, litigation claims by or against the Group and the restructuring of components of the Group’s operations. 78 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
CONTINUED
3 Critical accounting estimates and judgements 
In order to prepare these consolidated financial statements in accordance with the accounting policies set out in note 2, management has
used estimates and judgements to establish the amounts at which certain items are recorded. Critical accounting estimates and judgements
are those which have the greatest impact on the financial statements and require the most difficult, subjective and complex judgements about
matters that are inherently uncertain. Estimates are based on factors including historical experience and expectations of future events that
management believe to be reasonable. However given the judgemental nature of such estimates, actual results could be different from the
assumptions used. The critical accounting policies are set out below:
Impairment of assets
Asset impairments have the potential to significantly impact income. In order to determine whether impairments are required the Group
estimates the recoverable amount of the asset. This calculation is usually based on projecting future cash flows over a five-year period and using 
a terminal value to incorporate expectations of growth thereafter. A discount factor is applied to obtain a current value (‘value in use’). The ‘fair
value less costs to sell’ of an asset is used if this results in an amount in excess of ‘value in use’.
Estimated future cash flows for impairment calculations are based on management’s expectations of future volumes and margins based on
plans and best estimates of the productivity of the assets in their current condition. Future cash flows therefore exclude benefits from major
expansion projects requiring future capital expenditure where that expenditure has not been approved at the balance sheet date.
Future cash flows are discounted using a discount rate based on the Group’s weighted average cost of capital, adjusted if appropriate for
circumstances specific to the asset being tested. The weighted average cost of capital is impacted by estimates of interest rates, equity returns
and market and country related risks. The Group’s weighted average cost of capital is reviewed on an annual basis.
Retirement benefits
Among the range of retirement benefits provided in businesses around the Group are a number of defined benefit pension plans and an
unfunded healthcare benefit scheme in the United States. The amounts recorded in the financial statements for both of these types of
arrangement are based on a number of assumptions, changes to which could have a material impact on the reported amounts. 
Any net deficit or surplus arising on defined benefit plans and the liability under the healthcare plan is shown in the balance sheet. The amount
recorded is the difference between plan assets and liabilities at the balance sheet date. Plan assets are based on market value at that date.
Plan liabilities, including healthcare liabilities, are based on actuarial estimates of the present value of future pension or other benefits that will
be payable to members. The most sensitive assumptions involved in calculating the expected liabilities are mortality rates and the discount
rate used to calculate the present value. The main financial assumption is the real discount rate, being the excess of the discount rate over 
the rate of inflation. If this assumption changed by 0.1%, the gross plan liabilities would change by approximately £18 million.
The income statement generally comprises a regular charge to operating profit and a finance charge which represents the net of expected
income from plan assets and an interest charge on plan liabilities. These calculations are based on expected outcomes at the start of the
financial year. The income statement is most sensitive to changes in expected returns from plan assets and the discount rate used to calculate
the interest charge on plan liabilities. A 0.1% change in the assumption of the real discount rate would change the finance expense by
approximately £0.4 million.
Full details of these assumptions, which are based on advice from the Group’s actuaries, are set out in note 28.
Provisions
The Group recognises a provision where a legal or constructive obligation exists at the balance sheet date and a reliable estimate can 
be made of the likely outcome. Where appropriate, future cash outflows that are expected to arise over a number of years are discounted 
to a present value using a relevant discount rate.
At the balance sheet date provisions included amounts for insurance claims payable by the Group’s reinsurance company, legal matters,
employee termination costs and amounts payable under the deferred consideration clauses of the realignment of the Sucralose business 
in April 2004.
Although provisions are reviewed on a regular basis and adjusted for management’s best current estimates the judgemental nature of these
items means that future amounts settled may be different from those provided.
Taxation
The Group operates in a large number of tax jurisdictions around the world. Tax regulations generally are complex and in some jurisdictions
agreeing tax liabilities with local tax authorities can take several years. Consequently at the balance sheet date tax liabilities and assets are
based on management’s best estimate of the future amounts that will be settled. While the Group aims to ensure that the estimates recorded
are accurate, the actual amounts could be different from those expected. Deferred tax assets mainly represent past tax losses that the Group
expects to recover at some time in the future and by their nature the amounts recorded are therefore dependent on management’s judgement
about future events. Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   79
4 Segment information
Primary format – business segments
A business segment is a group of assets and operations engaged in providing products or services that are subject to risks and returns 
that are different from those of other business segments. On 2 June 2005 the Group announced a change to the basis on which divisional
performance is reported to reflect its evolving strategy. These divisions are the basis on which the Group reports its primary segment
information, as set out below.

Diluted
Diluted (loss)/earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion
of all potential dilutive ordinary shares. Potential dilutive ordinary shares arise from share options. For these, a calculation is performed to
determine the number of shares that could have been acquired at fair value (determined as the average annual market share price of the
Company’s shares) based on the monetary value of the subscription rights attached to outstanding share options. The number of shares
calculated as above is compared with the number of shares that would have been issued assuming the exercise of the share options.

(a) Adjustments to goodwill include amounts arising under the realignment of the Sucralose business on 2 April 2004 (the ‘realignment’). Under
the terms of the realignment, deferred consideration is payable to McNeil Nutritionals (‘McNeil’) based on the achievement of certain minimum
targets in respect of sales of Sucralose made by the Group (see note 29). Expected future payments were provided for at the time of the
realignment and any changes to the Group’s estimates of the deferred consideration are adjusted to goodwill. Another feature of the realignment
is that the Group receives amounts from the vendor, McNeil, based on sales of Sucralose tabletop products made by McNeil for ten years
from the date of the realignment. These receipts are treated as contingent assets, only recognised in the periods in which they are earned,
and are shown as a deduction from goodwill. On elimination of goodwill the receipts are recognised in the income statement.  Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   87

Goodwill is tested for impairment annually and whenever there is an indication of impairment. Unless otherwise stated, impairment reviews 
are carried out in accordance with the methodology set out in notes 2 and 3. 
Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas goodwill of £73 million includes £53 million relating to the Staley acquisition, which is treated as one
cash generating unit (‘CGU’) for impairment testing purposes, as the business is managed as one entity and it is therefore not appropriate 
to allocate goodwill to individual plants. Cash flows used were based on the latest approved plans for five years discounted at 12%. No
impairment is required.
Goodwill in the Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe division of £102 million includes £90 million relating to the acquisition in 2000, of the
minority of 34% of shares of the former Amylum business. Although cash flows have been identified for individual plants for the purposes 
of assessing the recoverable amounts of property, plant and equipment (as described in note 15) the business is managed as a network, with 
a large amount of interdependency between plants and centralised decision making. Consequently goodwill is monitored at a divisional level
and allocated to a group of plant CGUs for the purposes of impairment testing. As a result of the proposed changes to the EU Sugar Regime,
described in the Chief Executive’s Review, management has concluded that in certain markets the business is unlikely to be able to 
generate sufficient returns to cover its cost of capital. As required by IAS36 the property, plant and equipment has been reviewed first,
resulting in an impairment charge of £263 million as described in note 15. Subsequently, the goodwill has been tested for impairment and the
recoverable amount has been estimated based on the assets remaining after the impairment to property, plant and equipment. Recoverable
amount was based on value in use, which was calculated based on estimated future cash flows using management internal forecasts of
future margins (excluding the impact of any major initiatives) for the next five years. The discount rate used was 11% and zero growth was
assumed in perpetuity due to the regulated nature of the market. As a result of this review management has concluded that the recoverable
amount on a value in use basis of the group of plant CGUs is greater than the remaining net book value of goodwill and assets and
consequently no impairment is required.
The remaining goodwill relates to a number of smaller acquisitions, each of which has been tested for impairment using management
projections for five years and discount rates in the range of 10% to 12%. During the year goodwill of £12 million has been recognised 
on the acquisition of Cesalpinia Foods, part of Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe and £12 million on the acquisition of Continental 
Custom Ingredients, part of Food & Industrial Ingredients, Americas (as described in note 35). No impairment losses were identified in 
respect of these businesses.

Impairment losses
It is the Group’s policy to test assets for impairment whenever events or changes in circumstances indicate that their carrying amounts may
not be recoverable. As a result of the forthcoming changes to the EU sugar regime, which will reduce significantly EU subsidised exports of
sugar and is explained in detail in the Chief Executive’s Review, the Group has carried out an impairment review of the assets in Food &
Industrial Ingredients, Europe and Sugars, Europe. In addition the Citric business in the UK has continued to generate returns below its cost 
of capital and this business has been subject to a similar review. 
Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe is a major supplier of sweeteners which operate in direct competition to sugar throughout Europe. 
As a result of the proposed changes to the EU sugar regime management has concluded that in certain markets the business is unlikely to 
be able to generate sufficient returns to cover its cost of capital. Consequently an impairment review has been carried out by comparing the
recoverable amount of the individual cash generating units with their net book values. For the purposes of the review, individual plants were
used as the relevant cash generating units except for the plants in Belgium and France for which a combined review was performed due 
to the operational interdependency between the two sites. Recoverable amount was generally based on value in use, which was calculated
based on estimated future cash flows using management internal forecasts of future margins (excluding the impact of any major initiatives) 
for the next five years. The discount rate used was 11% and zero growth was assumed in perpetuity due to the regulated nature of the
market. For certain cash generating units the calculation of fair value less costs to sell, based on management estimates in the absence of 
an active market, resulted in recoverable amounts that were higher than value in use. Consequently for those sites the recoverable amount
was based on fair value less costs to sell. As a result of the review an impairment loss of £263 million, allocated pro-rata to the asset base 
of the plants impacted, has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2006.  Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   89
15 Property, plant and equipment (continued)
Sugars, Europe is also impacted by the proposed changes to the sugar regime, however management’s impairment review of this business
did not result in an impairment loss.
The Citric business in the UK has been impacted by margin pressure from increasing raw material and energy costs. An impairment review
has been carried out and an impairment of £9 million has been recognised in the year ended 31 March 2006. Cash flows were forecast based
on management plans for five years and no growth was assumed in perpetuity. The discount rate used was 12%.
Leased assets
Included in property, plant and equipment is £1 million (2005 – £2 million) in respect of plant and machinery held under finance leases.
Capitalised borrowing costs
The aggregate amount of borrowing costs included in the cost of property, plant and equipment is £44 million (2005 – £41 million), of which
£4 million (2005 – £1 million) was capitalised during the year.  90 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006

Fair value hedges
The Group employs currency and interest rate swap contracts to hedge the currency and interest rate risks associated with its borrowings.
The notional principal amounts of the outstanding currency and interest rate swap contracts applied in fair value hedging relationships as 
of 31 March 2006 were £410 million and £200 million respectively.
Net investment hedges
The Group employs currency swap contracts to hedge the currency risk associated with its net investments in subsidiaries located primarily 
in Europe and the United States. The notional principal amounts of the outstanding currency swap contracts applied in net investment
hedging relationships as of 31 March 2006 were £195 million. The fair value loss of £22 million on translation of the currency swap contracts
to sterling at the balance sheet date was recognised in the translation reserve in shareholders’ equity (note 23).
Certain of the Group’s borrowings are also designated as hedges of the net investments in overseas subsidiaries.
Trading contracts
Commodity pricing contracts held for trading relate to the Group’s commodity trading activities.
Interest rate caps
Interest rate caps hedge the Group’s exposure to interest rate risk, but do not qualify for hedge accounting (see note 26). The notional
amounts of the outstanding interest rate caps as of 31 March 2006 were £209 million.

current trade and other receivables are equivalent to their carrying values due to being short-term in nature.
The Group recognised a loss of £1 million (2005 – £1 million) for the impairment of its trade receivables during the period. The loss has been
included in operating income in the income statement.
Included in trade receivables are amounts received of £101 million (2005 – not applicable) in respect of securitised receivables, which are also
included in current borrowings. There is no concentration of credit risk with respect to trade receivables, as the Group has a large number of
customers, internationally dispersed.

(ii) Exercise is dependent on total shareholder return as measured by reference to a comparator group over a three-year period following
grant. Participants are not entitled to dividends prior to the exercise of options.
(iii) Exercise is dependent on earnings per share performance relative to inflation over a three-year period following grant. Participants are not 
entitled to dividends prior to the exercise of options.
(iv) Executives have the opportunity to defer up to 50% of their annual cash bonus (after deduction of tax, national insurance or other social
security payment) and invest the amount deferred in the Company’s shares. Subject to the satisfaction of employment conditions and a
performance target over the performance period, participants will receive awards of matching shares based on the number of shares
which could have been acquired from the gross bonus amount deferred by the participant. During the performance period, dividends are
paid on the deferred shares but not on matching shares. Further details are set out on page 56 of the Remuneration Report.
(v) Options granted in the years to 31 March 2005 and 31 March 2006 were by invitation at a 10% discount to the market price. Options are
exercisable at the end of a three-year or five-year savings contract.
The Group recognised total expenses of £5 million (2005 – £4 million) related to equity-settled share-based payment transactions during

Floating rate borrowings bear interest based on relevant national LIBOR equivalents. If the interest rates applicable to the Group’s floating rate
debt rise from the levels at 31 March 2006 by an average of 1% over the year to 31 March 2007, this would reduce Group profit before tax by
approximately £5 million.

As part of its interest rate management strategy, the Group has entered into interest rate caps for a notional principal amount of £209 million
(2005 – £203 million), capping interest rates at 4% or 5% until 2009 or 2007 respectively.
Taking into account the Group’s interest rate swap and cap contracts, the effective interest rates of its borrowings are as follows:

Short-term loans and overdrafts
Current short-term loans mature within the next 12 months and overdrafts are repayable on demand. Both short-term loans and bank
overdrafts are arranged at floating rates of interest and expose the Group to cash flow interest rate risk.
Credit facilities and arrangements
The Group has undrawn committed multi-currency facilities of £353 million (2005 – £327 million) which expire in 2009. These facilities incur
commitment fees at market rates. The facilities may only be withdrawn in the event of specified events of default. In addition, the Group has
substantial uncommitted facilities. 102 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
26 Borrowings (continued)
At 31 March 2006, a US subsidiary had outstanding external borrowings of US$800 million, the principal amount of which is guaranteed 
by another Group company by way of credit-linked deposits with a bank of US$680 million and pledged bank securities of US$120 million. 
The guarantees result in these borrowings being, in substance, non-recourse to the Group as to principal in the event of default and
accordingly the borrowings and deposits are offset in these financial statements.

2005 was £13 million asset and the fair value was £15 million asset.
2. The fair values of commodity derivatives are calculated as the product of the volume and the difference between their strike or traded price and the corresponding
market price. The market price is based upon the corresponding closing price of that market. Where there is no terminal market and/or the market is illiquid, the
market price is based upon management estimates, taking into consideration all relevant current market and economic factors.
The interest rate exposure of the financial assets of the Group at 31 March 2005 included £108 million on non-interest bearing assets and
£390 million on floating rate assets. The currency exposure of these assets totalling £498 million was as follows: £108 million (sterling);
£171 million (US dollars); £56 million (Euro); £23 million (Canadian dollars); and £140 million (other).
At 31 March 2005 the total net unrecognised gains on hedges were £5 million, which included unrecognised gains of £18 million and
unrecognised losses of £13 million.

27 Deferred tax (continued)
Of the amounts of deferred tax credited to income and equity, £2 million (2005 – £1 million) arises from changes in tax rates and the
imposition of new taxes. Of the amounts of deferred tax credited to income, £2 million arises from the recognition of previously unrecognised
tax losses, where the entities concerned have returned to profit.
Deferred tax assets in respect of unutilised tax losses of £577 million (2005 – £293 million) have not been recognised to the extent that they
exceed taxable profits against which these assets may be recovered.
No deferred tax has been recognised in respect of unremitted earnings of £1.3 billion (2005 – £1.1 billion) where the Group is both able to
control dividend policy and does not anticipate dividends to be remitted in the foreseeable future.

28 Retirement benefit obligations
(a) Plan information
The Group maintains pension plans for its operations throughout the world. Most of these arrangements are defined benefit pension 
schemes with retirement, disability, death and termination income benefits. The retirement income benefits are generally a function of 
years of employment and final salary.
The principal schemes are funded and their assets held in separate trustee-administered funds. The schemes are funded in line with local
practice and contributions are assessed in accordance with local independent actuarial advice. The schemes operated by the Group are
subject to independent actuarial valuation at regular intervals using consistent assumptions appropriate to conditions prevailing in the 
relevant country. The most recent actuarial valuations of plan assets and the present value of the defined benefit obligations were carried 
out as at 31 March 2006 by independent actuaries.
The Group also maintains defined contribution pension schemes and some fully insured pension schemes and multi-employer 
pension arrangements.
On 1 April 2002, the main United Kingdom scheme was closed to new members. A defined contribution pension scheme has been
established to provide pension benefits to new United Kingdom employees. Under the projected unit method, the service cost of the 
closed scheme will increase as the members approach retirement.
The Group’s subsidiaries in the United States provide unfunded retirement medical and life assurance benefits to their employees.
The Group expects to contribute approximately £50 million to its defined benefit plans in the year to 31 March 2007.
(b) Principal assumptions
The principal assumptions used for the purpose of the actuarial valuations were as follows:
Pension benefits

Year to 31 March 2006 UK US Others benefits
Inflation rate 2.8% 3.5% 2.0-2.5% 3.5%

Discount rate 5.4% 6.1% 4.5-5.8% 6.1%
Expected return on plan assets 6.2% 8.0% 4.5-7.0% n/a
The following mortality tables have been used for the principal schemes. For the UK pension scheme the Group has used PMA92CO5MC
(+2.5 year age rating) for male pensioners and PFA92CO5MC (+4.5 year age rating) for female pensioners (2005 – PMA8OCO3 and PA(90)F
(–2 year age rating)). For the US pension schemes the Group has used GAM83M for male pensioners and GAM83F for female pensioners
(2005 – GAM83M and GAM83F).
The expected rates of return on individual categories of plan assets are estimated by reference to indices published by the relevant
exchanges. The overall expected rate of return is calculated by weighting the individual rates in accordance with the anticipated balance 
in the plan’s investment portfolio. The actual rate of return on the plan assets for the year was 14.6% (2005 – 7.2%), and amounted to 
£173 million (2005 – £74 million).
Medical cost trend rates are estimated at between 8.9% and 9.5% per annum (2005 – 10.0-12.0%), grading down to 5% by 2015. 
If medical cost trend rates were to increase or decrease by 1%, the effects are estimated as follows:

32 Net debt
The adoption of IFRS – and of IAS32 and IAS39 in particular – has altered the Group’s net debt profile based on the definitions previously
reported under UK GAAP . Following adoption of IFRS, cash and cash equivalents, bank overdrafts and borrowings now reflect the effects 
of various balance sheet reclassifications as well as the inclusion of the Group’s share of joint ventures’ net debt. Furthermore, derivative
instruments used to manage the currency and interest rate risk of the Group’s net debt profile which were presented as part of cash and 
cash equivalents, bank overdrafts and borrowings are now presented within the classifications derivative financial assets and derivative
financial liabilities.

The Group is subject to claims and litigation generally arising in the ordinary course of its business, some of which are for substantial 
amounts. All such actions are strenuously defended but provision is made for liabilities that are considered likely to arise on the basis 
of current information and legal advice and after taking into account the Group’s insurance arrangements.
Whilst there is always uncertainty as to the outcome of any claim or litigation, it is not expected that claims and litigation existing at 
the balance sheet date will have a material adverse effect on the Group’s financial position. 110 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006

35 Acquisitions
Cesalpinia Group
On 16 December 2005, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Cesalpinia Foods for £32 million, satisfied in cash. The
Cesalpinia Foods group, located in Italy, produces food ingredients, specialising in solutions for dairy products, soups, sauces and dressings. 
The fair values currently established for the acquisition are provisional due to the proximity of the date of acquisition to the Group’s reporting
date. The acquisition has contributed £12 million to sales and £1 million to operating profit in the period since acquisition. If the acquisition 
of Cesalpinia Foods had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group sales for the year would have been £3,747 million and
Group loss attributable to equity holders of the Company would have been £28 million.

Goodwill has arisen on the acquisition of Cesalpinia Foods because of anticipated synergies that do not meet the criteria for recognition as an
intangible asset at the date of acquisition.
Continental Custom Ingredients
On 23 January 2006, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Continental Custom Ingredients (‘CCI’) for £40 million. The CCI
group, based in the United States, produces food ingredients, specialising in dairy stabilisers, emulsifiers, beverage flavours and vitamin and
mineral fortifications. The fair values currently established for the acquisition are provisional due to the proximity of the date of acquisition to 
the Group’s reporting date. The acquisition has contributed £7 million to sales and £nil million to operating profit in the period since acquisition.
If the acquisition of CCI had been completed on the first day of the financial year, Group sales for the year would have been £3,757 million and
Group loss attributable to equity holders of the Company would have been £27 million.

France Melasse
During the year the Group increased its shareholding in France Melasse SA by £4 million. Net assets of £2 million were acquired, giving rise 
to £2 million goodwill on consolidation.
Sucralose
In April 2004, the Group completed the realignment of its Sucralose activities with McNeil Nutritionals (‘McNeil’), a Johnson & Johnson
company, achieved through the separation of that business into its constituent Ingredient and Tabletop parts. The Group acquired the
Sucralose Ingredients business and manufacturing assets from McNeil for an initial consideration of £72 million. In addition, there are
contingent payments treated as deferred consideration, and other receipts treated as contingent assets (note 14), that reflect continued
participation in the success of each party’s own ongoing Sucralose activities. The assets acquired upon realignment were as follows:

36 Post balance sheet events 
In April 2006 the Group acquired the assets and intellectual property of Hycail BV and its Finnish subsidiary Hycail Finland OY for £2 million.
On 23 May 2006 the Group filed suit in the US District Federal Court for Central Illinois against a Chinese manufacturing group based in 
Hebei province as well as six importers of sucralose into the US. The proceedings allege infringement of patented sucralose manufacturing
technology in respect of sucralose manufactured in China.

40 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards
As described in note 1, these Group financial statements are the first such statements prepared under IFRS.
The Group’s transition date was 1 April 2004. At this date, certain changes were made to the Group’s accounting policies under UK GAAP 
in order to bring them in line with IFRS, resulting in a number of adjustments to equity to reflect the effects of retrospective application of those
new policies. 
In accordance with IFRS1 First-time Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards the Group applied certain optional exemptions
and mandatory exceptions to the principle of retrospective application of IFRS as follows:
■ The Group has applied IFRS3 Business Combinations prospectively with effect from the transition date. 
■ Certain items of property, plant and equipment were carried under UK GAAP at amounts based upon valuations. The Group has applied
the exemption which permits a first-time adopter to use a previous GAAP revaluation of an item of property, plant and equipment as
deemed cost. Consequently, there is no adjustment to the previous carrying value under UK GAAP .
■ As permitted by IFRS1 the Group has recognised all cumulative actuarial gains and losses at the transition date for all employee benefit
plans falling within the scope of IAS19 Employee Benefits. This means that the net deficit on the Group’s employee benefit plans is
included within net assets at 1 April 2004.
■ The Group has applied the IFRS1 exemption from the requirement for retrospective application of IAS21 The Effects of Changes in Foreign
Exchange Rates in respect of cumulative translation differences. This means that the Group has elected not to classify any retained
earnings arising prior to 1 April 2004 within cumulative translation differences, which are, therefore, deemed to be zero at the transition date.
■ The Group has applied the IFRS1 exemption from the requirement to restate its comparative information for the effects of adopting IAS32
Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS4 Insurance
Contracts. The Group did not restate comparative information at 1 April 2004 or for the year to 31 March 2005 for these standards.
■ As permitted under IFRS1 and IFRS2 Share-based Payment, the Group has made no adjustment in either the income statement or
balance sheet for share option grants that occurred prior to 7 November 2002.
Key changes in accounting policies
The following notes highlight the main differences between UK GAAP and IFRS that had a material effect on the financial statements 
of the Group.
(a) Share-based payment
Under UK GAAP , the Group recognised a charge in respect of employee share options based on the difference between the exercise price 
of the option and the market value of a Tate & Lyle share at the grant date. Accordingly, only grants made under the Tate & Lyle 2003
Performance Share Plan attracted a charge under UK GAAP , based on their intrinsic value. Under IFRS2 the Group recognises a charge
reflecting the fair value of all employee share options granted since 7 November 2002 that had not vested by 1 January 2005.
The UK GAAP charge for the year to 31 March 2005 totalled £2 million, reflecting expense for two years of option grants. The impact of IFRS
on profit before taxation for the year to 31 March 2005 is an additional charge of £2 million. In the year to 31 March 2006, the IFRS charge
increased to reflect expense covering three years of option grants.
Net assets increased by £3 million at 31 March 2005 reflecting the deferred taxation impact.
(b) Employee benefits
Tate & Lyle operates a number of pension and post-employment healthcare schemes and has both defined benefit and defined contribution
plans. Under UK GAAP , the Group accounted for these schemes in accordance with SSAP24, which required that the expected cost be
charged to the profit and loss account so as to accrue cost over the service lives of employees on the basis of a constant percentage of earnings.
Under IAS19, the net surplus or deficit for each defined benefit scheme is calculated based on the present value of the discounted obligation
less the fair value of the plan assets. The Group has elected to adopt early the amendment to IAS19 issued by the IASB on 16 December
2004, which allows all actuarial gains and losses to be immediately charged or credited to equity through the Statement of Recognised
Income and Expense.
The charge to the income statement under IAS19 comprises the current service cost, interest cost on scheme liabilities, expected return 
on scheme assets, past service cost and the impact of any settlements or curtailments.
The impact on profit before taxation for the year to 31 March 2005 is a credit of £4 million. Net assets at 31 March 2005 reduced by 
£117 million.
The impact on net assets reflects the reversal of prepayments and liabilities previously reported under UK GAAP and recognition of assets 
and liabilities measured in accordance with IFRS, including those of joint ventures, adjusted for the impact of deferred taxation. Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   117
40 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (continued)
(c) Intangible assets
Research and development
Under UK GAAP , the Group expensed all research and development costs as incurred. Under IFRS, the Group is required to capitalise
development costs where this expenditure meets the recognition criteria set out in IAS38 Intangible Assets. Research costs continue 
to be expensed as incurred.
The capitalisation under IFRS of development costs expensed during the 2005 financial year under UK GAAP increased profit before taxation
under IFRS by £1 million in the year to 31 March 2005. The charge in the year to 31 March 2005 under IFRS for the amortisation of
development costs capitalised in previous periods reduces profit before taxation by £1 million compared to UK GAAP . Overall, the impact 
on profit before tax in the year to 31 March 2005 is £nil million.
The impact on net assets under IFRS, reflecting the capitalisation of costs previously expensed as incurred under UK GAAP , after adjusting 
for the impact of deferred taxation, is an increase of £5 million at 31 March 2005.
Reclassification of capitalised software costs
Under UK GAAP , software assets were included as part of property, plant and equipment, whereas under IFRS, unless they are integral to
another asset, they are included as part of intangible assets. In the balance sheet, a reclassification of £4 million from property, plant and
equipment to intangible assets was reflected under IFRS at 31 March 2005. There was no impact on either profit before taxation or total net
assets under IFRS.
The treatment of goodwill under IFRS is discussed in the following note.
(d) Business combinations
IFRS3 Business Combinations introduces significant changes to the accounting for acquisitions compared to UK GAAP . The international
standard requires recognition of all intangible assets that meet the IAS38 recognition criteria. Any goodwill arising from business combinations
is not amortised under IAS38, but is subject to impairment tests annually or whenever there is an indication of impairment. Negative goodwill
is recognised immediately in the income statement.
The requirement to cease amortising goodwill has the impact of increasing profit before taxation by £9 million in the year to 31 March 2005.
Net assets at 31 March 2005 increased by £9 million.
IFRS3 requires the Group to record inventories acquired in a business combination at an amount equivalent to the selling price of those
inventories, less costs of disposal and a reasonable profit allowance for the subsequent selling effort of the Group. UK GAAP requires acquired
inventories to be recorded at cost.
In the case of the Sucralose realignment, this leads to the Group’s acquired inventory being valued at an amount £4 million higher under IFRS
than under UK GAAP , resulting in an increased charge under IFRS during the year to 31 March 2005. Net assets at 31 March 2005 reduced by
£4 million.
(e) Accounting for joint ventures
Under UK GAAP , the Group accounted for joint ventures using the gross equity method, showing its share of joint venture turnover as part 
of total turnover, and its share of operating profit separately on the face of the profit and loss account. Under IFRS, the Group has elected 
to account for joint ventures using proportionate consolidation, whereby its share of each of the assets, liabilities, income and expenses is
combined line by line with similar items in the Group’s financial statements.
While this change does not materially alter total net assets, it has a significant impact on the classification of assets and liabilities within the
Group’s balance sheet. Profit before taxation remains unchanged for all periods presented.
(f) Taxation
There is no difference in accounting for current taxation between UK GAAP and IFRS.
In respect of deferred taxation, under UK GAAP , the Group recognised deferred taxation only on timing differences that arose from the
inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they were recognised in the financial statements.
Under IAS12 Income Taxes, deferred tax is provided in full, using the liability method, on temporary differences arising between the tax bases
of assets and liabilities and their carrying amounts in the financial statements. Deferred tax assets are recognised to the extent that it is
probable that future taxable profit will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Under UK GAAP , the Group elected to discount deferred tax as permitted by FRS19. Discounting of deferred tax is not permitted under IFRS.
The impact on the taxation charge for the year to 31 March 2005 is a debit of £2 million reflecting the reversal of the discounting effect
recognised under UK GAAP . An increase during the year under UK GAAP of the goodwill on the Sucralose realignment of £4 million relating 
to the unwinding of discounted deferred taxation on the realignment has been reversed.
Net assets at 31 March 2005 reduced by £33 million (1 April 2004 – £30 million), due to the reversal of the discounting effect recognised
under UK GAAP as well as the recognition of deferred taxation in respect of the unremitted earnings of certain overseas investments. 118 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
NOTES TO THE CONSOLIDATED FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
CONTINUED
40 Adoption of International Financial Reporting Standards (continued)
(g) Other
Events after the balance sheet date
Under UK GAAP , the Group recognised a provision for the dividend declared within its financial statements. IFRS specifically states that
dividends approved by the relevant authority after the reporting date do not meet the definition of a present obligation and should not therefore
be recognised. The impact of this is to increase net assets at 31 March 2005 by £65 million (1 April 2004 – £62 million).
Other adjustments
Other adjustments, relating to sundry reclassifications and remeasurements, increase net assets by £6 million at 31 March 2005
(1 April 2004 – £5 million). These other adjustments contain certain minor amendments and balance sheet reclassifications compared 
to the unaudited appendix contained in the Annual Report and Accounts for the year ended 31 March 2005.
Cash flow
The adoption of IFRS had no material impact on the consolidated cash flow statement, but led to the reclassification of certain items between
categories. Cash and cash equivalents presented in accordance with IFRS include cash and cash equivalents of joint ventures, accounted for
under the proportionate consolidation method, of £30 million at 31 March 2005 (1 April 2004 – £17 million) and exclude certain current asset
investments of £1 million at 31 March 2005 (1 April 2004 – £14 million).
Financial instruments
As noted above, the Group has applied the IFRS1 exemption from the requirement to restate its comparative information for the effects of
adopting IAS32 Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation, IAS39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement and IFRS4
Insurance Contracts. Therefore, the Group adopted these standards with effect from 1 April 2005. Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   119

41 Adoption of IAS32 and IAS39
The Group adopted IAS32 and IAS39 from 1 April 2005. The effects of the changes in accounting policies required on the Group’s balance
sheet at 1 April 2005 are summarised below. 
(i) Under UK GAAP the Group reported other non-current assets and current asset investments of £29 million and £1 million respectively.
These comprised: equity investments, now reclassified as available-for-sale financial assets; and loans and non-current receivables, 
now reclassified as trade and other receivables.
■ Available-for-sale financial assets are made up of non-current recievables previously carried at £15 million and current asset
investments of £1 million. A fair value adjustment resulted in an increase of £1 million, which also increases other reserves by 
the same amount.
■ Trade and other receivables are made up of other non-current assets carried at £10 million.
In addition to the reclassifications described above, a further £4 million previously reported as other non-current assets has been
reclassified as derivative financial instruments.
(ii) Certain of the Group’s derivative financial instruments were not carried at fair value under UK GAAP . IFRS also requires separate
presentation of derivative financial instruments on the balance sheet. Reclassifications from other financial assets and liabilities and
accrued interest balances have been made, along with re-measurement adjustments, as reflected in the restated consolidated 
balance sheet.
(iii) The Group’s Food & Industrial Ingredients, Europe business operates a securitisation programme under which it receives cash from selling
trade receivables. Under UK GAAP , the amounts received under this facility of £45 million were linked in presentation to the original
amounts receivable. Under IAS39, the amounts received are shown as borrowings. Trade and other receivables are reduced for
reclassification of derivative financial instruments of £14 million.
(iv) Cash and cash equivalents have been adjusted for the reclassification of currency swap contracts of £9 million.
(v) Cumulative preference shares of £2 million have been reclassified as non-current borrowings.
(vi) Other reserves are adjusted by £1 million for unrealised fair value adjustments arising on available-for-sale financial assets (as explained 
in note (i)); a further reserve for deferred net gains on cash flow hedges of £11 million has been recorded in other reserves, net of
attributable deferred taxation of £4 million.
(vii) Non-current and current trade and other payables are adjusted for reclassification of derivative financial instruments of £5 million and
£35 million respectively, including £11 million relating to commodity trading contracts, as explained in note (ii).
(viii) Non-current borrowings are adjusted for reclassification of derivative financial instruments of £13 million, as explained in note (ii), and 
for cumulative preference shares of £2 million, as explained in note (v).
(ix) Current borrowings are adjusted for reclassification of derivative financial instruments of £21 million (including £11 million relating to
reclassified interest accruals), as explained in note (ii), and for securitised receivables of £45 million, as explained in note (iii).
(x) Retained earnings are increased by £1 million net as a result of re-measurement differences arising on financial instruments at 1 April 2005.
Under UK GAAP , trading instruments were marked-to-market using externally derived market prices. Gains or losses were recognised
immediately in the profit and loss account. For hedging instruments, the Group applied a form of hedge accounting which enabled changes 
in the market value of financial instruments to be matched in the profit and loss account with recognition of the underlying hedged exposure.

INDEPENDENT AUDITORS’ REPORT TO THE MEMBERS OF 
TATE & LYLE PLC: PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
We have audited the parent company
financial statements of Tate & Lyle PLC 
for the year ended 31 March 2006 which
comprise the Parent Company Balance
Sheet and the Notes to the Parent Company
Financial Statements. These parent company
financial statements have been prepared
under the accounting policies set out therein.
We have also audited the information in the
Directors’ Remuneration Report that is
described as having been audited.
We have reported separately on the Group
financial statements of Tate & Lyle PLC for
the year ended 31 March 2006.
Respective responsibilities of directors
and auditors
The directors’ responsibilities for preparing
the Annual Report, the Directors’
Remuneration Report and the parent
company financial statements in accordance
with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards (United Kingdom
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) 
are set out in the Statement of Directors’
Responsibilities.
Our responsibility is to audit the parent
company financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited in accordance with relevant 
legal and regulatory requirements and
International Standards on Auditing (UK 
and Ireland). This report, including the
opinion, has been prepared for and only 
for the Company’s members as a body 
in accordance with Section 235 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion,
accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this
report is shown or into whose hands it may
come save where expressly agreed by our
prior consent in writing.
We report to you our opinion as to whether
the parent company financial statements
give a true and fair view and whether the
parent company financial statements and the
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report
to be audited have been properly prepared
in accordance with the Companies Act
1985. We also report to you as to whether 
in our opinion the information given in the
Directors’ Report is consistent with the
parent company financial statements. 
The information given in the Directors’
Report includes that specific information
presented in the Operating and Financial
Review that is cross referred from the
Business Review section of the Directors’
Report. We also report to you if, in our
opinion, the Company has not kept proper
accounting records, if we have not received
all the information and explanations we
require for our audit, or if information
specified by law regarding directors’
remuneration and other transactions 
is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in
the Annual Report and consider whether
it is consistent with the audited parent
company financial statements. The other
information comprises only the Directors’
Report, the unaudited part of the
Directors’ Remuneration Report, the
Chairman’s Statement, the Chief
Executive’s Review, the Operating and
Financial Review and the Corporate
Governance Statement. We consider the
implications for our report if we become
aware of any apparent misstatements 
or material inconsistencies with the
parent company financial statements.
Our responsibilities do not extend to 
any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance 
with International Standards on Auditing 
(UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing
Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence
relevant to the amounts and disclosures 
in the parent company financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited. It also includes an
assessment of the significant estimates and
judgements made by the directors in the
preparation of the parent company financial
statements, and of whether the accounting
policies are appropriate to the Company’s
circumstances, consistently applied and
adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as
to obtain all the information and explanations
which we considered necessary in order to
provide us with sufficient evidence to give
reasonable assurance that the parent
company financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be
audited are free from material misstatement,
whether caused by fraud or other irregularity
or error. In forming our opinion we also
evaluated the overall adequacy of the
presentation of information in the parent
company financial statements and the part
of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to 
be audited.
Opinion
In our opinion:
■ the parent company financial statements
give a true and fair view, in accordance
with United Kingdom Generally Accepted
Accounting Practice, of the state of the
Company’s affairs as at 31 March 2006; 
■ the parent company financial statements
and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration
Report to be audited have been properly
prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985; and
■ the information given in the Directors’
Report is consistent with the financial
statements.

PARENT COMPANY BALANCE SHEET 126 Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006
NOTES TO THE PARENT COMPANY FINANCIAL STATEMENTS 
1 Parent company accounting policies
Accounting basis 
The parent company financial statements are prepared under the historical cost convention, except as disclosed below, in accordance with
the Companies Act 1985 and applicable UK accounting standards. As permitted by Section 230 of the Companies Act 1985, the Company’s
profit and loss account and statement of total recognised gains and losses are not presented in these financial statements. The Tate & Lyle
PLC consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 March 2006 contain a consolidated statement of cash flows. Consequently the
Company has taken the exemption available in FRS1 (Revised 1996) Cash flow statements, and has not presented its own cash flow statement.
Changes in accounting policies
The Company has adopted the following new standards in the year ended 31 March 2006: FRS1 Retirement Benefits; FRS20 Share-based
Payment (early adopted); FRS21 Events after the Balance Sheet Date; FRS23 The Effects of Changes in Foreign Exchange Rates; FRS25
Financial Instruments: Disclosure and Presentation; FRS26 Financial Instruments: Measurement and FRS28 Corresponding Amounts. The
adoption of each of these standards represents a change in accounting policy and the comparative figures have been restated accordingly
except where the exemption from restating comparatives has been taken. Details of the effect of prior year adjustments are shown in note 14.
Intangible fixed assets
Patents and other intellectual property are shown at historical cost less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Where the assets
are acquired as part of a business combination, historical cost is based on their fair values as at the date of the combination. Amortisation 
of the assets is recognised on a straight-line basis over the period of their expected benefit, not exceeding 20 years.
Tangible fixed assets
Depreciation is provided on a straight-line basis to write off the cost of tangible fixed assets over the estimated useful life. The tangible fixed
assets comprise plant and machinery which is depreciated over a period of 3 to 28 years. Impairment reviews are undertaken if there are
indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Investments
Fixed asset investments are included in the balance sheet at cost, less any provision for impairment.
Leases
Operating lease costs are charged to profit as incurred.
Research and development
All expenditure on research and development is charged to profit as incurred.
Retirement benefits
The Company contributes to the Group pension plan operated in the UK. Details of the plan are included within Note 28 of the Group financial
statements. As permitted under FRS17 Retirement Benefits, the plan is accounted for as a defined contribution plan, as the employer cannot
identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities of the plan. The employer’s contributions relate to the current service period only.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on a full provision basis on timing differences between the recognition of gains and losses in the accounts and 
their recognition for tax purposes that have arisen but not reversed at the balance sheet date. Deferred tax is not recognised on permanent
differences or on timing differences arising on unremitted profits of overseas subsidiaries. Deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent
that it is considered more likely than not that there will be sufficient future taxable profits to permit tax relief of the underlying timing differences. 
Foreign currencies
Assets and liabilities in foreign currencies are translated into sterling at the rates of exchange ruling on the last day of the financial period 
(the closing rate) and other profits and losses on exchange are credited or charged to the profit and loss account.
Share-based compensation
The Company operates a number of equity-settled, share-based compensation plans. The fair value of employee services received in
exchange for the grant of the options is recognised as an expense. The total amount to be expensed over the vesting period is determined by
reference to the fair value of the options granted, excluding the impact of any non-market vesting conditions (for example, earnings targets).
Non-market vesting conditions are included in assumptions about the number of options that are expected to become exercisable. At each
balance sheet date, for options granted with non-market vesting conditions, the Company revises its estimates of the number of options that
are expected to become exercisable. It recognises the impact of the revision of original estimates, if any, in the profit and loss account, and a
corresponding adjustment to equity. The proceeds received net of any directly attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and
share premium when the options are exercised. Tate & Lyle Annual Report 2006   127

discounting of deferred tax balances.
(b) Creditors – due within one year reduce by £65 million due to the adoption of FRS21 and represents the reversal of the accrual for the final
dividend for the year ended 31 March 2005 which is no longer recognised as a liability until it is approved by the Company’s shareholders.
(c) The Company has taken advantage of the exemptions in FRS25 and FRS26 not to restate comparative information. The impact of these
standards, which were therefore adopted on 1 April 2005, is shown in note 13.
The impact of adopting the remaining standards on the parent company balance sheet at 31 March 2005 was not significant.

In 2000, the Group changed its accounting reference date from 30 September to 31 March resulting in an extended accounting period of 
18 months to March 2000. 
Results presented above are for years to 31 March and have been calculated using the Group’s published interim and full year financial
statements.
In order to show the underlying trend of dividend payments, dividends shown in the above table have been adjusted as follows:
(a) to exclude from the dividend for the year to March 1997 the Foreign Income Dividend enhancement of 1.325p per share included in the
Interim 1997 dividend; and
(b) to exclude from the dividend of 26.9p per share paid in respect of the 18 months to March 2000 the Final Dividend of 9.1p per share paid
in respect of the transitional six-month period to March 2000 with the effect that the dividend of 17.8p per share for the year to March
2000 shown above is presented on an annualised basis.

INVESTMENT
SIGNIFICANT
BENEFITS
Peter Baker
Non-Executive Chairman Some Chairmanships are a sinecure. Others demand 
active involvement. Given my preference for the latter form 
of engagement, I am delighted to have assumed the role 
of Chairman at such a pivotal moment in the history of 
Finsbury Foods. 
Chairman’s Statement
A significant corner has been turned in recent years. 
Th e balance sheet is secured, investment in people and
machinery has begun to bear fruit and scale benefits 
are being realised across the business. 
I am pleased to report that our results for the current 
financial year are comfortably in line with the expectations
of the markets and our shareholders. 
We have achieved an encouraging degree of momentum
in a diﬃcult market against a backdrop of increasing
commodity costs. Th ere is a new Board, a fresh attitude
and a sharpened appetite for progress. 
I have worked in the Food and (on and oﬀ ) the Bakery
Industry for almost four decades. Th roughout that period,
two constants have remained unchanged – people and
products. If the product is eﬀective, you have a powerful
springboard. Add the right people and you are primed 
to succeed. 
Both those two elements are in place at Finsbury; we’re
producing great products on a consistent basis and have
outstanding people in all spheres of the business.  
Even in my short time with the Company I have seen
confidence growing across the business; confidence in 
our relationships, confidence in our approach and strategy,
confidence in the direction we’re taking.  
Travelling around our facilities provides further 
encouragement. Th e management team at Cardiﬀ has 
exceptional talent and drive while the facility at Hamilton
is equally well run. We have focused on doubling capacity
at our platform at Nicholas & Harris, which has demanded
internal focus and it is now fully commissioned. 
Corporate governance standards have moved on apace
and our new Board will continue to make significant 
improvements in this important area. Th ere is a lot of
brainpower around the table with comprehensive sector
experience and a smaller Board will help our decision
making become more nimble and decisive. 
I would like to express my gratitude to our shareholders,
to my fellow Directors and to each and every one of our
employees for all their hard work. I would also like to place
on record our continued appreciation for the enduring
support and assistance of our bankers.
Treading water is not an option. Over the next three 
to five years, my tenure will be judged by a number 
of criteria:
a. Improving shareholder value
b. Acting justly and fairly towards our employees 
c. And in a nutshell, growth.
It is a pivotal time for Finsbury Foods. We can bring about
a degree of organic expansion but growth will primarily
be realised through acquisition and mergers.
Th ere is a window of opportunity in the markets and the
Board is actively exploring investment options. Scale will
stimulate fresh routes to market, diversification of our
customer base and a new perception of the Company
among analysts and stakeholders.
Is it possible for a relatively small, listed Group like 
Finsbury to double in size over a relatively short period?
Th e management team believes that it is, providing 
we can find the right opportunities.
We’ve done the hard yards. Finsbury has invested in the
business when others played safe, invested in people when
our competitors did not. We are focussed on helping 
retailers respond to changing consumer needs by oﬀering
solutions that work.
Th e next stage requires foresight, courage and pragmatism.
It demands an ability to sustain the pace of internal
transformation while remaining sensitive to external 
opportunities. Given the obstacles overcome by the business
in recent years, I have every confidence we shall continue
to advance. 
We have achieved an 
encouraging degree 
of momentum in 
a difficult market.

Chief Executive Officer
REDUCED
COST BASE
INCREASED
EFFICIENCY Finsbury Foods had two very different halves during the 
financial year. The first half maintained the hard-earned impetus
of previous periods. Sales were marginally down but Profit Before
Tax registered a 50% uplift, principally due to the decrease in
interest charges following the sale of our Free From business.
Chief Executive’s Report
Th e second period was more challenging. Commodity price
inflation began edging back upwards with escalating costs
in chocolate, butter, energy and labour. Our historical
customer base was adjusting to meet the threat of value-
oriented discounters and we found ourselves squeezed 
on all sides.  
Refocus was imperative. Around the turn of the year, the
management team set about eliminating £1m in annualised
overhead costs and implemented a dramatic increase in
capital spend. Significant projects included the installation
of leading edge robotics at the cake factory in Scotland
and extending space at Nicholas & Harris by 60%. 
At the end of another exacting year, it gives me great
pleasure to report a further rise in bottom line growth.
We have good momentum slightly disguised by a poor
market, underlining yet again our ability to achieve 
consistent results under demanding conditions.
Trading Performance
Results for the full 52-week period ending 28 June 2014
are described in greater depth in the Strategic Report 
but there are a number of areas I would like to take this 
opportunity to highlight:
• Group revenue from continuing operations 
£175.7 million (2013: £176.6 million) 
• Profit before tax up 18% to £6.5 million 
(2013: £5.5 million)
• Total net debt £8.8 million (2013: £7.4 million)
• Adjusted diluted EPS 6.3p (2013: 5.9p)
• Final proposed dividend 0.75 pence per share,
amounting to a total dividend of 1 pence per share
(2013: 0.75 pence per share)
• Capital investment spend £6.2 million 
(2013: £4.2 million)
• Investment in single serve cake slice 'snap pack' 
successfully completed during the year as well as the 
largest cake bites robotic picking installation in the world
• Commissioning of speciality bread facility expansion, 
delivering 60% additional space at Nicholas & Harris.
Beyond Th e Numbers
Consumer behaviour has changed, polarising the 
marketplace. Having spotted an opportunity on margin,
Aldi, Lidl and Pound Shops are reporting up to 30%
year-on-year growth. Premium retailers, hindered by low
food inflation, are struggling to retain market share.
For Finsbury Foods, the situation is delicate. Th ere are
self-evident sensitivities between our historical customer
base and the burgeoning new players. Ultimately, you have
to follow the consumer but existing relationships must 
be safeguarded.
Given our recent track record, one area of relative 
disappointment is the speciality bread business which had
been enjoying double-digit growth. A flat year was primarily
caused by market dynamics, specifically the impact of the
so-called ‘Bread Wars’.
Organic growth will be harder to come by. Acquisitions
signpost the route forward but not at any price. Th e Board
has been working assiduously to uncover investment 
opportunities but is not prepared to meet unrealistic 
valuations. I am confident that value expectations will start
to temper in the near future and we will be ready to step in. 
After years of dedicated service, Martin Lightbody has
relinquished the role of Chairman. Having assumed the
mantle under testing circumstances, Martin proved a steady
figurehead during the turnaround phase, carrying out his
duties with dedication and resilience. David Marshall and
Crawford Currie have also stepped down from the Board
after many years service and I would like to thank all three
for the support and contribution.
As of 1 July, the baton passed to the suitably surnamed Peter
Baker. Steeped in industry experience at RHM Consumer
Brands, British Bakeries and Rank Hovis Mills, Peter is
committed to taking a proactive role on behalf of Finsbury,
acting as a conduit for change.
It has taken a lot longer than I hoped or expected to get
to this stage but recognition is spreading. In 2013, Finsbury
Foods received the coveted Bakery Supplier of Th e Year
Award while Martin Lightbody was voted Chairman 
of Th e Year at the Quoted Company Awards.
Finsbury Foods remains driven by a passion to meet 
consumer expectations for aﬀordable quality food. We didn’t
install robots to keep pace with technology but to pass
eﬃciencies down to our consumers, enhancing the appeal
of our category and our cake. 
Our course is set. Th e business environment isn’t going 
to get any easier but doing the right things is the only
long-term solution. We must persevere with internal 
investment, keep scanning the horizon for acquisitions
and the right opportunities will come. 
We have underlined 
yet again our ability to
achieve consistent results
under demanding 
conditions.

Strategic Report
The Group will continue to invest in production capability and
people, there will be an element of organic expansion but growth
will primarily be realised through acquisition and mergers
which will in turn help us respond to consumer needs through
diversification of products and customer bases. Working with
retailers to meet changing consumer needs is key, in addition
to this the focus will be on growth, improving shareholder 
perception of value and investing in employees. 
Our Markets
Th e total annual UK ambient cake market (including 
pre-packed cake and in-store bakery) is valued at £924 million
(source: Symphony IRI w/e 21 Juner 2014). Th e past 12
months has seen value sales decline by -2.4% and unit sales
decline by -4.9%. We continue to be the second largest
supplier of ambient cake to the UK’s multiple grocers and
have maintained our leading position in the niche areas
on which we focus.
Annual bread and morning goods sales are in excess 
of £3.5 billion (source: Kantar Worldpanel), although 
the market remains flat. We are a niche player in this
market, focusing on speciality breads and rolls. Th e retail 
environment remains challenging as consumers struggle
to stretch household budgets, but Nicholas & Harris 
are trading with key customers that are outperforming
the market and so are well placed when the economic 
climate improves for UK shoppers.
Our Business
Th e Group consists broadly of the following businesses:
UK Bakery
Lightbody of Hamilton Ltd (‘Lightbody’), based in
Hamilton, employs over 1,100 people and is the UK’s
largest supplier of Celebration cakes with Disney, Nestlé,
WeightWatchers and Th orntons product within its 
Licenced Portfolio as well as Own Label Cake. It also
produces a wide range of sweet snacking products, slices
and in store bakery (ISB) bites, a number of which are
under our licensed brands including Nestlé, Th orntons,
and WeightWatchers.
Memory Lane Cakes Ltd (‘Memory Lane’) is based in
Cardiﬀ and employs around 800 permanent staﬀ as well
as agency at high promotional and seasonal peak times. 
It is the leading manufacturer of the UK retailers premium
own label cake ranges. It also produces under a number
of brands including Nestlé, Th ornton’s, WeightWatchers
and its own Memory Lane brand.
Nicholas & Harris Ltd. (N&H), based in Salisbury, 
employs around 280 people and produces a range of 
speciality breads to UK retailers. Its focus is on ‘clean
label’ breads, rolls and buns. Within its brand portfolio,
N&H has Vogel’s seeded bread, Cranks Organic and 
Village Bakery Rye bread, all of which have outperformed
the bread market. Th e past year has been one of significant
change in the bakery, with a 60% increase in its footprint
to allow more eﬃcient distribution and space for future
growth. Baking capacity has also been increased by 25%.
Th e business is now in a strong position to benefit from
improvements in trading conditions in the UK.
Brands and Licences
Th e Group remains primarily a retailer branded business
with sales of retailer own label products accounting for
around 60% of our total revenue. Th e balance represents
the strength of the licensed brands under our control.
WeightWatchers
WeightWatchers remains one of the largest food brands
in the UK and we hold the licence to manufacture and
distribute low fat cake to the UK and Ireland’s grocers under
this brand. Th e Low Fat cake category continues to struggle
in the face of recessionary pressures on household budgets.
However, this year WeightWatchers has again successfully
grown its share of this category. Since the summer of 2013
we have undertaken a number of significant innovation
projects under the WeightWatcher brand. Initially moving
the slices into a new individually wrapped snack pack
format to broaden the appeal of the oﬀering and open new
usage occasions, then incorporating a new pack design
onto the slices range in June 2014. Th is new pack design
will be rolled out across the remaining products in the
WeightWatchers Cake range later in 2014.
Th orntons
Th e Group continues to develop its branded oﬀering via its
licensing arrangement with the Th orntons confectionery
business. Th orntons is the 4th largest brand in the market
place and continues to grow its unit sales, in so doing
outperforming the market and all key competitors over the
last 52 weeks (Source: Symphony IRI). Th orntons remains
the dominant player within the Bites market holding 
a market share in excess of 40%, and 2014 has seen the
introduction of two new products which will further 
enhance our position within this key segment.
Nestlé Confectionery
We continue to manufacture and distribute Cake Products
under the Nestlé Confectionary Brands. In 2014 the brand
outperformed the market and has returned to growth
driven by products under the Smarties, Yorkie, Aero 
and Funtastic Brands.
Disney
Our successful range of Disney Celebration cakes continues
to evolve and has grown by over 20% in the last 52 weeks.
Properties within the portfolio include Disney Princess,
Cars, Fairies, Avengers and Spiderman. Th e Disney portfolio
is a core part of our overall Celebration cake business 
and plays an important role in retaining our position 
as the largest supplier of Celebration cake to the UK’s 
multiple grocers. 
We are working with 
retailers to meet changing
consumer needs, and 
responding by diversifying
our products and 
customer bases. 10
Strategic Report
Other Celebration Cake Licences
Th ese four major brands are complemented by a range
of other licences which are particularly focused on 
driving Celebration cake sales. Evergreen properties 
such as Peppa Pig, Hello Kitty, and Me To You, are 
complemented by more trend led licenses such as One
Direction and, later this year the new Despicable Me
oﬀer, to provide a compelling oﬀer across all key target
markets. Th is portfolio of licenses has played a key role 
in growing our market share of the UK Celebration 
cake market.
Speciality Bread Licences
Nicholas & Harris bakery has three brands which it 
continues to develop and market under the long-term 
licence agreements, along with LivLife which was developed
and launched by Nicholas & Harris. In what has been 
a volatile and turbulent year in the bread market with sales
declining 3.4% in value and 2.3% volume, Vogel’s, Crank’s
and Th e Village Bakery Rye breads have maintained their 
position. Th e repositioning of Vogel’s from ‘Experts in Seeds
and Grains’ to ‘Crammed to Bursting’ have given additional
traction to the PR activity, gaining new followers on
Facebook and now over 2,000 new Twitter followers.
Village Bakery continues to demonstrate a loyal customer
following, with further interest being shown in the sector
where the use of ‘no added wheat’ is a key part of the brand.
Cranks is being relaunched this year with the main focus
still being on ‘real bread’ but with the added addition of
vegetables. Th is is being supported by PR and advertising
campaigns later in the year. LivLife having been launched
in July 2013, is showing continued interest in both people
who wish to reduce carbs and people who have diabetes
type 2.
Overseas
Th e Group’s 50% owned Company Lightbody Stretz Ltd,
supplies and distributes the Group’s UK manufactured
products and third party products primarily to Europe.
Principal Risks and Uncertainties
Th e Group operates in an environment which is continually
changing and as a result the risks it faces will also change
over time. Th e assessment of risks and the development
of strategies for dealing with these risks are achieved on
an ongoing basis through the way in which the Group 
is controlled and managed internally. A formal review of
these risks is carried out by the Group on an annual basis.
Th e review process involves the identification of risks, 
assessment to determine the relative likelihood of them
impacting the business and the potential severity of the
impact, and determination of what needs to be done to
manage them eﬀectively.
Th e Directors have identified the following as the principal
risks and uncertainties that face the Group.
Competitive Environment and Customer Requirements
Th ere is currently over capacity in the market place and
competition is strong between manufacturers in the Bakery
sector. Th e monitoring of key performance indicators at
customer level such as service levels and customer complaints
is part of the risk management process associated with this
specific risk. Strong customer service, quality products, low
costs and innovative new product development are areas
of focus to satisfy customer needs and remain strong in a
competitive environment. Th e Group has invested heavily
in category management, new product development and
marketing skills. Th is investment has helped create an 
insight into customers and consumer demands. Continual
monitoring of customer KPI’s and production quality
measures take place to ensure customer requirements are
being met and issues are identified in a timely manner 
to limit their impact.   Strategic Report
13
Product Quality
Product quality is a key strength of the Group and failure
to maintain a high standard of food quality and safety
would have a severe impact on service levels and customer
relationships. Th e Group’s quality assurance procedures,
managed at site level, are reviewed continuously with
improvements made as appropriate. Th e Group’s Technical
Director helps provide focus to ensure there is continuous
improvement across all sites to meet the increasingly high
expectations of our customers. Th e operating subsidiaries
are subject to regular internal and independent food safety
and quality control audits including those carried out by,
or on behalf of, our customers. Th e Group maintains
product recall insurance cover to mitigate the potential
impact of such an occurrence.
Prices and Supply
Increases in the price and volatility of price of raw materials
along with increasing utility costs can impact the core
profitability of the business and any related shortage in
supply of raw materials will impact the business’ ability 
to maintain its service levels to customers – another of 
its key performance indicators. Th e prices of certain key
commodities (e.g. sugar) are tied to the Euro – the relative
strength of sterling and future volatility within the 
Eurozone will, therefore, have an impact on the cost 
of these commodities. 
Aﬀordability for consumers is essential and the Group
will focus on internal efficiencies and productivity 
initiatives to lessen the rising commodity price impact on
consumers. Th e Group maintains a high level of expertise
in its buying team and will consider long-term contracts
where appropriate to reduce uncertainty in input prices.
Th e team also cultivates strong relationships with its major
suppliers to ensure continuity of supply at competitive
prices. Regular renovation and innovation in our product
range can help to manage margin pressures in an eﬀective
manner as far as the competitive environment allows. 
Th e Group also purchases forward foreign currency in
order to minimise the fluctuation of input costs linked
to future currency conversion rates.
Economic Environment
Th e economic environment remains challenging, 
with consumer behaviour changing and a shift toward
value-oriented discounters. Th e Group will continue to
focus on quality and value for money in periods of reduced
spending. Th e Group manages margins through investing
in site capabilities such as leading edge robotics to increase
eﬃciency and eﬀectively manage capacity. Innovation and
development of products that stand out from the crowd
help maintain strong relationships with customers and 
licensors. We are driven by a passion to meet consumer
expectations at aﬀordable quality.
Trading Results
Continuing Group revenue for the 52 week period to 
28 June 2014 was £175.7 million (2013: £176.6 million).  
Gross margin for the financial year was 27.4% (2013:
26.3%). Commodity price inflation began edging back
upwards during the second half of the year with escalating
costs in chocolate, butter, energy and labour. Th e outlook
is that some volatility is expected in key ingredients
driven by market risks.  
Administrative expenses on continuing activities have 
increased by £1.0 million year on year through increased
marketing support, new product development and range
support. Inflationary increases and employee pay rises
have been oﬀset largely by operational improvements 
and returns from capital investment. Strategic Report

Strategic Report
Earnings Per Share (EPS)
EPS comparatives to the prior year can be distorted by significant non-recurring items and IFRS adjustments. Th e Board
is focused on growing adjusted diluted EPS, which is calculated by eliminating the impact of the items highlighted
above and incorporates the dilutive eﬀect of share options. Continuing adjusted diluted EPS is 6.3p for the 52 week
period (2013: 5.9p).

Non-Financial Key Performance Indicators
A range of non-financial key performance indicators are
monitored at site level covering, amongst others, customer
service, quality and health and safety. Th e Group Board
receives an overview of these on a regular basis.
Disposals
In the prior year comparatives on 27 February 2013 
the Group sold its Free From business for a total value 
of approximately £21 million of which £3 million is 
deferred to 27 February 2015.
Th e Free From business consisted of two subsidiaries,
Livwell Limited (“Livwell”) and United Bakeries (Holdings)
Limited (“UBH”) (the holding company of United Central
Bakeries Limited (“UCB”)). Th ese subsidiaries, which 
accounted for approximately 14% of prior year Group
revenues, were sold to Genius Foods Limited (“Genius”),
on a debt-free, cash-free basis.
Cash Flow
Th ere was an increase in our working capital requirement
of £2.2 million compared to the last financial year. 
Corporation tax payments made in the financial year totalled
£1.7 million (2013: £1.8 million), the payments in the
current year took account of the research and development
tax relief due to the Group. Capital expenditure in the
year amounted to £6.2 million (2013: £4.2 million).  
Debt and Bank Facilities
Th e Group’s total net debt including deferred consideration
payable is £8.8 million (2013: £7.4 million) up £1.4 million
from prior year. 
Th e Group’s total net bank debt excluding deferred 
consideration after deducting cash balances as at 28 June
2014 was £8.8 million (2013: £7.2 million). Within this
total net bank debt, £5.1 million is due within one year,
including cash at bank and invoice finance (2013: £2.8
million).   18
Strategic Report
Th e Group’s debt facility with HSBC Bank Plc totals
£32.0m, the key features of the facility are as follows:
• Overdraft (£3.0m)
• Confidential invoice discounting facility (£15.0m)
• Mortgage facility (£4.0m)
• Rolling asset finance facility (£2.0m)
• Revolving credit facility (£8.0m).
Note 20 gives details of the drawn amounts and maturity
dates.
Th e Group is able to oﬀer strong asset backing to secure
its borrowings. Th e Group owns freehold sites at Memory
Lane in Cardiﬀ and Lightbody and Campbells in Scotland.
In addition, the Group has a strong trade debtor book to
support the invoice discounting facility, made up primarily
of UK’s major multiple retailers. Th is debtor book stood at
£22.4 million (2013: £21.9 million) at the period end date.
Th e Group recognises the inherent risk from interest rate
rises. To mitigate these risks, the Group has three interest
rate swaps in place with a total coverage of £14.0 million
(2013: £18.0 million) equivalent to 159% (2013: 250%)
of year end net bank at a weighted average rate of 2.5%
(2013: 4.0%). 
Th e eﬀective interest rate for the Group at the year end,
taking account of the interest rate swaps in place and 
deferred consideration with base rate at 0.5% and LIBOR
at 0.69%, was 4.27% (2013: 5.97%). 
Financial Covenants
Th e Board reviews the Group’s cash flow forecasts and key
covenants on a regular basis to ensure that it has adequate
facilities to cover its trading and banking requirements
with an appropriate level of headroom. Th e forecasts are
based on management’s best estimates of future trading.
Th ere has been no breach of covenants during the year. 
Interest cover (based on adjusted EBITDA) for the 52
weeks to 28 June 2014 was 8.6 (2013: 6.3). Net bank debt
to EBITDA (based on adjusted EBITDA) for the year 
to 28 June 2014 was 0.8 (2013: 0.6). 
Taxation
Th e Group taxation charge on continuing operations for the
year was £1.7 million (2013: £1.3 million). Th is represents
an eﬀective rate of 25.1% (2013: 21.4%). Th e current year
contains a revaluation of net opening deferred tax asset
balances from 23% to 20% amounting to a charge in the year
of £197,000. Th e eﬀective rate excluding this revaluation
would be 22.1%.
Further details on the tax charge can be found in Note 9
to the Group’s Financial Statements.
Environmental Matters
Th e Group continues to focus on packaging reduction
through innovation and has delivered further reductions
across the business. Th e Group continues to take the key
learning and successes from the Cake Category and 
applying them across other areas of the business to deliver
category leading innovative solutions. 
Mandatory participation in the CRC Energy Eﬃciency
Scheme (formerly known as the Carbon Reduction
Commitment) focuses the Group to reduce its carbon
emissions. New production capability, which is in the
process of being commissioned in Hamilton, will further
reduce the consumption of cardboard and reduce food
waste. Work with local universities on shelf life of product
will lead to waste reduction of the coming years. We are
also presently formulating our Environmental Sustainability
Strategy within Cake.
Nicholas & Harris remains a ‘landfill-free’ site and all
waste materials are recycled.   21
Strategic Report
Employee Social and Community Issues
All manufacturing sites are active within their local 
community supporting local community initiatives. 
Th e Group also supports local and national government
initiatives such as the New Work programme.
We donate regularly to local and national charities in terms
of both product and fund raising activities at all sites.
We work closely with local universities business projects
and placements and plan to continue this partnership work
further in several areas of training, development and project
work. Th ey continue to invest in training and development
of the workforce supporting a programme of vocational
qualifications.
Eight Bakers have qualified from the Nicholas & Harris
bakers’ apprenticeship scheme this year, with City and
Guilds’ qualifications, adding to the 13 that qualified in
2013. Nicholas & Harris have continued in their support
of the local community, including sponsorship of the 
internationally renowned Salisbury Arts Festival.
Technical Matters
Th e focus in 2014 has been improving the strength of 
the teams to be able to deliver the challenging strategic
objectives for the next three years. In particular this has
focussed on strong Process and Compliance resource 
to drive root cause analysis and embed a continuous 
improvement culture. 
Retail customers have placed a much stronger focus on
unannounced audits across the whole supply base in the
wake of ‘Horsegate’. All Finsbury sites have performed
well against these requirements and end the year 
maintaining strong BRC A and A* grades.
Strengthening the Development teams and processes 
at the front end of the business has started to improve
the quality of products launched which in turn is driving
down complaints. Th e Development teams have made
significant progress in translating the category priorities
into innovation and new products and this has been key
to cementing customer relationships.

Presentation of Financial Statements
Basis of Preparation
Th ese accounts cover the 52 week period ended 28 June 2014 (prior financial year is the 52 week period ended 29 June 2013). Th e Group Financial Statements
consolidate those of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”).
Th e Group Financial Statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
as adopted by the EU (“Adopted IFRSs”). Th e Company has elected to prepare its parent company Financial Statements in accordance with UK GAAP; 
these are presented on pages 59 to 64.
It should be noted that current liabilities exceed current assets. Having reviewed the Group’s plans and available financial facilities, the Board has reasonable
expectations that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future. Th e Group has stayed within its banking
facilities during the year, meeting covenant requirements. Th e Group has the continued support from its bank with facilities of £32m. In addition, the Group
has a strong asset backing and strong trade debtor book. Accordingly, the Board continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the Financial
Statements for both the Group and the parent company.
Th e Board reviews the Group’s cash flow forecasts and key covenants on a regular basis to ensure that it has adequate facilities to cover its trading and
banking requirements with an appropriate level of headroom. Th e forecasts are based on management’s best estimates of future trading. Th ere has been 
no breach of covenants during the year. All covenant tests were passed at the year end.
Critical Accounting Estimates and Judgements
Th e Group is required to make estimates and assumptions concerning the future. Th ese estimates and judgements are based on historical experience and
other factors, including expectations of future events that are believed to be reasonable under the circumstances. Th e resulting accounting estimates will, 
by definition, seldom equal the related actual results.
Accounting estimates and judgements have been required for the production of these Financial Statements. Th e following are those that are deemed 
to require the most complex judgements about matters that have the most significant eﬀect on the amounts recognised in the Financial Statements.
• Impairment of goodwill can significantly impact the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the year. Th e Group estimates the recoverable
amounts based on historical experience of margin, volumes and cost structure and expectations of future events. Th e discount rate takes account of the
current market conditions and this has been applied as a pre-tax discount factor to obtain a current value. Refer to Note 12 for further details.
• Th e Group has one defined benefit pension scheme. Th e net deficit or surplus is the diﬀerence between the plan assets and plan liabilities at the period
end date. Th e valuation of the assets and liabilities is based on a number of judgements. Th e assets are based on market value at the period end date,
the liabilities are based on actuarial assumptions such as discount, inflation and mortality rates. Th e assumptions applied are based on advice provided
by the Scheme’s actuary, further detail can be found in Note 16. 
• Th e Group recognises provisions where an obligation exists at the period end date and a reliable estimate can be made. Provisions for employee claims
and pension augmentation have been recognised in these Financial Statements. Estimates for employee claims are made based on the number of reported
accidents and incidents and the number of expected claims yet to be reported based on historical evidence, all accrued up to the maximum self-insured
amount of £10,000 per claim. Th e pension provision relates to a contractual liability for pension augmentation that has been valued by the pension
scheme actuaries. See Note 23 for further detail.
28 1 Significant Accounting Policies
Th e accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated Financial Statements, except as explained
in the basis of preparation, which addresses any changes in accounting policies resulting from new or revised standards.
Basis of Consolidation
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Group has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and operating
policies of an entity so as to obtain benefits from its activities. In assessing control, potential voting rights that are currently exercisable or convertible are
taken into account. Th e Financial Statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated Financial Statements from the date that control commences
until the date that control ceases. Th e accounting policies of new subsidiaries are changed when necessary to align them with the policies adopted by the
Group. Intra-group balances and transactions are eliminated in preparing the consolidated Financial Statements.
Lightbody Stretz Limited which is 50% owned by the Group has been consolidated into the Group accounts as a subsidiary with a corresponding non-controlling
interest on the basis that the Group has the controlling interest. Control arises by virtue of the fact that Lightbody Group, a wholly owned subsidiary 
of Finsbury Food Group, has a majority of voting rights arising from an agreement between Lightbody Group Limited and Philippe Stretz.
Change in Accounting Policy
Th e Group adopted IAS 19 (revised) Employee Benefits from January 2013. As a result of IAS 19 (revised), the key change to these Statements is the
“finance cost” which was previously the diﬀerence between the interest on liabilities and expected return on assets, the expected return on assets is eﬀectively
based on the discount rate with no allowances made for any outperformance expected from the Scheme’s actual asset holding.
As a result of these amendments, the comparative financial information in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss and Other Comprehensive Income
(OCI) have been restated for the year ending 29 June 2013. Th e eﬀect of the above was to decrease finance income in the Consolidated Statement of Profit
and Loss by £575,000 from £1,401,000 to £826,000 and decrease the remeasurements of the net defined benefit pension liability in OCI by £575,000
from £1,118,000 to £543,000.
As a result of the above, the tax expense in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss has decreased by £132,000 for the year ending 29 June 2013 
and the deferred tax credit in the OCI has decreased by £132,000. Th e eﬀect on the cashflow statement of the amended standard was an adjustment to profit
before tax and the operating reconciling items. Th ere was no eﬀect on the net cash from operating activities. Th e eﬀect on the statement of changes in equity
of the amended standard was an adjustment to retained earnings, as explained above.
Foreign Currency
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated to the functional currency of Group entities at the foreign exchange rate ruling at the date of the transaction.
Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the period end date are retranslated to the functional currency at the foreign exchange 
rate ruling at that date. 
Any exchange diﬀerences arising on the settlement of monetary items or on translating monetary items at rates diﬀerent from those at which they were
initially recorded are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period in which they arise.
Th e assets and liabilities of foreign operations, including goodwill and fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated to the Group’s presentational
currency, Sterling, at foreign exchange rates ruling at the period end date. Th e revenues and expenses of foreign operations are translated at an average rate
for the year where this rate approximates to the foreign exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Th is revaluation is recognised through Other
Comprehensive Income.
Derivative Financial Instruments
Th e Group has derivative financial instruments in respect of interest rate swaps and foreign exchange hedges. Th e Group does not hold derivative financial
instruments for trading purposes. Th e existing interest rate swaps and foreign exchange hedges used by the Group do not meet the criteria for hedge accounting
set out by IAS 39 and have thus been treated as financial assets and liabilities which are carried at their fair value in the Consolidated Statement of Financial
Position. Fair value is deemed to be market value, which is provided by the counterparty at the year end date. 
Changes in the market value of interest rate swaps have been recognised through the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as finance income 
or cost. Changes in the market value of foreign exchange hedges have been recognised through the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss within
administrative costs.
29 1 Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Non-derivative Financial Instruments 
Non-derivative financial instruments comprise investments in equity and debt securities, trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, loans 
and borrowings, and trade and other payables.
Unless otherwise indicated, the carrying amounts of the Group’s financial assets and liabilities are a reasonable approximation of their fair values. 
Trade and other Receivables
Th e value of trade and other receivables is the amount that would be received if the debt was cleared on the period end date which is a close approximation
to amortised cost.
Trade and other Payables
Th e value of trade and other payables is the value that would be payable to settle the liability at the period end date.
Cash and Cash Equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances. Bank overdrafts that are repayable on demand and which form an integral part of the Group’s cash
management are included as a component of cash and cash equivalents.
Interest-bearing Borrowings
Interest-bearing borrowings are stated at amortised cost using the eﬀective interest method.
Property, Plant and Equipment
Recognition and Measurement
Items of property, plant and equipment are measured at cost or fair value at the date of acquisition, less accumulated depreciation and impairment provisions.
Costs include expenditure that is directly attributable to the acquisition of the asset. Th e cost of self-constructed assets includes the cost of materials and
direct labour and any other costs directly attributable to bringing the asset to a working condition for its intended use, and the costs of dismantling and
removing the items and restoring the site on which they are located. Purchased software that is integral to the functionality of the related equipment 
is capitalised as part of that equipment.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write oﬀ the cost, less estimated residual value, of the property, plant and equipment by equal instalments over their estimated
useful economic lives to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. When parts of an item of property, plant and equipment have diﬀerent useful lives,
they are accounted for as separate items (major components) of property, plant and equipment.
Th e depreciation rates used are as follows:
Freehold buildings 2% – 20% Plant and equipment 10% – 33%
Leasehold property Up to the remaining life of the lease Assets under construction Nil
Fixtures and fittings 10% – 33% Motor vehicles 25% – 33%
Impairment reviews of fixed assets are undertaken if there are indications that the carrying values may not be recoverable.
Leased Assets
Leases under the terms of which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership are classified as finance leases. Upon initial recognition
the leased asset is measured at an amount equal to the lower of its fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments. Subsequent to initial
recognition, the asset is accounted for in accordance with the accounting policy applicable to that asset.
Assets acquired by finance lease and hire purchase are depreciated over the lease term or their useful lives. 
Obligations under finance leases are included in liabilities net of the finance charge allocated to future periods. Th e finance element of the rental payment
is charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as finance expense so as to produce a constant periodic rate of charge on the net obligations
outstanding in each period.
Other leases are operating leases and the leased assets are not recognised on the Group’s Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.
Operating Lease Payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease.
Finance Lease Payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. Th e finance charge is allocated 
to each period during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
30 1 Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Intangible Assets and Goodwill
Goodwill
Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested
annually for impairment.
Goodwill arises when the fair value of the consideration for the business exceeds the fair value of the net assets acquired. Where the excess is negative
(negative goodwill), the amount is taken to retained earnings. Goodwill is capitalised and subject to impairment reviews both annually and where there 
are indications that the carrying value may not be recoverable.
Impairment
Th e carrying amounts of the Group’s intangible assets and goodwill are reviewed at each period end date to determine whether there is an indication 
of impairment. Intangible assets and goodwill are considered to be impaired if objective evidence indicates that one or more events have had a negative
eﬀect on the estimated future cash flows of that asset. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated.
For goodwill and intangible assets that have an indefinite useful life, the recoverable amount is estimated at each period end date.
An impairment loss would be recognised whenever the carrying amount of an intangible asset, goodwill or its cash generating unit exceeds its recoverable
amount. Impairment losses are recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Calculation of Recoverable Amount
Th e recoverable amount is the greater of the assets’ fair values less costs to sell and its value in use. In assessing an asset’s value in use, the estimated future
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time value of money and the
risks specific to the asset.
Deferred Consideration
Th e provision for deferred consideration is initially stated at the net present value of the expected future payment and the discount is accrued by increasing
or decreasing the amount of the provision or debtor up to the expected payment or receipt date. Th e charge or credit relating to the unwinding of the discount
is recorded within finance costs or finance income.
Inventories
Inventories are measured at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is determined on the first-in first-out basis, and includes all direct costs incurred
and attributable production overheads. Net realisable value is based upon estimated selling price allowing for all further costs of completion and disposal.
Specific provisions are made against old and obsolete stock taking the value to zero or an estimated reduced value based on the most likely route for disposal
of each particular item of stock.
Employee Benefits
Defined Benefit Plans
Our wholly owned subsidiary Memory Lane Cakes Ltd operates a defined benefit pension scheme and the pension costs are charged to the Consolidated
Statement of Profit and Loss and Other Comprehensive Income in accordance with IAS 19 (revised), with current and past service cost being recognised
as an administrative expense, interest on assets and liabilities is shown as finance income or a finance cost in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss.
Th e remeasurements are recognised in full in Other Comprehensive Income. Further details on the defined benefit pension scheme are given in Note 16 
to the Financial Statements.
Defined Contribution Plans
Th e costs of contributing to defined contribution and personal pension schemes are charged to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss 
as an administration cost in the period to which they relate.
Share-based Payment Transactions
Th e value, as at the grant date, of options granted to employees is recognised as an employee expense, with a corresponding increase in equity, over the period
in which the employees become unconditionally entitled to the options. Th e fair value of the options granted is measured using an option valuation model,
taking into account the terms and conditions upon which the options were granted.
Revenue
Revenue represents the amounts derived from the sale of bakery products. Revenue is the invoiced value of consideration received or receivable excluding
value added tax, trade discounts, transactions with or between subsidiaries and less the cost of price promotions and sales over-riders. Revenue is recognised
upon despatch of goods.
Segmental Reporting
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur expenses, including revenues
and expenses that relate to transactions with any of the Group’s other components. All segments’ operating results are reviewed regularly by the Group’s
Board of Directors. The Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered to be the Board.
31 1 Significant Accounting Policies (continued)
Licence Fees
Payments made for licence fee charges are recognised under cost of sales in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss in the period to which they relate.
Any charges relating to future years are deferred and recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss under cost of sales over the life of the contract.
Finance Income and Cost
Finance costs comprise loan interest payable, interest payable and finance charges on finance leases recognised using the eﬀective interest method, unwinding
of the discount on provisions and deferred consideration, interest on defined benefit pension plan obligations and changes in the fair value of interest rate swaps.
Finance income comprise expected return on defined benefit pension plan funds invested, interest receivable on funds invested and changes in the fair
value of interest rate swaps. Interest income is recognised in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as it accrues, using the eﬀective interest method.
Taxation
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss except 
to the extent that it relates to items recognised directly in equity, in which case it is recognised in equity.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the period end date, 
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous years.
Deferred tax is provided on temporary diﬀerences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting purposes and the amounts
used for taxation purposes. Th e following temporary diﬀerences are not provided for: 
• Th e initial recognition of goodwill;
• Th e initial recognition of assets or liabilities that aﬀect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business combination; and
• Th e diﬀerences relating to investments in subsidiaries to the extent that they will probably not reverse in the foreseeable future.
Th e amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax
rates enacted or substantively enacted at the period end date. A deferred tax asset is recognised only to the extent that it is probable that future taxable profits
will be available against which the temporary diﬀerence can be utilised.
Research and Development Expenditure
Expenditure on research activities, undertaken with the prospect of gaining new scientific or technical knowledge and understanding, is recognised 
in Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss as incurred.
32 2 Discontinued Operations
In the prior year comparatives on 27 February 2013 the Group sold its Free From business for a total undiscounted value £21,257,000 and a pre-tax gain 
of £1,184,000 was recorded. 
Th e Free From business consisted of two subsidiaries, Livwell Limited (“Livwell”) and United Bakeries (Holdings) Limited (“UBH”) (the holding company

3 Revenue and Segment Information 
Operating segments are identified on the basis of internal reporting and decision making. Th e Group’s Chief Operating Decision Maker is considered 
to be the Board as they are primarily responsible for the allocation of resources to segments and the assessment of performance by segment.
Th e Board uses adjusted operating profit, reviewed on a regular basis, as the key measure of the segments’ performance. Operating profit in this instance 
is defined as profit before the following:
• Net financing expense
• Share option charges
• Non-recurring significant items
• Fair value adjustments relating to acquisitions 
• Pension charges or credits in relation to the diﬀerence between the expected return on pension assets and interest cost on pension liabilities and 
• Revaluation of interest rate swaps and forward foreign currency contracts.
Th e Board regularly reviews along with operating profit, the segmental revenue from the sale of bakery products, direct and indirect costs, ebitda, and return
on capital employed.
Th e UK cake and bread business is viewed as one segment – UK Bakery, whilst the 50% owned business Lightbody Stretz Limited is viewed as a separate
segment – Overseas.
Th e UK Bakery segment manufactures and sells bakery products to the UK’s multiple grocers. Th is segment primarily comprises the operations of Memory
Lane Cakes Ltd, Lightbody Group Ltd, Campbells Cake Company Ltd and Nicholas & Harris Ltd. Th ese subsidiaries were aggregated into a single segment
after considering the following criteria:
• Th e nature of the products – products are similar in nature and are classed as manufactured bakery products, the products sit side by side 
in the retailers’ bakery aisles
• Th e production process – the production processes have the same or similar characteristics
• Th e economic characteristics – the average gross margins are expected to be similar
• Th e customers – five customers account for approximately 70-75% of total revenue, these customers are common throughout the subsidiaries
• Th e distribution methods – the same methods of distribution apply to all subsidiaries.
Th e core operation of the Overseas segment is the distribution of the Group’s UK manufactured product along with the sale of third party products
primarily to Europe. 
Costs of Group operations plus a 10% premium have been allocated across the segments on the basis of their operating profit. Th e premium has been charged
to reflect the synergies achieved from obtaining resources centrally giving benefits across the operating segments. Operating profit levels have been chosen 
as the basis, as this reflects the underlying performance of the segment and is also the return the Group expects from those segments.
A purchasing premium of 2% is charged from Group operations, and is calculated on materials and packaging spends at segmental level. Th is charge is based 
on the rationale that Group operations, through its Group buyers, optimises the Group’s procurement spend through leveraging its purchasing power. 
Th is has resulted in a profit from continuing operations of £0.5m (2013: £0.8m) being presented within the Group Operations segment.
Th e Group’s finance income and expenses cannot be meaningfully allocated to the individual operating segments. 35

9 Taxation (continued)
Reductions in the corporation tax rate from 24% to 23% (eﬀective from 1 April 2013) and to 21% (eﬀective 1 April 2014) were substantially enacted 
on 3 July 2012 and 2 July 2013 respectively. Further reduction to 20% (eﬀective from 1 April 2015) was substantially enacted on 2 July 2013. Th is will 
reduce the company’s future current tax charge accordingly. Th e deferred tax asset at 28 June 2014 has been calculated based on the 20% rate.
Th e impact of the reduction in the UK corporation tax rate from 23% to 21% from April 2014 amounts to £82,000 lower charge in the financial year 
to 28 June 2014. Th e rate change on deferred tax has had an adverse impact on the current year tax charge amounting to £197,000. Th e adjustment 
for prior year in 2013 relates to additional tax relief on qualifying R&D expenditure for prior periods.
Th e parent company has an unrecognised deferred tax asset of £191,300 (2013: £219,995). Th is asset has not been recognised in these Financial Statements 
as suitable profits to utilise the underlying losses are not expected to arise in the future. 
10 Earnings Per Ordinary Share
Basic earnings per share for the period is calculated on the basis of profit for the year after tax, divided by the weighted average number of shares in issue
65,635,000 (2013: 59,904,000).  
Basic diluted earnings per share is calculated by adjusting the weighted average number of ordinary shares outstanding to assume conversion of all potential
dilutive ordinary shares; which for 28 June 2014 the diluted weighted average number is 70,169,000 shares, (2013: 65,653,000). 
An adjusted earnings per share and an adjusted diluted earnings per share have also been calculated as in the opinion of the Board this will allow
shareholders to gain a clearer understanding of the trading performance of the Group. Th ese adjusted earnings per share exclude:
• Reorganisation and other significant non-recurring costs
• IAS 39 ‘Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement’ fair value adjustment relating to the Group’s interest rate swaps 
and foreign exchange contracts
• IAS 19 (revised) ‘Accounting for retirement benefits’ relating to the net income
• IFRS 3 ‘Business Combinations’ discount charge relating to the deferred consideration payable and receivable
• Th e taxation eﬀect at the appropriate rate on the adjustments.

12 Intangibles
Intangible assets comprise licences and goodwill.
a) Licences
Th e value of the licensing agreements is calculated by reference to the additional cash flow they are expected to generate over unbranded sales. Th e period
over which the value is amortised varies between licences depending on their remaining life.
Th e licenses recognised were purchased as part of the acquisition of Goswell Enterprises Ltd in June 2009 and relate to the exclusive licensing agreements
for Cranks, Doves Farm breads and Vogels. Th e period over which the value is amortised is the life of the license which is five years to June 2014. 
Th ese licences have been renewed at no up front cost.

b) Goodwill
Goodwill has arisen on acquisitions and reflects the future economic benefits arising from assets that are not capable of being identified individually and
recognised as separate assets. Th e goodwill reflects the anticipated profitability and synergistic benefits arising from the utilisation of the Group’s existing
distribution channels and customer relationships in the bakery sector. Th e goodwill is the balance of the total consideration less fair value of assets acquired
and identified. Th e carrying value of the goodwill is reviewed annually for impairment.
Total
£000
Balance at 29 June 2013 and at 28 June 2014 52,968
Th e carrying amount of goodwill has been allocated to cash generating units or groups of cash generating units as follows:
2014 2013
£000 £000
Nicholas & Harris 2,980 2,980
Lightbody of Hamilton 48,474 48,474
Memory Lane Cakes 1,514 1,514
52,968 52,968 12 Intangibles (continued)
Th e Group tests goodwill for impairment on an annual basis, or more frequently if there are indications that the goodwill may be impaired. Th e recoverable
amounts of the cash generating units are determined from value in use calculations. Th e key assumptions for the value in use calculations are the discount
rate used for future cash flows and the anticipated future changes in revenue, direct costs and indirect costs. Th e assumptions used reflect the past experience
of management and future expectations.
Th e Group prepares cash flow forecasts based on the most recent financial budgets approved by management and extrapolates these forward for the next 
five years with a residual value at the end of the five years. Changes in revenue and direct costs are based on past experience and expectations of future
changes in the market.  
Th e revenue growth rate used for impairment tests at 28 June 2014 was 3% (2013: nil) for all cash generating units. Th is inflation rate of 3% (2013: nil) 
has been applied to the 2015 budget and for the following 5 years on costs of sales, variable costs and indirect costs. Th e five year cashflow is taken along
with a residual value at the end of the five year period.
A pre-tax discount rate of 10% (2013: 10%) has been used in these calculations. Th e Group has considered the economic environment and higher level 
of return expected by equity holders due to the perceived risk in equity markets when selecting the discount rate. 
Th e discount rate used for each cash generating unit has been kept constant as the market risk is deemed not to be materially diﬀerent between the diﬀerent
segments of the bakery sector, nor over time.
Sensitivities have been carried out by the Directors and they are comfortable that at reasonable discount levels there are no indications of impairment.

Traders Limited (10.5% of the issued capital of that company). Th ere is no active market in these shares, therefore the fair value cannot be determined and 
the investments are held at cost.
Interest Rate Swaps at Fair Value
Th e Group has entered into three interest rate swap arrangements to hedge its risks associated with interest rate fluctuations:
£5.0m for five years from 1 July 2011 (fixed) at 3.6%
£3.0m for four years from 22 May 2013 (fixed) at 1.7%
£6.0m for three years from 2 June 2014 (fixed) at 1.9%
One four year interest rate swap of £10.0m (fixed) at 4.9% matured during the year in June 2014.
Th e total coverage at the year end of £14.0 million (2013: £18.0 million) is equivalent to 159% (2013: 250%) of total net bank debt at a weighted average
rate of 2.5% (2013: 4.0%).
A credit of £708,000 (2013: credit £855,000) is shown in finance income for the periods reflecting changes in the fair values of interest rate swaps. 
Th e fair values are liabilities as a result of the current low levels of base and LIBOR interest rates.
Forward Foreign Exchange Contracts at Fair Value
Th e Group has entered into a number of forward foreign exchange contracts to minimise the impact of fluctuations in exchange rates. A credit of £81,000
(2013: charge £179,000) is shown in administration expenses for the periods reflecting changes in their fair value.  15 Deferred Consideration Receivable
On 27 February 2013 the Group sold its Free From business to Genius Foods for a total value of £21,257,000, £3,000,000 of which has been deferred 
and is payable 27 February 2015. Deferred consideration is shown as a current asset in the Consolidated Statement of Financial Position.

16 Pension Schemes
A number of companies within the Group operate defined contribution pension schemes with one company also operating a defined benefit scheme. 
Defined Contribution Scheme
Th e Group made contributions in respect of its defined contribution pension arrangements of £688,000 (2013: £648,000). 
Defined Benefit Scheme
Th e Group’s defined benefit scheme is the Memory Lane Cakes Pension Scheme, which is a separately administered plan. At the financial year end 2014,
the scheme had no active members accruing benefits (2013: nil), 227 deferred pensioner members (2013: 240) and 200 pensioner members (2013: 189).
Th e scheme was closed to future accrual on 31 May 2010. Th e assets of the schemes are held separately from those of the company. Th e amounts in the
Financial Statements for the 52 weeks ended 28 June 2014 relating to defined benefit pension are based on a full actuarial valuation dated 31 December
2012, which was updated at the end of the financial year 2013.
A £70,834 contribution was paid during the financial year 2014 from Memory Lane Cakes (2013: £65,000). Th e Group’s contribution has been agreed 
based on the outcome of the full actuarial valuation dated 31 December 2012. Th e valuation of the Scheme on an equity/bond basis and projected unit
method, showed that there was a deficit of £1,910,000 equivalent to a 10% deficit of liabilities over assets. Th e valuation was conducted by a qualified
independent actuary. Th is deficit is payable at a rate of £100,000 per annum until September 2020, a full valuation is due by 31 December 2015 which 
will challenge the appropriateness of this recovery plan taking into consideration the deficit recovery contributions and actual returns realised on the 
pension scheme assets. 
A revised version of IAS 19 Defined Benefit Plans applies to accounting periods on or after 1 January 2013. Th e year to 28 June 2014 is the first year end 
for which the revised standard will apply, comparatives have been restated under the new standard.
During the year over 90% of the plan assets previously held in a target return fund targeting three month LIBOR +3% pa were moved to two diversified
growth funds which targets 6 month LIBOR +5% and CPI + 5%. Th is move followed a review of the investment strategy. Th e expected return on cash
balances held is based on the current Bank of England base rate rather than long-term deposit rates as cash is held to cover short-term requirements. 
Th e full actuarial valuation diﬀers from the financial year end valuation deficit of £3,630,000 (2013: £2,843,000). No allowance is made in the financial year
end valuation for any outperformance expected from the Scheme’s actual asset holding over and above high quality corporate bonds. Th e weighted average
expected return is 6.3% compared to the expected return in the year end valuation of 4.3%.

Discount rate for liabilities 4.3% 4.7%
Expected rate of return for plan assets 4.3% 4.7% 47
16 Pension Schemes (continued)
Th e diﬀerential between the assumed rate of inflation and the discount rate for liabilities is 1.8% (2013: 2.2%).
Salary inflation assumptions are as determined by the Board with regard to price inflation. Th e salary inflation from 31 May 2010 when the Scheme closed
to future accrual was assumed to be in line with inflation.
Th e financial assumptions are based on market conditions as at the review date of 28 June 2014 with discount rates based on the yields on long-dated high
quality corporate bonds. Th e discount rate is lower than the discount rate used last year reflecting the change in bond yields over this period. Th e expected
rate of return for plan assets is the long-term rate that reflects the yield on high quality corporate bonds as required under changes to IAS 19. Th e expected
rate of return is eﬀectively based on the discount rate with no allowance made for any outperformance expected from the Scheme’s actual asset holding.

Male currently at age 45 24.2 24.1
Female currently at age 45 26.9 26.8
Male currently at age 65 22.5 22.4
Female currently at age 65 25.0 24.9
Changing the year end 2014 assumptions to those of 2013 year end listed above, the deficit would have been £1,977,000 compared to the reported deficit 
of £3,630,000. 
Sensitivity Analysis
Th e calculation of the defined benefit obligation is sensitive to the assumptions set out above. Th e following table summarises changes in these assumptions
and their approximate (decrease)/increase on liabilities.
2014
Discount rate plus 0.5% (£2.1 million)
Discount rate minus 0.5% £2.4 million
Inflation plus 0.5% £2.0 million
Inflation minus 0.5% (£2.0 million)
Life expectancy plus 1.0 years £0.4 million
Life expectancy minus 1.0 years (£0.4 million)
Th e above sensitivities are approximate and only show the likely eﬀect of an assumption being adjusted whilst all other assumptions remain the same.
Th e weighted average duration of the defined benefit obligation is around 19 years.
Risk Mitigation Strategies
Whilst the Scheme does not explicitly hold risk mitigation strategies such as swaps, annuities or liability driven investments, the investment strategy 
is dominated by diversified growth funds which are intended to reduce the investment risk through diversification. 48
16 Pension Schemes (continued)
Eﬀect of the Scheme on the Company’s Future Cashflows
Th e Company is required to agree a Schedule of contributions with the Trustees of the Scheme following a valuation which must be carried out at least once
every three years. Th e next valuation of the Scheme is due as at 31 December 2015. In the event that the valuation reveals a larger deficit than expected the
Company may be required to increase contributions above those set out in the existing Schedule of Contributions. Conversely, if the position is better than
expected contributions may be reduced. Th e Company expects to pay contributions of £100,000 in the year to 30 June 2015. Th e projected net interest charge
to the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss for the year to 30 June 2015 is £154,000, this projection assumes cashflows to and from the scheme are
broadly unchanged from the current year figures and that there will be no events that would give rise to a settlement/curtailment/past service cost.  
Th e history of the plans for the current and prior periods is as follows:

assuming that the cashflows to and from the Scheme are broadly unchanged from the current year’s figures and that there will be no events that will give 
rise to settlement, curtailment or past service cost or credit.

25 Financial Risk Management 
Th e main purpose of the Group’s financial instruments which comprise of bank term loans, invoice discounting facility, hire purchase, finance leases, interest
rate swaps, foreign currency forwards, cash and liquid resources and various items arising directly from its operations, such as trade receivables and trade
payables, is to finance the Group’s operations. Th e main risk arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Th e Group’s
policies on the management of liquidity, credit, interest rate and foreign currency risks are set out below and also referred to in the Strategic Report.
a) Fair V alues of Financial Instruments
All financial assets and liabilities are held at amortised cost apart from forward exchange contracts, interest rate swaps and deferred consideration receivable,
which are held at fair value, with changes going through the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss. Th e Group has not disclosed the fair values for
financial instruments such as short-term trade receivables and payables, because their carrying amounts are a reasonable approximation of fair values.  
Th e fair values of forward exchange contracts and interest rate swaps are determined using a market comparison valuation technique. Th e fair values are
based on broker quotes. Similar contracts are traded in an active market and the quotes reflect the actual transactions in similar instruments. Th e fair values
relating to these instruments represent level 2 in the fair value hierarchy which relates to the extent the fair value can be determined by reference to comparable
market values. Th e classifications range from level 1 where instruments are quoted on an active market through to level 3 where the assumptions used 
to arrive at fair value do not have comparable market data.  25 Financial Risk Management (continued)
b) Liquidity
Th e Group’s policy is to ensure that it has suﬃcient facilities to cover its future funding requirements. Short-term flexibility is available through the 
existing bank facilities and the netting oﬀ of surplus funds. Th e carrying amounts are the amounts due if settled at the period end date. Th e contractual
undiscounted cash flows include estimated interest payments over the life of these facilities. Th e estimated interest payments are based on interest rates
prevailing at the 28 June 2014.

Th e carrying amount relating to interest rate swaps is the fair value.
Th e information relating to the interest rate swaps shown in the tables above indicate the cash flows associated with these instruments. Th is also reflects 
the expected eﬀect on the future profit. Th ese amounts will change as interest rates change.
Short-term flexibility is available through existing bank facilities and the netting oﬀ of surplus funds.
c) Credit Risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual obligations, and arises
principally from the Group’s receivables from customers. Th ese trading exposures are monitored and managed at operating level and are also monitored at
Group level. Whilst there is a concentration of credit risk arising from the profile of five customers accounting for 73% of total revenue, the Group deems
this to be low risk due to the nature of these customers. Th e carrying amount of the financial assets represents the maximum credit exposure. Th erefore, the
maximum exposure to credit risk for the trade receivables at the period end date was £22.4 million (2013: £21.9 million) and the ageing of trade receivables
at the period end date was:  
2014 2013
£000 £000
Not past due 21,052 19,297
Past due 0 – 30 days 1,167 2,082
Past due 31 – 120 days 144 427
Past due more than 120 days 47 58
22,410 21,864
Th e above numbers are net of impairment provisions. Group policy is to provide in full against all receivable balances whose full recovery is significantly 
in doubt. Th e provision is netted oﬀ the gross receivable.
53 54
25 Financial Risk Management (continued)
Th e Group’s strategy is to focus on supplying UK multiple grocers, the nature of these customers is such that there is relatively low risk of them failing 
to meet their contractual obligations. Th ere is no impairment necessary to the value of trade receivables at the period end date over and above the specific
credit note provision and bad debt provision held at the year end. Th e balance of £0.2 million past due by more than 30 days is equivalent to less than 
1 day sales (2013: £0.5 million, equivalent to 1 day).
Deferred consideration amounting to £3 million is due from Genius Foods Ltd on 27 February 2015, there is deemed not to be an issue over recoverability of
this receivable. 
d) Market Risk
i) Interest Rate Risk
Th e Group’s interest rate risk exposure is primarily to changes in variable interest rates. Th e Group has entered into three interest rate swap arrangements 
in order to hedge its risks associated with any fluctuations. Details of swaps are given in Note 14.
Th e profile of the Group’s loans including deferred consideration and overdraft at the period end date were split as follows:
2014 2013
£000 £000
Variable rate liabilities 9,406 8,739
Swaps amounting to £14,000,000 (2013: £18,000,000) limit the risk associated with the variable rate liabilities, the weighted average interest rate 
at 28 June 2014 is 2.5% (2013: 4.0%).
Sensitivity
A 1% increase in the base rate or LIBOR would have the following impact on interest charges and associated net assets for the Group, this sensitivity 
relates to interest-bearing bank borrowings and interest rate swaps only and excludes possible changes in pension financing costs. 
2014 2013
£000 £000
Profit decrease 160 70
Decrease in net assets 160 70
A 1% decrease in the base rate or LIBOR would have an equal and opposite impact to those listed above. 
Th e above movement is not equal to 1% of interest-bearing loans because of interest rate swap cover that is in place. 
ii) Commodity Prices
Any rises in commodity prices can adversely impact the core profitability of the business. Th e Group will aim to pass on its increased costs to its customers 
as far as is reasonable in the circumstances whilst maintaining its tight control over overhead costs to mitigate the impact on consumers. Th e Group maintains
a high expertise in its buying team and will consider long-term contracts where appropriate to reduce uncertainty in commodity prices. Further information 
on input prices and risks is contained in the Strategic Report.
iii) Foreign Exchange Risk
Th e Group currently supplies UK manufactured products to Lightbody Stretz Ltd, its 50% owned selling and distribution business trading primarily 
in Europe. Th e Group also purchases some raw materials in foreign currency. Th e consequence of this is that the Group is exposed to movement in foreign
currency rates. Forward foreign exchanges contracts are used to manage the foreign exchange exposure.
e) Debt and Capital Management
Th e Group’s objective is to maximise the return on net invested capital while maintaining its ongoing ability to operate and guaranteeing adequate returns
for shareholders and benefits for other stakeholders, within a sustainable financial structure. On 21 March 2014, the Board approved an interim dividend 
for the six months to 28 December 2013 of 0.25p per share paid on 25 April 2014 to shareholders on the register at the close of business on 4 April 2014. 
A final dividend of 0.75p per share has been proposed. It is the Company's intention, to pay dividends at an aﬀordable rate so that the Company can
continue to invest in the business in order to grow profits. 25 Financial Risk Management (continued)
Th e Group manages its capital by monitoring its gearing ratio on a regular basis, there are also covenant tests which are monitored regularly and presented 
to the Group’s bank every 6 months. Th ere have been no breaches of covenant tests during the year and the gearing ratio stands at 0.1 (2013: 0.1). 
Th e gearing ratio is calculated taking total net debt including deferred consideration over net assets.
Th e Group considers its capital to include share capital, share premium and capital redemption reserve.
Th e Group does not have any externally imposed capital requirements.
26 Capital and Reserves
Th e reconciliation of movement in capital and reserves is shown as a primary statement Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity. Within retained
earnings is the net exchange diﬀerence balance at the year end of £63,000 gain (2013: £63,000 gain). 
Equity comprises the following:
• Share capital representing the nominal value of equity shares
• Share premium representing the excess of the fair value of consideration received for the equity shares, net of expenses of the share issue over nominal 
value of the equity shares
• Capital redemption reserve representing the buyback and cancellation of shares at nominal value
• Retained earnings represent retained profits.

Th e holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at meetings of the Company. 
Share-Based Payments 
Th e Group operates both approved and unapproved share option schemes. 
Th e fair value is calculated at the grant date and ultimately expensed in the Consolidated Statement of Profit and Loss over the vesting period, based 
on the best available estimate of the number of share options expected to vest, with a corresponding credit to reserves.
Upon exercise of the share options the proceeds received net of attributable transaction costs are credited to share capital and where appropriate share premium.

34 Accounting Policies
Th e following accounting policies have been applied consistently in dealing with items which are considered material in relation to the Financial Statements.
Basis of Preparation
Th e financial year was the 52 weeks ended 28 June 2014 (prior financial year 52 weeks ended 29 June 2013). Th e Financial Statements for the Company have
been prepared in accordance with applicable accounting standards, and under the historical cost accounting rules and in accordance with applicable United
Kingdom Generally Accepted Accounting Principles (UK GAAP) and law.
Under section 408 of the Companies Act 2006 the Company is exempt from the requirement to present its own Profit and Loss Account. Th e profit or loss
for the year is set out in the Reconciliation of Movements in Shareholders’ Funds.
Under Financial Reporting Standard 1 the Company is exempt from the requirement to prepare a cash flow statement on the grounds that it is included
within the consolidated accounts.
Th e accounting policies of the Company are the same as for the Group except for the following:
Investments
Investments are stated at cost less provision for any permanent diminution in value. 
Taxation
Th e credit for taxation is based on the loss for the year and takes into account taxation deferred because of temporary diﬀerences between the treatment 
of certain items for taxation and accounting purposes.
Deferred tax is recognised, without discounting, in respect of all temporary diﬀerences between the treatment of certain items for taxation and accounting
purposes which have arisen but not reversed by the balance sheet date, except as otherwise required by FRS 19.

Th e Company maintains a Directors and Oﬃcers liability insurance policy.
Financial Instruments
Th e Group’s financial instruments comprise mortgage, asset finance facilities, a confidential invoicing facility, revolving credit facility, cash and liquid

Th e main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are interest rate risk and liquidity risk. Th e Board reviews and agrees policies for managing

Interest Rate Risk
Th e Group finances its operations by retained profits and bank borrowings. A suite of borrowing facilities totalling £32 million is available. Th is includes an
overdraft facility of £3 million, undrawn invoice discounting facility of £12.0 million, undrawn revolving credit of £6 million and unused asset finance

Th e Group aims to improve the performance of the organisation through the development of its employees. Th eir involvement is encouraged by means 
of team working, team briefings, consultative committees and working parties.

Th e Group is committed to equality of employment and its policies reflect a disregard of factors such as disability in the selection and development 
of employees.  
Political and Charitable Contributions
During the year charitable donations amounting to £1,000 (2013: £3,000) were made, primarily to local charities.
Going Concern
On the basis of current financial projections and available funds and facilities, the Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue
in operation for the foreseeable future and, therefore, consider it appropriate to prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis. Refer to the 
basis of preparation for further details.
Auditors
In accordance with Section 489 of the Companies Act 2006, a resolution for the re-appointment of KPMG LLP as auditors is to be proposed at the
forthcoming Annual General Meeting.
• So far as each Directors is aware, there is no relevant audit information of which the Company’s auditor is unaware; and
• Each Director has taken all the steps that they ought to have taken as a Directors in order to make himself aware of any relevant audit information 
and to establish that the Company’s auditor is aware of that information.
Th e Directors’ Report was approved by the Board of Directors on 19 September 2014 and was signed on its behalf by:
Stephen Boyd 
Director 68
Th e Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and the Group and parent company Financial Statements in accordance with applicable
law and regulations.
Company law requires the Directors to prepare Group and parent company Financial Statements for each financial year. As required by the AIM Rules 
of the London Stock Exchange they are required to prepare the Group Financial Statements in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU and applicable
law and have elected to prepare the parent company Financial Statements in accordance with UK Accounting Standards and applicable law (UK Generally
Accepted Accounting Practice).
Under company law the Directors must not approve the Financial Statements unless they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of aﬀairs
of the Group and parent company and of their profit or loss for that period. In preparing each of the Group and parent company Financial Statements, 
the Directors are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• Make judgments and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• For the Group Financial Statements, state whether they have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the EU;
• For the parent company Financial Statements, state whether applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, subject to any material 
departures disclosed and explained in the Financial Statements; and
• Prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the parent company 
will continue in business.

Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities in Respect 
of the Annual Report and the Financial Statements   69
Report on Corporate Governance
Although not required to do so, the Directors have sought to embrace the principles contained in the UK Corporate Governance Code (2012), applicable
to fully listed companies, in formulating and applying the Group’s corporate governance policies. Th ese policies are monitored to ensure that they are
appropriate to the Company’s circumstances and comply as far as possible with the provisions of the Code given the size of the Company.
Th e Board operates as an eﬀective Board in directing the activities of the Group. Th e Board meets at least six times during the year and all the Directors
make every eﬀort to attend these meetings. Th e Board maintains a schedule of matters which are reserved to it for decision, including acquisition policy,
approval of major capital expenditure and approval of annual budgets.
Th e Board consists of the Non-Executive Chairman, Peter Baker who was appointed on 1 July 2014, succeeding Martin Lightbody who stood down from
the Board on 30 June 2014, two Executive Directors (John Duﬀy, Chief Executive and Stephen Boyd, Finance Director), and three Non-Executive Directors
(Paul Monk, Edward Beale and Raymond Duignan. David Marshall who retired from the Board with eﬀect 30 June 2014 had served as a Non-Executive
Director up until that date). Consideration is given to character, judgement and business relationships when considering a Director’s independence. 
Th e role of the Chairman and the Chief Executive are separate. Th e Chairman is responsible for running the Board and he meets regularly and separately
with the Chief Executive and the other Non-Executive Directors to discuss matters for the Board.
Edward Beale is the Chief Executive of City Group Plc and David Marshall is a Director of that company. City Group Plc is a subsidiary of London
Finance & Investment Group Plc, a substantial shareholder in the Company. City Group Plc provides a full company secretarial service to the Company
on an outsourced basis and its fees are set out in Note 31 of the Financial Statements. Th e Company is not large enough to justify the employment of a full
time Company Secretary.  
Board Committees
Th e Board has separate Audit, Nominations and Remuneration Committees.
Th e Audit Committee is chaired by Raymond Duignan with Edward Beale, a chartered accountant, as the other member.
Further details are given in the Audit Committee Report on page 70.
Th e Remuneration Committee is chaired by Raymond Duignan with Edward Beale as the other member.
Further details are given in the Remuneration Committee Report on page 71.
Th e Nominations Committee comprised of David Marshall up until 30 June 2014. Peter Baker now chairs the Nominations Committee and Raymond
Duignan is the other member of that Committee. Th e Committee’s main responsibilities include:
• Advising the Board on the appointment of Directors
• Reviewing the composition and size of the Board
• Evaluating the balance of skills, knowledge, experience and diversity of the Board
• Making recommendations on succession planning.
Internal Controls
Th e Board is responsible for maintaining a sound system of internal controls to safeguard shareholders’ investment and the Group’s assets, as well as reviewing
the eﬀectiveness of those controls. Th e system of internal controls is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risks of failure to achieve the Group’s
objectives and can only provide reasonable, rather than absolute, assurance against material loss and mis-statement. Additional resource has been employed
to review current policies and procedures and to test the systems.
Dialogue with Shareholders
Th e Board maintains a general policy of keeping all interested parties informed by regular announcements and update statements.
In implementing this policy the Board keeps in mind the distribution of shareholders between direct, nominee and institutional shareholders.
Communications are then distributed between these groups accordingly.
Specific methods of communication are:
• Annual general and meetings
• Broker briefings
• Broker and analysts visits to operating sites
• Letters to shareholders when appropriate
• Corporate website (www.finsburyfoods.co.uk)
• One to one meetings with investors. 70
Responsibilities
Th e Audit Committee monitors and reviews areas such as risk management, internal controls and the integrity of financial reporting both internally and
externally. Th e Audit Committee is also responsible for making recommendations to the Board on the appointment of the external auditor and assessing
the auditor’s independence and objectivity. Th e Committee is also responsible for monitoring the auditor’s eﬀectiveness and agreeing the terms of the auditor’s
engagement. It receives reports on these issues from the relevant Executive Directors and reports back to the Board on the action points within those
reports and any recommendations arising. As part of these responsibilities it considers the requirement for an internal audit function.
Th e full terms of reference of the Audit Committee are reviewed periodically by the Board and updated as necessary. A copy can be found on the Company’s
website at www.finsburyfoods.co.uk.
Membership
Th e Audit Committee is chaired by me, Raymond Duignan, the other member being Edward Beale, a Non-Executive Director. Both committee members
are considered by the Board to be independent Directors. Edward Beale, a chartered accountant, was a member of the Accounting Council of the FRC
until August 2013 and therefore has recent and relevant financial experience.
Procedures
Th e Audit Committee met three times during the year. Th e Finance Director is invited to attend Committee meetings and the external auditors are invited
to attend any meetings involving the Financial Statements, the annual audit and other significant matters. Time is set aside during at least one meeting each
year for the Committee to hold discussions in private with the external auditors in the absence of management and Executive Directors.  
Risks and Controls
Group management prepare an Annual Report for the Audit Committee’s consideration that identifies the risks and uncertainties to which the Group is exposed,
the procedures in place to mitigate those risks and uncertainties and the potential impact on the Group. Th e Audit Committee reviews this report and any
concerns that it has over the adequacy of the controls in place, or the level of risk accepted by the Group, are reported to the Board. Th e principal risks and
uncertainties to which the Group is exposed are considered by the Board and are set out in the Strategic Report on page 8.  
Th e Committee reviews the need for an internal audit function on an annual basis. At present, due to the size of the Group and lack of complexity in the
business model, the Committee does not believe that a dedicated full time internal audit function is warranted. Additional resource has been recruited to assist
with the reporting of risks, policies and procedures. A programme of rolling internal control and risk reviews is monitored by the Committee which considers
reports on these reviews at each meeting.  
External Reporting
Th e Board delegates primary responsibility for the preparation of complete, balanced and accurate Financial Statements and disclosures, in accordance with
Financial Reporting Standards and regulations, to the Finance Director. Th e responsibility of the Audit Committee is to consider significant accounting
policies, any changes in policies and significant estimates and judgements, taking into account the external auditors’ view, and to report back to the Board
on any concerns that it might have. Th e Audit Committee reviews and comments on the clarity and completeness of disclosures within the Financial Statements.
Ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the annual Financial Statements and half yearly reports remains with the Board.
Th e Audit Committee also reviews and comments on related information presented with the Financial Statements, in particular the Strategic Report, 
the Directors’ Report and the Report on Corporate Governance.
Key Agenda Items
During the year, the Committee specifically discussed issues arising from:
• Interest rate and currency hedging
• Review of risks and appropriate level of internal controls
• Systems, purchasing and IT security review
• Impairment reviews 
• Dividend policy
• Group insurance renewal
• Pension disclosures.
Certain services relating to taxation, pension, due diligence and IT systems review advice has been received and/or is proposed to be received by the Group’s
auditor. All non-audit services are subject to and have been approved in advance by the Audit Committee Chairman. Th e Audit Committee does not believe
it compromises the auditor’s independence as the Auditor’s ethics and independence policies and procedures are fully consistent with the requirements 
of the APB Ethical Standards.
If any reader of these accounts has suggestions for improvement in the content or the presentation of the Financial Statements, please can they let me know
by writing to info@finsburyfoods.co.uk.

Remuneration Committee Report
Responsibilities
Th e Remuneration Committee provides advice and recommendations to the Board on the policy for remuneration of the Executive Directors of the Company
and other senior managers, to agree within that policy the salary and benefits packages for Executive Directors and executive management and, to agree
business unit cash bonus schemes and equity related remuneration and incentive schemes. Th e Remuneration Committee is also responsible for agreeing
any termination benefits.
Th e full terms of reference of the Remuneration Committee are reviewed periodically by the Board and updated as necessary. A copy can be found on the
Company’s website at www.finsburyfoods.co.uk.
Membership
Th e Remuneration Committee is chaired by me, Raymond Duignan, the other member being Edward Beale, a Non-Executive Director. Both of us are
considered to be independent Directors.
Procedures
Th e Remuneration Committee met three times during the year. Th e Chief Executive is normally invited to attend Committee meetings.
Executive Directors
Th e remuneration packages for full time Executive Directors are structured to attract, motivate and retain Directors with the experience, capabilities 
and ambition required to achieve the Group’s strategic aims. 
Th e main elements of their remuneration packages are:
• Basic annual salary
• Annual cash bonus payments
• Share related incentives.
Th e salaries of Executive Directors are set by the Committee in accordance with the policy agreed by the Board and reviewed annually, taking into account
the performance of the Group, the individual and salary increases given to other Group employees.
Annual bonuses are paid to Executive Directors dependent upon Group profitability targets being achieved and individual objectives, as agreed with the
Committee, being met. Bonus payments for the year to 28 June 2014 are disclosed in Note 7 to the Accounts.
Pension contributions for full time Executive Directors are set at up to 10% of basic annual salary excluding additional amounts arising from bonuses 
or salary sacrifice.
No Director has a service contract incorporating a notice period of more than 12 months.
Chairman and other Non-Executive Directors
Non-Executive Directors are not rewarded with share options and so the Group’s share related incentive plans are restricted to Executive Directors and
senior managers of the Group. Non-Executive Directors receive a fee. Th e remuneration of the Chairman is determined by the Board and the remuneration
of Non-Executive Directors is determined by the Chairman and the Group Chief Executive.
Annual Cash Bonus Schemes
Th e Remuneration Committee reviews and approves proposed annual cash bonus schemes within the Group. Th e main characteristics of these schemes 
are that payments to individuals depend on the profitability of the business unit relative to its budget and the achievement of relevant personal or departmental
performance conditions. Maximum payments under these schemes are set at levels that are meaningful, but not excessive, relative to individuals’ salaries.
Long-Term Incentive Scheme
A new incentive scheme was agreed for the CEO and CFO of the Group in order to align their remuneration more closely with the performance of the Group
and shareholder returns. Th e scheme provides for a bonus to be paid, 50% in cash and 50% in equity, in the event that the EBITDA achieved by the Group
is in excess of the Group's business plan as communicated to shareholders. All cash elements, including costs and tax, must be self funding ie must not impact
negatively the Group plan as communicated. Any shares issued may not be sold without prior consultation and it is noteworthy that neither the CEO or CFO
have sold shares or options, other than to pay tax thereon, since they joined the Group.
In respect of the 2014 financial year the bonuses payable to the CEO and CFO and the equity issued are set out in the table on Board remuneration in Note 7.

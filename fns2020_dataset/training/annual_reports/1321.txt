Ascribe ICW
The Ascribe Integrated
Clinical Workstation
(ICW) provides the 
web-based integration 
to bring together all
applications across the
Group and also
integrate with third-party
and legacy systems.
Park PMR & PharmaciePoS
The Park Patient Medication
Record “PMR” enables retail
pharmacists to maintain a PMR
system and supports the
monitoring of drug interactions 
and contraindications, reducing 
the risk of adverse drug reactions. 
It provides a stock control system
which supports label printing and
the electronic transmission of
orders to wholesalers. The
PharmaciePoS system provides
retail pharmacists with an
electronic point of sale system.
Evolve Exeter
The Exeter System is the longest
successfully running central server
GP solution available in the UK 
and winner of the prestigious
Healthcare Computing Gold 
award for Primary Care
Computing. The Exeter System is
now available as a mobile option
using PDA technology, enabling
GPs and nursing staff to download
the whole practice list with clinical
histories onto a PDA and use it to
enter morbidity and medication
data which is subsequently
uploaded into the practice clinical
system.
Ascribe pharmacy
Ascribe operates as a series of
interacting modules that address 
a range of pharmacy IT
requirements; from electronic
prescribing, pharmacy stock
control & labelling, through to
substance misuse and drug level
monitoring, the modules can
operate in isolation or as a
cohesive and co-ordinated
medicines management solution.
This technology also supports
robotic dispensing systems. 3 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 • ascribe plc

Ascribe’s strategy is to build 
on its position in the medicines
management market through
organic growth and the acquisition
of profitable companies
Pharmacy
The Hospital & Retail Pharmacy
market continues to offer strong
growth opportunities. The Audit
Commission’s ‘Spoonful of Sugar’
report raised several concerns
around the management of
medicines, which can be addressed
with IT solutions. With clients in the
UK, the Far East & Australasia, the
company has seen a marked
increase in the demand for IT
solutions that can be delivered
today and that will integrate with
future health service requirements.
Mental Health and 
Community Care
The Mental Health & Community
Care market is a significant growth
sector within the NHS. There is a
common requirement, addressed 
by Ascribe, to provide ready access
to patient-centric healthcare
information; this allows healthcare
professionals make more informed
decisions, allocate resources and
even book and track appointments
and visits.
Primary and Unscheduled Care
Major hospitals and local GPs’
surgeries throughout the world are
embracing IT solutions that deliver
better support for patients and
ensure that their needs are met 
in a timely and efficient manner. 
From Accident and Emergency
departments, to the GP’s practice,
Ascribe provides tools to track
patients using electronic record
systems that can monitor their
progress, assess their requirements
and improve resource allocation.

Operating Divisions
Ascribe’s major asset is its team 
of healthcare and business

within the health service, and are
passionate about building and
delivering commercial solutions that
focus upon the needs of the patient
and the needs of our customers.
This is a company that is committed
to creating a commercial business
to deliver better healthcare through
IT innovation.
ePEX
ePEX supports the inter-
agency needs of the modern
primary healthcare
community, including
community nursing, mental
health, learning disabilities,
child health, elderly services
and social care. ePEX is used
in over 100 UK Trusts and
supports all the interoperability
standards to meet Integrated
Care Records Service (ICRS)
requirements.
Symphony
Symphony is an Accident &
Emergency system that provides
medical staff with a complete
patient information record.
Symphony can operate as a
stand-alone solution or it can 
be integrated into existing
computer systems. It is also
available as a handheld 
portable system. It enables 
full identification of the patient
and storage of all records in
connection with the patient’s
current and previous
attendances. The data collected
can be defined locally so as to
build up a patient record that is
both pertinent and practical. 4 ascribe plc • ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005
I am delighted to present Ascribe’s first
annual report since its admission to 
AIM on 17 December 2004. The Group
has made significant progress in the
medicines management market and 
has delivered excellent financial results for
the year, surpassing initial expectations. 
This success comes from strong organic
growth and impressive value yielded from
the acquisitions made at, and since,
flotation.
Trading Results
2005 has been a remarkably successful year
for the Group. Following an earlier period of
significant investment in software development,
the company has been able to apply greater
focus on creating and pursuing sales
opportunities. Turnover has increased by 89%
to £5.3m (2004: £2.8m). Operating profit of
£0.7m (2004: (£0.4m)) represents a £1.1m
turnaround in profitability over the previous year.
In order to provide a better understanding of
our trading results we have prepared a pro
forma profit and loss account which is set 
out in the Financial Review on page 10. This
shows the results of the Group as if it had
been trading in its form at flotation for a full
twelve months with the three acquisitions
made in May and June being included in the
results from their dates of acquisition. I am
very pleased to report that the pro forma profit
before tax and the amortisation of goodwill
has grown to £1.3m in the year to 30 June
2005 from a profit of £0.2m in 2004. This has
been due to continued organic growth in sales
of our medicines management software, the
expansion of the group and the delivery of
synergies and economies of scale from
transforming the enlarged group into flexible
and efficient divisions able to call upon key
and common resources. 
Sales revenue visibility is robust with 61% of
pro forma revenues for the current year being
derived from recurring maintenance contracts
and a further 17% of account development
revenue from existing customers. The Group
continues to perform very well in the tenders 
for which it competes.
Pro forma adjusted basic earnings per share
in 2005 increased to 1.0p from 0.3p in 2004.
The Group’s balance sheet is strong with net
cash at 30 June 2005 of £2.7m. Operating
cashflow for the year represented 198% of
operating profits.

Management and Staff
During the period since flotation we have
established a strong plc board and an
effective operating management team who 
are well positioned to deliver enhanced
shareholder value from the enlarged Group. 
In an increasingly competitive environment,
attention to the needs of patients and
customers becomes increasingly important
and I would like to thank all of our employees
for their hard work during the year which has
helped us to maintain our market leading
position in medicines management.
Dividends
The Board has decided to recommend a
progressive dividend policy that shares some 
of the trading success with shareholders
whilst recognising the requirement for cash 
to pursue further acquisitions. The Board
recommends a first and final dividend of 
0.1p per share. Subject to approval by the
shareholders at the AGM on 26 October 2005
this dividend will be paid on 27 October 2005
to shareholders on the register at the close of
business on 7 October 2005.
Current Trading and Outlook
Ascribe has started the new financial year
trading in line with management expectations
and we expect to continue to deliver value 
for our customers and their patients, our
shareholders and our employees. Our strategy
for growth, based on adding companies with
earnings-enhancing IT solutions to our existing
core medicines management business,
provides a growing platform from which to
deliver enhanced growth in the coming years.
The company has already begun to benefit
from synergistic sales opportunities between
products and healthcare markets,
demonstrating the value of solid organic
growth and a more cohesive set of healthcare
solutions to our customers and investors.
We enter the new financial year with excellent
visibility of earnings - an order book at record
levels, a strong bank of tendering activity and
prospects and recurrent maintenance income
that represents over half of the Group’s total
income.

Stephen Critchlow
Chief Executive
Strategy
With over 50% of UK hospital pharmacies
using the Ascribe software, Ascribe has a
unique position in the medicines management
market. Our product includes software to
improve the safe handling and administration of
medicines as well as knowledge databases to
support decision making, when medicines are
prescribed, dispensed and administered.
Strong organic growth can be achieved by
cross selling our solutions to our current
customers who do not have this capability at
present. This gives us access to a market
which is in excess of £1bn in the UK alone. Our
overseas customers provide routes to markets
in Australia, New Zealand and South East Asia. 
The ability to achieve organic growth through
cross-sales comes from Ascribe’s web-based
Integrated Clinical Workstation “ICW” software
which also provides an integration capability
allowing the Group to move to a single product
strategy by controlled evolution. Firstly by
integrating the legacy applications and then by
replacing them over time. Using this approach
Ascribe can grow shareholder value when
acquiring other businesses in the Health IT
sector by improving their solution offering and
sales revenue, and optimising their overheads.
This focused product-strategy means that the
IT healthcare businesses which Ascribe has
and will acquire, can be rapidly integrated into
our model, providing an excellent offering and
additional benefits for patients, healthcare
professionals, employees and ultimately our
shareholders.
Operations
Since flotation we have organised the Group
into three divisions – Pharmacy, Mental 
Health & Community Care and Primary &
Unscheduled Care. These divisions benefit 
from a group sales and product strategy.
Common services across the Group are
managed to improve performance and deliver
economies of scale.
We have built a strong operational
management team which is actively
consolidating the Group and has demonstrated
efficiencies ahead of our initial expectations.
We are able to invest £1m in ongoing R&D
with a profit before tax of £1.3m and an
excellent cash conversion of 198%. I would
like to thank all the employees for the
commitment and energy they have put into
delivering these results and creating such a
healthy platform for growth.
Our overseas operations provide a route to
market for the integrated product. We will be
launching the new web-based pharmacy and
ICW software in our overseas markets in
November 2005.
Pharmacy
The Pharmacy Division comprises the
traditional hospital and retail pharmacy
markets together with the emerging
opportunities in ward-based electronic
prescribing. The Division has a market leading
position in UK hospital pharmacy with Ascribe
software installed in more than 50% of
hospitals. With the acquisition of Park
Systems, the Group now also supplies retail
pharmacy customers. In addition the Division
has systems in 41 hospitals in South East
Asia and Australasia, where it has a sales
office in Brisbane.
The Division has enjoyed continued organic
growth during the year. New software
solutions have been installed and are in 
live usage at 27 new sites. With unique
functionality and access to a clinical decision
support database the ascribe product has
won nearly 90% of the tendering activity in
this market in recent years. Its modern
architecture facilitates simple integration 
with other hospital systems. An experienced
operations team, which includes a high
proportion of pharmacists, ensures that
implementations are efficient and effective 
for the customer. Further sales are expected
where the new medicines management and
electronic prescribing systems are sold to
existing pharmacy customers. 7 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 • ascribe plc
The Ascribe web-based solution supports the
Christie team by enabling them to make more
informed clinical decisions, based upon the
shared availability of clinical and drug information
for each patient. The project began in November
2004 and the first clinic was live within six
months. The Trust-wide rollout is scheduled for
early 2006.
“Our aim for the first phase of this project was to
ensure we could safely prescribe and administer
medicines electronically for the breast cancer

Professionalism and expertise
Mental Health and Community Care
Over 100 primary care trusts in the UK and
Ireland use the Group’s solutions. With a track
record of delivering for over 20 years, ePEX 
is seen as a leader in the Mental Health IT
market. We are already delivering Ascribe’s
new web-based medicines management
solution for drug misuse and customer
feedback has been excellent. These solutions
are expected to comprise a significant
element of the division’s organic growth in 
the coming year.
Healthcare Trusts are widening the usage 
of care systems in the community. Many
customers have therefore extended their
software licences to include further users 
and modules. This increases recurring
maintenance revenue and has been
accelerated by improved system functionality,
particularly in the sphere of web-based
electronic care management modules.
Increasingly, field-based mental health and
child care clinicians are using our systems,
day to day, to treat patients in the community. 8 ascribe plc • ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005

Primary and Unscheduled Care
This Division delivers software to accident &
emergency (A&E) departments, minor injuries
clinics and GP practices throughout the UK
and Ireland. 
The GP system is supported by a loyal user
group who use traditional GP management
software. Primary care processes are
changing considerably and Ascribe is
committed to offering flexible software
solutions to the new ways of working. This 
is being driven by a move to commission
healthcare services from larger and more
capable facilities in the community, offering
unscheduled care such as treating minor
injuries. In May 2005 Ascribe acquired
Footman Walker, which supplies software 
to 30% of A&E departments in the 
UK as well as some of the newer minor
injuries units.  Since acquisition, contracts for
four new sites have been won, demonstrating
the growth potential within this Division. We
are also developing software to serve the
needs of newer GP surgeries where extra
functionality is required.
This approach has been designed to
complement the NHS “Connecting for Health”
programme.
The recent sales orders for A&E solutions
have taken this business to a record sales
level as it moves into the delivery phase of its
latest system offering, “Symphony”.
Symphony is based on the same Microsoft
technologies as the Ascribe products and will
be rapidly integrated to enable a single
product offering.
Product Strategy
Our web-based medicines management
solution will be integrated with the current
product offerings of our recent acquisitions,
providing an ideal vehicle to deliver integrated
modules as follow-on sales to current
customers. The reorganisation of the
development operation will ensure that 
Ascribe can offer a single product to any 
health IT market.
Growth arising from this strategy is expected 
to be delivered progressively over the next 
five years. Using the Group’s overseas
development team in tandem with UK staff 
that has domain knowledge, will mean that
our development resource will be optimised
and will be more effective in its delivery. This
strategy will enable development teams from
incremental acquisitions to quickly reap the
benefits of scale and a common software
architecture.
Sales and Marketing
We have a healthy sales pipeline against the
products currently available. Customers are
demanding integration and clinical functionality
to address changes in healthcare, where
systems become organised around the needs
of both patients and the healthcare
organisation. Ascribe’s Medicines Management
software delivers the functionality required to
address the needs of our customers today
and also delivers integration that can be used
to deliver other products from our merged
Group, seamlessly, to the customer without 
re-development.  9 ANNUAL REPORT AND ACCOUNTS 2005 • ascribe plc
Solihull PCT required an IT system to 
support their implementation of the “Single
Assessment Process” (SAP) which would
allow patient information to be drawn
together from separate systems and shared
across both health and local authority
services within the community. An Ardentia
Data Warehouse was selected for this
purpose and a secure messaging method
was devised to transfer patient data from
ePEX and Care First over the NHS Net into
the Warehouse, providing a common view 
on demographics and referrals, SAP
information, specialist assessments and 
care plans. The e-PEX 3 system went live
with this functionality on 28th June 2005.
“I am pleased that the development has met
its primary objectives and a number of
additional benefits are also being discussed,
including other opportunities for sharing data
that benefits the patient” Neil Serougi,
Director of IT Services, Solihull PCT.
Solihull Primary Care Trust

bring together all those who

simpler for patients.

Business Development
Strong organic growth is coming from selling
our departmental and clinical systems directly
to clinicians. Customers are demanding an
integrated approach to patient care from a
responsive supplier that can be flexible as
health systems change both in the NHS 
and overseas.
Ongoing acquisitions of companies that can
use Ascribe IT solutions to enhance delivery 
to their customers, or who can add to this
product offering, will put Ascribe in a dominant
position as a clinical systems provider.

The Company was incorporated and registered
in England and Wales on 12 August 2004. 
On 17 December 2004, the Company’ s ordinary
shares were admitted to trading on AIM.
Operating Results
(including unaudited pro forma results)
The reported results on page 20 represent the
trading of three elements of the group: firstly,
the Company since incorporation; secondly,
ASC Computer Software Limited and its
subsidiaries (“ASC”) for the year and finally, 
all other subsidiaries since acquisition. These
results show turnover of £5.3m and operating
profit before amortisation of goodwill of £0.9m.
In order to provide a clearer understanding of
the Group’s results we have produced a pro
forma profit and loss statement, which shows
the results for the Group as if its constituent
elements (namely ASC and Protechnic Exeter
Limited (“Protechnic”) at the time of flotation at
17 December 2004 had been trading for the
full year). The results of the acquisitions made 
in late May and June 2005, have been
included from their respective dates of
acquisition. 
The pro forma results for both years have
been prepared on the basis of current
accounting policies, except in so far as: 
a) the same 2005 past-year goodwill
amortisation charge for Protechnic has been
used for 2004; b) the same 2005 interest
credit has been used for 2004; and c) the
same 2005 non-equity dividend has been
used for 2004. The comparative pro forma
results for the year to June 2004 represent 
the results of ASC and Protechnic only for 
that period.

Tax
The tax charge for the year of £0.15m
represents an effective rate of 15.8% on profit
before tax and goodwill amortisation. This is
due to the tax losses utilised against profits
made in ASC and the availability of enhanced
allowances from investment in R&D activity
across the Group. Further details on how the

Balance Sheet and Cash Flow
The balance sheet as at 30 June 2005 shows
net assets of £6.4m, which includes goodwill
of £8.3m, deferred income of £3.7m and
deferred cash consideration of £1.2m. It also
includes net cash balances of £2.7m.
During the year the Group’s cash flow from
operating activities was strong, representing 
a conversion rate of 198% of operating profit
before goodwill amortisation. The funds raised
at float were used to repay ASC’s preference
shareholders and to meet the initial cash
consideration for the Protechnic acquisition.
The Group remains highly cash generative, 
not least because of the high level of recurring
annual maintenance contract income paid 
in advance.
Acquisitions
On 17 December 2004, the Group acquired
the entire share capital of Protechnic Exeter
Limited and its subsidiaries. The initial
consideration of £5m was satisfied by 
£2.7m in cash and £2.3m in shares. Further
consideration of £0.8m in cash is payable if
certain performance criteria are met.
On 20 May 2005, Footman Walker Associates
Limited and its subsidiary was acquired for 
an initial consideration of £1.8m. This was
satisfied by £1m in cash and £0.8m in shares.
A further £0.8m consideration is payable
(£0.2m in cash and £0.6m in cash or shares) 
if certain performance criteria are met.
On 17 June 2005, the Group acquired Arkive
Computing Limited for an initial consideration 
of £52,000 in cash and shares, and deferred
consideration of £55,000.
On 21 June 2005, the Group acquired Park
Systems Limited for an initial cash
consideration of £13,000 plus a deferred
consideration of up to £0.4m (£0.2m in cash
and £0.2m in cash or shares), subject to
meeting certain performance criteria.
Goodwill Amortisation
A charge of £0.15m for the amortisation of
goodwill has been made during the year,
representing a part-year charge in all cases.
Goodwill is being amortised over 20 years for
each of the acquisitions made during the year.

By order of the Board
J S W Lee
Secretary
22 September 2005 Ascribe joined AIM in December 2004 and is therefore not required to comply fully with the provisions of the Combined Code (“the Code”). However the
Directors believe that good corporate governance is essential, and having considered the provisions of the Code, set out below those principles which the
Group has adopted since incorporation and how the Group has applied the principles. The current size of the Group means that full compliance with the
provisions of the Code is not practicable. 
The Board
The Board of Directors includes a balance of Executive and Non-executive Directors. As at the year end the Board comprised two Executive Directors –
the Chief Executive and the Finance Director – and three Non-executive Directors, including the Chairman of the Board. These Directors bring a wide range
of business and sector experience to the Board’ s discussions and decision making.
There is a formal schedule of matters reserved for decision by the Board which includes overall strategy, business planning, acquisitions and the approval
of major items of capital expenditure, thus ensuring that it maintains full and effective control over appropriate strategic, financial, organisation and
compliance issues. The Directors have access to the Company Secretary and to independent legal advice, if required, at the Company’ s expense.
Board committees
The Board delegates certain specific responsibilities to Committees which have been formally constituted and have clearly defined terms of reference.
Audit committee
The Audit Committee, now comprises two Non-executive Directors and is chaired by Mark Woodbridge. It meets at least twice a year when the Executive
Directors are invited to attend. The Committee reviews the interim and annual reports prior to submitting them to the Board for approval. 
It ensures that appropriate accounting and financial policies and procedures are implemented, that systems of internal control and external audit are 
in place and that auditors’ recommendations are considered. 
The Committee receives monthly reports from the Executive Directors, reviews the relationship with the external auditors and recommends the audit fee to
the Board.
The external auditors attend each meeting and have the opportunity for direct access to the Committee without the presence of the Executive Directors for
independent discussions.
Internal controls
The Board is responsible for reviewing and approving the adequacy and effectiveness of the Group’ s internal controls, including financial, operational and
compliance controls and risk management.
The Directors are ultimately responsible for the Group’ s system of internal controls and for reviewing its effectiveness. The role of management is to
implement Board policies on risk and control. 
The key elements of the Group’ s internal control are:
• a clearly defined management structure and delegation of authority to committees of the Board, heads of department and individual business divisions;
• regular and comprehensive information provided to management, covering financial performance and key performance, including non-financial
measures;
• a detailed budgeting process and rolling strategic plan which is approved by the Board;
• procedures for the approval of capital expenditure and business acquisitions; and
• monthly monitoring and re-forecasting of results versus budget, with analysis, investigation and action taken in relation to variances.
Remuneration committee
The Remuneration Committee determines, on behalf of the Board, the Group’ s policy on executive and higher paid staff remuneration and considers and
approves remuneration packages for the Executive Directors. The Remuneration Report is set out on page 16 and 17.
Going concern
The Directors are satisfied that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable future, a period of not less than
12 months from the date of this report. For this reason, they continue to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the financial statements. The Directors
have satisfied themselves that the Group is in a sound financial position and that sufficient cash resources will be available to meet foreseeable operating
cash requirements.
Relations with shareholders
The Company endeavours to maintain regular communications with shareholders through RNS announcements, via the Group’ s website and by direct
contact with its major shareholders. The Board values the views of shareholders and maintains a regular dialogue with investment fund managers, other
investors and analysts to ensure that the investing community receives a consistent view of the Group’ s performance.

Remuneration policy
The Board has appointed the Remuneration Committee to ensure that the Company’s Executive Directors are rewarded to attract, retain and motivate

• benefits including pension contributions, life assurance, company car allowance and healthcare;

Ascribe plc operates approved and unapproved discretionary share option schemes for staff of the Group. The Committee decides which individuals
should participate and the extent of their participation. Share options are awarded within the scheme rules subject to Inland Revenue rules.
Pension benefits
The Ascribe Group operates a number of Stakeholder and Contracted-In Money Purchase schemes where the Group matches staff contributions up
to a maximum of 5%. Both Executive Directors accrue benefits under Money Purchase schemes. In addition the Group operates an executive pension
scheme whereby Stephen Critchlow receives a contribution equal to 15% of his basic salary. Access to independent financial advice is provided to all
eligible staff to ensure that they are aware of the need to make adequate provision for retirement.

Directors’ responsibilities
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year which give a true and fair view of the state of affairs of the
Company and the Group and of the profit or loss of the Group for that year. In preparing those financial statements, the Directors are required to:
• select suitable accounting policies and then apply them consistently;
• make judgements and estimates that are reasonable and prudent;
• state whether applicable accounting standards have been followed, subject to any material departure disclosed and explained in the financial
statements; and
• prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records which disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the
Company and the Group and to enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies Act 1985. They are also responsible
for safeguarding the assets of the Company and the Group and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other
irregularities.
The annual report and accounts is available on the Group website: www.ascribe.com. The maintenance and integrity of the Group’s website is the
responsibility of the Directors. The work carried out by the auditors does not include consideration of these matters. Legislation in the UK governing 
the preparation and dissemination of accounts may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities
For the period ended 30 June 2005 Independent auditor’ s report to the shareholders of Ascribe plc
We have audited the financial statements of Ascribe plc for the year ended 30 June 2005 which comprise the Consolidated Profit and Loss Account,
the Consolidated Statement of Total Recognised Gains and Losses, the Consolidated Balance Sheet, the Company Balance Sheet, the Consolidated
Cash Flow Statement and the related notes. These financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and the accounting
policies set out therein. We have also audited the information in the part of the Remuneration Report that is described as having been audited.
This report is made solely to the company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985. Our audit work has
been undertaken so that we might state to the company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report and for no
other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the company and the company’s
members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and the financial statements in accordance with applicable law and United Kingdom
Accounting Standards are set out in the Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. They are also responsible for the preparation of the other information
contained in the 2005 Annual Report including the Directors’ remuneration report.
Our responsibility is to audit the financial statements in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and United Kingdom Auditing
Standards.
We report to you our opinion as to whether the financial statements give a true and fair view and are properly prepared in accordance with the
Companies Act 1985. We also report to you if, in our opinion, the Directors’ Report is not consistent with the financial statements, if the company has
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if information specified by
law regarding Directors’ remuneration and transactions with the company is not disclosed.
We read other information contained in the Annual Report, and consider whether it is consistent with the audited financial statements. This other
information comprises only the Directors’ Report, the Chairman’s Statement, the Chief Executive’s Report, the Financial Review, the Corporate
Governance Report and the unaudited part of the Remuneration Report. We consider the implications for our report if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the financial statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion
We conducted our audit in accordance with United Kingdom Auditing Standards issued by the Auditing Practices Board. An audit includes
examination, on a test basis, of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements. It also includes an assessment of the
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in the preparation of the financial statements, and of whether the accounting policies are
appropriate to the Group’s circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed.
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the information and explanations which we consider necessary in order to provide us with
sufficient evidence to give reasonable assurance that the financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the financial statements.
Opinion
In our opinion the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state of the affairs of the company and the Group as at 30 June 2005 and of the
Group’s profit for the year then ended, and have been properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985.

1 Accounting policies
Basis of preparation
The financial statements have been prepared under the historical cost convention and are in accordance with applicable accounting standards.
The following principal accounting policies have been applied:
Basis of consolidation
Ascribe plc was incorporated on 12 August 2004 and following a share exchange agreement effected on 23 November 2004 it acquired the entire
share capital of ASC Computer Software Limited and its subsidiaries (“ASC”). This Group reconstruction has been accounted for by using merger
accounting principles and ASC’s results have been included in the Group’s financial statements, as if they had always been a member of the Group
with their results included for the full year. The corresponding 2004 results include the results for ASC for the year to June 2004 and the assets and
liabilities at 30 June 2004 together with the shares issued by the Company as consideration for ASC, as if they had always been in issue.
The Group financial statements consolidate those of the Company and of its subsidiaries up to 30 June 2005. The results of the other subsidiaries
acquired during the period are included from the effective date of acquisition. Profits and losses on intra-Group transactions are eliminated in full.
On acquisition of a subsidiary, all of the subsidiary’s assets and liabilities which exist at the date of acquisition are recorded at their fair values
reflecting their condition at that date. No profit and loss account is presented for the Company, as permitted by Section 230 of the Companies 
Act 1985.
Goodwill
Goodwill arising on acquisition of a subsidiary undertaking or business is the difference between the fair value of the consideration paid and the fair
value of the assets and liabilities acquired. Goodwill arising on consolidation is amortised through the profit and loss account over the Directors’
estimate of the useful life of up to 20 years. Impairment tests on the carrying value of goodwill are undertaken at the end of the first full financial year
following acquisition and in other periods if events or circumstances change.
Turnover and long-term contracts
Turnover comprises the value of sales of licences, implementation, installation, support, maintenance, training, consultation and the supply of third
party software and hardware. Turnover excludes value added tax.
For the supply of hardware, software, and other sales, excluding maintenance, revenue is only recognised when each stage as specified in the
contract or order is completed.
Revenue on long-term contracts is ascertained in a manner appropriate to the stage of completion of the contract at the balance sheet date, with
due regard to anticipated future costs. Amounts recoverable on such contracts are included within debtors. Payments on account in excess of
turnover are included within creditors. Full provision is made for losses on all contracts in the year in which the loss is first foreseen.
For maintenance sales, only that proportion of revenue is recognised which relates to the part of the maintenance period falling within the
accounting year.
Research and development costs
All software research and development expenditure is expensed in the period in which it is incurred.
Depreciation
Depreciation is provided to write off the cost, less estimated residual values, of all fixed assets on a straight-line basis. It is calculated at the
following rates:
Leasehold improvements – 20% per annum.
Fixtures and fittings – 20% - 33
1
⁄ 3% per annum.
Computer equipment – 33
1
⁄ 3% per annum.
Motor vehicles – 33
1
⁄ 3% per annum.
Fixed asset investments
Fixed asset investments in subsidiary undertakings are stated at cost less provision for permanent diminution in value. Cost comprises the
aggregate of cash consideration, shares issued and acquisition expenses.
Deferred consideration
The terms of an acquisition may provide that the fair value of the purchase consideration, which may be payable in cash or shares at a future date,
depends on uncertain future events such as the future performance of the acquired company. The amounts recognised in the financial statements
are the fair value of the deferred consideration that is reasonably expected to be paid at the balance sheet date.
Deferred taxation
Deferred tax balances are recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed by the balance sheet date except
that the recognition of deferred tax assets is limited to the extent that the Group anticipates making sufficient taxable profits in the future to absorb
the reversal of the underlying timing differences. Deferred tax balances are not discounted.
Foreign currency translation
Transactions in foreign currencies are recorded at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities
denominated in foreign currencies are translated into sterling with the rate of exchange ruling at the balance sheet date, or at the contracted rate
when covered by a forward exchange contract. Differences on exchange arising from the retranslation of the opening net investment in subsidiary
undertakings are taken to reserves and reported in the statement of recognised gains and losses. All other foreign exchange differences are taken
to the profit and loss account.
Operating leases
Operating lease rentals are charged to the profit and loss account on an accruals basis over the term of the lease.
Pension costs
Contributions to staff and Directors defined contribution pension schemes are charged to the profit and loss account in the period in which they
become payable.

8 Earnings / (loss) per share
Basic earnings per share are calculated by dividing profit for the financial year attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted average number of
shares in issue. Diluted earnings per share is the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue adjusted for the potential ordinary share dilution
from share options and shares to be issued. Adjusted basic earnings per share was calculated by adding back goodwill amortisation and the
dividends and appropriations relating to non equity shares repaid at flotation, to more accurately reflect the Group’ s underlying earnings.

Goodwill arose on the purchase of subsidiary undertakings during the year. Details of the goodwill arising on each acquisition are shown in note 12 
to these financial statements. In accordance with the requirements of FRS10, goodwill arising on each of the acquisitions during the year has been
capitalised on the Group’ s balance sheet and is being amortised over 20 years. This is the period over which the Directors estimate that the value of
the underlying business acquired will continue to exceed the value of the underlying assets. The investment in each company is included in the
balance sheet at its fair value at the date of acquisition. These fair values are preliminary and will be further reviewed in 2006.

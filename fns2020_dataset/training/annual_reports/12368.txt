What sets us apart
2014 highlights
Our gold equivalent (GE) production
1
 
was 1.43 Moz, up by 12%. This 
exceeded both our original production 
guidance of 1.3 Moz of GE by 10% and 
the updated guidance of 1.365 Moz  
by 5%. This was largely due to the  
full ramp-up of Mayskoye and strong 
operational delivery at Dukat 
and Omolon.
We acquired the Kyzyl gold project  
in Kazakhstan. With gold reserves  
of 6.7 Moz at 7.5 g/t (JORC), this has 
increased Polymetal’s gold equivalent 
reserves by 50%. The project has  
a mine life of at least 20 years with 
substantial exploration potential.
Increased free cash flow generation 
enabled us to go beyond the regular 
dividend and pay a special dividend  
of US$0.20 per ordinary share 
(approximately US$84 million in total).
1
 Gold equivalent is calculated based on 1:60 Ag/Au  
and 5:1 Cu/Au conversion ratios.
1
 Total cash costs comprise cost of sales of the operating assets (adjusted for depreciation expense, rehabilitation expenses and write-down of inventory to net realisable value and certain other 
adjustments, including addition of treatment and refinery charges related to concentrate offtake) and general, administrative and selling expenses of the operating assets. Gold equivalent sales 
volume is calculated based on average realised metal prices in the relevant period. Total cash cost per gold equivalent ounce sold is calculated as total cash costs divided by total gold 
equivalent unit ounces sold.
2
 The Company defines adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation expenses, rehabilitation expenses, write downs of inventory to net realisable 
value, share-based compensation, additional mining tax, VAT, penalties and accrued interest, income on disposal of subsidiaries, bargain purchase gains, foreign exchange gains/(losses), 
changes in fair value of derivatives, changes in fair value of contingent consideration, finance income, finance costs, and income tax expenses. Adjusted EBITDA margin is adjusted EBITDA 
divided by revenue. See Note 6 to the financial statements.
3
 Free cash flow is defined as total operating cash flows less investing cash flow (2014: excluding cash payment for the Kyzyl acquisition).
4
 Mineral resources and ore reserves are estimated in accordance with the JORC Code (2012). Mineral resources are additional to ore reserves.
5
 Average headcount for the period.

Our commitment  
to shareholder value  
creation is underpinned 
by a preference for  
high-grade assets,  
a strong operating and 
project delivery record, 
and capital discipline.
High-grade assets 
 
Our focus on grade and a preference  
for open-pit mines are key factors in 
maintaining lower operating costs and 
reducing per-ounce capital expenditure. 
Proven operating track  
record: delivering and 
exceeding expectations
Our track record speaks for itself: for  
the third consecutive year, we beat our 
production guidance despite difficult 
trading conditions. Our gold equivalent 
(GE) production for 2014 was 1.43 Moz, 
an increase of 12%, exceeding both our 
original production guidance of 1.3 Moz 
of GE (by 10%) and an updated guidance 
of 1.365 Moz (by 5%).
Capital discipline:  
strong free cash flow  
and substantial dividends
Our investment and capital structure 
decisions are based on a strong culture 
of capital discipline. Our project 
development and acquisition decisions 
are only approved if they are able to 
deliver the required return on capital.  
The free cash flow generated allows  
us to deliver a meaningful dividend 
payout while maintaining a comfortable 
leverage level.
Pipeline of quality  
growth projects 
Growth is essential to the long-term  
value of the mining business. With a 
major construction programme within 
existing assets now completed, we are 
concentrating on our next growth phase 
with the development of Kyzyl, Svetloye 
and our platinum group assets. Our latest 
acquisition, Kyzyl, is a world-class asset 
and one of the largest untapped, 
high-grade gold deposits globally.

4 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 5 Bobby Godsell talks about Polymetal’s 
performance, economic environment 
and prospects
Chairman’s Q&A 
I am delighted to be able 
to report a very robust  
set of financial results  
for our shareholders.
What were the key challenges 
for the Company in 2014?
2014 has been a tough year for mining 
companies worldwide. Slowing growth  
in key developing economies, especially 
China, saw mineral prices decline. The 
two minerals that are key to value creation 
in Polymetal, gold and silver, declined by 
10% and 20% respectively. Mining 
companies battled to control costs, bring 
new projects in on time and on budget 
and maintain, let alone grow production. 
All of this has depressed capital growth 
as measured by share prices, and put 
pressure on dividends.
In addition to these general challenges, 
Polymetal has faced the investor 
headwinds of the geopolitical tensions  
in both Ukraine and the European Union.
In this tough context I am therefore 
delighted to report a robust set of results 
for this company.
In 2014, Polymetal increased its gold 
equivalent (GE) production by 12%  
to 1.4 million ounces, 10% above our 
guidance. Adjusted EBITDA grew by 15% 
to US$685 million. In the meantime, the 
Company paid its shareholders significant 
dividends. The company’s dividend yield 
over the last 3 years has averaged 4%.
How did Polymetal achieve  
this, given such difficult 
circumstances?
The Company’s focus has continued to 
be building high-grade assets, shaped 
around hub-based processing facilities. 
This has enabled us to better manage 
costs in this low and declining 
price environment.
This has also helped us to grow 
production combined with strong cash 
generation. The impact of declining gold 
and silver prices has been more than 
offset by currency devaluations in the two 
countries in which we operate, Russia 
and Kazakhstan.
We have also been able this year to 
acquire a major new source of future 
production in the Kyzyl gold project in 
Kazakhstan. This has boosted our total 
reserves by 50% and added a single 
high-grade property with a life of 20 years 
to our asset base.
How do you ensure the 
effective operation of the  
Board and good governance?
Our Board combines effective 
representation of strategic investors with 
a strong (and majority) representation of 
fully independent non-executive Board 
members. Diverse, both in terms of 
professional experience and nationality, 
the Board both aspires to and believes 
that it achieves global best practice in 
terms of corporate governance. 
This is an active Board with a total of  
ten Board meetings during the year under 
review. Ten meetings of the three Board 
committees (Audit and Risk, Remuneration 
and Nomination) have also taken place.
Besides its Terms of Reference and 
Corporate Governance Code defined 
regular duties, the Board has been 
particularly focused on ensuring the 
Company anticipates and adjusts  
to market circumstances; responds 
appropriately to the geopolitical 
challenges that have arisen in the areas  
in which it operates; and continues to 
offer its shareholders meaningful rewards.
The Board visited the Kyzyl Project at  
a relatively early stage of the transaction. 
This project continues to be a focus of 
Board oversight at every meeting.
What, in your view, makes 
Polymetal different from  
its competitors?
Gold mining companies have in general 
produced disappointing results for their 
owners in recent years. Costs have risen 
faster than prices, and development 
projects have disappointed. Companies 
have failed to grow either the value or 
volume side of their wealth creation 
equation. Regional conflicts and a 
growing tide of resource nationalism  
have dramatically heightened the risk 
character of many jurisdictions.
In this context, Polymetal has grown 
production, controlled costs and been 
able to pay dividends to its shareholders 
which totalled US$173 million for the year 
under review. It has again demonstrated 
its ability to create wealth for its owners 
even in a depressed commodity cycle 
and in tough geopolitical circumstances.
What are the objectives and 
challenges for Polymetal in the 
coming year?
Polymetal can neither determine the 
pricing of the metals it produces, nor  
the geopolitical circumstances of the 
jurisdictions in which it operates.  
Our challenge is however to produce 
strong operational results, generate 
strong cash flow and continue to pay  
our shareholders significant dividends.
A particular focus in the coming year will 
be the development of a detailed plan for 
the development of the company’s new 
long life asset in Kyzyl in Kazakhstan.
58%
Dividend payout ratio in 2014
(based on underlying net earnings)
Our ability to  
deliver cash flow to 
shareholders whilst 
maintaining production 
growth is surely the 
best evidence that we 
can give to the market 
that our strategy works.
Most of our assets  
have delivered above  
the original plan for  
the year.

6 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 7 A proven strategy and business  
model that continue to deliver  
growth and value
Group Chief Executive Officer’s review
Weak commodity prices 
persisted with debilitating 
outcomes for many. 
Polymetal, however, 
bucked the market  
trends and delivered  
a strong set of results.
If 2013 was a testing time for gold miners, 
then 2014 will be remembered as the  
year when commodity-price weakness 
persisted with material consequences 
within the global mining industry. Many 
companies were forced to make cuts in 
exploration and development spending as 
well as operating and capital expenditure.
For Polymetal, however, it was a different 
story. We continued to deliver on our 
promises and demonstrated resilience  
to both current market trends and 
geopolitical challenges.
Outstanding operating 
performance
For the third consecutive year, we  
beat our production guidance despite 
challenging market conditions. Our gold 
equivalent (GE) production was 1.43 Moz 
(2013: 1.28 Moz), up by 12%. This 
exceeded both our original production 
guidance of 1.3 Moz of GE by 10%  
and the updated guidance of 1.365 Moz  
(by 5%).
Annual gold production for the year 
increased by 17% to 945 Koz 
(2013: 805 Koz). Annual silver production 
rose by 5% to 28.7 Moz (2013: 27.2 Moz). 
Gold production now accounts for  
over two-thirds of our total revenue –  
69%, up from 63% in 2013.
The full ramp-up of our Mayskoye 
underground mine and strong operational 
delivery at the Dukat and Omolon hubs 
were the key drivers in helping us achieve 
these record figures for the business.  
At Mayskoye, the total gold produced 
during 2014 increased almost three-fold 
to 142.6 Koz (2013: 48.4 Koz), due  
to a full year of design throughput  
and recovery. We also commenced 
concentrate processing at the Amursk 
pressure oxidation (POX) plant while  
sales of concentrate to China more than 
doubled. Our state-of-the-art Amursk 
POX plant performed in line with 
expectations and we exceeded design 
recoveries for both Albazino and 
Mayskoye concentrates.
Growth by strategic acquisition
Our high-grade assets and the 
completion of a major construction cycle 
in advance of the drop in the price of gold 
put us in a unique position in the sector. 
We entered the year with a strong cost 
and operating profile and comfortable 
leverage. The turn of the commodities 
cycle created a window of opportunity  
for Polymetal and allowed us to invest  
in an exciting growth project, Kyzyl.
Located in a traditional mining region  
with good infrastructure in northeastern 
Kazakhstan, Kyzyl is ready for fast-track 
development. The project exactly matches 
our strategic target characteristics: a 
large, high-grade asset with a clear path 
to production and cash flow generation, 
which leverages Polymetal’s core 
strengths in selective mining and 
refractory ore processing.  
As a result of the acquisition, our gold 
equivalent reserves increased by about 
50%. The project has a mine life of at 
least 20 years with substantial exploration 
potential, allowing us to deliver significant, 
long-term shareholder value. This 
acquisition also leverages our business 
presence in Kazakhstan, where we have 
been operating successfully since 2009.
With all our production assets operating 
stably, our main focus has shifted  
to delivering growth post-2017. We  
are concentrating on Kyzyl and other 
development projects: Svetloye, where 
construction will begin later this year with 
a view to production starting in Q3 2017 , 
and our greenfield PGM (platinum group 
metals) exploration projects.
Capital discipline delivers returns
On the back of a very successful 
production year, Polymetal was  
also able to deliver a solid financial 
performance, due in part to the current 
macroeconomic environment in Russia. 
The devaluation of the Rouble against  
the US Dollar and the two-fold drop  
in the price of oil were significant factors 
in bringing down operating costs across 
the business and the corresponding 
increase in free cash flow generation.
Our adjusted EBITDA increased by 15%  
to US$685 million, while pre-acquisition 
free cash flow more than doubled to 
US$306 million. The underlying return  
on equity (excluding non-cash foreign 
exchange losses and impairments) 
increased from 9% in 2013 to 21% in 2014. 
This has allowed us to offer a substantial 
58% dividend payout in the reporting year, 
while maintaining a comfortable leverage 
ratio of 1.82x Net debt/EBITDA.
Our commitment to capital discipline  
has been – and will remain – central  
to our ability to deliver such a dynamic 
financial performance. Even after a major 
investment like the Kyzyl acquisition,  
the Company is able to continue paying 
regular dividends and declare a special 
dividend, while still maintaining 
comfortable leverage levels.
Employee safety and  
well-being are paramount
We are saddened to report the loss of 
three colleagues during 2014 and also 
one workplace fatality at a contractor’s 
operation. The increased fatality rate  
is of great concern at both Board  
and executive management level.  
Our investigations show that the lapse  
in safety performance was in part due  
to the increased scope of underground 
mining in complex geotechnical 
conditions at these operations.
It is vital that we significantly reduce  
risks and improve health and safety 
performance during the year ahead, 
aiming for zero fatalities in 2015. We have 
already launched new risk assessment 
systems and the implementation of 
additional measures to ensure proper 
enforcement of existing safety standards 
and management procedures is under 
way. We are also actively reinforcing  
the need for individual responsibility  
for personal safety and risk awareness 
across our operating mines.
We continue to support the well-being  
of our employees and communities  
in the current complex macroeconomic 
environment in Russia. We are mindful of 
the need to take account of the increase 
in consumer prices and the inevitable 
impact this has on our workforce.  
We will be monitoring the situation  
and providing salary increases  
to match the rising inflation levels.
Looking to the future
At Kyzyl, initial exploration and testing  
is already providing more clarity and 
comfort regarding the chosen project 
development route. The pilot metallurgical 
testing confirmed the viability of ore 
flotation to concentrate and signals the 
potential to improve on the parameters 
achieved in previous testing. The 
decommissioning of old infrastructure, 
site clearing and various licencing 
applications – including environmental 
and social impact assessments –  
are all ongoing. We have successfully 
completed preliminary public 
consultations with the Bakyrchik 
community. The full feasibility study  
for Kyzyl is due to be published by the 
end of 2015 with the start of full-scale 
construction in 2016.
Our operating mines are set to deliver  
on our annual production guidance of 
1.35 Moz of gold equivalent for 2015;  
with current guidance for 2016 set at the 
same level. Our financial performance will 
inevitably be influenced by the Rouble 
devaluation and the drop in oil prices. 
This will support our cost performance 
and cash flow generation, despite being 
partially offset by rising inflation 
during 2015.
With that, I am confident in our outlook  
for Polymetal in 2015. We are committed 
to delivering value to our shareholders 
through meaningful dividend payments  
in the current market environment while 
preparing the Company for the next 
growth stage.

Strategic expansion and growth through...
...a selective acquisition strategy 
designed to increase our resource 
base for the long term
The successful Varvara deposit was Polymetal’s  
first investment in Kazakhstan
Significant new reserves
The acquisition provided an excellent 
opportunity for Polymetal to significantly grow 
its reserve base with a high-grade gold deposit 
in a well-known jurisdiction for the company.
Kyzyl is ready for fast-track development  
and increases Polymetal’s gold equivalent 
reserves by about 50%. The project features 
the large, high-grade Bakyrchik property, 
which contains 6.7 Moz of gold at 7.5 g/t 
(JORC) and, based on existing reserves,  
a mine life of at least 20 years. There is also  
a significant exploration upside.
Processing competence
A key element behind the Kyzyl acquisition 
strategy was the opportunity it presented for 
Polymetal to take advantage of its process 
technology expertise. Polymetal expects  
to capitalise on its strengths in pressure 
oxidation, which will enable the Company to 
access the double refractory ores at the site, 
and a strong track record of refractory gold 
trading with third-party offtakers.
Timeline
We expect to have the permits and revised 
feasibility study for Kyzyl completed by the 
fourth quarter of 2015. We will be looking to 
start active construction sometime in the 
spring of 2016. The goal is to then produce 
the first concentrate in the third quarter of 
2018 before we ramp up to full capacity  
in 2019.
To fund construction, we will look at securing 
a project financing deal or use existing bank 
arrangements with the equity component  
to be sourced from existing operational  
cash flows.
Growing Kazakh portfolio
Polymetal’s footprint in Kazakhstan, where  
it is one of the only foreign-based companies 
mining for gold, takes a major leap forward 
with the acquisition of the Kyzyl project.
We first entered the country in 2009 through 
the acquisition of the Varvara project, which 
has since been developed into an open-pit 
operation that features a modern, 4.2 Mtpa 
capacity processing plant and produced 
106 Koz of gold equivalent in 2014.
Our commitment to establishing an 
extensive pipeline of growth projects 
has continued with the acquisition  
of the Kyzyl gold project. Based in 
one of Polymetal’s core jurisdictions, 
Kazakhstan, Kyzyl is set to become 
a priority development project  
for our Company.
Strategic rationale for the deal
Large high-grade reserves
•	 Mineral reserves: 6.7 Moz of gold  
at 7.5 g/t (JORC)
•	 Expected production start in 2018
•	 Expected annual gold production  
of 325-375 Koz
Significant exploration upside
•	 Substantial exploration potential 
through resource-to-reserve 
conversion
•	 Resources (additional to the 
reserves) of 3.8 Moz of gold at 
6.9 g/t (JORC)
Conventional mining
•	 Initial development via open-pit 
mining (up to 10 years of production)
•	 Cut-and-fill with consolidated backfill 
followed by underground mining
Refractory competency
•	 Leverages Polymetal’s core 
competencies in pressure oxidation 
(POX) processing and refractory 
gold concentrate trading
•	 Concentrate will initially be sold  
to offtakers
Favourable location within 
familiar jurisdiction
•	 Well-understood and 
straightforward operating 
environment – a country in  
which we have successfully  
operated since 2009
•	 Excellent infrastructure

Strategic focus
The acquisition is consistent with the 
Company’s longstanding strategy to target 
high-quality, low-risk assets with large 
reserves and high grades.
Our Company will have the opportunity to 
leverage its competitive strengths in pressure 
oxidation and refractory gold concentrate 
trading once Kyzyl reaches production.
Kyzyl is located within a traditional mining 
region in northeastern Kazakhstan, 750 km 
east of the capital city Astana and 75 km west  
of Oskemen, a key mining and metallurgical 
industry centre. This location provides 
Polymetal with good access to established 
infrastructure, including power and rail.

Applying strong capital discipline
Focusing on high-grade assets
Investing in exploration
Leveraging our hub-based system
A clear and consistent 
basis for long-term growth
The consistent implementation of our strategy  
is at the heart of our successful track record.
Underpinned by a commitment 
to good corporate governance,  
our business model is the  
key to our success and,  
ultimately, enables us to  
deliver sustainable value  
to our stakeholders.
Maintaining exemplary 
governance
We are committed to upholding good 
governance throughout our operations 
and in our interactions towards and  
on behalf of all our stakeholders, 
including communities, employees  
and government bodies.
Applying strong capital 
discipline
Capital discipline is the key characteristic 
of our investment and funding policy, 
informing the decision-making process 
across every aspect of the business  
in order to deliver healthy dividend 
streams for our shareholders.
Driving operational excellence
We continue to focus on achieving 
improved operational excellence in mining 
and processing technologies, which  
in turn has enabled us to commence  
the development of the third generation  
of high-quality assets.
Investing in exploration
Investment in both greenfield and 
near-mine exploration provides us with  
a cost-effective increase in our reserve 
base and, along with successful 
acquisitions, is the key source of  
our long-term growth.
Leveraging our hub-based system
Our centralised hub-based system 
handles ores from different sources, 
achieving economies of scale by 
minimising processing and logistics 
costs, as well as capital spending per 
ounce. This facilitates production at 
otherwise uneconomical medium-  
and small-sized near-plant deposits.
Focusing on high-grade assets
Return on investment in the precious 
metals industry is reliant on grades and 
mining conditions. We achieve better 
returns and lower risks from our project 
portfolio by setting appropriate thresholds 
on head grades and largely focusing  
on open-pit mines.
Delivering sustainable value
Our business model brings together our 
multi-faceted capabilities for increasing 
our resource base and improving both 
production efficiency and grades in order 
to increase profitability and free cash flow 
to deliver value to our shareholders.
01
Ensure robust  
operating and financial 
performance at our 
operating mines 
Focus on full capacity utilisation and 
robust cost performance of our operating 
mines by driving continued operating 
improvement. Extend our life-of-mine  
by investing in near-mine exploration.
02
Develop third generation  
growth projects 
 
 
With the second generation growth 
assets (Omolon, Albazino, Amursk POX,  
and Mayskoye) completed and fully 
operational, we have now commenced 
the development of the third generation  
of high-quality assets. The highlight of the 
portfolio is the recently acquired Kyzyl 
project, which, along with the Svetloye 
project, will be the key source of 
production growth from 2018.
05
Maintain high standards 
of corporate governance 
and sustainable 
development 
Maintain high standards of corporate 
governance, strictly adhering to the 
principles of sustainable development  
in our interaction with all stakeholders in 
our operations, including communities, 
employees and government bodies.  
Our goal is also to safeguard the health 
and safety of our staff in line with industry 
best practice. We are compliant with  
the provisions of the UK Corporate 
Governance Code. The Group is also  
a participant in the UN Global Compact,  
a recognised international standard for 
sustainable development.
04
Remain opportunistic  
in the M&A arena 
combined with own 
exploration efforts 
Pursue further ‘bolt-on’ or other 
synergistic acquisition opportunities with 
a view to leveraging processing capacity, 
infrastructure and operational expertise  
at our existing processing facilities.
03
Maintain capital 
discipline to deliver 
superior free cash  
flow and substantial 
dividends
Deliver superior, strong free cash  
flow by focusing on return on capital in 
investment decisions and maintaining 
safe leverage levels. Deliver the value 
created to shareholders through stable 
and substantial dividend payments.

20 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 21 Stable and resilient operations 
in a volatile market
Market review
In 2015, the gold price is expected to 
continue to be negatively correlated with 
the strength of the US Dollar and the 
speed of recovery of the US and global 
economy, which may lead to an increase 
in interest rates by the Federal Reserve  
in the middle of 2015.
Silver closely followed the price dynamics 
of gold, although given the weaker 
investment demand, the gold/silver price 
ratio continued to increase: from 61/1  
at the beginning of the year to 75/1 at  
the end of 2014. The average silver price 
decreased by 19.8% from US$23.8/oz  
in 2013 to US$19.1/oz in 2014. The 
closing price was down 19.9%, from 
US$19.9/oz at the beginning of the  
year to US$16.6/oz at the year-end.
Demand
The annual total demand, according to  
the World Gold Council, was 3,924 tonnes, 
down 4% year-on-year after 2013’s record 
boost caused by lower prices.
Of that, jewellery demand of 2,153 tonnes, 
although down 10% year-on-year,  
was above the five-year average by a 
comfortable 5% margin. In the second 
half of the year, the Indian government 
relaxed measures designed to restrict 
gold imports, helping the physical 
demand. Jewellery is deemed to be the 
largest component of above-ground 
stocks of gold, accounting for almost half 
of the 177 .2 Kt of gold estimated to be 
held by private owners and central banks.
Central banks bought 477 tonnes of gold 
in 2014. Seeking continued diversification 
away from the US Dollar, these institutions 
continued to bolster their holdings of 
gold. Russia’s central bank was the 
largest purchaser, adding 173 tonnes  
to its already sizable stocks. Russian 
holdings are now estimated at over 
1,200 tonnes, which accounts for 12%  
of Russia’s overall reserves. Kazakhstan 
bought another 48 tonnes during 2014. 
Sales of gold by central banks 
were limited.
Net investment demand was 905 tonnes  
in 2014, up 2% compared to 2013.  
The increase was driven by a slowdown 
in outflows: ETF redemptions slowed 
considerably compared with 2013. 
Demand for bar and coins among smaller 
investors dropped by 40% after an 
abnormally strong demand in 2013.
Supply
2014 was another challenging year for 
gold producers. Many gold companies 
continued to cut costs and postpone  
their development projects to adjust to 
the lower gold price. This should help  
to re-establish market confidence in the 
sector in the longer term as the supply 
pipeline thins. In the short term, however, 
the global gold supply remained flat 
year-on-year. Mine supply rose for the 
sixth consecutive year to a new record  
of 3,114 tonnes, as mines that have been 
developed and become operational in 
recent years added to the supply stream 
and existing producers used high-grading 
to offset price declines. Meanwhile, scrap 
supply slipped by 11% to 1,122 tonnes. 
As a result, total supply at 4,278 tonnes 
was little changed. So, although 
production is expected to stay at this 
record level in 2015, the potential for 
existing operations to generate greater 
volumes of output is limited. The sector 
continues to lack interest in hedging, 
beyond project financing or the 
restructuring or rolling-over of 
existing positions.
Russia became the second largest  
gold producer in 2014 after China,  
having produced more than 270 tonnes. 
A further 2-3% increase in production is 
predicted by the Russian union of gold 
miners. Australia’s production remained 
largely flat, while annual mine production 
has decreased in the US, Peru and  
South Africa.

Price dynamics
Both gold and silver prices demonstrated 
significantly more stability throughout 
2014. Volatility was relatively low; the year 
closed with the price at US$$1,199/oz, 
little changed from the starting price for 
the year. The moderate weakening of the 
gold price was driven by the continued 
strength of US Dollar and equity markets, 
as well as an expected interest rate 
increase by the US Federal Reserve in 
2015. Throughout the majority of the year, 
gold traded in the range of US$1,200 – 
1,300/oz, with the lowest fixing at 
U$1,145/oz in November and highest  
at US$1,379/oz in March 2014. On an 
annual average basis, the gold price 
decreased by 10.3% from US$1,410/oz  
in 2013 to US$1,266/oz in 2014.
After last year’s dramatic 
reversal of a decade-long 
upcycle, the performance 
of the gold and silver  
price in 2014 was far  
less remarkable.

 Average for the period.
Polymetal continued to consistently beat expectations in 2014, 
despite the persisting weakness of commodity prices.
Our gold equivalent production in 2014 increased by 12% to 
1.43 Moz, exceeding its original production guidance of 1.3 Moz 
of gold equivalent by 10% and also the updated production 
guidance of 1.365 Moz by 5%. This achievement was mostly 
driven by the full ramp-up of Mayskoye and strong operational 
delivery at Dukat and Omolon.
Annual gold production for the year increased by 17% to 
945 Koz. Annual silver production increased by 5% to 28.7 Moz, 
led mostly by Dukat’s strong performance. The share of gold  
in revenue composition increased to 69%, compared with  
63% in 2013. Production of copper concentrate at Varvara was 
temporarily shut down due to the persisting weakness of the 
concentrate market, resulting in a significant decline in copper 
production year-on-year.
Production dynamics on a quarterly basis are shown in the 
graph below. With the full ramp-up of Mayskoye, the third  
and fourth quarters were the strongest during the year as 
concentrate was shipped out of the mine for sale or processing 
at the POX plant in the July – November navigation period.

The underlying production trend was emulated very closely by 
sales for the year. Increased sales of Mayskoye concentrate and 
further diversification of the offtaker base for concentrate from 
Dukat contributed to the reduction in working capital and 
improved financial performance.
Analysis of production results
Mining
Stripping volumes in 2014 decreased year-on-year to 77.5 Mt  
of rock moved (2013: 85 Mt). This encompassed the completion 
of the stripping campaigns at Varvara; the move to underground 
mining at Arylakh (Dukat hub) and Avlayakan (Khakanja hub); 
and the completion of open-pit mining at Sopka, with Dalneye 
nearing completion. Underground development increased by  
a further 9% to more than 56 km (2013: 55 km), with increased 
capacity to match processing volumes at Dukat and Mayskoye 
underground mines, while underground development continued 
at Avlayakan (Khakanja hub) and commenced at both 
Birkachan (Omolon hub) and Arylakh (Dukat hub).
Ore mined increased by 32% to 13.7 Mt (2013: 10.4 Mt), mainly 
as a result of the completion of a major stripping campaign  
at Varvara in 2013, increased volumes at Albazino to match 
processing capacity and accelerated completion of open-pit 
mining at Sopka (Omolon hub). Underground mining  
increased at Dukat and Mayskoye in line with the respective 
plant throughputs.
Processing
Ore processed increased by 5% year-on-year to 11.3 Mt 
(2013: 10.7 Mt). The main contributors were Dukat hub and 
Albazino with increased plant capacity, while Mayskoye 
achieved a full year of production at the design throughput.
In line with increased grades in ore mined, average gold 
equivalent grade in ore processed grew by a further 3%  
to 4.7 g/t. This was driven by increased contributions from 
Mayskoye and Albazino, combined with a stronger grade  
profile at Omolon and stable grades at other mature mines  
(with the exception of Khakanja and Varvara).
Production and sales
We exceeded our original guidance with a record production 
level of 1.43 Moz of gold equivalent. Key drivers behind this 
performance were Dukat, Omolon and Mayskoye. At Khakanja, 
where the mine is approaching the end of its mine life, 
production declined due to the decrease in average grade.  
At Varvara there was a 19% decrease in production, due mainly 
to the temporary shutdown of the flotation circuit on the back  
of the continued weakness in the copper concentrate market.
While most of the sales are comprised of refined metals, we 
continue to sell concentrates from Dukat (gold-silver), Varvara 
(gold-copper) and Mayskoye (refractory gold) to offtakers in 
Kazakhstan, Japan, South Korea and China. The offtake allows 
us to maximise the margins compared with in-house processing 
of these materials. In 2014, we continued to diversify our  
offtaker base in order to achieve an optimal combination of 
transportation costs and treatment charges/recoveries. Offtake 
concentrate trading was pioneered by Polymetal in the Russian 
gold sector and has now clearly become one of our core 
competencies. This will be leveraged further in the Kyzyl project.
Exploration
Our sustained investment in both greenfield and brownfield 
exploration, despite the current weak commodity price levels, is 
one of the key components of our business strategy. We believe 
strongly that our long-term growth is reliant on our continued 
efforts in this area.
Our exploration activities are focused on five regions of Russia –  
Khabarovsk, Magadan, Chukotka, Karelia, and Ekaterinburg –  
as well as on Kazakhstan. Polymetal currently has 62 licences 
for geological studies and gold, silver, copper and platinum 
group metals (PGM) mining, covering a total area of 8,624 km
2
, 
and one coal mining licence. Of these, our current exploration 
portfolio includes 42 licences covering 8,130 km
2
. In 2014, 
exploration capital expenditure amounted to US$72 million:  
269 km were drilled; 3 km of exploration underground 
development completed; and an additional 229 km
3
  
of trenching was carried out.
The breakdown of the activities by the stage of the asset is 
presented in the charts on the next page.
Our key exploration objectives in 2014 included:
•	 ongoing brownfield exploration activities aimed at extending 
mine lives at our existing operations: Khakanja (currently the 
shortest mine life), Dukat, Omolon, Varvara and Voro;
•	 completion of exploration at our greenfield gold assets, 
including Svetloye, Kutyn, Maminskoye and – most  
recently – Bakyrchik (Kyzyl project), and getting them ready  
for development;
•	 continuation of exploration for PGM deposits in the Karelia 
and Ekaterinburg regions in order to establish new hard-rock  
PGM resources sufficient for a standalone mining operation;
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Appendices
24 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 25 Operating review
Continuing to focus on operating 
capacity and investment in exploration
•	 continued exploration activities at Albazino (including 
underground drift, geotechnical studies and in-fill drilling) that 
were aimed at converting the newly discovered resources  
to reserves that would extend the mine life of Albazino; and
•	 further greenfield exploration for new precious metals 
deposits with a potential resource base which would be 
sufficient in grade and size to justify the construction  
of a standalone mine.

 Restated data.
In 2014, our drilling volumes increased by a further 22% 
year-on-year to 268.8 km. The total capital expenditure on 
exploration increased to US$72 million in line with the increased 
volumes, including capital-intensive underground exploration at 
Albazino and drilling at the newly acquired Kyzyl project.
As a result, significant resource to reserve conversions were 
achieved during the year, along with maiden reserve and 
resource estimates completed for several greenfield projects. 
These included:
•	 initial reserve estimate at Svetloye (Khakanja hub) of 677 Koz 
with an additional 80 Koz of resources, which was followed  
by Board approval of the project development decision;

In 2014, we considerably expanded our reserves to 21.6 Moz  
of gold equivalent. This was a result of the Kyzyl acquisition 
(+6.7 Moz), coupled with a significant resource-to-reserve 
conversion and initial reserve estimate completed at several  
of our operating mines and advanced exploration projects 
(including Albazino underground, Svetloye, Kutyn and Veduga). 
Mineral resources (additional to ore reserves) declined by  
12%, mainly as a result of the resource-to-reserve conversion, 
particularly at Albazino, Svetloye and Olcha (Dukat hub). 
Additionally, with the acquisition of Kyzyl, we increased 
resources by 3.8 Moz.
The moderate gold and silver prices, of US$1,200/oz and 
US$17/oz respectively, used in both reserve and resource 
estimates in 2014 (2013: US$1,300/oz and US$22.5/oz) did not 
have a material impact on the final size of either but we felt that 
our more conservative approach was warranted.
Mainly as a result of the Kyzyl acquisition, our average ore 
reserve grade increased by 16% to 4.3 g/t GE and is one of  
the highest in the sector (see chart on page 13). The average 
mineral resource grade also increased by 11% to 4.2 g/t, also 
mainly due to the addition of Kyzyl mineral resources at 6.9 g/t.
•	 initial reserve estimate at Kutyn (completed in 2015) –  
386 Koz with an additional 649 Koz in resources;
•	 initial resource estimate at Tarutin (685 Koz of gold equivalent, 
of which Polymetal now owns 50%), which is now well 
positioned to complement the Varvara resource pool;
•	 initial resource estimate at North Kaluga (171 Koz of gold 
equivalent), previously part of Ural-Polymetal joint venture  
and now a 100% subsidiary of the Group;
•	 conversion of underground resources into reserves at 
Albazino (+1.4 Moz) and Olcha (Dukat hub) (+120 Koz).
In 2015, Polymetal will continue to expand its exploration 
portfolio into new potential areas. The Company filed  
19 applications for licences in 2015 including six gold areas  
in the Urals, nine gold and silver areas – four in the Magadan 
Region and five in Khabarovsk Region, and four PGM areas – 
one in the Urals and three in Karelia.
Our efforts during the year to come will be focused on:
•	 step-out drilling at Kyzyl, including the drilling to establish 
resources for the Bolshevik deposit and Bakyrchik 
exploration area;
•	 continuing brownfield exploration near the Omolon and 
Khakanja operations;
•	 step-out drilling at the flanks of known-ore bodies at Albazino;
•	 in-fill drilling at Svetloye ahead of the expected 
commencement of mining in Q4 2015;
•	 completing the PGM resource assessment at the Semcha 
area and prospecting for new objects with PGM mineralisation 
in the region.
Outlook for 2015
We are confident about the outcomes for 2015. With all of our 
operating mines now running at full capacity, the Company  
is on track to produce 1.35 Moz in 2015 and in 2016. There will 
be a slight decrease in production, mainly due to a reduction  
at Omolon after record levels in 2014 and the ongoing grade 
decline at Khakanja as it approaches the end of its mine life.
Operational plans
Our current year’s operational objectives for existing 
mines include:
•	 commencing mining at Oroch (Omolon hub);
•	 further increasing volumes of underground mining with  
the start of underground mining at Birkachan and further 
expansion at Arylakh (Dukat hub), Avlayakan (Khakanja)  
and Mayskoye; and
•	 materially improving health and safety performance, including 
at underground mines, and enhancing risk management 
activities with particular attention given to underground mining 
and blasting works.
Project development
The key focus of management will increasingly shift towards  
our new projects – Kyzyl being the largest. Our efforts in 2015 
will centre around completion of the full feasibility study for the 
project in Q4 2015 and the start of full-scale construction in  
Q2 2016. We will proceed with the construction of the Svetloye 
mine, approved in 2014, with mining expected to start in  
Q4 2015. We will also continue geological and metallurgical 
studies at Viksha (Semcha) – our PGM project in Karelia.

Mining
At Dukat, ore mined grew by 17% compared to 2013 to 1.47 Mt, 
of which 0.9 Mt was hauled by the newly commissioned railroad 
haulage system. Underground development grew by 2% to  
31.2 km. Small-scale equipment was integrated in the current 
production process. We are now prepared to mine narrow ore 
bodies in Smeliy and Vostochniy. At Goltsovoye, a total of  
191 Kt at a stable grade of 624 g/t silver was mined in 2014. 
At Arylakh, underground development continued following  
the completion of open-pit mining in Q2. The ore is still 
predominantly sourced from Lunnoye underground mine  
with a variable grade profile driven by stope sequencing, with 
average silver grade increasing by 22% to 421 g/t in 2014.  
At Lunnoye mine, stoping in ore zone 7 started. To ensure  
better grade control and to reduce dilution, we launched pilot 
cut-and-fill mining in horizontal layers in ore zone 7.
Processing and production
In 2014, Omsukchan concentrator shifted from three-stage to 
two-stage milling. As a result of this and due to a reduction in 
time for re-lining and scheduled maintenance, ore processed 
grew by 9% up to 1.7 Mt. There was a modest reduction  
in average grades (by 9% for gold to 0.66 g/t and by 5% to 
405.6 g/t for silver). Silver recoveries were sustainably high at 
86.5% due to an ore quality control system based on geological 
and process mapping. As a result, gold and silver production 
grew by 4% and 7%, respectively, to 31.5 Koz of gold and 
19.5 Moz of silver.
At Lunnoye, ore processed grew by 18% year-on-year to  
400 Kt after the new SAG mill was commissioned, with average 
grades increasing by 21% for gold and 5% for silver, and  
with continued improvement in silver recoveries to 91.8%.  
Gold production was 13.9 Koz, up 36% year-on-year,  
and silver production was 4.4 Moz, up 16%.
The hub’s total silver production was a record 23.9 Moz,  
up 8% year-on-year. Gold production grew to 45.3 Koz,  
up 12% year-on-year.
Resources and exploration
In 2014, we completed the conversion of resources into reserves 
at Olcha, adding 119 Koz of gold and 222 Koz of silver into the 
hub’s base. Further resource-to-reserve conversion continued 
at the deeper levels of Dukat, Lunnoye and Goltsovoye. We have 
carried on our exploration efforts at the flanks of Dukat. As a 
result of drilling 28 km at the flanks, known ore bodies were 
traced in more detail and new ‘blind’ veins were discovered. 
Priorities for 2015
Matching increased processing capacity, we plan to increase 
underground mining throughput up to 1,400 Ktpa at Dukat 
underground mine. At Goltsovoye, we will commence 
underground development of ore body 2 to prepare for stoping. 
Active stoping will commence at Arylakh underground mine.  
To improve safety performance and monitoring, we will use 
centralised transportation to underground mines and install 
position control systems for workers and mining equipment. 
Strong gold and silver recoveries are expected to be maintained 
at Omsukchan concentrator due to automated control over 
cleaner flotation machines. Exploration drilling at both Dukat 
flanks and Olcha is due to continue in 2015 to replenish the 
hub’s resource base.
Omolon delivered strong operating and financial performance  
in 2014, with gold equivalent production increasing by 43% to 
226 Koz and cash costs decreasing by 35% to US$570/GE oz. 
This was driven by a higher grade profile, as well as an 8% 
increase in Kubaka mill throughput.
Mining
Total ore mined increased by 20% in 2014 and amounted  
to 2,065 Kt.
At Sopka, ore mined grew by 37% to 922 Kt and open-pit 
mining was completed in Q4 2014 with ore processing due to 
be completed in Q3 2015. In Q1 2015, we plan to relocate the 
released mining fleet to Oroch by winter road. At Dalneye, ore 
mining will be completed in 2015. At Birkachan, open-pit mining 
was completed in June, and the underground development 
started in Q3. At Tsokol, which was the major source for CIP 
circuit in 2014, ore mined grew by 42% to 317 Kt.
Processing
The Kubaka plant achieved a further increase in throughput  
in 2014, with ore processed increasing by 8% to 825 Kt. 
Supported by a high share of ore processed from Sopka and 
Dalneye during the year, average grades processed increased 
by 31% for gold to 6.7 g/t and by 13% for silver to 133 g/t.  
As a result, gold production at Kubaka increased by 48%  
to 170 Koz and silver production was up 14% to 2.9 Moz;  
the peak level achieved by Omolon hub. 
At Birkachan heap leach, irrigation of the existing leach pads 
continued and 6 Koz of gold were recovered from the solution 
during 2014. There will be no additional ore stacking in 2015  
as multi-year recoveries will continue to be monitored.
Reserves, resources and exploration
At Omolon, we continue to work on a number of brownfield 
targets close to the Kubaka plant in order to extend the life of 
mine. In 2014, we have completed an initial reserve estimate  
for Burgali, adding 72 Koz to reserves, and continued drilling  
at the Adygaya and Pyatinakh areas. In 2015, we will continue 
drilling at other areas, such as Yolochka.
 
Priorities for 2015
In 2015, Omolon operations will increasingly switch to 
underground mining. Open-pit mining at Tsokol will near 
completion in Q2 2015, with underground development planned 
to commence in Q3 2015. The potential for underground mining 
will be evaluated after the completion of a detailed in-fill drilling 
campaign. Ore stoping at Birkachan is scheduled to start  
in Q4 2015. Open-pit mining at Oroch will start in Q2 2015,  
with ore to be trucked by winter road starting from Q4 2015  
for processing in 2016. 
Processing volumes in 2015 will be split between Sopka, 
Birkachan, Dalneye and Tsokol with major volumes to be 
processed from Sopka and Birkachan.

The flagship Amursk POX plant delivered a full year of 
performance at design throughput and recoveries. This now 
includes concentrate from Mayskoye, along with that from 
Albazino, in the combined processing. Our unique experience  
of using POX technology in the Former Soviet Union was one  
of the key factors in determining our competitive advantage and 
enabling us to acquire the Kyzyl project with its refractory ore.
2014 highlights
In 2014, the Amursk POX plant worked steadily at the design 
parameters. Throughput increased by 27.6% year-on-year to 
163 Kt of concentrate processed, including the initial 10 Kt of 
concentrate from Mayskoye. Recoveries from the Albazino 
concentrate were 94%, up 9% year-on-year, and fully in line with 
design levels. Design levels were exceeded in the last quarter  
of the year, with 94.5% recovery achieved. Average recoveries 
from Mayskoye concentrate were 92% (including pilot 
processing in Q1), increasing to 94% in Q4.
As a result, total gold production was 240 Koz (including  
12 Koz from Mayskoye concentrate), up 51% year-on-year.
Priorities for 2015
In 2015, continuous flowsheet improvement is set to continue. 
Several targeted improvements will further develop the water 
circulation system of the POX plant. The reverse osmosis 
section capacity will be increased to process recycled liquor. 
The concentrate discharge section will be upgraded; liquid 
oxygen storage and a gasification section will be constructed.
In 2015, as previously, all concentrate from Albazino will be 
processed at the POX. The volume of Mayskoye concentrate 
processed through the POX will increase, as sufficient stockpiles 
have now been built. We are targeting stable gold recoveries  
at 94% for both concentrates.
Albazino had a full year performing at design parameters.  
It also demonstrated substantial cost improvement in 2014, with 
cash cost reducing by 21% to US$625/oz, below the Group’s 
average, despite a moderate scheduled decrease in grade.
Mining
Albazino open-pit mine expanded in 2014 to match the 
upgraded capacity of the processing plant. Ore mined 
increased by 17% to 1.57 Mt of ore, which partially 
compensated for a reduction in average grade mined down 
12% to 4.9 g/t, closer to average reserve grade. Open-pit 
mining commenced in the new Olga ore zone.
Underground development continued, mainly to facilitate 
additional exploration in-fill drilling and geotechnical studies.  
One block was prepared for pilot mining in order to choose  
the optimal development system. 
During the year, a mining fleet dispatch management system 
was implemented at Albazino. This increased capacity by five 
extra vehicles per day, with data created for further optimisation 
analysis. Additional benefits will be realised in the longer term.
Processing
Ore processed grew by 6% year-on-year to 1,609 Kt, 
successfully achieving the new nameplate capacity of 1.6 Mtpa. 
Average grades processed declined to 4.8 g/t in line with the 
mine grade profile. Gold recoveries remained stable at 88%, 
while concentrate yield reduced from 9% to 8.4%. 136 Kt of 
concentrate with 218.5 Koz of gold contained were produced, 
with an 8% decrease mainly driven by this planned grade 
decline. As the POX plant continued to reduce excess stockpiles 
in the beginning of the year, 153 Kt of Albazino concentrate were 
processed, with total gold produced at 227 Koz.
The reliability of Albazino power supply was enhanced by 
adding 10 diesel gensets.
Exploration and development
Active in-fill drilling at the new ore zones continued in 2014, with 
more than 65 km of core drilling performed. However, following 
the acquisition of the Kyzyl project in the middle of the year,  
it was decided to postpone putting the new resources into 
production by expanding the plant. Instead, the new resources 
were converted into reserves after the in-fill drilling campaign.  
This resulted in the addition of 1.4 Moz and more than  
doubled the mine life. 
Priorities for 2015
We will continue exploration of the known ore zones and 
prospecting drilling in the flanks of ore bodies. We will also 
continue our search for new ore zones within a range  
of 50 km from the Albazino mine.
Following the conversion of underground resources into 
reserves, in 2015 we are planning to complete pilot mining, 
aimed at choosing an optimal development system, and to start 
stoping. In the Olga zone, we will continue stripping and further 
development of the new pit.

Gold production at Khakanja in 2014 decreased slightly by 5% 
year-on-year to 97.9 Koz, while silver production was 1.7 Moz, 
down 29% year-on-year. These decreases were driven by 
planned average grade declines as the Khakanja mine is nearing 
depletion and the mill feed is complemented by material from 
lower-grade stockpiles.
In 2014 we completed all preparatory works at Svetloye ahead 
of construction in 2015. A sea-side access point and all-season 
road from the shore to the site have been fully established. 
Mining
At Khakanja open-pit mine, works concentrated on pit 1, with 
increased stripping and 271 Kt of ore mined in 2014. Average 
gold grades in ore mined increased more than two-fold to 
3.0 g/t while silver grade remained stable at 142 g/t. At Ozerny, 
which became the major source of ore for processing in 2014, 
764 Kt of ore were mined with gold grade increasing by 12% to 
4.0 g/t. At both Khakanja and Ozerny, open-pit mining will be 
completed in 2015 in Q1 and Q2 respectively with the mining 
fleet to be re-directed to Svetloye. 
At Avlayakan, where mining works completely switched to 
underground in 2014, we achieved design capacity, with 3.8 km 
of underground development completed during the year and  
42 Kt of ore mined. The shift to underground resulted in a 55% 
increase in the average gold grade to 13.8 g/t and a roughly 
stable silver grade of 105 g/t.
Processing
In 2014, ore processed was 622 Kt, unchanged from 2013. 
Average gold and silver grades were 5.3 g/t and 117 g/t, 
respectively. The silver grade decline is attributable to the 
increased processing of ore from Ozerny that largely substituted 
that from Khakanja.
Exploration and development
A highlight of 2014 was the completion of the feasibility study  
for the Svetloye 1.0 Mtpa open-pit heap leach operation, 
followed by the Board’s approval for the start of construction. 
Ore reserves are estimated at 7.3 Mt at an average gold grade 
of 2.8 g/t, containing 0.7 Moz of gold. This capital-light project 
(with a Capex of approximately US$80 million and an initial mine 
life of eight years) generates an impressive 44% IRR at a gold 
price of US$1,250/oz and will significantly extend the overall 
mine life of the Khakanja hub. Svetloye is expected to add 
70 Koz of gold in annual production at an average all-in 
sustaining cost of US$750-800/oz starting from Q3 2017.
In our exploration efforts, we are focusing on extending 
Khakanja’s mine life through brownfield exploration. At Ozerny, 
prospecting drilling in the flanks (8 km) was performed, with  
new ore body discovered in the northern flank. We are also 
continuing prospecting works, including trenches and drilling,  
in the Golubichny and Dikiy areas where several ore bodies 
were identified. Three additional new licences were obtained  
in 2014 covering 257 km
2
.
Priorities for 2015
In 2015, some further decline in production is expected due  
to reduced grades in ore from Khakanja and Ozerny and  
the current reserve base nearing depletion by 2018. In the 
meantime, mining at Svetloye is expected to start in Q4 2015. 
Our brownfield exploration programme will continue in 2015, 
with the focus on the Mankanja, Vodorazdelny, and Serebryany 
areas, where initial high-grade intercepts were obtained in 2014.
In 2014, Mayskoye operated the first full year at design capacity 
and delivered a significant 143 Koz contribution to the Group’s 
total production. We have also achieved better offtake terms 
and were able to effectively split the concentrate produced  
at Mayskoye between POX processing and offtake to achieve 
optimal economic performance.
Mining
Mining at Mayskoye achieved the target level in 2014. With  
10.5 km of underground development during the year, 653 Kt  
of ore were mined at an average grade of 8.4 g/t. This was  
a 14% improvement compared with 2013, achieved due to 
better dilution and grade control.
Processing
In 2014, ore processed grew by 66% year-on-year to 807 Kt 
with an average gold grade of 8.7 g/t (+22%), reflecting the 
increased volumes and quality of the ore mined. Average 
recoveries were 84% and increased by 8% compared with 
2013. In the second half of the year, following a number of 
operational improvements and increase in grades, recoveries 
exceeded 86%. 92.7 Kt of flotation concentrate containing 
188 Koz of gold were produced. Of this, 72 Kt of concentrate 
were sold to China and another 10 Kt processed at the  
Amursk POX plant, with the remaining material stockpiled 
on-site after the close of the navigation period.
Sales and downstream processing
In 2014, we were able to expand the number of our offtake 
partners in China and achieve an improvement in the offtake 
terms as our partners gained experience with the material 
supplied. 130 Koz of payable gold was sold to offtakers  
in 2014 while another 13 Koz came from the processing  
at the Amursk POX.
At the POX plant, following the initial pilot processing in Q1 2014, 
full scale blending of Mayskoye concentrate commenced in the 
second half of the year, once sufficient amounts of concentrate 
were shipped to Amursk from the mine. 10 Kt of concentrate 
were processed with recoveries reaching 94% by the year-end 
and thus exceeding the design level.
Priorities for 2015
We will continue to work on further improvement of grade 
control and dilution through the optimisation of underground  
mining methods. We are also aiming to develop geomechanical 
modelling in order to improve engineering solutions for 
preparation and cutting works. An underground communication 
system will be installed in order to improve dispatch control  
at the mine. 
A further increase in the concentrator throughput to reach 
nameplate capacity of 850 Ktpa is planned, while maintaining 
the design recovery levels in excess of 86%. 
In 2015, the share of Amursk POX in total production should 
increase with sufficient stockpiles available before the start  
of the navigation period in July. Nevertheless, we will continue  
to split the concentrate between own processing and offtake  
in China, based on the metallurgical properties and resulting 
economics of each route.

In 2014, Varvara faced additional market challenges due to  
the decline in the copper price and resulting weakness of the 
copper concentrate market. Unlike our Russian assets, which 
benefited significantly from the massive Rouble devaluation, the 
effects of Tenge devaluation were lower and did not fully offset 
this price decline. Nevertheless, Varvara demonstrated stable 
cost performance (TCC decreasing by 11% to US$705/GE oz) 
and margins in 2014 despite the production decline.
Mining
Waste mined decreased by 2% year-on-year while ore mined 
grew by 98% to 3,985 Kt after the major stripping campaign 
was completed. Stripping started in the potential North-East  
pit and mining started in the South pit. During the year, mining 
works were re-directed in order to increase the volume of gold 
ore, after the temporary suspension of the flotation circuit. 
Stricter grade control procedures were implemented, with  
gold grades remaining stable throughout the year.
Processing
Ore processed at the leaching circuit amounted to 3,117 Kt 
(+17% year-on-year) with average gold grades of 1.14 g/t  
(-10% year-on-year), with lower grades attributable to the lower 
amount of third-party ore available for purchase during the year. 
The flotation circuit throughput was limited to 547 Kt as the 
section was temporarily shut down in July. This was to prevent 
the accumulation of excess concentrate stockpiles in a weaker 
copper concentrate market. The sales of concentrate stockpiled 
resumed at the end of 2014/early 2015. The reduction in grades 
at both circuits resulted in lower gold recoveries (-5% at the 
leaching circuit and -9% at the flotation circuit). As several 
metallurgical initiatives were implemented, gold recoveries  
at the leaching circuit increased to 81% in Q4 with further 
improvements expected in 2015.
Total gold and copper production in 2014 declined by 8% and 
66% to 98 Koz and 1,631 t, respectively, mainly as a result of 
the copper circuit suspension. 
Exploration
As with other mature mines, we are actively engaged in 
brownfield exploration and the search for potential third-party 
ores for Varvara, in order to complement the existing resource 
base and leverage existing capacity. In 2014, these objectives 
were largely met by drilling and the subsequent initial resource 
estimate at Tarutin, a gold-copper deposit located in close 
proximity to Varvara across the Russia-Kazakhstan border.  
The newly established 645 Koz of GE mineral resources,  
of which Polymetal currently owns 50%, have the potential  
to extend Varvara’s life of mine.
Priorities for 2015
In 2015, both mining and processing will focus on the gold  
ore, with full throughput expected at the leaching circuit and a 
moderate reduction in grade. As a result of further deterioration 
in the copper price in the beginning of 2015, re-start of the 
copper circuit is likely to be delayed till 2016. The existing 
copper concentrate stockpile is expected to be completely  
sold in 2015. In-fill and step-out drilling will continue at Tarutin.
Voro, despite being one of the oldest assets in the portfolio, 
continues to be a key cash flow contributor. This is due to  
its prime location with access to infrastructure, continuous 
process improvements and resulting attractive cash cost  
profile (TCC of US$376/oz and AISC of US$515/oz in 2014,  
a decline of more than 25% compared with 2013).
Mining
Ore mined at Voro grew by 6% year-on-year to 1.9 Mt, with  
an increased shift towards primary ore. Mining was performed  
in two areas of the Gorevoy deposit on the South Voro pit. 
Average grades in primary ore declined modestly to 5.2 g/t 
while average grade in oxidised ore increased by 17% to 1.8 g/t. 
Processing
At Voro Heap Leach, the amount of ore stacked decreased  
to 747 Kt. However, production at the heap leach grew  
by 18% and amounted to 27.7 Koz. This was due to the 
implementation of the Carbon-in-Column (CIC) process instead 
of zinc precipitation in the Merrill-Crowe circuit, which was  
previously used for recovery from the heap leach solution.
Total gold production at Voro in 2014 increased slightly  
by 3% year-on-year to 157.5 Koz as higher recoveries at  
the CIP plant (up 3 p.p. to 82.5%) offset slightly lower grades. 
Exploration
Our near-mine exploration efforts are mostly focused on 
oxidised ore which is nearing depletion at the main Voro 
deposit. In 2014, we carried out exploration works in the 
Shilovskaya licence area and the Bortevsky area by core drilling. 
We have also completed drilling with an initial resource estimate 
of 171 Koz of gold equivalent at the North Kaluga deposit, which 
was acquired in the restructuring of our interest in the Ural-
Polymetal joint venture. 
Priorities for 2015
Our near-mine exploration will continue to focus on the potential 
sources of heap leachable mineralisation. This will include, in 
addition to existing projects, exploration drilling at Nyavlinsky 
and Krasnoturinsky licence areas.
Ore stacking at the heap leach plant will near completion in 
2015, with 400-450 Kt of ore to be stacked during the year. 
Processing at the CIP plant will continue at a steady pace, with 
a moderate reduction in grade. Nevertheless, Voro is expected 
to remain one of the key cash-generating units of Polymetal  
with low capital expenditure and operating cost levels.

New infrastructure
The decommissioning of the old infrastructure, site clearing and 
various permitting activities, including environmental and social 
impact assessment (ESIA) preparation, have all continued as 
planned. In the next phase, we will progress to more detailed 
studies and the selection of processing flow charts. This should 
all be finalised by Q2 2015.
We have developed a preliminary layout for the mining and 
processing facilities, and the supporting infrastructure, including 
power, heat and water supplies. We have already commissioned 
the design of the power grid, step-down transformer substation, 
water conduits and boiler house. Some existing facilities will  
need to be dismantled during 2015 and into Q1 2016 before  
we start stripping in the pit; others will be used as temporary 
storage and maintenance facilities during the construction period.
In Q4 2015, we will finalise the audit of the updated feasibility 
study with the inclusion of the estimate of the resources required 
for the open-pit mining option. We will also carry out a full ESIA, 
in line with international best practice.

In September 2014, Polymetal completed the acquisition  
of the Kyzyl project in Kazakhstan. The addition of this world-
class asset to our high-quality portfolio will provide us with  
a considerable expansion of our existing reserves and mine  
life, as well as a significant exploration upside.
The Kyzyl gold project consists of the Bakyrchik and Bolshevik 
gold deposits. Bakyrchik is one of the largest untapped  
gold deposits in the Former Soviet Union and globally.  
With gold reserves of 6.7 Moz at 7.5 g/t (JORC), this will  
double Polymetal’s gold equivalent reserves. Inferred resources 
of 2.9 Moz gold at 6.6 g/t at Bakyrchik are expected to provide  
a life of mine of 20 years and there is the potential for further 
exploration on adjacent properties, which is covered by 
Bakyrchik and Bolshevik licences.
Kyzyl is located in northeastern Kazakhstan, 75 km from the 
industrial centre of Oskemen (Ust-Kamenogorsk). This is a 
traditional mining region with an established infrastructure  
which gives us good access to power and rail.
Open-plan mining planned
The previous owners had only considered underground  
mining of primary ores, with full processing flowsheet to  
Doré production (including roasting and BIOX technologies). 
Polymetal believes that the challenging underground mining 
conditions make open-pit mining a more attractive option  
from the point of view of risk mitigation and capital expenditure 
reduction, despite the expected high stripping ratio. Open-pit 
mining is judged to be the better option for the first ten years  
(to mine 18 Mt of ore with 120 t of gold), followed by a switch  
to underground mining at a later stage.
Initially, we plan to build a flotation plant for ore processing, 
selling the concentrate to third-party offtakers. We will then 
review the options of either processing the concentrate in  
our POX hub in Amursk or, alternatively, building a new POX 
plant on-site. This sequencing will reduce risks, split capital 
expenditures and, ultimately, increase the return on invested 
capital. The initial capital expenditure for the flotation plant  
and open-pit mine is estimated at US$440-530 million.  
This will be revisited once the feasibility study has been 
completed in Q4 2015.
In 2014, Polymetal submitted documents for open-pit 
development to the regulatory authorities of the Republic  
of Kazakhstan for examination. The Company also carried  
out a preliminary assessment of the environmental impact and 
held a series of public consultations with the local Bakyrchik 
community with positive outcomes. The application for the 
statutory permits for open-pit mining should be completed  
with the regulatory authorities in Q2 2015.
Preparatory work underway
We have now started exploration and in-fill drilling in the main 
licence area and along the edges/borders of the deposit. 
Planned exploration is set to continue in 2015 (see table on  
the next page). In Q3-4 2014, we commenced the engineering 
surveys required to design mining and processing facilities,  
and also performed a technical and economic assessment  
of the mining equipment needed for open-pit mining.
From the bulk samples collected, pilot metallurgical testing  
of the Kyzyl ore has confirmed the viability of ore flotation  
to concentrate. This signals the potential to improve on  
the parameters achieved in the previous test work.

Sustained investment  
in standalone exploration
Exploration
Despite the current weak commodity 
price levels, our sustained investment  
in both greenfield and brownfield 
exploration is one of the core pillars of  
our strategy. We strongly believe that  
our long-term growth is underpinned  
by these efforts. In selecting licence  
areas for exploration, we focus on areas 
adjacent to our processing hubs or 
potential hubs (brownfield), and on assets 
with the potential to become sizeable 
standalone operations. The advancement 
of the exploration project is subject to 
rigorous review through pre-established 
project stages that are linked to our 
estimate of the resource potential and  
its economic prospects. At any stage,  
a project may be terminated, suspended  
or moved to the next exploration stage. 
In 2014, we completed internal  
restructuring of the exploration  
function at Polymetal that allowed us  
to decentralise, reduce red tape and  
to increase the responsibility of local 
geology project managers for the 
outcome of the project. This will also 
speed up the project evaluation process 
and consequent turnover of projects and 
licences that we hold.
Our key greenfield exploration targets  
for 2014 were:
•	 continued exploration at key greenfield 
gold assets (Svetloye, Kutyn, 
Maminskoye and Kyzyl), preparing 
them for development stage;
•	 exploration for platinum group  
metals (PGM) deposits in the Karelia  
and Ekaterinburg regions in order  
to establish new hard-rock PGM 
resources sufficient for a standalone 
mining operation.
 
Key greenfield projects
As a result of exploration activities during 
the year, significant resource-to-reserve 
conversions were achieved. Maiden ore 
reserves and mineral resources estimates 
were completed for several greenfield 
and brownfield projects. 
Karelia PGM project
One of our newest greenfield exploration 
projects, Viksha (Semcha), is now very 
well positioned to establish a large PGM 
resource in Karelia, an accessible region 
with developed infrastructure. We have 
been exploring the precious metals 
mineralisation (gold, platinum and 
palladium) of the Koykar ore field. 
Our activities in 2014 were focused on 
drilling to a depth of 100 m at the large 
PGM ore body identified along the known 
surface outcrop. Core drilling (18.7 km) 
was carried out at the Viksha, Kenti 
and Shagri areas. In these areas, PGM 
mineralisation within the ferrous titanium 
horizon was revealed with a steady width 
at shallow depths. Platinum, gold and 
palladium mineralisation was identified 
with an average palladium equivalent 
grade of 1.8-2.6 g/t. Mineralised potential 
in the most explored part of the field 
(Viksha) is estimated at 57 tonnes of 
palladium equivalent. The total mineralised 
potential of the Koykar sill is estimated at 
350-400 tonnes of palladium equivalent, 
including 190 tonnes at an open-pittable 
depth of 150 m. Viksha’s statutory 
feasibility study and the statutory GKZ 
reserves were approved by the Russian 
state authorities in 2014; in 2015 we will 
be converting the exploration licence  
to exploration and mining. 
Svetloye
In 2014, we completed an initial  
ore reserves estimate at Svetloye  
of 677 GE Koz with an additional  
80 GE Koz of mineral resources. Project 
development has been approved by the 
Polymetal Board and Svetloye will now 
become part of Khakanja hub. In 2014, 
our drilling campaign focused on the 
Elena and Emi zones, as well as prospect 
drilling in the Ludmila zone and Emi 
flanks. In 2015, along with the start of 
construction, we will prepare for mining  
at Svetloye with the in-fill detailed drilling.  
To further increase the resource potential, 
we will start prospecting at the new 
licence area, Pravosekchenskaya.
Kutyn
At Kutyn, we targeted the assessment  
of oxidized open-pittable resources and 
the increase of the resource potential of 
the deposit by discovering new ore 
bodies. The works were focused on 
mineralisation located near the surface 
and suitable for heap leaching, including 
extensions of known ore bodies. Detailed 
drilling and mapping of ore bodies  
in Sedlovinnaya, Rodnikovaya and 
Geophyzicheskaya enabled us to perform 
geotechnical mapping of ores amenable 
to cyanidation. Trenching was performed 
in the Itylskaya, Delinskaya, Dzhuaty-1 
and Dzhuaty-2 ore zones. Known and 
new ore bodies have been traced along 
the strike. 
The initial ore reserves estimate  
and the pre-feasibility study at Kutyn 
(completed in 2015) confirmed 386 Koz, 
with additional mineral resources of 
649 Koz. The pre-feasibility study entails 
an all-year-round 700 Ktpa open-pit 
heap-leach operation with an initial  
mine life of five years. Annual average 
production is estimated to be 50 Koz  
of gold with average all-in sustaining  
costs of US$750/oz. Primary (non-oxide) 
mineralisation is not included in the 
current study and therefore not included 
in the ore reserve. Pre-production capital 
expenditure is estimated at US$52 million. 
However, with the current focus on the 
development of the Kyzyl project, we will 
consider sale or partnership to advance 
the development of the asset.
Maminskoye
In-fill drilling continued at Maminskoye  
in the first half of 2014. Following the 
acquisition of the Kyzyl project, we 
decided to re-prioritise the project 
pipeline and, accordingly, slow down  
the development of Maminskoye, 
suspending further exploration activities.

38 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 39 Focused on building  
a sustainable future
Sustainability
Our core objective is to  
create sustainable returns for 
shareholders while fulfilling our 
corporate responsibilities to 
society and the environment.
In this way, we balance our 
business interests with the 
interests of our people, suppliers, 
investors, local communities  
and other stakeholders. And  
it is this balance which ensures 
the long-term success and 
sustainability of our operations.
Stakeholder engagement and material issues
In our approach to sustainability, we want to address the issues 
that matter most to our business and to our stakeholders. To 
this end, we follow the principles of materiality and stakeholder 
inclusiveness that are set out within the GRI G4 prioritisation 
guidelines. We carry out regular stakeholder mapping exercises 
to determine the various stakeholder groups on which Polymetal 
has the biggest impact. Once identified, we then engage with 
these stakeholders and collate all ensuing dialogue; this enables 
us to understand the issues most material to each group, and to 
incorporate their opinions and priorities into our decision making 
and policy development. 
Through our stakeholder engagement and materiality mapping 
activities, we have identified our core sustainability focus areas 
which are shown above.
See our materiality matrix in the Sustainability Report 2013/2014 
for more information.
Sustainability risk management
Our approach to sustainability is also underpinned by rigorous 
risk management policies and procedures. Informed by our 
interaction with stakeholders, we work to identify, manage and 
mitigate the sustainability risks we face. This process is overseen 
by the Audit and Risk Committee of the Board, reflecting the 
importance we place on sustainability within the Company.
Environmental performance
Polymetal, as a typical mining business, operates complex 
processes on a large scale in remote locations. These 
processes produce a range of waste materials and use  
toxic substances, such as cyanide. Like any other mining 
company, we also produce significant quantities of emissions 
and carry out processes that can have potentially negative 
environmental impacts.
To control these impacts we have developed a robust 
environmental management system (EMS) that complies  
with increasingly sophisticated national and international 
standards and regulations. This system is overseen by 
dedicated environmental teams, and focuses on resource  
and energy efficiency, pollution prevention, use of modern 
equipment and technologies, and employee engagement.
At the heart of the management system is our environmental 
policy, which can be viewed at www.polymetalinternational.com. 
It emphasises the use of best practice, continuous improvement, 
risk reduction, compliance and management of specific 
environmental issues. It also focuses strongly on incident  
and emergency control, the use of environmentally friendly 
materials and resource efficiency.
Our approach
2014 represents a milestone on our sustainability journey.  
This year, we are adopting the most recent version of the  
Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) sustainability reporting 
guidelines. Within this G4 framework, the main focus is 
‘materiality’ – in other words, those issues that matter most  
to our business and our stakeholders. Compliance with G4 
does not become mandatory until the end of 2015, so we are  
making this transition ahead of schedule. This is a sign of our 
commitment to continuous improvement and best practice,  
and demonstrates our willingness to engage with clear and 
accountable reporting practices. In support of this, in 2015,  
we have recruited a Chief Sustainability Officer, whose role  
will involve co-ordinating our diverse sustainability initiatives 
and activities.
Polymetal’s overall approach to sustainability is guided  
by the UN Global Compact, to which the Company has been  
a signatory since 2009. Our strategy is designed to meet the 
requirements of this voluntary international standard and ensure 
compliance with its ten principles in the areas of human rights, 
labour, environment and anti-corruption. We are also an active 
member of the UK Global Compact Network Russia.
The UN Global Compact and our corporate values –  
dialogue, compliance, ethical conduct, fairness, stewardship 
and effectiveness – shape the focus of our more detailed 
sustainability policies and associated management systems. 
These polices are defined at Group level and implemented 
through our Head Office in St. Petersburg and subsidiary 
companies. Through ongoing monitoring and auditing,  
we ensure that our performance is measured against  
all relevant regulatory and internal requirements.
Each of our subsidiary companies has its own environmental 
team. These teams contribute to the running and monitoring  
of the EMS and provide quarterly performance reports to  
the Group. Meanwhile our in-house engineering operation, 
Polymetal Engineering, employs more than 100 specialists  
to ensure that up-to-date practices and modern technologies 
are used in the design and construction of mines and 
processing facilities. 
Across the Group, we incorporate regular auditing and monitoring 
activities into the environmental management system. We also 
comply with the requirements of relevant Russian and Kazakh 
legislation and ISO 14001. External audits are regularly 
undertaken by state supervisory authorities such as the Russian 
Federal Service for Supervision of Natural Resource Usage, while 
audits conducted by service providers (such as Bureau Veritas) 
help us to improve our internal environmental management and 
performance. During the reporting period, we received no 
significant fines or non-monetary sanctions for non-compliance 
with environmental laws and regulations.
Environmental compliance
We comply with stringent environmental impact assessment 
procedures which include public hearings and adequate 
mechanisms to enable stakeholders to share their grievances. 
Our ongoing stakeholder engagement activities also provide 
forums for stakeholders to voice concerns. In 2014, there were 
no new major grievances filed about our environmental impacts.
All of our suppliers comply with applicable laws and regulations. 
In our formal contractual agreements, we insist that our 
suppliers meet their compliance requirements. 
Investment in environmental protection
Our overall investment in environmental protection during the 
reporting period was US$13.5 million, a slight increase from 
US$13.4 million in 2011/12. Of this total 51% went into the 
protection of water resources, 32% into land reclamation,  
and 17% into the reduction of atmospheric emissions.
However, investment in 2014 decreased to US$5 million in 
comparison with US$7 .1 million in 2013, partially due to the 
completion of construction and ramp-up of the environmental 
protection facilities at Polymetal’s new operations and partially 
due to currency devaluation. 
The balance comprises quarterly payments we make to 
governments in the regions we operate for the negative impact  
on the environment caused by our business. The amounts of 
these payments are governed by environmental law and are 
defined by specialised government agencies through the  
audits they conduct regularly at our operation sites.
Our sustainability focus areas 
  Maintaining positive  
working relationships  
with local government,  
NGOs and communities by 
enhancing our partnership 
agreements and increasing 
the effectiveness of 
our investments.
  Improving our health and 
safety system through more 
sophisticated visualisation, 
risk management systems 
and more rigorous 
monitoring within the 
Company and with our 
supplier network.

Sustainability Report 2013/14
This section of our Annual Report presents an overview of Polymetal’s sustainability approach and 
performance in 2014. We have also published a full Sustainability Report 2013/2014, which provides  
more detailed coverage. 
The scope of the Sustainability Report covers all of our wholly-owned operating mines and processing sites  
in Russia and Kazakhstan (Dukat, Omolon, Amursk, Albazino, Mayskoye, Khakanja, Voro and Varvara),  
our headquarters in St. Petersburg and our subsidiary companies. We own and operate all of these entities 
and have direct control over their policies, procedures and performance. 
This report and copies of our previous reports are available on our website, along with regular updates about  
our sustainability activities during the year: www.polymetalinternational.com/sustainable-development.

Kyzyl environmental assessment
International environment and social consultants are 
undertaking a detailed review of the environmental and  
social issues related to the Kyzyl gold project in northeastern 
Kazakhstan. A formal ESIA report along with the project 
feasibility study will be issued in Q4 2015 which will outline 
priority action areas and benchmark the project and the 
embedded environmental programme. This will ensure that any 
environmental and social impacts are addressed in line with the 
International Finance Corporation Performance Standards and 
World Bank Environmental Health and Safety Guidelines.
Key environmental projects in 2014 
During 2014, we made good progress in our environmental 
management programmes.
The five main projects undertaken during the year:
•	 the construction of advanced storm-water and waste-water 
purification units at Amursk, Birkachan and Mayskoye 
was completed;
•	 mine site rehabilitation at Yurievskoye was completed;
•	 improvements were made in water treatment efficiency  
and reduction of water consumption at Voro;
•	 we started waste oil combustion at Albazino, Mayskoye and the 
Omolon hub in order to heat on-site buildings and spaces; and
•	 we instigated tailing dump reconstruction with artificial damp 
bed freezing at Lunnoye.
Waste management
Across our operations we are committed to responsible waste 
management. We operate systems and procedures that are 
designed to maximise the amounts we recycle and minimise 
potential impacts on people and the environment.
We deal with the production and consumption wastes  
we generate by reutilising them in our own production
processes, outsourcing them to specialist companies,  
and disposing of them within our own waste facilities. 
Overburden and tailings
The most significant waste streams linked to our operations  
are overburden and tailings, which account for more than 99% 
of total arisings by volume. The former is material extracted to 
uncover ore deposits; the latter a by-product of ore processing. 
In 2014, we produced a total of 68 million tonnes of overburden, 
and 11 million tonnes of tailings.
Recycled materials
Wherever possible we try to recycle the waste we produce.  
In 2014, this accounted for 20% of total waste produced. 
Cyanide and hazardous waste management
We pay particular attention to the way we monitor and manage 
cyanide, since it generates hazardous waste components during 
the recovery of gold from the ore we process. In 2014 we used 
8,002 tonnes of cyanide, compared with 7 ,369 tonnes in 2013. 
Our approach involves:
•	 identifying all associated hazards;
•	 strictly controlling all cyanide levels in our tailings;
•	 monitoring air, soil, surface and ground waters;
•	 providing environmental monitoring results to public 
authorities; and
•	 delivering environmental protection measures, including the 
design, construction and monitoring of tailings dams, and the 
monitoring of water sources and quality, riverbed changes 
and associated drainage.
Additionally, when we use cyanide, we use 100% of the volumes 
purchased to ensure there is no waste element. Cyanide also 
exists in our processes as a chemical compound found in gas, 
water and in solids, which we later purify.
In line with our commitments in this area, we take a rigorous 
approach to the transportation of hazardous materials.  
In 2013 and 2014, we did not transport, import or export  
any waste deemed hazardous under the terms of the  
Basel Convention 2, Annex I, II, III and VIII.
Water
We withdraw significant volumes of water for use across our 
business. All water is re-used, treated and discharged as 
effluent to surface water, or is treated and stored in tailings 
dams. We capture all water consumption and discharge data 
using water meters, flow meters and indirect measuring.
We have consent from local and state authorities to withdraw 
water from a wide range of sources adjacent to our operating 
sites. Due to the wide geographical spread of our operations, 
we are able to ensure that our usage does not place undue 
demands on any one water source, and always remains within 
acceptable withdrawal limits. We also withdraw very little from 
surface water bodies such as rivers or springs. Indeed, around 
90% of our water sources are underground, and our annual 
average volume of water withdrawn from surface bodies does 
not exceed 10%. Those surface sources we do use are located 
away from environmentally sensitive areas, or those areas where 
water sources are of high value to local communities and 
indigenous peoples.
Performance
During 2013/14, we made good progress in our environmental management programmes.
The major projects carried out in this period included land rehabilitation, environmental monitoring, industrial waste recycling,  
the construction of waste storage areas, the repair and replacement of gas purification and exhaust systems, and the control  
of dust emissions.
GHG emissions  
(CO 2 equivalent  
tonnes per 10 Kt  
of ore processed)
Due to the remote locations of our operations, we rely heavily  
on diesel fuel for power generation. These diesel generators, plus  
the use of natural gas and coal for heating and fuel for vehicles, 
account for the bulk of GHG emissions. The significant drop  
in emissions per unit for 2014 is evidence of our increasing  
carbon efficiency.

materials and minimise our potential impacts on people and 
the environment.

Across our operations we aim to reduce discharge intensity, 
improve the quality of water discharged, enhance the efficiency  
of water use and increase recycling. Any increases are due  
to growth of incoming waters in our open pits.

Energy intensity  
(gigajoule per 10 Kt

Polymetal's remote subsidiaries must generate their own sources  
of electricity and heat, which currently necessitates significant use  
of diesel. However, we are constantly reviewing costs, environmental 
impacts and alternatives, and the increase in 2014 is the result of the 
change from diesel to electricity-powered equipment.

Sustainability
Health and safety
Polymetal operates 120 production sites and processes, 
including open and underground mines, geological exploration 
sites, ore processing and explosives depots. Each of these sites 
has its own inherent risks, and in Russia and Kazakhstan 92 of 
our production facilities are deemed ‘hazardous’.
Our people work in challenging conditions and remote locations 
where it can be difficult to enforce stringent safety procedures. 
However, each year, as our operations expand, we are learning 
more about how best to engage our people with health and 
safety issues, and to promote a ‘zero harm’ culture in which 
everyone takes responsibility for personal safety and wellbeing.
Our overall approach is set by the Company’s Health and  
Safety Policy and underpinned by our employee protection and 
workplace safety management system. We also follow best 
practice in our management of industrial risks to protect our 
employees and safeguard the interests of local populations.
We comply with the health and safety legislation of the states 
and regions where we operate, and we meet all relevant 
international requirements. Indeed, our employee protection and 
workplace safety management system is based on the most 
up-to-date health and safety standards, including ILO-OSH 
2001, OHSAS 18001 and GOST R 12.0.007-2009.
It is with the deepest regret, therefore, that we report that during 
2014 there were three fatalities across the Group. There was 
also one workplace fatality at a contractor’s site. We extend our 
deepest condolences to the families and friends of those who 
lost their lives and pay tribute to the hard work and commitment 
of the men who died. We are of course covering all related costs 
and providing extended financial support to the families of 
the deceased.
There were also eight non-fatal accidents across the Polymetal 
Group in 2014. Any fatality, accident or injury within our operations 
is wholly unacceptable. We have to do more to reduce workplace 
risks and improve the health and safety performance of our 
employees and contractors. We aim to return to our previous 
record of zero fatalities across all sites and operations.
Our analysis shows that the rise in the number of workplace 
accidents was partially attributable to the increased scope of 
underground mining at our operations in complex geotechnical 
environments. In response, we have been quick to increase the 
level of training, hazard visualisation and use of safety videos 
across our operations – particularly for those workers in 
high-risk roles, such as blasters, shaft miners and shaft 
timber-men. We are also taking further actions to extend 
personal safety and risk awareness across our operating mines, 
and devising corrective and preventative measures in relation  
to each specific accident.
We are implementing a range of new safety measures and 
actions designed to enhance our existing Occupational Health 
and Safety Management System (OHSMS):
•	 updating our OHSMS policy and objectives;
•	 changing underground mining technology;
•	 carrying out a comprehensive analysis of all work-related 
injuries and their causes;
•	 conducting a rigorous assessment of our OHSMS to identify 
inefficiencies and weak points;
•	 an external OHSMS audit by Bureau Veritas;
•	 appointing new personnel to oversee health and safety  
at certain mine sites; and
•	 launching an upgraded shift-by-shift risk assessment system.

Definition of H&S terms:
Accident: an unfortunate event that occurs in the course of work, on the way to or from work, 
or in a Company vehicle, which leads to mental or physical harm.
Incident: an event that gives rise to an accident, or has the potential to lead to an accident  
(for example, an unexpected explosion and/or the release of dangerous substances).
Occurrence: a failure, near miss or dangerous event.
LTIFR: Lost Time Injury Frequency Rate per one million hours worked.
FIFR: Fatal Injury Frequency Rate per one million hours worked.
Regardless of location, our overarching aim is to reduce the 
amount of water we use per unit of output. In addition, we aim 
to reduce to the absolute minimum the volume and impact of 
liquids discharged into watercourses, while maximising the 
safety of our tailings dams.
During 2013/14, the total amount of ore mined by Polymetal 
increased year-on-year by 32%, meaning the total amount of 
water used across our operations also increased.
Over the past three years, the volume of water re-used by all 
Group companies has averaged 87% of the total withdrawn. 
The remaining proportion is treated and discharged to surface 
water, in accordance with the requirements of Russian and 
Kazakh environmental legislation. We have discharge permits 
and agreements in place, and the quality of our discharge water 
complies with target indicators.
Energy
Polymetal’s mining operations are energy intensive. In addition, 
operating in remote locations with no access to grid power and 
extreme weather conditions, we are reliant on diesel fuel for 
heating and powering equipment and vehicles. Diesel and gas 
purchased from third-party suppliers account for the majority  
of our total direct energy consumption. We also use coal which 
we mine at our production sites.
Energy efficiency and savings
We obviously need to develop and maintain our own power 
infrastructure, whilst at the same time promoting energy 
efficiency and savings across our operations. In 2014 we saved 
1,495 tonnes of diesel. We are also investigating long-term 
options for renewable energy use.
Greenhouse gas emissions
Our operations produce direct greenhouse gas (GHG) 
emissions through the generation of heat and electricity from 
diesel generators, the burning of natural gas and coal, and the 
use of industrial and household landfills.
We use established international methodology to calculate our 
CO
2
 emissions. In 2014, direct CO
2
 emissions resulting from our 
operations amounted to 304 Kt, compared with 327 Kt in 2013.
Indirect emissions and other pollutants released during 
production processes are shown in the following table.

  From 1 January 2013, the Group began calculating CO 2 emissions according to the 
reference book ‘International Greenhouse Gases Emissions Inventory Methodology’ 
developed by A. Zinchenko from the scientific and production corporation Atmosphere  
in St. Petersburg in 2003.

  Direct emissions include: CO 2 -equivalent emissions produced by combustion of fuel (diesel 
fuel, petrol, gas, coal) and use of electric power when operating own power-generating 
facilities, automobile transport, main and auxiliary mining equipment.
3
  Indirect emissions include: CO 2 -equivalent emissions that relate to the generation of power 
purchased (imported) by the Company’s operations.
Biodiversity management
We make concerted efforts to minimise our impact on flora and 
fauna, and we do not operate in or adjacent to protected or 
vulnerable areas of land or bodies of water. Neither do we 
operate on or adjacent to land identified as having natural, 
historical or cultural value for Indigenous Minorities of the  
North (IMN).
Key plans for 2015-2017
We have also identified a number of projects on which  
we will be focusing our attention in 2015:
•	 rehabilitation of the pits in the Ozerny area;
•	 reconstruction of the dump facility for solid domestic  
and industrial waste in Lunnoye;
•	 increased throughput of the emergency and storm 
wastewater purification station at Voro;
•	 construction of a sewage collector from the Amursk POX  
plant to a mechanical sewage purification station; and
•	 recycling of industrial waste in Mayskoye.

Training, motivation and reward  
at the core of our activities
Employees
As we expand our operations, we are looking to develop  
our stable, loyal and motivated employee base. Each year we 
strengthen our internal Talent Pool, increasing the scope of our 
employees’ expertise and building our leadership capabilities  
for the future. We also pay competitive salaries and provide 
equal terms of recruitment, employment and promotion,  
making Polymetal a highly attractive place to work.
Indeed, we believe that by providing an environment in which 
our employees feel well looked after, rewarded and listened  
to, we can continue to develop the workforce we need to meet 
our long-term business goals. As a key stakeholder group,  
our employees expect a certain standard of behaviour from  
us. In return, our employees are expected to adhere to our 
Company Code of Conduct, which covers all aspects of HR  
and development as well as our commitment to the UN Global 
Compact and International Labour Organisation Principles.
Salaries and benefits
We strongly believe in acknowledging and rewarding our 
employees’ achievements. We offer competitive and fair rates  
of pay and benefits to ensure we can attract and retain the best 
people. Our levels of salary and remuneration exceed regional 
averages in all our areas of operation, while our long-term 
incentives are linked to employees’ performance and potential.
Within the Company, our remuneration structure is built around 
a base salary, which comprises a fixed salary and allowance 
based on an employee’s qualifications and personal attributes. 
For operational staff, we provide a time-paid salary which  
is calculated according to the number of hours worked, the 
amount of work done, and monthly and annual allowances 
based on performance and available funds. With these 
measures, we comply with and exceed all legal requirements  
in Russia and Kazakhstan.
Gender diversity
We do not believe that the skills and talent required for the 
business are gender-related. We proactively work to recruit  
and encourage women within the business.
In 2014, the proportion of women working in the Group was 
22%. Women represent 22% of Board members, 22% of  
senior management positions, and 43% of qualified employees.
Employee turnover
In recent years, we have managed to significantly reduce  
our average employee turnover rate (including fly-in/fly-out 
operations). This was down to 11.4% in 2014, compared  
with 18.5% in 2013.
Anti-corruption
Through the Polymetal Code of Conduct, we take a rigorous 
stance on anti-corruption. We educate our employees on 
preventing corruption and its potential impact on our business. 
In 2014, 3,000 Polymetal employees, including all regional 
managing directors, attended a total of 66 anti-corruption 
seminars. We also have measures in place to help minimise 
corrupt practices and fraudulent transactions among our 
workforce, our contractors and our suppliers. 
Human rights
As supporters of the UN Global Compact and through  
our own corporate values, defined in the Polymetal Code  
of Conduct, we apply human rights principles rigorously  
for all our employees. We respect the human rights and 
preserve the cultural heritage of the indigenous communities  
in areas where we operate, in keeping with the UN Declaration 
on the Rights of Indigenous Peoples. We also seek to  
influence our partners, contractors and suppliers to apply  
the same standards. 
 
Communities
Geographically, the scope of our operational activities is vast.  
It encompasses the Magadan Region, Khabarovsk Territory,  
the Chukotka Autonomous Territory, Northern Urals and 
Kazakhstan, and is expanding every year in these areas.  
This means that our interactions with local populations are 
widespread and diverse. 
As an employer, we provide local employment opportunities 
across all our sites and facilities. We commission and use  
local services, helping to stimulate local economies and  
supply chains. 
During 2014, despite macroeconomic headwinds, we sustained 
stable wage growth across the Group in line with inflation, 
maintaining our position as an attractive employer in the labour 
market in the regions where we operate. We also continued  
to deliver improvements to employees’ working conditions, 
especially for those undertaking shift-work in remote areas with 
severe climates. Key achievements included the construction  
of a modern workers’ dormitory in Mayskoye, comprehensive 
repair of dormitories at Dukat, and the commissioning of 
state-of-the-art sports facilities in some of our more 
remote locations.
Training and development
We invest in training and development to enhance the 
capabilities of our people. Our training programmes are 
designed to create the workforce we need to meet our 
operational and strategic goals, and to offer our employees 
opportunities for career progression. Using both our own 
specialist instructors and external suppliers, we offer general 
management and technical training at our Corporate Training 
Centre in St. Petersburg and at the teaching facilities available at 
most of our sites. This is supplemented by the training modules 
provided by our distance-learning system. We also nurture 
future generations of skilled managers through our Talent Pool.
We invested US$0.7 million in 2014 (2013: US$0.5 million)  
in professional training across all disciplines. This means  
that 9,626 employees received some form of professional 
development training during the year. In 2014, the average 
number of hours of training for managers and qualified 
employees was 49 and 72 hours per person respectively.  
The average hours of training for all other employees increased 
from 111 to 139, reflecting the good work done in this area.
Of course, our operations also generate waste materials and 
emissions. However, we have robust measures in place to 
manage and mitigate these impacts and go beyond our 
regulatory obligations to ensure our operations do not  
adversely affect local communities or environments.
We believe that long-term sustainable development is 
underpinned by the effective management of social investment. 
Our social investment initiatives are guided by industry 
benchmarks and standards and extend to all territories where 
we conduct exploration and production activities. In the last five 
years, the scope of our social investments has increased, with  
a total of US$24 million invested in local projects from 2010-2014. 
In 2015, we plan to spend US$5.5 million on social support and 
territorial development programmes.
Our investment priorities are determined through open dialogue 
with local communities. As part of this process, we carry out 
in-depth analysis of local people’s needs and work with them  
to understand how social investment could best bring positive 
change to their lives. Together, we identify the most pressing 
local issues and define the scope of the support required.
Investments and related targets are approved annually by the 
Polymetal management and Board of Directors. Decisions are 
made based on a project’s potential to improve the quality of life 
for local people, with a focus on the following areas:
•	 healthcare and education;
•	 infrastructure;
•	 sport and lifestyle;
•	 culture and creative potential;
•	 Indigenous Minorities of the North (IMN); and
•	 environmental protection.

Highlights
•	 Revenue for the year ending 2014 was US$1,690 million, largely unchanged from 2013 (year-on-year) despite average realised 
gold and silver prices decreasing 7% and 18% respectively year-on-year. The price decline was largely offset by a 7% increase  
in the volume of gold equivalent sold during the period.
•	 Group Total cash cost
1
 (TCC) was US$634/gold equivalent ounce (GE oz), down 15% from 2013 due to a robust operational 
performance, resulting in higher average grades processed and increased throughputs across the portfolio, coupled with 
significant Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge depreciation against the US Dollar. Total cash costs in the second half of the year 
increased slightly by 2% to US$641/GE oz versus the first half of 2014 driven by production from Mayskoye with cost levels higher 
than the Group average.
•	 All-in sustaining cash costs
1
 decreased by 18% year-on-year, to US$893/GE oz as a result of reduction in total cash costs during 
the period, combined with increased production levels and an associated reduction in per ounce sustaining capital expenditure  
at operating mines.
•	 Adjusted EBITDA
1
 was US$685 million, an increase of 15% year-on-year, driven predominantly by strong cost performance and 
production growth offsetting the decline in commodity prices. Adjusted EBITDA margin was 41% compared with 35% in 2013.
•	 Underlying net earnings for the year (adjusted for the after-tax amount of impairment charges/reversals and foreign exchange 
loss) were US$282 million (2013: US$179 million). As a result of non-cash foreign exchange losses, the Group recorded a net 
loss for the year of US$210 million in 2014 (2013: US$198 million).
•	 Net debt was US$1,249 million (including the liability for the special dividend payable), an increase of 20% versus the 2013  
levels as the Company raised an additional US$318.5 million of debt for the acquisition of the Kyzyl gold project in Kazakhstan 
(completed on 4 September 2014), while continuing to generate free cash flow and pay dividends. Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA 
was 1.82 (31 December 2013: 1.75). Free cash flow for the year
1
 was US$306 million, an increase of more than two-fold 
compared with 2013.
•	 A final dividend of US$0.13 per share representing 30% of the Group’s underlying net earnings for 2H 2014 is proposed  
by the Board, which, in accordance with the current dividend policy, has the discretion to declare a regular dividend when the  
Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA ratio is above 1.75. This will bring the total dividend declared for the period to US$0.41 per share,  
or US$173 million.

Market summary
Please see the market overview on pages 22-23.
Foreign exchange
The Group’s revenues and the majority of its borrowings are denominated in US Dollars, while the majority of the Group’s costs are 
denominated in Russian Roubles. Changes in exchange rates therefore affect its financial results and performance. Both average 
monthly and period-end RUB/US$ exchange rates fluctuated heavily during 2014, a result of significant depreciation of the Russian 
Rouble against the US Dollar by the year-end. From 1 January to 31 December 2014 the Russian Rouble depreciated against the 
US Dollar by 72.2% from 32.7 RUB/US$ to 56.3 RUB/US$, and the average rate was up 23% year-on-year from 31.8 RUB/US$  
in 2013 to 38.4 RUB/US$ in 2014. The devaluation of the Rouble had a significant negative non-cash effect on the Group’s net 
earnings in 2014 due to the effect of retranslating its US Dollar debt, which was partially offset by a more long-lasting positive  
effect on the Dollar value of the Group’s Rouble-denominated operating costs and Adjusted EBITDA.

Total revenue 1,690 1,707 -1%
In 2014, revenue decreased slightly by 1% year-on-year to US$1.69 billion driven by a 7% decline in the average realised gold price, 
while gold equivalent volume sold was up 7%. Gold and silver sales volumes increased by 17% and 7% year-on-year, while 
production grew 17% and 5%, respectively.
The average realised price of gold was US$1,231/oz in 2014, down 7% from US$1,326/oz in 2013, and slightly below the average 
market price of US$1,266/oz. The average realised silver price was US$17.7/oz, down 18% year-on-year, and 7% below the average 
market price of US$19.1/oz due to a larger volume of Polymetal’s sales recorded in the second half of the year when market prices 
had significantly deteriorated.
The share of gold sales as a percentage of total revenue increased from 63% in 2013 to 69% in 2014, driven by production and 
sales volume movements and the relative decline in the silver price.
Copper sales were limited by the current weakness in the copper concentrate market, resulting in a temporary shutdown of the 
flotation circuit at Varvara.

The decline in gold and, notably, silver prices during the period affected revenues at Voro and Dukat, respectively, despite the 
increase in production volumes. Sales at Omolon and Albazino followed production growth, while Khakanja experienced some 
reduction in revenues due to lower production driven by the planned grade decline. At Varvara, the decline in sales was driven  
by the weakness in the copper concentrate market and resulting production decline.

Total cash operating costs 866 100% 919 100%
Total cost of sales decreased by 9% in 2014 to US$1,023 million, mainly on the back of decreased amounts of ore purchased from 
third parties at Voro and Varvara combined with Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge depreciation during 2014. This was partially 
offset by volume-based growth in production and sales (12% and 7% year-on-year respectively in gold equivalent terms) and  
a significant increase in depreciation charges at Mayskoye and Omolon driven by larger mining and production volumes. 
The cost of consumables and spare parts decreased by 10% and the cost of services remained almost flat despite meaningful 
production growth.
The total cost of labour within cash operating costs in 2014 was US$169 million, a 6% decrease, mainly stemming from a decline  
in the average number of employees at Khakanja, Omolon and Mayskoye.
Mining tax remained flat year-on-year at US$110 million as production volume growth of 12% offset the decrease in average 
realised prices.
Depreciation and depletion was US$292 million, up 19% year-on-year, mainly as a result of the full ramp-up of Mayskoye as well  
as the revision of the mine plan at Omolon triggering faster depreciation of capitalised stripping costs and depletion of mineral 
rights. US$36 million of depreciation and depletion expenses in 2014, related to ore and concentrate stockpiles, was included  
in metal inventories as at 31 December 2014.
In 2014 a net metal inventory increase of US$142 million was recorded (excluding write-downs to net realisable value). The increase 
was mainly represented by the temporary increase in ore stockpiles at the Omolon hub, represented by low-grade heap leach ore  
at Birkachan, ores at Sopka (where mining was completed ahead of schedule) and at Dalneye, and accumulation of excess 
concentrate stockpiles at Varvara.

Other 14 14 -1%
Total 131 168 -22%
General, administrative and selling expenses decreased by 22% year-on-year from US$168 million to US$131 million, mainly because 
of the fall in (Rouble-denominated) labour and share-based compensation costs.
The US$24 million of share-based compensation recognised during 2013 represented the final accrual made in respect of the old 
Long-term Employee Incentive Programme (Old EIP) which was adopted in 2010 and had a vesting date of 11 June 2013 (or, at the 
discretion of the participants, 11 June 2014). None of the options vested in June 2013, as the performance conditions (the share 
price exceeding the strike price of US$16.74 per share) were not met. Further, in March 2014 the majority of employees waived  
their rights under the Old EIP in order to be able to participate in the new Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP). However, the expense 
previously recognised does not reverse as a credit to the income statement in accordance with IFRS rules as the non-vesting is 
related to a market-based condition. The first grant of options under the new LTIP took place on 22 April 2014 and US$2 million  
was recognised in share-based compensation expense for 2014.

Other expenses increased from US$88 million in 2013 to US$132 million in 2014. Additional charges recognised in 2014 were 
recorded by the Company in relation to various tax exposures and tax penalties and are related to the mining tax exposure of 
US$11 million, VAT exposure of US$2 million, tax exposure at Varvara in respect of the commercial discovery bonus of US$3 million 
and penalties and interest related to income tax of US$4 million. For more information refer to Note 12 of the consolidated 
financial statements.
The increase in exploration expenses from US$24 million in 2013 to US$51 million in 2014 is mainly due to a higher amount  
of previously capitalised exploration costs being written off (on a cash basis the exploration expenses were US$16 million and 
US$23 million respectively).

In 2014 the total cash costs per gold equivalent ounce sold (TCC) were US$634/GE oz, down 15% year-on-year. The recent 
depreciation of the Russian Rouble had a meaningful positive impact on cost levels reported in US Dollars, which were supported  
by robust operating performance across Polymetal’s operations.
The table below summarises major factors that have affected the Group’s TCC dynamics year-on-year:

 Effect of mix change between mines with different cost levels.
Total cash cost by mine:
•	 Dukat’s total cash cost per silver equivalent ounce sold decreased by 25% year-on-year to US$8.7/oz. Beyond the effect  
of the Rouble depreciation, this decrease in cash costs has been achieved as a result of stable grades and solid improvement  
in throughput at both the Omsukchan and Lunnoye plants.
•	 At Voro, which continues to be our lowest cost operation, cash costs decreased further by 25% compared with 2013, to 
US$376/GE oz. The key driver of cost dynamics was the discontinued use of purchased ore with relatively low grade and higher 
cost, as well as higher recoveries at the CIP plant and higher production at the heap leach facility.
•	 Khakanja’s TCC was US$704/GE oz, a 7% decrease year-on-year. This cost performance was supported by the significant 
devaluation of the Russian Rouble, which offset the scheduled decline in average grade processed (from 5.7 g/t to 5.3 GE g/t 
year-on-year).
•	 At Varvara, TCC was US$705/GE oz, decreasing by 11% year-on-year. This performance was achieved on the back of a stable 
grade profile and significant devaluation of the Kazakh Tenge in early 2014.
•	 At Omolon, TCC amounted to US$570/GE oz, a 35% decrease year-on-year. This strong performance was achieved on the back 
of 31% growth in average gold equivalent grade processed at the Kubaka mill during the period (from 5.1 g/t to 6.7 g/t), as well  
as an 8% increase in Kubaka mill throughput.
•	 At Albazino/Amursk, TCC was US$625/GE oz, down 21% compared with 2013. This improvement was achieved on the back  
of steady mine performance, increased capacity at Albazino, and the POX plant operating for a full year at design throughput and 
exceeding design recovery levels.
•	 Total cash costs at Mayskoye were US$966/GE oz as the majority of sales were generated from concentrate offtake, which  
is more expensive than concentrate processing at the POX plant.

mines (i.e. excluding new project Capex, but including all exploration expenditure (both expensed and capitalised in the period) and minor brownfield expansions).
All-in sustaining cash costs amounted to US$893/GE oz in 2014 and decreased by 18% year-on-year, with a decrease in total  
cash costs and reduction of per ounce SG&A and capital expenditure on the back of continued production growth.

Reversals recorded in 2014 are related to ore in heap leaching piles, work-in-progress and metal for refinery previously impaired, 
which was further processed or determined to be economic for further processing. The reversals are mainly driven by the decline  
in unit cash costs required to bring the work-in-progress stockpiles into saleable metal.

 The Company defines Adjusted EBITDA (a non-IFRS measure) as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation expense, rehabilitation expenses, write-down of inventory to net realisable 
value, share-based compensation, listing expenses, gains and losses on acquisitions and disposals, foreign exchange gain/(loss), change in fair value of derivatives, change in fair value of 
contingent consideration, finance income, finance costs and income tax expense. Adjusted EBITDA margin is Adjusted EBITDA divided by revenue. The figures presented above have been 
rounded and accordingly may not add to the total shown.
In 2014, Adjusted EBITDA was US$685 million, 15% higher year-on-year, resulting in an Adjusted EBITDA margin of 41%.  
The increase was mainly driven by the 15% decrease in total cash costs, which was partially offset by a 7% and 18% reduction  
in the average realised gold and silver price, respectively. Adjusted EBITDA increased at Voro, Omolon and Albazino, while it 
decreased at Khakanja due to the scheduled grade declines, as well as at Varvara due to lower sales volumes and increased costs. 
The Adjusted EBITDA margin at Mayskoye was 19%, as most sales were derived from high-cost concentrate offtake.
Other income statement items
Polymetal recorded a net foreign exchange loss in 2014 of US$559 million compared with US$74 million in 2013. These unrealised 
non-cash losses represent the appreciation of the Group’s predominantly US Dollar-denominated borrowings against the Russian 
Rouble, the functional currency of all Group companies other than Varvara (whose functional currency is Kazakh Tenge). The Group’s 
average gross debt during 2014 was US$1,217 million, fully denominated in US Dollars, while the US Dollar appreciated against the 
Russian Rouble by 72.2% during the period, from 32.7 RUB/US$ at 31 December 2013 to 56.3 RUB/US$ as at 31 December 2014.
The Company does not use any hedging instruments for managing foreign exchange risk, other than a natural hedge arising from 
the fact that the majority of the Group’s revenue is denominated or calculated in US Dollars. Though income statement volatility may 
arise in the financial reporting, Polymetal believes that the underlying matching of revenue cash flows against debt repayments and 
related interest represents an economically effective hedging strategy.
Net earnings, earnings per share and dividends
The Group recorded a net loss of US$210 million in 2014 versus US$198 million in 2013. The loss resulted from unrealised foreign 
exchange losses (pre-tax amount of US$559 million, equal to an after-tax amount of US$523 million).
Underlying net earnings (excluding after-tax impact of impairment charges/reversals and foreign exchange losses) were 
US$282 million, compared with US$179 million in 2013. The increase in underlying net earnings was mainly driven by the increase  
in Adjusted EBITDA.
Basic earnings per share were a loss of US$0.53 per share compared with a loss of US$0.51 per share in 2013. Underlying basic 
EPS was US$0.71 per share, compared with US$0.46 per share in 2013.
In accordance with the Company’s dividend policy, the Board is proposing to pay a final dividend of US$0.13 per share representing 
approximately 30% of the Group’s underlying net earnings for the period. During 2014, Polymetal paid a total of US$65 million in 
dividends, representing final dividends for FY 2013 and interim dividends for 1H 2014. In January 2015, Polymetal paid an additional 
US$84 million of special dividends on the back of strong free cash flow generation and a comfortable leverage position.

 Total capital expenditure includes amounts payable at the end of the period. On a cash basis, capital expenditure was US$210 million in 2014 (2013: US$319 million). The difference from 
Capex on an accrual basis is mostly due to depreciation of US$19 million (2013: US$33 million) capitalised into exploration and stripping assets.
In 2014, total capital expenditure was US$223 million, down 38% year-on-year. All of the Group’s major investment projects are  
now complete, following the launch of the Mayskoye concentrator in April 2013. From 2H 2013 the bulk of the Group’s capital 
expenditure has been related to stay-in-business spending and exploration. Capital expenditure excluding stripping costs was 
US$192 million in 2014 (2013: US$265 million).

56 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 57 Financial review
Capital expenditure in 2014 was represented as follows:
•	 across all mines, capital expenditure declined year-on-year and was mainly represented by mining fleet upgrades/replacements 
and maintenance expenditure at the processing facilities;
•	 the Company continues to invest in standalone exploration projects. Capital expenditure on exploration in 2014 was US$72 million 
compared with US$59 million in 2013, and focused, in addition to near-mine properties, mostly on PGM assets, Maminskoye 
and Kutyn;
•	 capitalised stripping costs totalled US$31 million in 2014 (2013: US$91 million) and are attributable to operations with stripping 
ratios during the period exceeding their life of mine (LOM) averages, including, most importantly, Varvara, Voro and Khakanja.  
The decline is mainly related to completion of major stripping campaigns in 2013; and
•	 total capital expenditure in 2014 includes US$5 million of capitalised interest (2013: US$6 million), which has declined as the 
Group has commissioned all of its major growth assets.

Operating cash flows in 2014 strengthened compared with the prior period. Operating cash flows before changes in working  
capital grew by 37% year-on-year to US$614 million as a result of an increase in Adjusted EBITDA. Net operating cash flows  
were US$515 million, compared with US$462 million in 2013. These were also affected by an increase in working capital in 2014  
of US$99 million. These increases are mainly due to additional ore stockpiles at Omolon (net increase of US$72 million) and 
accumulation of excess concentrate stockpiles at Varvara (net increase of US$30 million).
Total cash and cash equivalents increased by 139% compared with 2013 and comprised US$157 million, with the following items 
affecting the cash position of the Group:
•	 Operating cash flows of US$515 million;
•	 Investment cash outflows totalled US$524 million, up 61% year-on-year, and are represented by capital expenditure (down  
34% year-on-year to US$210 million) and other investing cash flows represented by the cash portion of the Kyzyl acquisition;
•	 Payment of regular dividends for 2013 and 1H 2014 amounting to US$65 million; and
•	 The net increase in borrowings of US$202 million.

Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA 1.82 1.75 +4%
The Group continues to maintain a comfortable liquidity and funding profile.
The Group’s net debt increased to US$1,249 million as at 31 December 2014, representing a Net debt/Adjusted EBITDA  
(over the last 12 months) ratio of 1.82. The increase is mainly attributable to debt financing of the Kyzyl acquisition in 2H 2014.
The proportion of long-term borrowings comprised 58% as at 31 December 2014 (93% as at 31 December 2013).
In addition, as at 31 December 2014 the Group had US$1.0 billion (31 December 2013: US$1.3 billion) of available undrawn 
facilities, of which US$0.8 billion is committed, from a wide range of lenders. This ensures that Polymetal maintains its operational 
flexibility in the current environment.
The average cost of debt remained low at 3.5% in 2014 (2013: 2.99%), supported by low base interest rates and the ability  
to negotiate competitive premiums given the solid financial position of the Company and Polymetal’s excellent credit history.  
Despite ongoing tightening of the credit markets in Russia, the Group is confident in its ability to refinance the existing borrowings  
as they fall due. In January 2015, the Group negotiated a four-year US$100 million loan from a large European bank.
2015 outlook
While we recognise that our financial performance is heavily dependent on the RUB/US$ exchange rate, inflation in Russia,  
and oil price dynamics, Polymetal expects to deliver a resilient financial performance at the current price levels which will be driven 
by the following factors:
•	 the Company is fully on track to deliver on its production guidance of 1.35 Moz of gold equivalent for 2015;
•	 Polymetal expects total cash costs in 2015 of US$575-625/GE oz and All-in sustaining cash costs of US$750-800/GE oz;
•	 capital expenditure in 2015 is expected to total approximately US$240 million (including exploration, capitalised stripping and 
spending on the Kyzyl project); 
•	 as a result, the Company expects to continue to generate meaningful free cash flow and dividend payments in 2015.

58 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 59 Effective risk identification  
and management
Risks and risk management
Risk management process
Polymetal’s risk management process is 
designed to minimise the potential threats 
to achieving our strategic objectives.
Internal control and risk management 
systems are continuously enhanced to 
add value to our business.
The risk management process 
incorporates the following stages:
•	 identification and documentation  
of risks;
•	 assessment, qualification and 
quantification of each risk;
•	 development and implementation  
of risk mitigation/control strategies;
•	 monitoring, reporting and reviewing 
risks; and
•	 establishment and enhancement of 
effective internal control procedures.
Effective risk management is critical to the  
long-term sustainability and success of the Company. 
We believe that delivery of sustainable value to our 
stakeholders should be based on effective risk 
identification and response. As the global and local 
markets we operate in have demonstrated increased 
turbulence over the last several years, the Board 
placed greater emphasis on principal risk 
management in 2014.
The Audit and Risk Committee of the 
Board sets the agenda for the risk 
management policies and procedures  
of the Group, and is responsible for 
reviewing their effectiveness. Its duties 
include the review of:
•	 policies and processes to identify and 
assess principal business risks and to 
manage their impact on the Company 
and the Group;
•	 regular assurance reports from 
management, internal audit, external 
audit and others on matters related to 
risk and control;
•	 periodic ‘deep dives’ into significant risk 
areas; and
•	 the timeliness of, and reporting on, the 
effectiveness of corrective actions 
taken by management.
Risk identification
Risk awareness is embedded within the 
Group and is grounded in our strong 
ethical values and pro-active corporate 
culture. Our risk management philosophy 
is driven by the Company’s Board of 
Directors and runs through all our 
management, employee and connected 
stakeholder activities – from developing 
strategy to day-to-day operations.
Risk management is one of the key 
functions of the Audit and Risk 
Committee. Strategic risks are identified 
by the Board based on a detailed 
understanding of the Company, its 
markets and the legal, social, political, 
economic, technological, natural and 
cultural environments in which we 
operate. Our risk identification system 
considers not only single, mutually 
exclusive risks, but also multiple linked 
and correlated risks.
Risk matrices and assurance maps are 
used to record, prioritise and track each 
risk through the risk management 
process. These are regularly reviewed  
by the Audit and Risk Committee.
Risk assessment
Once identified, potential risk factors are 
assessed to consider the quantitative and 
qualitative impact these may have on the 
business and the likelihood of the event 
(see table opposite). Together these 
create a risk profile.
Risk response
When the appropriate ranking has  
been identified, a response to each  
risk is formulated and implemented. 
Management assesses the effects of a 
risk’s likelihood and impact, as well as the 
costs and benefits of possible mitigating 
actions. A response is then determined 
and implemented, to bring the risk within 
acceptable tolerance levels.
Monitoring and reporting
Ongoing monitoring processes are 
embedded in Polymetal’s business 
operations. These track the effective 
application of internal control and risk 
management policies and procedures, 
including internal audit and specific 
management reviews. Risk matrices and 
assurance maps are used to re-evaluate 
and adjust controls in response to 
changes in the Company’s objectives, the 
business and the external environment.
Management is responsible for the 
implementation of effective follow-up 
procedures to ensure appropriate actions 
occur in response to changes in risk and 
control assessments.

Risk category Risk description and potential effect Risk response
1.  
Market risk
Gold and silver price volatility may result  
in material and adverse movements in the 
Company’s operating results, revenues  
and cash flows.
The Company has developed and implemented plans  
to ensure consistent cash flow generation at operating  
mines, including:
•	 redistribution of ore feedstock among deposits to achieve 
better cost profile due to better grade profile, better logistics  
or less expensive mining methods;
•	 deferring the start of production while continuing ore stacking 
to achieve better cost profiles due to positive scaling effects;
•	 managing the volume of third-party ore purchases;
•	 staffing level review and hiring freeze;
•	 asset-level cost-cutting.
Reserve and resource prices, as well as cut-off grades, are 
adjusted at least annually to reflect the prevailing commodity  
price levels. Short-, medium-, and long-term life-of-mine plans  
are adjusted as appropriate.
Stress testing for conservative price assumptions is performed  
to ensure resilience of the operating mines in a stress scenario 
and continued value creation. Contingency action plans were 
developed to address performance in a stress scenario.
Currently the Company does not hedge its commodity price 
exposure as its strategy is to offer stakeholders full exposure  
to potential gold and silver price upside potential.
2.1  
Production and 
processing risks –  
mining plans
The risk of failure to meet the planned 
production programme objectives. Failure  
to meet production targets may adversely 
affect operating performance and financial  
results of the Group. The risk of lower  
than expected metal grade or dilution  
is caused by complex mining and geological 
conditions, mainly at underground mines. 
Recoveries at the Group’s processing  
plants may not reach planned levels due  
to the complex technological properties  
of ore processed.
Annual, quarterly and monthly production budgeting and 
subsequent monthly control against budget is designed  
to mitigate the risk. The effectiveness and efficiency of the 
production process is ensured by the Group engineering team’s 
senior management. An approved production programme 
includes increased volume of operational prospecting works, 
such as in-fill drilling and grade control sampling.
To mitigate the risk the Group invests considerable amounts  
in ore quality assessment procedures and seeks to control  
ore quality by formation of ore stacks with the  
required characteristics.
2.2  
Production and 
processing risks – 
production  
process supply by  
resources required: 
raw materials,  
equipment, etc.
The Group’s production activity depends 
heavily on the effectiveness of supply 
chains. These might be negatively affected 
by complex logistics to remote locations 
and delays in construction and delivery  
of purchased mining and processing 
equipment or spare parts.
The Group has implemented and constantly improves the supply 
chain system to closely link the production demand of resources 
with inventory levels, optimise the number of order placements 
and ensure the in-time inventory and equipment delivery to 
production sites.
2.3  
Production and 
processing risks – 
production  
process staffing 
Failure to retain key employees or to recruit 
new staff mainly at the Group’s mining and 
processing facilities may lead to increased 
staff costs, interruptions to existing 
operations and delays in new projects.
Lack of skilled and knowledgeable staff at 
remote locations may occur due to extreme 
weather conditions.
A working conditions improvement programme is in place.
Remuneration policies are designed to incentivise, motivate  
and retain key employees.
There is an increased focus on health and safety – refer to 
page 45 of this report. A positive corporate culture is actively 
promoted within the Group.
2.4 
Production and 
processing risks – 
reliance on 
contractors
Risk of underperformance against 
production plan, exceeding available 
resources: budget overspending,  
delayed results.
Contractors’ performance control system is designed, 
implemented and applied.
Risk category Risk description and potential effect Risk response
3.  
Tax risks
Due to frequent changes in tax legislation in 
Russia and Kazakhstan, lack of established 
practices in tax law means that additional 
costs such as taxes or penalties may occur.
The taxation risk level correlates with the 
legal and political risks levels.
The Company’s policy is to comply fully with the requirements  
of the applicable tax laws, providing adequate controls over tax 
accounting and tax reporting and to actively monitor the ongoing 
changes to the tax legislation in its countries of operation.
Given the prevailing practice accepted by arbitration courts when 
deciding on certain cases in tax disputes in 2013 and 2014,  
as well as particular outcomes of tax disputes involving Kazakh 
and Russian subsidiaries of the Group, the tax risk is assessed  
as ‘High’.
The consolidated financial statements reflect provisions booked  
in connection with the Company’s evaluation of tax risks.
To date, the Company is not aware of any significant outstanding 
tax claims, which could lead to additional taxes accrued in the 
future (except for amounts already booked or disclosed in the 
Group’s financial statements).
A new anti-offshore law has been enacted in Russia from  
1 January 2015. The law introduces material changes into the 
taxation procedures for controlled foreign companies and 
establishes new criteria for beneficial ownership of income and 
tax residency in Russia. As all operating entities of the Group are 
domiciled in Russia and Kazakhstan, Polymetal generates all  
of its revenues and profits, and pays all related taxes in these 
countries. Therefore the Company intends to comply with the  
new requirements in full and does not expect any material impact 
on the total tax expense of the Group from the new law. 
4.  
Exploration risks
Exploration and development are time- and 
capital-intensive activities and may involve 
high degrees of risk but are necessary for 
the future growth of the business. Failure  
to discover new reserves of sufficient 
magnitude could adversely affect the 
Company’s future performance.
Risk and uncertainty are inherent for exploration and  
development activities.
The Group invests considerable amounts in focused exploration 
projects to obtain sufficient information about the quantity and 
quality of new reserves and to estimate expected cash flows.  
The Group’s team of geologists and engineering specialists  
has a strong track record of successful greenfield and brownfield 
exploration leading to subsequent development of exploration 
fields into commercial production.
5.  
Construction and 
development risk
Failure to achieve target returns from the 
major capital expenditure projects, such  
as building new mines and processing 
facilities or production capacity increase/
refurbishment at existing mines, as a result 
of failure to meet project delivery timeline 
and budgets. This can adversely affect the 
Group’s financial results and cash flows.
The Company implements global best practices in project 
management. The Group’s engineering team is responsible for 
the oversight of capital expenditure projects, including project 
support, co-ordination of service organisations, contractors, 
constructors and co-operation with regulatory bodies.
Significant parts of exploration and development projects are 
performed by the Group in-house by Polymetal Engineering,  
a subsidiary company with significant expertise and track record  
of designing and commissioning mines and processing plants.
The methods of construction risk management are constantly 
improved including by the employment of world-class consultants 
with recognised international experience.
6.  
Logistics and  
supply chain risk
The Company operates in remote locations 
that require complex transportation of 
material volumes of ore and gold/silver 
concentrates, most of which is performed 
by third party contractors. Production 
targets may not be reached if any element  
of the logistics chain is disrupted.
To mitigate the logistics risk, the Group invests considerable 
amounts into construction and maintenance of permanent and 
temporary winter roads at exploration and production sites.  
The Group exercises effective control over the whole logistics 
chain, including selection and operation of contractors.

62 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 63 Risks and risk management
Risk category Risk description and potential effect Risk response
7. 
Health and  
safety risk
Health, safety and environment risk 
includes regulatory compliance, 
environment pollution and damage,  
and personal safety.
The Company has an occupational and industrial safety control 
system, including risk assessment of individual workplaces, and 
protection of personnel with safety equipment.
The Company has tightened the responsibility for safety by 
making workers be more careful towards risk, and developed 
additional security measures in relation to the recently identified 
insufficient compliance with safety requirements by employees.
8.  
Environmental risk
Major pollution arising from operations 
include deforestation, air and water 
pollution, land contamination. Potential 
impacts include fines and penalties, 
statutory liability for environmental 
redemption and other financial 
consequences that may be significant.
The Company implemented a certified environmental 
management system which meets international standards.
The Company implements a number of initiatives to monitor and 
limit the impact of its operations on the environment including 
external expert assessment of pollution generated and adopting 
best practice in the industry on corporate-level policies  
and procedures.
9.  
Mergers and  
acquisitions
The Group invests considerable amounts  
in precious metals assets and operations  
in Russia and Kazakhstan. There is a risk  
of failure to achieve expected benefits from 
any acquisition in the case of adverse 
changes in assumptions or inaccuracy of 
estimates made, or where the information 
used for decision making was incomplete 
or inaccurate.
Failure to deliver expected benefits from an 
acquisition can result in adverse financial 
performance, lower planned production 
volumes or problems with product quality.
Rigorous due diligence procedures are applied to the evaluation 
and execution of all acquisitions to assess the consequences of 
the acquisition, based on economic, ecological, political and 
social factors.
Board and/or shareholder approval is required for any acquisition 
in excess of US$15 million.
10.  
Legal risk
Operating in developing countries, such  
as Russia and Kazakhstan, involves the  
risk that changes in tax and other legislation 
may occur from time to time. The most 
sensitive areas are regulation of foreign 
investments, private property, 
environmental protection and taxation.
In recent years, however, the governments 
of both Russia and Kazakhstan have 
become more consistent regarding  
the introduction of new regulations and 
taxes, demonstrating awareness of 
investment climate issues. However, in the 
application of existing legislation requiring 
interpretation, courts often uphold the more 
assertive position of the tax authorities, 
which does not always coincide with the 
Company’s position.
Polymetal has a successful track record of operating in both 
Russian and Kazakh jurisdictions, having developed its own 
expertise in corporate, tax, licensing and other legal areas.
The Group’s financial and legal teams monitor current legislation 
and proposed changes and incorporate these into the practice.
Corporate and operating management teams are responsible for 
meeting the legal requirements in their operating activities. Head 
office and on-site legal teams guarantee appropriate controls over 
compliance issues.
The Group takes into account the results of tax audits and court 
rulings when interpreting taxation rules and determining future  
tax positions.
Risk category Risk description and potential effect Risk response
11.  
Political risk
Operating in Russia and Kazakhstan 
involves some risk of political instability, 
which may include changes in government, 
negative policy shifts and civil unrest.
Financial and economic sanctions imposed 
in 2014 by the United States and the EU  
on certain businesses and individuals in 
Russia have increased political tensions 
and increased economic instability; there  
is a risk that further sanctions could impact 
the Group’s ability to operate in Russia  
or Kazakhstan.
These may have an adverse effect  
on the Group’s market value and  
operating environment.
The Group actively monitors political developments on an 
ongoing basis.
We aim to maintain open working relationships with local 
authorities in the countries where we operate.
Sanctions imposed on Russian individuals and businesses  
in 2014 have not currently had any direct influence on the Group’s 
operations, however at the same time they have meaningfully 
impacted both the macroeconomic situation in Russia and 
interest rates for local and foreign borrowings.
12.1  
Financial risks –
liquidity risk
The inability to raise sufficient funds to  
meet current operating or ongoing financial 
needs, or to develop new projects  
and growth.
Inadequate cash management in terms  
of cash flow forecast, available resources 
and future requirements.
The Group’s Treasury function is responsible for ensuring  
that there are sufficient funds in place, including loan facilities, 
cash flow from operating activities and cash on hand to meet 
short-term business requirements. Long-term credit lines are 
used to finance new projects and organic growth. The Group 
ensures that significant undrawn committed facilities are  
in place to cover any funding gaps.
12.2
Financial risk – 
currency risk
The risk arises from Company’s receipts 
from metal sales and foreign currency –
denominated debt, as well as the foreign 
currency-denominated cost of imported 
capital goods and consumables.
Natural hedging is used to reduce the risk exposure: revenue  
is matched with US Dollar-denominated debt.
Flexible budgeting is used to monitor the effect of exchange rate 
fluctuations on the Group’s financial results.
Depreciation of the Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge in 2014 
against the US Dollar and Euro resulted in recognition of unrealised 
negative foreign exchange losses on revaluation of US$-
denominated debt. However, lower exchange rates resulted  
in a decrease of operating costs and higher cash flows from 
operations as most costs are denominated in local currencies. 
12.3
Financial risks – 
interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to the interest rate 
risk as the significant part of the Group’s 
debt portfolio is US Dollar-denominated 
floating-rate borrowings.
Based on analysis of the current economic situation, the Group 
has decided to accept the risk of floating interest rates rather than 
hedge or borrow at fixed rates.
However the Group does not rule out the possibility of fixing the 
interest rate on its borrowings in the future, should assessment  
of the ongoing economic situation suggest this may be profitable.
Due to the financial sanctions imposed against some Russian 
banking institutions in 2014 the overall level of interest rates  
in Russia has increased. Considering this, the Company has 
revised the risk level by increasing it to average. 
12.4
Financial risks – 
inflation rate risk
A higher rate of inflation may increase  
future operational costs and have a 
negative impact on financial results if there 
is no related depreciation of the local 
currency against the US Dollar, or an 
increase in LBMA gold and silver fixings.
As part of the budgeting process, the Group estimates  
possible inflation levels and incorporates them into cost planning. 
The recent devaluation of the Russian Rouble, which is likely to 
result in increased inflation levels, has been factored in when 
preparing budgets and projections for subsequent years.

66 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 67 Corporate Governance
Dear Shareholders
This has been another difficult year for the industry, but Polymetal fared 
much better than many of its peers. Our long-term, through-the-cycle 
commitment to capital discipline was re-emphasised during 2014, when 
increased free cash flow generation enabled us to pay another special 
dividend whilst retaining the ability to re-finance debt with a comfortable 
leverage level. Prioritising shareholder returns and going beyond  
the minimum prescribed by our dividend policy in this way gives  
us a distinct competitive advantage over our peers. The Board of 
Directors of Polymetal believes that the acquisition of the Kyzyl project 
in Kazakhstan represents an excellent opportunity to expand the 
Company’s existing reserve base through the addition of high grade 
gold deposits with an expected long mine life and significant exploration 
upside. This acquisition received full support at the General Meeting 
and is a long-term project that will generate substantial value for our 
shareholders. The estimated capital expenditure for Kyzyl is at the 
bottom of the guidance range and is not expected to impair either  
our balance sheet strength or our ability to sustain dividends.
The Board attaches great importance to maintaining good relationships 
and an ongoing dialogue with all shareholders to keep them informed  
of significant Company developments. The Company continued its 
programme of communication with institutional investors and analysts 
throughout 2014 with regular presentations and webcasts, helping 
them to gain a better understanding of Polymetal, its operations and 
strategy as well as opportunities to meet the senior management team.
In July, we welcomed Christine Coignard to the Polymetal Board  
as Senior Independent non-executive Director. Her 25 years’ 
experience in global banking and advisory services, with particular  
skills in corporate finance and investment banking, is already proving  
a valuable asset to the Board. Her presence increases the 
representation of women on the Board to 22%, reinforcing  
our policy to promote and encourage women across the business.
Providing effective and strategic leadership is vital to the continuing 
success of the business and in the best interests of its stakeholders. 
We are mindful of the need for a meticulous approach to succession 
planning in order to achieve this.
As part of our commitment to clear and accountable reporting practices, 
we have adopted the most recent version of the Global Reporting 
Initiative sustainability reporting guidelines for our recently published 
Sustainability Report 2013/14. Compliance with the new G4 framework, 
which has as its main focus ‘materiality’ – those issues that matter most 
to our business and our stakeholders – does not become mandatory until 
the end of 2015, so we are making this transition ahead of schedule.
As the Company evolves and grows, so too does the need for good 
corporate governance. As a Board, we uphold the principles of 
continuous improvement and the regular evaluation of our performance 
to ensure that we govern effectively. In so doing, we emphasise our 
commitment to all our stakeholders by ensuring that the highest 
standards of ethical and responsible behaviour underpin how Polymetal 
runs its business.
Bobby Godsell
Chairman
Statement of compliance with the  
UK Corporate Governance Code
The Directors are committed to maintaining high standards of corporate 
governance. As a premium UK listed company, during the year ended 
31 December 2014 Polymetal International was required to comply with 
the UK Code of Corporate Governance (the UK Code) published in 
September 2012 and available through the UK Financial Reporting 
Council’s website or, where the provisions of the UK Code have not  
been complied with, to provide appropriate explanations. During 2014,  
the Company was in compliance with all provisions of the code with  
the exception of the six week period from 21 May to 1 July 2014. 
Following the departure of Charles Balfour and until the appointment  
of Christine Coignard, there were three independent Directors out of  
a total of seven Board members and in addition, the Audit and Risk and 
Remuneration Committees comprised two independent non-executive 
Directors (noting that there were no meetings of either Committee during 
this six week period). The Code states that at least half of the Directors 
(excluding the Chairman) should be independent (provision B.1.2) and  
that the Audit and the Remuneration Committees should comprise at 
least three independent non-executive Directors (provisions C.3.1 and 
D.2.1 respectively).
As well as complying with the UK Code, the Company has complied 
with all applicable regulations of the Moscow Stock Exchange and 
Russian securities laws since admission of its shares to secondary 
trading on the Moscow Exchange.
Role and structure of the Board
The Company’s Board comprises one executive Director, the non-
executive Chairman and seven non-executive Directors. Excluding the 
Chairman, four members of the Board are independent non-executive 
Directors. Refer to the schedule below for the structure of the Board 
and its Committees, showing the status of each Director.
The independent non-executive Directors are those determined by the 
Board to be independent in character and judgement and to be free  
from relationships or circumstances which may affect, or could appear  
to affect, the Director’s judgement. The role of the independent Directors 
on the Board is to challenge the strategy and scrutinise the performance  
of management in meeting agreed goals and objectives, to monitor  
the reporting of performance of the Company, to review the integrity  
of financial information, and ensure that the Company’s internal financial 
controls and system of risk management are robust and defensible.  
They are responsible for determining the appropriate level of 
remuneration for the Group CEO and have a primary role in  
appointing and, when necessary, removing him.
Directors’ interests are disclosed in annual declarations and the 
Company Secretary is notified promptly of any changes to those 
interests. Before each Board meeting, independent non-executive 
Directors reconfirm their independence and all Directors disclose 
whether they hold any interests in any matters to be reviewed  
at the Board meeting.
The significant shareholders of the Company are represented on  
the Board by Mr Yanakov (who is a representative of Powerboom 
Investments Limited); Ms Grönberg (who is a representative of 
Vitalbond Limited, A&NN and Capital Management Fund Limited) and 
Mr Duvieusart (who is a representative of PPF Group). Mr Nesis is the 
brother of the beneficial owner of Powerboom Investments Limited.  
Save for the potential conflicts inherent in these relationships, there  
are no potential conflicts of interest between the duties owed by the 
Directors or senior management to the Company and their private 
interests or other duties.
The Board has determined Charles Balfour (until his resignation  
in May 2014), Christine Coignard (from her appointment in July 2014), 
Jonathan Best, Russell Skirrow and Leonard Homeniuk to be 
independent non-executive Directors. Bobby Godsell met the 
independence criteria on appointment. 
Jonathan Best has been on the Board of the Company since 
September 2011 and on the Board of JSC Polymetal since December 
2006, and his reappointment is subject to particularly rigorous review.
The Board believes that Mr Best continues to display all of the qualities of 
independence pursuant to the criteria set out in the Code. From October 
2014 Mr Homeniuk no longer holds any shares, and since December 
2014 is no longer Executive Chairman and CEO of Polygon Gold Inc. 
(Polygon), in which Polymetal holds a 42.6% equity ownership and one  
of the three board seats. Polymetal’s interest in Polygon, with a carrying 
value of US$2 million, is not material. Accordingly, the Board continues  
to consider that Mr Homeniuk was independent throughout 2014 and 
continues to be an independent non-executive Director.
The Company considers that the Board and its Committees have the 
appropriate balance of skills, experience, independence and knowledge 
of the Company to enable them to discharge their respective duties and 
responsibilities effectively. All Directors have access to the advice and 
services of the Company Secretary, and are able to take independent
professional advice, if necessary, at the Company’s expense.
Charles Balfour did not offer himself for re-election at the AGM of  
the Company held on 21 May 2014 and retired as a Director at the 
conclusion of the AGM in order to pursue other opportunities. Further  
to a rigorous executive search led by Spencer Stuart, an international 
search firm with no other connection with the Company, Christine 
Coignard was appointed to the Board effective 1 July 2014 as an 
independent non-executive Director. Ms Coignard has also been 
appointed as a member of the Audit and Risk, Nomination and 
Remuneration Committees of the Board and as Senior Independent 
non-executive Director.
Board meetings
In 2014, the Board met ten times. Further business was approved by 
written resolution on one further occasion and by a committee of the 
Board on four occasions.
Role of the Board
The Board is responsible for:
•	 defining the commercial strategy and long-term objectives  
of the Group;
•	 approving annual operating and capital expenditure budgets and any 
material changes to them;
•	 overseeing the Group’s operations, ensuring competent and prudent 
management, sound planning, a strong system of internal control, 
and compliance with all statutory and regulatory obligations;
•	 reviewing the performance of the Group in the light of its business 
strategy, objectives, business plans and budgets and ensuring that 
any necessary corrective action is taken;
•	 approving any material extension of the Group’s activities into new 
businesses or geographic areas and any decision to cease to 
operate all or any material part of the Group’s business; and
•	 ensuring a mutual understanding of objectives and maintaining 
constructive dialogue with shareholders.
The schedule of matters reserved to the Board is reviewed  
at least annually.

Roles of the Chairman, Group Chief Executive Officer and  
Senior Independent Director
The Board has approved the division of responsibilities between the 
Chairman and the Group Chief Executive Officer (Group CEO) and  
the role of the Senior Independent Director (SID). The Chairman  
reports to the Board and is responsible for the leadership and overall 
effectiveness of the Board and for setting the Board’s agenda.  
His responsibilities include:
•	 effective running of the Board;
•	 ensuring there is appropriate delegation of authority from the Board 
to executive management;
•	 promoting a culture of openness and debate by facilitating the 
effective contribution of non-executive Directors in particular and 
ensuring constructive relations between executive and non-
executive Directors;
•	 encouraging active engagement by all members of the Board and 
ensuring that the Directors receive accurate, timely and clear 
information; and
•	 ensuring that the views of the shareholders are communicated to the 
Board as a whole.
Mr Godsell is able to commit sufficient time to his role as non-executive 
Chairman of Polymetal International and the Board believes that other 
commitments do not adversely affect his contribution to the Company. 
Mr Godsell’s other significant commitments are membership of the 
South African National Planning Commission, and a non-executive 
directorship in the South African Industrial Development Corporation. 
He is also Chairman of Business Leadership South Africa and Director  
of Platmin Limited.
Following certain administrative changes at the end of December 2014, 
the position of the Group CEO of Polymetal International plc Group of 
companies has been introduced and is held by Mr Nesis. The Group 
CEO is also serving as Executive Director of the Company and the role 
of Chief Executive Officer of Polymetal International plc as a separate 
entity no longer exists. However, these changes do not affect the Group 
CEO’s roles and responsibilities in managing the Group, which he 
continues to do in his capacity as an executive and/or director of Group 
subholding companies. The Group CEO reports to the Chairman and 
the Board directly and upholds the Group’s responsibilities to its 
shareholders, customers, employees and other stakeholders.
The Group CEO is responsible for the management of the Group and 
for developing the Group’s business strategy, objectives, budget and 
forecasts and, once approved by the Board, overseeing their successful 
Constructive use of the Annual General Meeting
The Board uses the Annual General Meeting (AGM) to communicate 
with investors and to encourage their participation. To ensure the 
Company’s shareholders have time to consider our Annual Report and 
Notice of AGM and lodge their proxy votes in good time, all meeting 
materials are made available more than 20 working days prior to  
the AGM. Separate resolutions are proposed on each substantially 
separate subject and all resolutions are put to a poll. The Company  
also offers shareholders the option to abstain.
Shareholders who are not able to attend the AGM are encouraged  
to submit proxy votes either electronically or in paper format. At the 
Company’s 2014 AGM we received votes representing approximately 
61% of our issued share capital. The results of the proxy vote are 
presented at the meeting, with the final results announced via the 
London Stock Exchange and available on the website.
In addition, our AGM provides a valuable opportunity for shareholders 
to meet with and put questions to the Directors in person. The 2014 
AGM was attended by all Directors, including the Chairmen of the Audit 
and Risk, Remuneration and Nomination Committees. Up to 2014, the 
Company’s AGMs held in Jersey, with live webcast and conference call 
facilities were available for shareholders unable to be present in person 
and recordings of the AGM webcast made available on the Company’s 
website. The 2015 AGM of the Company will be held in London to 
enable easier participation of shareholders in the meeting.
The primary means of communication with the majority of our 
shareholders who have not requested paper copies of our documentation 
is through our corporate website www.polymetalinternational.com.

implementation. The Board interacts with the executive management  
on a regular basis. Directors invite senior executives to attend relevant 
parts of the Board and Committee meetings for reporting on agenda 
items and participating in discussion. All members of executive 
management report directly to the Group CEO.
The Group CEO responsibilities include:
•	 developing and proposing Group strategy, including communicating 
annual plans and commercial objectives to the Board;
•	 upholding the Group’s responsibilities to its shareholders, customers, 
employees and other stakeholders;
•	 identifying and executing strategic opportunities;
•	 reviewing the operational performance and strategic direction  
of the Group;
•	 making recommendations on remuneration policies, executive 
remuneration and terms of employment for senior employees;
•	 ensuring the development needs of the executive Directors and 
senior management are identified and met and ensuring effective 
succession planning; and
•	 ensuring effective communication with shareholders and that 
appropriate, timely and accurate information is disclosed to the 
market, with issues escalated promptly to the executive management 
and the Board.
Senior Independent Director (SID)
Charles Balfour (up to 21 May 2014) acted as the Board’s SID. From 
1 July 2014, Christine Coignard was appointed as SID. Ms Coignard is 
available to major shareholders in order to listen to their views and help 
develop a balanced understanding of their issues and concerns. She 
also acts as an intermediary for the other Directors if necessary. In 
2014, Ms Coignard attended a series of one-on-one meetings with 
institutional shareholders and investors arranged as part of the 
Company’s roadshow, and the investor events organised by the 
Company’s brokers. The Board is regularly updated on shareholders’ 
opinions following meetings with the Directors and management.
Separate meetings are held between the non-executive Directors 
without the Chairman or the Group CEO being present and between 
non-executive Directors without the Chairman, led by the SID, to 
appraise his performance annually and on such other occasions as 
appropriate; and between the independent non-executive Directors 
without the other non-executive Directors being present. This includes 
both formal and informal meetings between Directors.
Nomination Committee
The Nomination Committee is chaired by Mr Godsell and its other 
members are Mr Homeniuk, Mr Balfour (up to 21 May 2014) and 
Ms Coignard (from 1 July 2014). The Committee has responsibility  
for making recommendations to the Board on the composition  
of the Board and its Committees, including appointments  
of additional and replacement Directors. The Committee:
•	 leads the process for Board appointments and makes 
recommendations to the Board;
•	 regularly reviews the Board structure, size and composition  
(including skills, knowledge, independence, experience and diversity) 
and makes recommendations to the Board about any changes that 
the Committee considers necessary;
•	 considers plans and makes recommendations to the Board for orderly 
succession to the Board and to senior management, so as to maintain 
an appropriate balance of skills and experience within the Company 
and on the Board and to ensure progressive refreshing of the Board, 
taking into account the challenges and opportunities facing 
the Company;
•	 keeps under review the leadership needs of the Group, both 
executive and non-executive, with a view to ensuring the continued 
ability of the Group to compete effectively in the marketplace;
•	 evaluates the balance of skills, knowledge, experience, 
independence and diversity of the Board before any appointment  
is made by the Board, and in the light of this evaluation prepares  
a description of the role and capabilities required for a particular 
appointment and the expected time commitment; and
•	 reviews the results of the Board’s performance evaluation process 
that relates to the composition of the Board and whether non-
executive Directors are spending enough time to discharge 
their duties.
Further to Mr Balfour not offering himself for re-election at the  
AGM held on 21 May 2014, the Company appointed Spencer Stuart  
as an international search firm to find a further independent non-
executive Director to replace Mr Balfour. Subsequently, Ms Coignard 
was appointed to the Board on 1 July 2014.
There were two meetings of the Nomination Committee in 2014.
At its meetings, the Committee continued discussing diversity and ways 
of helping to promote women in the Company. The Board welcomes 
diversity at all levels; it believes that the right way to approach diversity 
is not to introduce fixed quotas, but to seek the right qualities in every 
appointment, where competence comes first. Diversity becomes an 
additional advantage of such an approach and is in line with the 
Company’s objective of promoting women at all levels of the Group. 
Despite challenges presented by the industry the Company operates  
in, it takes steps to promote women, including hiring women in 
positions traditionally held by men.
In 2014, the proportion of women working in the Group was 22%. 
Women represent 22% of Board members; 22% of senior management 
positions; and 43% of qualified employees. The regular monitoring  
of compliance in terms of diversity policy is undertaken by the HR 
Department. No instances of discrimination towards employees  
of the Company have been revealed. All candidates and employees 
have equal opportunities regardless of gender, age, race, nationality, 
language, origin, wealth, residence, religion and other beliefs, social 
membership or other personal circumstances.

Corporate Governance
As part of the ongoing discussion in relation to succession planning 
arrangements the Committee and the other non-executive Directors 
continued meeting with young leaders and discussed ways of 
promoting talented employees and helping them to achieve their full 
potential. An executive development programme was adopted by the 
Committee, which includes mentoring and continuing education. In 
addition, the Company offers internship programmes in cooperation 
with key mining universities.
The Nomination Committee acknowledges that a deeper and more 
rigorous approach to succession planning is vital for the Company’s 
continuing success so that leadership is fully aligned to corporate 
strategy, both at Board and senior management levels.
Full terms of reference of the Nomination Committee are available  
at the Company’s website: www.polymetalinternational.com.
The Board considers that the composition of the Board and the 
Nomination Committee complies with the requirements of the UK Code.
Board evaluation
In 2014, the Board carried out a performance evaluation of itself, its 
Committees, the Chairman and the Group CEO. This was conducted 
without the assistance of an external facilitator. The first externally-
facilitated Board review had taken place in 2013 and was performed  
by Lintstock Ltd, an independent advisor with no other connection  
to the Company. In accordance with the UK Code, it is the Board’s 
intention that the evaluation process will be externally facilitated every 
three years.
Self-evaluation consisted of the Board discussing its composition  
and operational integrity; the balance of executive and non-executive 
Directors, independent Directors and Directors representing major 
shareholders; the balance of skills, experience, and knowledge  
of the Company; and international diversity. The number of Board and 
Committee meetings held was discussed as well as the performance  
of each Committee of the Board; it was agreed that the Board worked 
effectively together as a unit. The remuneration of Directors and senior 
management was also considered. For 2015 it is planned that each 
Director gives an assessment on their work as a Board member;  
and each member of a Committee will provide feedback on the work  
of the Committee and ways of improving. Information will be sent  
to the Chairman and chairmen of the respective Committees which  
will be followed by a discussion. Due to the recent appointment  
of Ms Coignard as Senior Indepedent non-executive Director, no 
performance evaluation of her work was made and Directors will 
provide their feedback on her for the first time in 2015/2016. Ways  
of improving the ongoing training of Directors were discussed and  
an enhanced training programme will be put in place in 2015 with 
assistance from external advisors.
The overall conclusion was that the Board and its Committees operated 
successfully and that Directors receive accurate, timely and clear 
information ensuring ongoing Board effectiveness. Each Director 
continues to contribute effectively and to demonstrate commitment  
to the role (including commitment of time for Board and Committee 
meetings and any other duties).
Re-election policies
In accordance with the UK Code, all Directors are subject to annual 
re-election.
Full terms and conditions of the appointment of non-executive Directors  
are available for inspection at the Company’s registered office.
The Directors’ biographical details are set out on pages 66 to 67  
and following their performance evaluations, the Board and Chairman 
consider that each of the Directors standing for re-election will continue 
to be an effective contributor to the Group’s success and demonstrate 
commitment to his or her role. A performance evaluation of the 
Chairman was conducted by the Board in 2014, and the Board believes 
that the Chairman continues to be effective and to demonstrate 
commitment to his role.
Induction
Upon appointment, Directors receive a full induction, including 
information about the Company; an outline of the role of a Director  
and a summary of his or her responsibilities and ongoing obligations 
under legislation, regulation and best practice; and a copy of the 
Memorandum on Inside Information, Insider Lists and Code of Practice 
on Dealing in Securities. Directors also receive the Company’s 
guidelines on matters reserved to the Board, terms of reference of the 
Board Committees and other governing documents of the Company. 
Directors and chairmen of the Board Committees regularly receive 
updates on changes to corporate governance and regulatory 
requirements and other changes affecting the Company. The Board  
is kept informed of relevant developments in the Company by way of 
monthly management reports, including comprehensive information  
on operating and financial performance and the progress of capital 
projects. A field trip to Varvara and Kyzyl for non-executive Directors 
took place in August 2014.
Dear Shareholders
During 2014, the macroeconomic situation in Russia, geopolitical 
factors and the sustained weakness of commodities prices all 
contributed to the Committee’s ever greater focus on risks. And, more 
importantly, ensuring that the Company’s risk management process 
minimises its exposure to these circumstances.
As new regulations emerge, we have concentrated on the principal  
risks and adequacy of internal controls, in particular those relating to 
financial, tax and market risk. The quality of both financial reporting and 
internal controls has increased this year. The Audit and Risk Committee 
and the Board as a whole are satisfied with the continuous 
improvement made by the finance team.
Since July 2014, the Committee has been further strengthened by 
Christine Coignard’s membership. Her extensive international finance 
and banking experience add significantly to our skill base and will be 
invaluable for the future.
The Audit and Risk Committee is a fully independent body, consisting 
only of independent non-executive Directors with relevant skills and 
experience in financial reporting and risk management.
In 2014 five meetings of the Audit and Risk Committee were held and 
further business conducted by the Committee was approved by written 
resolution on one additional occasion.
The Audit and Risk Committee dealt with the following matters:
•	 reviewed and recommended for approval financial and risk 
information included in the Annual Report 2013;
•	 reviewed and recommended for approval Polymetal’s results  
for the six months to 30 June 2014;
•	 discussed and approved the Committee work plan;
•	 supervised compliance with the Company’s anti-bribery  
and corruption policy;
•	 reviewed the Group’s internal audit plan and monitored the 
effectiveness of internal audit;
•	 reviewed the Group’s external audit plan and recommended for 
approval the interim and year end audit fees;
•	 reviewed the actual audit fee in 2014 compared to the 
authorised amount;
•	 approved the terms of engagement, including the engagement letter 
issued at the start of each audit and the scope of the audit;
•	 reviewed the independence and effectiveness of the external auditor; 
reviewed non-audit work performed by the auditors;
•	 recommended the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as external auditor;
•	 reviewed the critical risks and exposures of the Group, including 
significant judgements, impairments and tax risks;
•	 reviewed the capability of the Group’s finance team;
•	 performed an internal assessment of the Committee’s  
effectiveness; and
•	 reviewed corporate governance changes and planned for continued 
compliance in 2015.
In line with the Company’s overall approach to governance, we have 
instilled a strong culture of discipline throughout our business, and are 
confident that we have strong systems and processes which enable the 
Committee to operate effectively.
The Committee remains fully focused on the quality of the reporting, 
internal control and risk management processes in order to ensure the 
transparency and objectivity of the Company’s financial statements.

Audit and Risk Committee
The Audit and Risk Committee is chaired by Mr Best and its other 
members are Mr Skirrow and Mr Balfour (up to 21 May 2014) and 
Ms Coignard (from 1 July 2014), all independent non-executive 
Directors. The Directors consider that Mr Best has recent and  
relevant financial experience (refer to page 67 for details of Mr Best’s 
experience). In addition, the other members of the Committee have  
a wide range of financial and other relevant experience.
The responsibilities of the Audit and Risk Committee comprise:
•	 monitoring the integrity of the Group’s consolidated financial 
statements and reviewing its annual and interim financial statements, 
including, but not limited to the consistency of, and any changes to, 
accounting and treasury policies across the Company and the 
Group; the methods used to account for significant or unusual 
transactions; the reasonableness of significant estimates and 
judgements, taking into account the views of the external auditor; 
and the clarity and completeness of disclosure in the consolidated 
financial statements;
•	 considering and making recommendations to the Board, to be put to 
shareholders to consider at the AGM, in relation to the appointment, 
re-appointment, resignation or removal of the Group’s 
external auditor;
•	 overseeing the Group’s relationship with its external auditor and 
reviewing the effectiveness of the external audit process, taking  
into account relevant UK professional and regulatory requirements;  
the Committee meets with the external auditor at least once a year, 
without management being present, to discuss their remit and any 
issues arising from the audit;
•	 reviewing the independence and objectivity of the external auditor 
and the appropriateness of the provision of any non-audit services  
by the external auditor, taking into account relevant ethical guidance;
•	 reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s system of internal controls 
and risk management systems;
•	 monitoring and reviewing the effectiveness of the Group’s  
internal audit function in the context of the Group’s overall risk 
management system;
•	 reviewing the Group’s policies and procedures for preventing and 
detecting fraud, the systems and controls in place for preventing 
bribery, and its policies for ensuring that the Group complies with 
relevant regulatory and legal requirements; and
•	 approving significant transactions.
Full terms of reference of the Audit and Risk Committee are available  
at the Company’s website: www.polymetalinternational.com.
Ultimate responsibility for reviewing and approving the interim and 
annual financial statements remains with the Board. The Committee 
gives due consideration to applicable laws and regulations, the 
provisions of the UK Code and the requirements of the Listing Rules.
The Audit and Risk Committee monitors the Company’s relationship 
with its external auditor relating to the provision of non-audit services  
to ensure that auditor objectivity and independence are safeguarded. 
This is achieved by disclosure of the extent and nature of non-audit 
services (see Note 14 to the consolidated financial statements) and  
the prohibition against selected services being provided by the 
external auditor.
The policy governing the provision of non-audit services by the external 
auditor approved by the Committee defines permitted audit and 
non-audit services.
Pre-approval thresholds are in place for the provision of non-audit 
services by the external auditor, being: pre-approval by the CFO  
(if below US$5,000); by the Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee  
(if between US$5,000 and US$20,000); or by the Audit and Risk 
Committee (if above US$20,000).
Above a certain threshold, if it is determined that the external auditor 
has no obvious competitive advantage in the performance of proposed 
non-audit services, then the provider of those services must be chosen 
by way of a competitive tender. Certain types of non-audit work may  
be undertaken by the auditor without prior referral to the Audit and  
Risk Committee up to a cumulative annual value of US$100,000.  
Any further non-audit work is subject to approval by the Audit and  
Risk Committee in further tranches of US$100,000. In the event  
that the cumulative value of non-audit fees exceeds US$500,000  
in any given year, separate approval of the Audit and Risk Committee  
is required explaining why there is no threat to independence.  
A copy of the policy is available on the Company’s website: 
www.polymetalinternational.com.
The Audit and Risk Committee has considered information pertaining to 
the balance between fees for audit and non-audit work for the Group in 
2014 and concluded that the nature and extent of non-audit services 
provided do not present a threat to the external auditor’s objectivity or 
independence. The significant amount of other non-audit fees in 2014 
of US$579,000 is represented by the assurance services in respect of 
the Class 1 Circular for the Kyzyl acquisition. It is impracticable for these 
to be performed by an outside firm due to their nature and are they  
not considered to be a threat to the external auditor’s objectivity 
or independence.
Review of the effectiveness of the external  
audit process and audit quality
The Audit and Risk Committee has adopted a formal framework in its 
review of the effectiveness of the external audit process and audit 
quality which includes the following areas:
•	 the audit partners, with particular focus on the lead audit 
engagement partner; in 2015 the existing audit partner of the 
Company has been rotated and the Committee performed an 
interview of the new partner;
•	 the audit team;
•	 planning and scope of the audit and identification of areas  
of audit risk;
•	 execution of the audit;
•	 the role of management in an effective audit process;
•	 communications by the auditor with the Audit and Risk  
Committee, and how the auditor supports the work of the  
Audit and Risk Committee;
•	 how the audit contributes insights and adds value;
•	 the independence and objectivity of the audit firm and the quality  
of the formal audit report to shareholders.
An auditor assessment tool is completed each year by each member  
of the Audit and Risk Committee and by the CFO. Feedback is also 
sought from the Group CEO, other members of the finance team, 
divisional management and the head of internal audit.
The assessment tool adopted is comprehensive and includes detailed 
questions which are completed by way of a formal questionnaire  
every three years, with the key areas being performed every year.  
The feedback from this process is considered by the Audit and Risk 
Committee and is provided both to the auditor and to management. 
Action plans arising are also reviewed by the Committee.
The effectiveness of management in the external audit process is 
assessed principally in relation to the timely identification and resolution 
of areas of accounting judgement, the quality and timeliness of papers 
analysing those judgements, management’s approach to the value of 
independent audit, the booking of audit adjustments arising (if any) and 
the timely provision of draft public documents for review by the auditor  
and the Audit and Risk Committee.
Every three years, the Audit and Risk Committee requests that a partner 
independent of the audit engagement team discusses the quality of the 
external audit process with the Audit and Risk Committee Chairman and 
the CFO using this evaluation framework.
During this year, the Audit and Risk Committee’s focus was on:
•	 evaluating the recoverability of goodwill and PPE. The Committee 
examined the potential indicators of impairment (or impairment 
reversal, where appropriate) for each of the cash-generating units 
and the life-of-mine financial models used for assessing the fair value 
less costs to sell of the individual CGUs tested for impairment. The 
Committee examined and challenged the commodity price, discount 
rate and exchange rate assumptions used by management in its 
impairment tests;
•	 evaluating the existence and recoverability of metal inventories.  
The Committee examined the price assumptions used by 
management as well as unit costs and other internal assumptions 
used in determining the net realisable value of unfinished goods 
within metal inventories (ore and concentrate stockpiles);
•	 evaluating the recoverability of exploration and development assets. 
The Committee evaluated management’s approach to determine 
whether the existing exploration and development assets are likely  
to generate future economic benefits and whether any indicators  
of impairment had been identified;
•	 accounting and valuation of the Kyzyl acquisition. The Committee 
examined the purchase price allocation prepared by management, 
including the valuation of the deferred contingent consideration and 
seller put option, as well as key assumptions used in the valuation  
of these elements;
•	 the impact of sanctions on the Company’s performance and its 
access to external funding; 
•	 internal controls and the risk of misstatement: the Committee 
reviewed reporting from internal audit in respect of its audit plan  
and discussed all significant findings; and
•	 the Committee also evaluated the accounting policies adopted 
by management.
The Chairman of the Audit and Risk Committee makes himself available 
to major institutional shareholders annually to discuss the Company’s 
annual reporting to shareholders as part of the Company’s investor day.  
He is also available for one-on-one meetings with key shareholders  
at their request.
The re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as the Group’s external auditor is 
reviewed annually by the Audit and Risk Committee. Deloitte LLP was 
appointed auditor in 2011, with Deloitte CIS having been auditor of  
JSC Polymetal since the last tendering process in 2007. The Group  
has a policy of tendering the external audit at least every ten years.  
The Committee’s assessment of the external auditor’s performance and 
independence underpins its recommendation to the Board to propose 
to shareholders the re-appointment of Deloitte LLP as auditor until the 
conclusion of the AGM in 2016. Resolutions to authorise the Board to 
re-appoint and determine the auditor’s remuneration will be proposed 
at the AGM on 20 May 2015.
The Board considers that the Audit and Risk Committee complies  
with the requirements of the UK Code.
Internal control and risk management
The Company aims to ensure that all its activities are adequately 
controlled, to mitigate risk and support the achievement of its objectives, 
while avoiding the creation of excessive bureaucracy. The system of 
internal controls is designed to manage rather than completely eliminate 
risk, to achieve the Company’s business objectives whilst bringing 
residual risk to an acceptable level, and can only provide reasonable  
and not absolute assurance against material misstatement or loss.
In conducting its annual review of the effectiveness of risk management 
and internal control (including financial, operating and compliance 
controls), the Board considers the key findings from the ongoing 
monitoring and reporting processes, management assertions and 
independent assurance reports.
The Board also takes account of material changes and trends  
in the risk profile and considers whether the control system, including 
reporting, adequately supports the Board in achieving its risk 
management objectives.
During the course of the year, the Board considered the Group’s 
responsiveness to changes within its business environment. The Board 
is satisfied that there is an ongoing process, which has been operational 
during the year, and up to the date of approval of the Annual Report,  
for identifying, evaluating and managing the significant risks faced by 
the Group.
Internal audit
The internal audit function supports this aim by providing the Directors, 
through the Audit and Risk Committee, with an objective evaluation of 
the Company’s and the Group’s governance framework. The internal 
audit function also aims to raise levels of understanding and awareness 
of risk and control throughout the Group.
The head of internal audit reports to the Group CEO and, through the 
Audit and Risk Committee, to the Board of Directors. Where relevant, 
the internal audit function will additionally report its findings to members 
of the Company’s executive management.
The internal audit function’s annual work plan is designed to focus  
on matters arising from the operational risk matrix and is approved by 
the Audit and Risk Committee in advance. The internal audit function 
uses an annual self-certification process, which requires managers 
throughout the Group to personally confirm the testing of internal 
controls and compliance with Group policies within their business  
or function and the steps taken to address actual or potential issues 
that are identified.
Management provides a timely response to issues raised by internal 
audit. Where possible, the issues are resolved within one 
reporting period.

Internal control framework and activities
The management structure of the Group and internal policies and 
procedures are aimed at maintaining a robust control framework within 
the Group which will result in the achievement of strategic objectives 
within the set risk tolerance levels.
This framework includes:
•	 an appropriate tone set from the top (Board level), aimed at building 
the appropriate control environment;
•	 a proper risk identification and management system (for more detail 
please refer to pages 60-61);
•	 a strict division of responsibilities and adequate delegation 
of authority;
•	 specific control activities implemented at all levels of the Group; and
•	 a periodic review of the effectiveness of internal controls.
The governance framework reflects the specific structure and 
management of the Group, where authority and control are delegated 
by the Board to different levels, from the Group CEO to the managers  
of the Group’s operating entities and then downward to business and 
project managers as appropriate.
Within this framework, authority is delegated within clearly prescribed 
limits and decisions are escalated where either project size or risk 
profile require a higher level of authority. In addition to controls operating 
in specific areas (production, exploration, construction, procurement), 
the control framework also includes a set of common procedures for 
financial accounting, reporting and budgeting – see details below.
The Board confirms that the actions it considers necessary have been 
or are being taken to remedy any failings or weaknesses in the Group’s 
system of internal controls. This has involved considering the matters 
reported to it and developing plans and programmes that it considers 
are reasonable in the circumstances. Based on the results of the review 
of risk management and internal control activities undertaken by the 
Board and the Audit and Risk Committee, the Board considers that the 
risk management and internal control systems are in accordance with 
the Revised Guidance for Directors on the UK Code.
Financial reporting systems
The quality of financial accounting and reporting is ensured through  
a set of control procedures in the following areas: accounting 
methodology, preliminary review of new transactions, documentation, 
accounting techniques and financial closing procedures.
Accounting policies are developed centrally for each of the Group’s 
subsidiaries and are adapted for the peculiarities of each entity and 
Group-wide policies. Employees responsible for accounting and 
reporting functions have powers to review upcoming transactions and 
propose adjustments, where necessary, to ensure proper accounting 
and tax treatments. The use of a centralised Enterprise resource 
planning (ERP) system in each of the Group companies ensures 
unification of the business and accounting processes. The Group 
implements a multi-level set of controls over financial and accounting 
data recorded in the system. These controls involve the accounting 
department of each subsidiary, senior management of the subsidiary 
and controls at the relevant headquarters level. In addition, the 
accounting and reporting data are regularly audited by internal  
and external auditors.
Procedures for approval of capital and  
current expenditures
The Company prepares annual operating and capital expenditure 
budgets based on its current and strategic goals and objectives. 
In addition to periodic control of actual versus budgeted financial 
performance, a procedure of ongoing control and authorisation of 
expenses is in place. The current system of pre-approval of significant 
transactions, along with accounting procedures in the ERP system, 
achieves a level of control over the amount and appropriateness 
of expenses.
Treasury operations
The Group operates a centralised treasury function, which is 
responsible for payments on behalf of all subsidiaries of the Group.  
Use of such a centralised system achieves the best level of control over 
the payments function without compromising the speed and reliability 
of payments. All transactions with banks on accounts maintenance, 
deposits and borrowings and foreign currency transactions are also 
performed at relevant headquarters level in compliance with the 
treasury policy approved by the Board.
Controls over IT systems used in financial  
accounting and reporting
The Group uses a 1C: Enterprise 8 ERP system for the automation  
of everyday enterprise activities. These include various business tasks 
of the economic and management functions, such as management 
accounting, business accounting, HR management, supplier 
relationship management (SRM) and material requirements planning 
(MRP). Polymetal also uses the ERP system for budgeting, accounting, 
HR record-keeping and payroll, supply chain management, operational 
reporting and procurement. The Group operates an IT management 
framework based on COBIT (Control Objectives for Information and 
Related Technology), which provides a complete set of high-level 
requirements to be considered for effective control of each IT process.
UK Bribery Act 2010
The Company and its Directors are committed to ensuring adherence 
to the highest legal and ethical standards. This must be reflected in 
every aspect of the way the Group operates. Bribery is a criminal 
offence in the countries in which the Group operates. Corrupt acts 
expose the Group and its employees to the risk of prosecution, fines 
and imprisonment, as well as endangering the Company’s reputation. 
The Group has a Code of Conduct in place, which refers to anti-bribery 
and corruption policy. The policy extends across all the Group’s 
business dealings in all countries and territories in which the Group 
operates and applies to all employees of the Group, as well as relevant 
business partners and other relevant individuals and entities.
The Board attaches the utmost importance to this policy and applies  
a ‘zero tolerance’ approach to acts of bribery and corruption by any of 
the Group’s employees or by business partners working on the Group’s 
behalf. The Policy prohibits the payment, offer or authorisation of bribes, 
the receipt or acceptance of a bribe, or the payment, offer or promise  
to pay any facilitating payments. Any breach of this policy is regarded  
as a serious matter by the Company and is likely to result in 
disciplinary action.
As part of its implementation of internal procedures to comply with  
the UK Bribery Act, the Group has a formalised whistle-blowing policy 
which describes processes in place for staff to communicate,  
in confidence, concerns about possible improprieties, unethical or 
illegal activities and ensures that arrangements are in place for the 
independent investigation of such matters.
The Company affirms that it has not denied any personnel access  
to the Audit and Risk Committee and that it has provided protection  
to whistle-blowers from adverse personnel action.
The Code of Conduct is available on the website. Copies of the 
anti-bribery and corruption policy and the whistle-blowing policy  
are available on request from the Company’s offices.
Remuneration report
Dear Shareholders
2014 continued to be a challenging year for all mining companies  
when highly volatile movements in commodity prices forced the sector 
to continue focusing on controlling costs, producing robust operating 
performance and maintaining capital discipline. At the beginning  
of 2014, the Remuneration Committee approved a salary increase  
to Mr Nesis and the senior management team to bring their salaries 
more in line with market practice. This was the first salary review since 
the IPO in November 2011. 
A significant Russian Rouble devaluation at the end of 2014 meant  
that the income of those employees, whose salaries are denominated  
in Russian Roubles, significantly decreased (when taking inflation  
into account).
To remain competitive and attract and keep the most suitable 
employees, in January 2015 the Remuneration Committee 
recommended to the Board a salary increase of 16.5% for all Group 
employees whose salaries are denominated in Roubles, including  
the Group CEO Vitaly Nesis. This increase was effective from 
1 February 2015.
Even allowing for the 16.5% increase, the salary of Mr Nesis (in US 
Dollar terms) decreased by 38% as at 1 February 2015 compared  
to 1 April 2014, when the annual salary increases were effective. 
2014 was the first year of implementation for our new Long-Term 
Investment Plan (LTIP) scheme. In addition, 50% of bonuses awarded 
to the Group CEO and the senior management team are deferred into 
shares in the Company. 
As a FTSE 250 company, whose shares are listed on the London Stock 
Exchange, we believe that our shareholders rightfully expect Polymetal 
to comply with the strictest of corporate governance requirements. We 
remain committed to full adherence to all regulatory requirements and, 
as such, also reflect this in our remuneration policies and decisions. 
As a result, we consistently receive over 95% of votes in favour  
of AGM resolutions related to remuneration and to the reappointment  
of Directors. This unequivocal backing from shareholders in support  
of the Company’s decisions is very heartening as we strive to develop 
our remuneration policies in line with best practices, and align them  
with business strategy and performance.
Polymetal’s remuneration policy remains a key element in providing  
a clear framework to motivate, incentivise and retain our senior 
management team. As disclosed in the 2013 Annual Report, Polymetal 
fully complies with the new remuneration disclosure requirements and 
the Company’s remuneration policy and remuneration report were 
approved, with 99.8% of votes cast in favour, at the AGM held in 
May 2014. 
Going forward, we as a Committee will continue to ensure the 
alignment of Board and senior management remuneration with the 
Company’s strategic objectives, as well as maintaining full transparency 
to and open dialogue with our shareholders on executive pay. 
Remuneration philosophy
The focus on sustainable shareholder value creation is the cornerstone 
of our executive remuneration system. The Company’s remuneration 
policy is set to ensure that Directors are fairly rewarded with regard to 
the responsibilities undertaken, and considers comparable pay levels  
in the countries of operation and the international mining industry.  
The executive remuneration strategy, and underlying policy, supports 
this by enabling the Company to attract and retain talent that will 
maximise shareholder value. Corporate and individual performance  
is taken into account in setting the pay level for the Group CEO, and  
this is reviewed on an annual basis to ensure that it remains in line  
with companies of a similar nature, size and complexity.
An external benchmarking is undertaken every three years in order to 
ensure comparability with other gold mining companies worldwide and 
London-listed peers (such benchmarking was last performed in 2012). 
Remuneration levels for non-executive Directors are based on 
comparable levels for companies of a similar nature, size and 
complexity, and take into account specific responsibilities undertaken.
Context to the Committee’s decisions
In 2014, in addition to continued weakness in the commodities  
markets, we witnessed major macroeconomic and geopolitical issues  
in Russia and Kazakhstan. At Polymetal, we continued to concentrate 
on controlling costs, delivering robust operating performance and 
maintaining capital discipline. We have also been able to significantly 
expand the Company’s reserves and life-of-mine by acquiring the Kyzyl 
project in Kazakhstan. However, despite resilient operating and cost 
performance, the financial results of the Company in 2014 continued  
to be affected by the market conditions. Our net profit decreased  
on the back of significant decline in commodities prices, however we 
were able to sustain free cash flow as a result of decreases in capital 
expenditure and production growth and, as a result, pay regular  
and special dividends.

76 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 77 Remuneration report
Another challenge was to stay on top of the changing remuneration 
disclosure requirements and ensure that all procedures put in place are 
fully compliant with the applicable regulations and best practices. These 
priorities are reflected in our remuneration decisions when awarding 
performance bonuses to the Group CEO and senior employees and 
reviewing their base salaries.
Key Committee decisions
•	 In 2014 the Remuneration Committee concentrated on implementing 
the Long-Term Incentive Plan (LTIP), which was supported by 99.8% 
of shareholders who voted on it. The plan includes a total shareholder 
return (TSR) underpin stipulating that no options will vest in the  
event that TSR for the period is negative. Other features include the 
mandatory deferral of 50% of annual bonuses for three years, to be 
paid in shares; clawback provisions; a one-year holding period for all 
LTIP and a substantial minimum shareholding requirement for the 
Company’s executives.
•	 Due to unfavourable market conditions, the Remuneration 
Committee decided that any significant changes to the existing 
approach to the remuneration of Directors and senior officers of the 
Company in 2014 would be inappropriate.
•	 The Committee approved the increase in the Rouble-denominated 
Group Chief Executive Officer’s base salary for 2014 by 8% from 
1 April 2014 (there was no increase in 2013 versus 2012 and 2011), 
which partially compensates for the more significant depreciation of 
the Rouble against the US Dollar (14%) and inflation. The US Dollar 
equivalent of the Chief Executive Officer’s base salary decreased  
by 5%.
•	 Due to the rapid devaluation of the Rouble in Q4 2014, there was  
a further salary review for all employees who were paid in Roubles, 
resulting in a further 16.5% increase in Rouble terms for Group CEO 
pay effective from 1 February 2015. 
•	 An annual bonus representing 90% of the maximum available 
amount was awarded to the Chief Executive Officer in respect 
of 2014.
Changes during the year
Polymetal made no changes to its existing executive remuneration 
structure in 2014. The Company’s remuneration policy was approved  
by shareholders at the AGM 2014 and came into effect immediately 
after. It will continue to apply for the next three years, ending in May 2017 .
Approach to disclosure
This Report sets out the Company’s remuneration policy and 
implementation for its Directors and provides details of their 
remuneration and share interests for the year ended 31 December 
2014. The Board believes that for a Company whose shares are  
listed on the London Stock Exchange it is expected that the  
Directors’ remuneration policy and annual remuneration report of the 
Company should be approved by shareholders, and it is an element  
of good corporate governance for the Company to seek this.
As there were no changes to the Directors’ remuneration policy  
this year we will not be putting it to a binding shareholder vote.  
The Directors’ annual remuneration report will be put to an advisory 
shareholder vote at the Annual General Meeting of the Company  
on 20 May 2015.
On behalf of the Committee, I welcome feedback from shareholders 
and look forward to receiving your support at the AGM.

performance, the level of increases 
made across the Group as a whole, 
the remuneration of executives in 
similar positions in FTSE 250 and 
global mining peers, and individual 
performance when setting base salary 
for the following year.
Over the policy period, base salary for 
the Group Chief Executive Officer will 
be set at an appropriate level within 
the peer group and will increase in line 
with base salary increases for the 
wider workforce, except where a 
change in the scope of the role occurs.

Annual bonus
To focus on 
achieving annual 
performance goals, 
which are based  
on the Group’s key 
performance 
indicators (KPIs)  
and strategy.
The annual bonus result is determined 
by the Committee after the year end, 
based on performance against  
defined targets.
Annual bonuses are paid three months 
after the end of the financial year  
to which they relate.
50% of the annual bonus earned is 
paid in cash and the remaining 50%  
is compulsorily deferred into shares 
which are released annually to the 
employee over the next three years  
in equal instalments through the 
Deferred Share Awards plan (DSA).
Details of the DSA are set out on the 
next page.
Maximum bonus opportunity –  
150% of base salary.
Target bonus opportunity –  
100% of base salary.
Threshold – Nil annual bonus for 
threshold performance.
The annual bonus is earned on the 
basis of the achievement of a mix of 
financial and non-financial measures.
For 2014, performance metrics and 
associated weightings for each were:
•	 production (30%);
•	 total cash costs (30%);
•	 completion of new projects on time 
and within budget (30%); and
•	 health and safety (10%).
The Committee has discretion to vary 
the weighting of performance metrics 
over the life of this remuneration policy. 
In addition, the Committee has 
discretion to vary performance metrics 
part-way through a performance year  
if there is a significant event which 
causes the Committee to believe that 
the original performance conditions  
are no longer appropriate.
Performance is measured over the 
financial year.

Vesting is based on relative TSR, 
measured against the constituents of 
the FTSE Gold Mines Index, and also 
on the Company’s absolute TSR.
Peers are ranked and the Company’s 
position determines vesting:
•	 0% vests for below 
median performance;
•	 20% vests at median performance;
•	 100% vests at top decile 
performance and above; and
•	 no award will vest if absolute  
TSR is negative, regardless of 
relative performance.
The Committee may substitute, vary  
or waive the performance targets  
if an event occurs which causes the 
Committee to consider that the target 
is no longer appropriate.

Remuneration policy for other employees
The remuneration policy for the other members of the Company’s executive team and broader management team of the Group is consistent in 
both structure and KPIs with the policy in respect of the Group CEO. Whilst the value of remuneration will vary throughout the Group, depending 
upon the individual’s role, criticality to the business and level of seniority, the remuneration of all senior executives consists of a base salary, an 
annual bonus and participation in the new LTIP (the PSP and DSA). Employees up to three levels below the Board (approximately 300 employees 
throughout the Group) participate in the LTIP at the discretion of the Remuneration Committee. The PSP policy grant level is 150% of base  
salary for the Group CEO, 100% for Executive Committee members and 50-100% for employees of the level below the Executive Committee. 
Shareholding requirements are also set below Board level. The DSA operations mirror the arrangement set out for executive Directors in the policy 
table, where 50% of the annual bonus is compulsorily deferred into shares and released annually to employees over a period of three years.
Remuneration policy for the wider group of employees is aimed at aligning pay with the achievement of targeted results for each employee. The 
Company’s policy on fair pay provides for the payment of additional remuneration for employees living in difficult climatic locations and the delivery 
of appropriate levels of pay for different levels of work. The bonus component of remuneration for mid-level management and operational staff  
is measured based on the achievement of production targets, increasing output, the level of justified cost savings and health and safety records. 
In terms of pension arrangements, the Company applies a consistent approach for the Group CEO and other employees and adheres to the 
mandatory pension contributions required under applicable laws.
Salaries are considered for annual increases based on the Company’s performance results, inflation rates and the competitive level of salaries 
versus the wider market.
Notes to the policy table
Performance measures and targets
The Committee selected the performance conditions indicated in the policy table because they are central to the Company’s overall strategy,  
and are the key metrics used under the annual bonus and LTIP by the Group CEO to oversee the operation of the business.
Performance targets for all our incentive plans are reviewed annually, and where appropriate are typically set at a level that is in line with the 
Company’s forecasts.
Changes to remuneration policy for 2015
Design element Changes made during the year
Base salary
Rouble-denominated salaries increased for all employees by 16.5%, effective from 1 February 2015.  
Note that in US Dollar terms the Group CEO salary has decreased by 38% compared to 1 April 2014 
Annual bonus No changes made. 50% of bonus deferred into shares as required by the DSA
LTIP
First grants of options were made under the new PSP plan in April 2014. A new tranche of options  
is expected to be granted in April 2015 
Non-executive Directors No changes made
The new LTIP
Following shareholder approval at the AGM in June 2013, a new long-term incentive programme (the ‘Performance Share Plan’ or ‘PSP’) was  
put in place after the vesting of awards under the previous Long-Term EIP for those participants who have waived their rights under the EIP.  
Some minor amendments to the LTIP were approved by shareholders at the AGM in May 2014.
The key terms of the new LTIP are described in the policy table above.
The Board believes that the new LTIP ensures continued alignment of the executive team’s performance with shareholder interests and rewards 
superior long-term performance and the creation of sustainable shareholder value. The Board also believes that the LTIP is in line with UK best 
practice and follows fully the provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code and other relevant guidelines, while also containing features which 
are superior to common practice in the UK – such as a positive TSR underpin for vesting of the LTIP.
Illustration of application of remuneration policy
The composition and structure of the remuneration package for the Group CEO under three performance scenarios (Maximum performance, 
Target performance and Minimum performance) is set out in the charts below.
This chart shows that the proportion of remuneration delivered through short-term and long-term incentive schemes is in line with our remuneration 
policy and changes significantly across the three performance scenarios. As such, the package promotes the achievement of both short-term and 
long-term performance targets and drives the alignment of the Group CEO’s interests with the interests of shareholders.

Approach to recruitment remuneration
The Committee’s approach to recruitment remuneration is to pay a competitive overall package as appropriate to attract and motivate the right 
talent for the role. If an executive is promoted to the Board from within the Company, any pre-existing awards or benefits that were made available 
to him or her prior to becoming a Director (and not in anticipation of an imminent promotion to the Board) will be retained and allowed to vest  
or be provided under the original terms.
The following table sets out the various component, which would be considered for inclusion in the remuneration package for the appointment  
of an executive Director. Any new Director’s remuneration package would include the same elements, be set at a level consistent with the scope  
of the role (at a level not exceeding that of the Group CEO as set out in the remuneration policy table) and be subject to the same constraints  
as those of existing Directors performing similar roles, as shown below.
Area Policy and operation
Base salary  
and benefits
The base salary level will be set by taking into account the experience of the individual and the salaries paid  
in comparable companies.
Depending on the circumstances of any particular appointment, the Committee may choose to set the base salary  
below market median and increase the amount paid over a period of time to achieve alignment with market levels for  
the role (with reference to the experience and performance of the individual), subject to the Company’s ability to pay.
In line with the remuneration policy, as set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy table, no benefits will be provided  
to recruited Directors.
Pension Pension contributions will be limited to the mandatory contributions required by Russian or any other applicable law,  
as set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy table.
Annual bonus The executive Director will be eligible to participate in the annual bonus scheme as set out in the Directors’ remuneration 
policy table. The maximum annual opportunity is 150% of base salary.
50% of any bonus is deferred into shares under the DSA, as set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy table.
Long-term  
incentives
The executive Director will be eligible to participate in the LTIP at the Remuneration Committee’s discretion in line with the 
details set out in the Directors’ remuneration policy table. The maximum annual grant permitted under the scheme rules  
is 200% of base salary and the normal grant level is up to 150% of base salary. Performance measures would apply,  
as set out in the remuneration policy table.
Replacement  
awards
The Committee will seek to structure any replacement awards so that overall they are no more generous in terms of 
quantum or vesting period than the awards due to be forfeited as a consequence of the individual joining the Company.  
In determining the quantum and structure of any replacement awards, the Committee will seek to replicate the fair value 
and, as far as practicable, the timing, form and performance requirements of the forfeited remuneration. The maximum 
value of replacement awards is capped at 50% of the individual’s base salary, and at least 50% of any replacement award 
should be delivered in the Company’s shares.
Other Should relocation of a newly recruited executive Director be required, reasonable costs associated with this relocation will 
be met by the Company. Such relocation support may include, but not be limited to payment of legal fees, removal costs, 
temporary accommodation/hotel costs, a contribution to stamp duty, and replacement of non-transferrable household 
items. In addition, and in appropriate circumstances, the Committee may grant additional support in relation to the payment 
of school fees and the provision of tax advice.
The Company will reimburse the executive Director for all reasonable expenses which he/she may incur while carrying out 
executive duties.
Service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office
Loss of office policy
The Committee’s approach when considering payments in the event of termination is to take into account individual circumstances, including  
the reason for termination, contractual obligations of both parties and applicable share plan and pension scheme rules (including any relevant 
performance conditions).
Vitaly Nesis is an Executive Director and Group CEO of Polymetal International plc and CEO of JSC Polymetal, a 100% subsidiary of the Group 
incorporated in Russia. Further details are set out in the Current Directors’ service contracts section below.
The table below summarises the key elements of the executive Director service contracts and policy on payment for loss of office.
Area Policy and operation
Notice period Polymetal International JSC Polymetal
6 months from Company With immediate effect from Company
6 months from Director 1 month from Director
Compensation for 
loss of office in 
service contracts
No entitlement in respect of directorship of Polymetal International.
Up to three times average monthly salaries in respect of directorship of JSC Polymetal.
Treatment of annual 
bonus awards
Where an executive Director’s employment is terminated after the end of the performance year, but before the payment  
of the annual bonus is made, the executive may be eligible for an annual bonus award for that performance year subject to 
an assessment based on performance achieved over the period. No award will be made in the event of gross misconduct.
Where an executive Director’s employment is terminated during a performance year, a pro-rated annual bonus award for 
the period worked in that performance year may be payable, subject to an assessment based on performance achieved 
over the period.
Treatment of  
unvested Deferred 
Share Awards  
under plan rules
In normal circumstances, Deferred Share Awards will continue until the normal time of vesting upon cessation of 
employment in Good Leaver Circumstances. Alternatively, the Board may determine that Deferred Share Awards will vest 
immediately. In both circumstances there would be no pro-rating of the Deferred Share Awards for time from the award  
date until cessation of employment or for performance.
Treatment  
of unvested 
Performance  
Share Plan awards 
under plan rules
Any outstanding award will lapse at cessation of employment with the Group, unless the cessation is due to death, injury, 
ill-health, disability, redundancy, retirement, or any other circumstances which the Committee determines, when the award 
will vest as normal in accordance with the terms of the award.
Alternatively, the Committee may determine that a proportion of the award will vest immediately, with the proportion 
determined by the Committee, taking into account (where relevant) the extent to which the performance conditions have been 
met or are likely to be met at the end of the performance period, and any other factors the Committee may consider relevant.
The number of shares shall also normally be pro-rated down to reflect the reduced service period.
Exercise of  
discretion
Any discretion available in determining the treatment of incentives upon termination of employment is intended only to be 
relied upon to provide flexibility in unusual circumstances.
The Committee’s determination will take into account the particular circumstances of the Director’s departure and the 
recent performance of the Group.
Change of control In relation to Performance Share Plan awards in the event the Company’s shares cease to trade on the London Stock 
Exchange or any other recognised stock exchange (Delisting) or the Directors of the Company pass a resolution to the 
effect that Delisting is imminent or where the Board determines that a ‘significant event’ has occurred, which may be a 
demerger, winding up or compulsory acquisition of the Company, or any other event as determined by the Board, at the 
discretion of the Board and, where applicable, with the consent of the acquiring company, PSP Awards will not vest  
but will be exchanged for new PSP awards.
In the event that the PSP Awards are exchanged for new PSP awards:
•	 the award date of the new PSP award shall be deemed to be the same as the award date of the original PSP Award;
•	 the new PSP award will be in respect of shares in a company determined by the Board which may include any  
acquiring company;
•	 the new PSP award must be equivalent to the PSP Award and will vest at the same time and in the same manner  
as the PSP Award; and
•	 where relevant, either the vesting of the new PSP award must be subject to any performance conditions which are,  
so far as possible, equivalent to any conditions applying to the PSP Award, or no performance conditions will apply but 
the value of shares comprised in the new PSP award shall be the value of the number of shares which would have vested 
under the PSP Award if they had not been exchanged for new PSP awards.
Deferred Share Awards shall vest immediately and shall not be pro-rated for time or performance if any of the events 
referred to above occur.

Annual bonus targets and outcomes
The targets for annual bonus measures are considered commercially sensitive because of the information that their disclosure may provide to the 
Company’s competitors, given that these competitors are largely based outside of the UK and hence are not subject to the same reporting 
requirements as the Company. Performance against these targets is set out below:
Measures Weight Below Target Maximum
Achieving production budget 30% ●
Total cash cost per ounce of gold equivalent produced 30% ●
Completion of new projects on time and within budget 30% ●
Health and safety 10% ●
This resulted in the Group CEO receiving a bonus of 90% of maximum opportunity for the year (which constitutes 117% of his base salary or 
US$475,630).

Deferred Share Awards plan 
In accordance with the Company’s DSA, Mr Nesis received a conditional award of 22,178 shares. Shares are released annually over the next three 
years in equal instalments (March 2016, 2017 and 2018).
Performance Share Plan 
Under the PSP, a conditional award of 74,165 ordinary shares with no par value was made to Mr Nesis. It is exercisable following a four-year vesting 
period, subject to performance measures determined by Polymetal. For this award, vesting is based on relative TSR, measured against the 
constituents of the FTSE Gold Mines Index, and also on the Company’s absolute TSR. Peers are ranked and the Company’s position determines 
vesting (0% vests for below median performance; 20% vests at median performance; 100% vests at top decile performance and above).  
No award will vest if absolute TSR is negative, regardless of relative performance.
Scheme interests awarded during the financial year
No other share awards were made to the Group CEO in 2014. 10,027 shares will be allotted after the publication of the Annual report in April 2015.
Total pension entitlements (audited information)
Save for the Group’s defined contributions to the mandatory pension fund of the Russian Federation during the financial year ended  
31 December 2014, no amounts were set aside or accrued by the Group to provide pension, retirement or other benefits to the Directors and 
senior management.
Loss of office payments or payments to past Directors (audited information)
No loss of office payments or payments to past Directors were made in the year under review.
Directors’ shareholdings (audited information)
The Group CEO is required to retain a shareholding equal to five times his base salary, i.e. 180,463 shares.
For the purposes of determining whether the requirements have been met, share price is measured at the end of each financial year. Shares are 
valued for these purposes at the year-end price of £5.76 (US$8.95) per share at 31 December 2014 translated at the closing exchange rate of the 
British Pound to the Russian Rouble as at 31 December 2014.
Shares that count towards shareholding requirements include unfettered shares. The table below sets out the number of shares held, or potentially 
held, by Directors.

  An additional bonus was awarded by the Remuneration Committee to Mr Nesis for the successful IPO of the Company in November 2011. Mr Nesis was required to devote a significant amount 
of time above and beyond his normal day-to-day responsibilities as CEO to successfully bring about the IPO. Excluding the additional bonus, the annual bonus comprised 49% of maximum 
opportunity in 2011.
Percentage change in Group CEO’s remuneration
Excluding the value of long-term incentives, the percentage change in total remuneration for the Group CEO was a 16% decrease from 
US$1,081,572 in 2013 to US$907,790 in 2014 due to the significant devaluation of the Russian Rouble against the US Dollar. In Rouble terms the 
Group CEO total remuneration for 2014 increased by 1% compared to 2013. The average percentage change in total remuneration for all 
employees in the year was a 17% decrease mainly driven by the same factor.
To ensure the comparability of this figure, and to minimise distortions, the all-employee remuneration figure is on the basis of full-time 
permanent employees.

Implementation of remuneration policy in the following financial year
In 2015 the Committee intends to implement the executive and non-executive Director remuneration policies as follows:

 Base salary for 2015 is translated at the closing exchange rate of Rouble to US Dollar stated by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation as at 1 February 2015. Base salary for 2014 is 
translated at the average exchange rate of Rouble to US Dollar stated by the Central Bank of Russian Federation during 2014.
The Remuneration Committee decided to increase the base salary of the Group CEO in 2014 in Rouble terms for the first time since 2011, having 
taken into account inflation in the Russian Federation, as well as significant devaluation of the Russian Rouble against the US Dollar during the 
period. In January 2015, the Board approved the Remuneration Committee’s recommendation that a salary increase of 16.5% be paid to all Group 
employees, whose salaries are denominated in Roubles, including the Group CEO Vitaly Nesis. The US Dollar equivalent of his base salary has 
decreased by 38% compared to 2014 as a result of the significant Russian Rouble devaluation.
Pension and benefits
No pension or benefits plans are in place for 2015, except for the defined pension contributions to the mandatory pension fund of the 
Russian Federation.

Annual bonus
The targets for annual bonus measures are considered commercially sensitive, particularly in the gold mining industry, because of the sensitivity  
of information that their disclosure may provide to the Company’s competitors, given that these are largely based outside the UK and hence are not 
subject to the same reporting requirements as the Company.
Long-Term Incentive Plan (Deferred Share Awards Plan and Performance Share Plan)
Deferred Share Awards Plan
The Committee intends to defer annual bonus awards earned for the 2015 performance period in line with policy.
Performance Share Plan
The Committee intends to make an award under the PSP to the Group CEO in 2015, in line with the policy disclosed on pages 80-81.
Vesting is based on relative TSR measured against the constituents of the FTSE Gold Mines Index and on the Company’s absolute TSR.  
Peers are ranked and the Company’s position determines vesting:
TSR vs. FTSE Gold Mines Payout
Below threshold Below median performance 0%
Threshold Median performance 20%
Maximum Upper decile performance 100%
Straight-line vesting will occur between the points set out above. No award will vest for performance below median, or if the Company’s absolute 
TSR performance is negative, regardless of relative performance.
Non-executive Directors
The policy for determining non-executive Directors’ fees will be unchanged from 2014. Fee rates for 2014 and 2015 are set out below:
Role
2015 fees
(US$)
2014 fees
 (US$)

Note: Non-executive Director fees are denominated in British pounds sterling and for presentation purposes the figures are translated to US$ at cross-rates of the British Pound and the  
US Dollar to the Rouble stated by the Central Bank of the Russian Federation as at 31 December 2014.
Remuneration Committee
The Remuneration Committee comprises three independent non-executive Directors who have no personal financial interest, other than as  
a shareholder, in the matters to be decided. As a result of Mr Balfour’s decision not to offer himself for re-election as a Director, a replacement 
member of the Remuneration Committee was appointed following the AGM. From October 2014 Mr Homeniuk no longer holds equity and since 
December 2014 is no longer Executive Chairman and CEO at Polygon Gold Inc. (Polygon), in which Polymetal holds a 42.6% equity ownership  
and one of the three board seats.
The membership of the Remuneration Committee is shown in the table below.

Consideration by the Directors of matters relating to Directors’ remuneration
In 2014 the Remuneration Committee met three times. Further business conducted by the Committee was approved by written resolutions on one 
further occasion.
In 2014 the meetings of the Committee covered the following key areas:

of external consultants.
Statement of voting at AGM
At the 2014 AGM, held on 21 May, votes for the Remuneration report and Remuneration policy were as follows:
Votes for Votes against Withheld
Remuneration report 238,310,278 (99.79%) 494,526 (0.21%) 0
Remuneration policy 238,263,983 (99.77%) 540,821 (0.23%) 0
At this meeting, minor amendments to the Company’s long-term incentive plan were put to a vote, with 99.78% of shareholders in favour.
Advisors
The Committee continued to use PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP (PwC) as independent external remuneration consultants to provide support  
in relation to the design and operation of the new LTIP and on the changes associated with the new remuneration report regulations. PwC is a 
member of the Remuneration Consultants’ Group (RCG) and a signatory of the RCG Voluntary Code of Practice, and incorporates the principles  
of the Voluntary Code of Practice into its engagement. No other services were provided by PwC during 2014. Fees paid to PwC in relation to 
remuneration services provided to the Committee in 2014 totalled US$48,000 (2013: US$54,400), with fees quoted in advance and based  
on the level of complexity of the work undertaken. The Committee reviews the objectivity and independence of the advice it receives from  
PwC at a private meeting held on an annual basis.
During its work in 2014, the Committee was also aided by the Group CEO, and senior finance and human resources executives of the Company.
PwC’s appointment was made by way of a competitive tender, the results of which were presented to the Remuneration Committee for approval.

attributable to equity holders of the Company was US$210 million 
(2013: loss of US$198 million). Underlying net earnings (adjusted  
for the after-tax amount of impairment charges/reversals and foreign 
exchange losses) in 2014 were US$282 million (2013: US$179 million).  
In August 2014 the Company declared an interim dividend of  
US$0.08 per share which was paid in September 2014. The Directors 
have proposed the payment of a final dividend of US$0.13 per  
share (2013: US$0.08 per share). In addition, a special dividend  
of US$0.20 per share was declared by the Company in  
December 2014 and paid in January 2015.
Annual General Meeting
The AGM of shareholders of the Company will take place on  
20 May 2015 at 9.30 am (BST) at the offices of Freshfields Bruckhaus 
Deringer LLP, 65 Fleet Street, London EC4Y 1HS. 
Auditor
Each of the persons who is a Director at the date of approval of this 
Annual Report confirms that:
•	 so far as the Director is aware, there is no relevant audit information 
of which the Group’s auditor is unaware; and
•	 the Director has taken all steps that he or she ought to have taken 
as a Director in order to make himself or herself aware of any relevant 
audit information and to establish that the Group’s auditor is aware 
of that information.
Deloitte LLP has expressed its willingness to continue in office  
as auditor and a resolution to reappoint it will be proposed at the 
forthcoming AGM. The Audit and Risk Committee reviews both the  
level of the audit fee and the level and nature of non-audit fees as part 
of its review of the adequacy and objectivity of the audit process.
Having taken all matters considered by the Board and brought to the 
attention of the Board during the year into account, we are satisfied  
that the Annual Report, taken as a whole, is fair, balanced and 
understandable and provides the information necessary for shareholders 
to assess the Company’s performance, business model and strategy.

Directors’ report
The Directors submit the Annual Report of Polymetal International Plc 
together with the audited financial statements of Polymetal International 
Plc for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Corporate governance
Refer to pages 68 to 72 for a description of the Group’s corporate 
governance structure and policies.
Going concern
In assessing its going concern status, the Group has taken account  
of its financial position, anticipated future trading performance, its 
borrowings and other available credit facilities, its forecast compliance 
with covenants on those borrowings and its capital expenditure 
commitments and plans, including the potential exercise of the put 
option in respect of the Kyzyl transaction. As at 31 December 2014,  
the Group held US$157 million of cash and had net debt of 
US$1,249 million, with US$810 million of undrawn but committed 
facilities available subject to applicable covenants compliance. 
The Board is satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and projections, 
having taken account of reasonably possible changes in trading 
performance, show that the Group has adequate resources to continue 
in operational existence for at least the next 12 months from the date  
of this report and that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 
31 December 2014.
Financial and business reporting
The Board believes that the disclosures set out in the Strategic  
report on pages 1 to 65 of this Annual Report provide the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s performance, 
business model and strategy.
Directors
The Directors, their status and Board Committee memberships are set 
out on pages 66-67, 70 of the Report.
Appointment and replacement of Directors
The Board may appoint a person who is willing to act to be a Director, 
either to fill a vacancy or as an additional Director and in either case 
whether or not for a fixed term. Irrespective of the terms of his or her 
appointment, a Director so appointed shall hold office only until the  
next AGM. If not reappointed at such Annual General Meeting,  
he or she shall vacate office at its conclusion.
The Company may, by ordinary resolution, remove any Director from 
office (notwithstanding any provision of the Company’s Articles or of 
any agreement between the Company and such Director, but without 
prejudice to any claim he or she may have for damages for breach  
of any such agreement). No special notice needs to be given of any 
resolution to remove a Director and no Director proposed to be 
removed has any special right to protest against his or her removal.  
The Company may, by ordinary resolution, appoint another person  
in place of a Director removed from office.
Directors’ interests
Information on Directors’ interests in shares of the Company  
is set out in the Remuneration report on page 88.
Directors’ indemnities
To the extent permitted by the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991, the 
Company has indemnified every Director and other officer of the 
Company (other than any person (whether an officer or not) engaged  
by the Company as auditor) out of the assets of the Company against 
any liability incurred by him or her for negligence, default, breach  
of duty, breach of trust or otherwise in relation to the affairs of the 
Company. This provision does not affect any indemnity that  
a Director or officer is otherwise entitled to.
Political donations
The Company may not make a political donation to a political party  
or other political organisation, or to an independent election candidate, 
or incur any political expenditure, unless such donation or expenditure 
is authorised by an ordinary resolution of shareholders passed before 
the donation is made or the expenditure incurred. No such donations 
were made in 2014 (2013: none).
Capital structure
The structure of the Company’s share capital is detailed in Note 32 to 
the financial statements. There are no specific restrictions on the size  
of a holding or on the transfer of shares, which are both regulated by 
the Articles of the Company and applicable legislation. The Directors 
are not aware of any agreements between holders of the Company’s 
shares that may result in restrictions on the transfer of shares or on 
voting rights.
There are a number of agreements that take effect, alter or terminate 
upon a change of control of the Company, such as commercial 
contracts, bank loan agreements and employees’ share plans. None  
of these is considered to be significant in terms of their likely impact  
on the business of the Group as a whole. Furthermore, the Directors  
are not aware of any agreements between the Company and its 
Directors or employees that provide for compensation for loss  
of office or employment that occurs because of a takeover bid.
Substantial shareholdings in the Company are disclosed on page 158.
Details of employee option schemes are set out in the Remuneration 
report on pages 80 to 90.
There were no acquisitions of the Company’s own shares in 2014. 
At 31 December 2014, the Group and its subsidiaries held no treasury 
shares (31 December 2013: no shares). As at 31 December 2014, the 
Company had shareholders’ authority to purchase up to 38,947,286  
of its own ordinary shares.
The Articles of the Company can be altered by a special resolution  
of the Company. A resolution is a special resolution when it is passed 
by three-quarters of the members who (being entitled to do so) vote  
in person, or by proxy, at a General Meeting of the Company.
Pursuant to the Company’s Articles, the Directors have the power  
to allot Equity Securities (as defined in the Articles). At the AGM  
of the Company held in 2014, the power to allot Equity Securities was 
renewed up to an aggregate number of 129,824,288 ordinary shares, 
provided that the Directors’ power in respect of such an amount may 
only be used in connection with a pre-emptive issue (as defined  
in the Articles).

92 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 93 Independent auditor’s report to the members of Polymetal International plc Directors’ responsibility statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report and Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and regulations. 
Company law requires the Directors to prepare financial statements for each financial year. Under that law the Directors are required to prepare  
the Group financial statements in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as adopted for use in the European Union (IFRS). 
The financial statements are required by law to be properly prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. International 
Accounting Standard 1 requires that financial statements present fairly for each financial year the Group’s financial position, financial performance 
and cash flows. This requires the faithful representation of the effects of transactions, other events and conditions in accordance with the definitions 
and recognition criteria for assets, liabilities, income and expenses set out in the International Accounting Standards Board’s ‘Framework for the 
preparation and presentation of financial statements’.
In virtually all circumstances, a fair presentation will be achieved by compliance with all applicable IFRSs. However, the Directors are also required to:
•	 properly select and apply accounting policies;
•	 present information, including accounting policies, in a manner that provides relevant, reliable, comparable and understandable information;
•	 provide additional disclosures when compliance with the specific requirements in IFRSs are insufficient to enable users to understand the impact 
of particular transactions, other events and conditions on the entity’s financial position and financial performance; and 
•	 make an assessment of the Company’s ability to continue as a going concern.
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the financial position of the 
Company and enable them to ensure that the financial statements comply with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. They are also responsible for 
safeguarding the assets of the Company and hence for taking reasonable steps for the prevention and detection of fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity of the corporate and financial information included on the Company’s website. 
Legislation in the UK and Jersey governing the preparation and dissemination of financial statements may differ from legislation in other jurisdictions.
Responsibility statement 
We confirm that to the best of our knowledge:
•	 the financial statements, prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, give a true and fair view of the assets, 
liabilities, financial position and profit or loss of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole; and
•	 the management report, which is incorporated into the strategic report, includes a fair review of the development and performance of the 
business and the position of the company and the undertakings included in the consolidation taken as a whole, together with a description  
of the principal risks and uncertainties that they face.
By order of the Board
Bobby Godsell
Chairman of the Board of Directors

Opinion on consolidated financial statements of Polymetal International PLC
In our opinion the consolidated financial statements:
•	 give a true and fair view of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2014 and of the Group’s loss for the year then ended;
•	 have been properly prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as adopted by the  
European Union; and
•	 have been prepared in accordance with the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991.
The financial statements comprise the Consolidated Income Statement, Consolidated Statement of Comprehensive Income, Consolidated Balance 
Sheet, Consolidated Statement of Changes in Equity, Consolidated Statement of Cash flows and the related notes 1 to 36. The financial reporting 
framework that has been applied in their preparation is applicable law and IFRSs as adopted by the European Union.
Going concern
We have reviewed the directors’ statement on page 92 that the Group is a going concern. We confirm that:
•	 we have concluded that the directors’ use of the going concern basis of accounting in the preparation of the financial statements  
is appropriate; and
•	 we have not identified any material uncertainties that may cast significant doubt on the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.
However, because not all future events or conditions can be predicted, this statement is not a guarantee as to the Group’s ability to continue  
as a going concern.
Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
The assessed risks of material misstatement described below are those that had the greatest effect on our audit strategy, the allocation of 
resources in the audit and directing the efforts of the engagement team:
Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Recoverability of PP&E and Goodwill (notes 2, 3, 18 and 19)
As a consequence of the current volatility in gold and silver 
prices and foreign exchange rates, and political and economic 
uncertainties in Russia, the assessment of recoverability of 
PP&E (carried at US$2,021 million) and goodwill (carried at 
US$18 million) is a key judgment.
Management has assessed whether any indicators of 
impairment existed at its eight cash generating units (‘CGUs’) 
(as set out in Note 5). Where goodwill is allocated to that  
CGU (at Dukat and Mayskoye), management performs formal 
impairment testing as at 31 December 2014 to assess whether 
the recoverable amount of the CGU exceeds its net book value.
We challenged management’s assessments as to whether indicators  
of impairment (or impairment reversal) exist for the Group’s CGUs through 
critical assessment of developments in the wider economic environment and 
the performance of each of the CGUs in the year and through meetings with 
local and Group operational management.
We obtained copies of the valuation models used to determine the recoverable 
amount of CGUs and tested the arithmetical accuracy of the models.
We challenged the assumptions underpinning the models, including  
the discount rate used, expected metal prices, capital and operating expenditure 
forecasts, production profiles and foreign exchange rates. This was achieved by 
comparison to third party documentation, the review of reserves and resources 
reports, consultation with Deloitte specialists (to critically assess the discount 
rate applied) and discussions with operational management. We assessed 
whether assumptions had been determined and applied consistently across  
the Group.
Recoverability of Exploration and Development (E&D) assets (notes 2, 3, 18 and 19)
At 31 December 2014 the Group held US$1,076 million in 
respect of E&D expenditure on the Balance Sheet of which 
US$854 million related to the acquisition in September 2014  
of Altynalmas Gold Ltd. (‘Kyzyl’).
Recoverability is dependent on the expected future success of 
exploration activities. E&D expenditure is capitalised once it has 
been determined that the mineral property can be economically 
developed. The valuation assessment of each asset’s future 
prospects requires significant judgement.
Management undertook a detailed assessment of E&D assets 
for impairment, which included a review of developments in the 
year and planned further E&D expenditure including the 
expected timings for that spend.
We challenged management’s conclusions as to where impairment indicators 
existed and assessed the recoverability of assets by meeting with operational 
management to discuss material E&D assets, reviewing drilling and other 
testing results in the year and confirming future development plans. We 
reviewed Board-approved budgets for 2015/6 to check that specific 
exploration project spend was committed and we performed detailed  
testing to assess the validity of costs capitalised in the year.

Risk How the scope of our audit responded to the risk
Existence and valuation of metal inventories (notes 2, 3 and 23)
At 31 December 2014 the Group held US$381 million  
in respect of metal inventories on the Balance Sheet.
Management’s determination of the contained metal levels  
in ore stockpiles and work in progress involves the use of 
sampling techniques and theoretical models.
The assessment of the recoverability of metal inventories 
requires judgement both in terms of calculating expected costs 
to process and refine ore stock piles to produce concentrate  
or doré for sale, and in terms of estimating future prices to be 
realised on sale.
We tested the existence of metal inventories through attending inventory counts 
conducted by management’s experts at material operating locations and 
performing roll forward testing from the count dates through to year end by 
testing management’s metal inventory models.
We tested the recoverability of metal inventories through the recalculation of 
projected net realisable values based on expected commodity prices (which 
were consistent with prices used in the Group’s PP&E and goodwill impairment 
calculations) and costs to complete. We also performed a detailed analytical 
review of management’s inventory costing calculations.
We tested inventories for obsolescence by reviewing management’s strategic 
mine plans and assessing whether there is appropriate provisioning in place,  
in particular where stockpiles are no longer expected to be used.
Accounting for and valuation of Kyzyl consideration payable (notes 2, 3 and 4)
The acquisition was funded through four elements with a fair 
value total of US$676 million, comprising: cash consideration 
paid; issuance of 31 million new Polymetal International plc 
shares; a put option granted to allow the seller to divest its shares 
in Polymetal International plc back to the Group at a fixed price of 
US$9.57 per share and deferred contingent consideration based 
on future gold and Polymetal share prices. 
The determination of fair value of the put option and the 
deferred contingent consideration was complex and  
required the use of Black-Scholes and Monte Carlo  
valuation models, respectively.
Determining the key inputs to those models (gold and share 
prices; expected volatilities; the correlation between gold and 
Polymetal share prices and discount rates applied) required 
significant judgement.
We reviewed the acquisition agreement and agreed cash consideration paid to 
bank statements and new shares issued to the share register. We recalculated 
the valuation of shares granted, based on the spot price at the transaction date.
We challenged management’s key model inputs underpinning the put option 
valuation and contingent consideration liability valuations on completion (and,  
in the case of the contingent consideration, again at 31 December 2014) against 
third party sources and recalculated the fair value.
We involved Deloitte modelling specialists to assist with our challenge of the 
appropriateness of the model used to value the contingent consideration,  
to test the integrity of the model and to assist our challenge and testing of the 
key model input assumptions, agreeing assumptions to third party data.
We reviewed management’s accounting paper to assess that the  
accounting treatment in respect of assets acquired, the put option liability  
and corresponding debit to Equity, and the contingent consideration liability  
was in line with IFRS.
Last year our report included one other risk which is not included in our report this year: provisioning and disclosure in respect of income tax and 
mineral extraction tax liabilities (there have been no new material exposures identified in the current year).
The description of risks above should be read in conjunction with the significant issues considered by the Audit and Risk Committee discussed  
on page 75.
Our audit procedures relating to these matters were designed in the context of our audit of the financial statements as a whole, and not to express 
an opinion on individual accounts or disclosures. Our opinion on the financial statements is not modified with respect to any of the risks described 
above, and we do not express an opinion on these individual matters.
Our application of materiality
We define materiality as the magnitude of misstatement in the financial statements that makes it probable that the economic decisions of a 
reasonably knowledgeable person would be changed or influenced. We use materiality both in planning the scope of our audit work and in 
evaluating the results of our work.
We determined materiality for the Group to be US$18 million (2013: US$16 million), which is 4.5% (2013: 5.6%) of adjusted pre-tax profit and  
2.1% of equity (2013: 0.9%). Pre-tax profit is adjusted to exclude one-off impairments and net foreign exchange losses recognised which would,  
if included, significantly distort materiality year on year.
We agreed with the Audit and Risk Committee that we would report to the Committee all audit differences in excess of US$360,000  
(2013: US$320,000), as well as differences below that threshold that, in our view, warranted reporting on qualitative grounds. We also report  
to the Audit and Risk Committee on disclosure matters that we identified when assessing the overall presentation of the financial statements.
An overview of the scope of our audit
Our Group audit was scoped by obtaining an understanding of the Group and its environment, including groupwide controls and assessing the 
risks of material misstatement across the Group. Our audit scope focused primarily on the eight key operating segments (Voro, Khakanja, Dukat, 
Omolon, Varvara, Amursk-Albazino, Mayskoye and Kyzyl, which was acquired in the year) plus the Head Office entity such that 100% of revenues 
and over 99% of total assets were subject to a full scope audit.
The Group audit team was involved in the work of the component auditors at all stages of the audit process. The signing partner and senior 
members of the Group engagement team visited the Head Office in St. Petersburg on multiple occasions in the past year and continued to follow  
a programme of regular planned visits to the Group’s other business units. The Group audit team directed and reviewed in detail the work 
performed on significant risks by the component auditors.
Our audit work was executed at levels of materiality applicable to each individual component; which were between US$12.6 million and 
US$9.0 million.
Matters on which we are required to report by exception 
Adequacy of explanations received and accounting records
Under the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991 we are required to report to you if, in our opinion:
•	 we have not received all the information and explanations we require for our audit; or
•	 proper accounting records have not been kept by the parent company, or proper returns adequate for our audit have not been received from 
branches not visited by us; or
•	 the financial statements are not in agreement with the accounting records and returns.
We have nothing to report in respect of these matters.
Corporate Governance Statement
Under the Listing Rules we are also required to review the part of the Corporate Governance Statement relating to the Company’s compliance with 
the ten provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code. We have nothing to report arising from our review.
Our duty to read other information in the Annual Report
Under International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland), we are required to report to you if in our opinion information in the Annual Report is:
•	 materially inconsistent with the information in the audited financial statements; or
•	 apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, our knowledge of the Group acquired in the course of performing  
our audit; or
•	 otherwise misleading.
In particular, we are required to consider whether we have identified any inconsistencies between our knowledge acquired during the audit and  
the directors’ statement that they consider the Annual Report is fair, balanced and understandable and whether the Annual Report appropriately 
discloses those matters that we communicated to the Audit and Risk Committee which we consider should have been disclosed. We confirm that 
we have not identified any such inconsistencies or misleading statements.
Other matters
In our opinion, the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited has been properly prepared in accordance with the provisions of the 
UK Companies Act 2006 as if that Act had applied to the Company.
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditor
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities Statement, the directors are responsible for the preparation of the financial statements and 
for being satisfied that they give a true and fair view. Our responsibility is to audit and express an opinion on the financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). Those standards require us to comply with the Auditing Practices 
Board’s Ethical Standards for Auditors. We also comply with International Standard on Quality Control 1 (UK and Ireland). Our audit methodology 
and tools aim to ensure that our quality control procedures are effective, understood and applied. Our quality controls and systems include our 
dedicated professional standards review team and independent partner reviews.
This report is made solely to the Company’s members, as a body, in accordance with Article 113A of the Companies (Jersey) Law 1991. Our audit 
work has been undertaken so that we might state to the Company’s members those matters we are required to state to them in an auditor’s report 
and for no other purpose. To the fullest extent permitted by law, we do not accept or assume responsibility to anyone other than the Company and 
the Company’s members as a body, for our audit work, for this report, or for the opinions we have formed.
Scope of the audit of the financial statements
An audit involves obtaining evidence about the amounts and disclosures in the financial statements sufficient to give reasonable assurance that the 
financial statements are free from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or error. This includes an assessment of: whether the accounting 
policies are appropriate to the Group’s circumstances and have been consistently applied and adequately disclosed; the reasonableness of significant 
accounting estimates made by the directors; and the overall presentation of the financial statements. In addition, we read all the financial and 
non-financial information in the Annual Report to identify material inconsistencies with the audited financial statements and to identify any information 
that is apparently materially incorrect based on, or materially inconsistent with, the knowledge acquired by us in the course of performing the audit.  
If we become aware of any apparent material misstatements or inconsistencies we consider the implications for our report.

Going concern 
In assessing its going concern status, the Group has taken account of its financial position, anticipated future trading performance, its borrowings 
and other available credit facilities, and its forecast compliance with covenants on those borrowings and its capital expenditure commitments and 
plans, including the potential exercise of the put option in respect of the Kyzyl transaction. As at 31 December 2014, the Group held US$157 million 
of cash and had net debt of US$1,249 million, including liability for special dividends payable (Note 17), with US$1,038 million of undrawn facilities 
available, of which US$810 million were considered committed.
The Board is satisfied that the Group’s forecasts and projections, having taken account of reasonably possible changes in trading performance, 
show that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational existence for at least the next 12 months from the date of this report and 
that it is appropriate to adopt the going concern basis in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014.
Foreign currency considerations
The Group’s revenues and the majority of its borrowings are denominated in US Dollars, while the majority of the Group’s costs are denominated in 
Russian Roubles. Changes in foreign exchange rates affect the Group’s financial results and performance. Both the average and year end RUB/
US$ exchange rates fluctuated significantly during 2014, in particular in the second half, resulting in significant depreciation of the Russian Rouble 
against the US Dollar by the year-end. From 1 January to 31 December 2014 the Russian Rouble depreciated against the US Dollar by 72.2% from 
32.7 RUB/US$ to 56.3 RUB/US$, and the yearly average rate by 23.5% from 31.8 RUB/US$ in 2013 to 38.4 RUB/US$ in 2014. 
Foreign exchange losses recognised in the Consolidated Income Statement predominantly arise on the re-translation of US Dollar-denominated 
external loans in Rouble functional currency entities and represent a non-cash loss. 
The Group’s net assets have also reduced with a US$618 million non-cash loss arising in reserves relating to the translation of the Russian Rouble 
and Kazakh Tenge denominated Balance Sheets into the US Dollar presentational currency. 
The devaluation of the Rouble had a limited effect on operating costs and Adjusted EBITDA in the first three quarters of the year, however this 
benefit became more significant in Q4 2014 when a significant devaluation took place. Should the RUB/US$ exchange rate continue at the current 
levels throughout 2015, there will be further significant operating cost and Adjusted EBITDA benefits relative to 2014. 
Basis of presentation
The Group’s annual consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014 are prepared in accordance with International 
Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted by the European Union. The financial statements have been prepared on the historical cost basis, 
except for certain financial instruments and share-based payments which are measured at fair value. 
The accounting policies have been applied in preparing the consolidated financial statements for the year ended 31 December 2014. 
New and amended standards adopted by the entity
The following standards became effective for annual periods beginning on or after January 1, 2014 for the companies reporting under IFRS  
as adopted by the EU, with earlier application permitted. The Group adopted these standards and they did not have a material impact on its 
consolidated financial statements: 
IFRS 10 Consolidated Financial Statements replaces the portion of IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial Statements that addresses 
accounting for consolidated financial statements and SIC-12 Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. IFRS 10 provides a single basis for 
consolidation with a new definition of control. 
IFRS 11 Joint Arrangements replaces IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures and SIC-13 Jointly-controlled Entities – Non-monetary Contributions by 
Venturers. Under IFRS 11 a joint arrangement is classified as either a joint operation or a joint venture, and the option to proportionately consolidate 
joint ventures has been removed. Interests in joint ventures must be equity accounted. 
IFRS 12 Disclosures of Interests in Other Entities accompanies IFRS 10 and IFRS 11. This standard combines the disclosure requirements 
previously covered by IAS 27, related to consolidated financial statements, IAS 31 Interest in Joint Ventures and IAS 28 Investments in Associates, 
as well as including additional disclosure requirements. 
Amendments have been made to IAS 28 Investments in Associates and it has been reissued as IAS 28 Investments in Associates and Joint 
Ventures. The revised standard prescribes the application of the equity method when accounting for investments in associates and joint ventures. 
IAS 32 Offsetting Financial Assets and Financial Liabilities (Amendments to IAS 32). On December 16, 2011 the IASB published amendments to  
IAS 32, Financial Instruments: Presentation to clarify the application of the offsetting requirements. The Group has assessed that whether certain  
of its financial assets and financial liabilities qualify for offset based on the criteria set out in the amendments and concluded that the application  
of the amendments has had no impact on the amounts recognised in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 36 Recoverable Amount Disclosures for Non-Financial Assets remove the requirements to disclose the recoverable amount  
of a cash-generating unit (CGU) to which goodwill or other intangible assets with indefinite useful lives had been allocated when there has been  
no impairment or reversal of impairment of the related CGU. The amendments introduce additional disclosure requirements applicable to when  
the recoverable amount of an asset or a CGU is measured at fair value less costs of disposal. The application of these amendments has had no 
material impact in the disclosures in the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
Amendments to IAS 39 Novation of Derivatives and Continuation of Hedge Accounting and IFRIC 21 Levies issued in May 2013 on the accounting 
for levies imposed by governments has had no material impact on the Group’s consolidated financial statements.
2. Significant accounting policies
Basis of consolidation
Subsidiaries
The consolidated financial statements of the Group include the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries, from the date that control 
effectively commenced until the date that control effectively ceased. Control is achieved where the Company is exposed, or has rights, to variable 
returns from its involvement with the investee and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the investee.
Income and expenses of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the period are included in the consolidated income statement from the 
effective date of acquisition and up to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate.
When necessary, adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries to bring their accounting policies into line with those used  
by the Group.
All intra-group balances, transactions and any unrealised profits or losses arising from intra-group transactions are eliminated on consolidation.
Changes to the Group’s ownership interests that do not result in a loss of control over the subsidiaries are accounted for as equity transactions. 
The carrying amount of the Group’s interests and non-controlling interests are adjusted to reflect the change in their relative interests in the 
subsidiaries. Any difference between the amount by which the non-controlling interest is adjusted and the fair value of the consideration paid or 
received is recognised directly in equity and attributed to the owners of the Company.
When the Group loses control of a subsidiary, the profit or loss on the disposal is calculated as the difference between 1) the aggregated fair value 
of the consideration received and the fair value of any retained interest and 2) the previous carrying amount of the assets (including goodwill), and 
liabilities of the subsidiary and non-controlling interests.
For non-wholly owned subsidiaries, non-controlling interests are initially measured at the non-controlling interest’s proportion of the fair values of 
net assets recognised at acquisition. Thereafter, a share of the profit or loss for the financial year and other movements in the net assets or liabilities 
of the subsidiary is attributed to the non-controlling interests as shown in the income statement and balance sheet.

Business combinations
IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination. When acquiring new 
entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute an integrated set of 
activities, whether the integrated set is capable of being conducted and managed as a business by a market participant, and thus whether the 
transaction constitutes a business combination, using the guidance provided in the Standard. Acquisitions of businesses are accounted for using 
the acquisition method. The consideration for each acquisition is measured at the aggregate of the fair values (at the date of exchange) of assets 
given, liabilities incurred or assumed, and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for control of the acquiree. Acquisition-related costs 
are recognised in the consolidated income statement as incurred. Transaction costs incurred in connection with the business combination are 
expensed. Provisional fair values are finalised within 12 months of the acquisition date.
Where applicable, the consideration for the acquisition may include an asset or liability resulting from a contingent consideration arrangement. 
Contingent consideration is measured at its acquisition-date fair value and included as part of the consideration transferred in a business 
combination. Subsequent changes in such fair values are adjusted against the cost of acquisition retrospectively with the corresponding 
adjustment against goodwill where they qualify as measurement period adjustments. Measurement period adjustments are adjustments that arise 
from additional information obtained during the measurement period about facts and circumstances that existed at the acquisition date. The 
measurement period may not exceed one year from the effective date of the acquisition. The subsequent accounting for contingent consideration 
that does not qualify for as a measurement period adjustment is based on how the contingent consideration is classified. Contingent consideration 
that is classified as equity is not subsequently remeasured. Contingent consideration that is classified as an asset or liability is remeasured at 
subsequent reporting dates in accordance with IAS 37 Provisions, Contingent Liabilities and Contingent Assets or IAS 39 Financial Instruments 
Recognition and Measurement with the corresponding amount being recognised in profit or loss.
The identifiable assets acquired and the liabilities assumed are recognised at their fair value at the acquisition date, except that:
•	 deferred tax assets or liabilities and liabilities or assets related to employee benefit arrangements are recognised and measured in accordance 
with IAS 12 Income Taxes and IAS 19 Employee Benefits, respectively;
•	 liabilities or equity instruments related to share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree or share-based payment arrangements of the 
Group entered into to replace share-based payment arrangements of the acquiree are measured in accordance with IFRS 2 Share-based 
Payment at the acquisition date; and
•	 assets (or disposal groups) that are classified as held for sale in accordance with IFRS 5 Non-current Assets Held for Sale and Discontinued 
Operations are measured in accordance with that Standard.
Where a business combination is achieved in stages, the Group’s previously held interests in the acquired entity are remeasured to fair value at the 
acquisition date (i.e. the date the Group attains control) and the resulting gain or loss, if any, is recognised in the consolidated income statement. 
Amounts arising from interests in the acquiree prior to the acquisition date that have previously been recognised in equity are reclassified to profit  
or loss, where such treatment would be appropriate if that interest was disposed of.
Goodwill and goodwill impairment
Goodwill arising in a business combination is recognised as an asset at the date that control is acquired (the acquisition date). Goodwill is 
measured as the excess of the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any non-controlling interests in the acquiree, and the fair  
value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any) over the net of the acquisition-date amounts of the identifiable assets 
acquired and the liabilities assumed.
If the Group’s interest in the fair value of the acquiree’s identifiable net assets exceeds the sum of the consideration transferred, the amount of any 
non-controlling interests in the acquiree and the fair value of the acquirer’s previously held equity interest in the acquiree (if any), the excess is 
recognised immediately in the consolidated income statement as a bargain purchase gain.
Goodwill is not amortised but is reviewed for impairment at least annually. For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to each of 
the Group’s cash-generating units expected to benefit from the synergies of the combination. Cash-generating units to which goodwill has been 
allocated are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount 
of the cash-generating unit is less than its carrying amount, the impairment loss is allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill 
allocated to the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. An impairment 
loss recognised for goodwill is not reversed in a subsequent period.
On disposal of a subsidiary, the attributable goodwill is included in the determination of the profit or loss on disposal.
Acquisition of mining licences
The acquisition of mining licences is often effected through a non-operating corporate entity. As these entities do not represent a business, it is 
considered that the transactions do not meet the definition of a business combination and, accordingly, the transaction is accounted for as the 
acquisition of an asset. The net assets acquired are accounted for at cost.
Investments in associates
An associate is an entity over which the Group has significant influence and that is neither a subsidiary nor an interest in a joint arrangement. 
Significant influence constitutes the power to participate in the financial and operating policy decisions of the investee but does not extend to a 
control or joint control over the enactment of those policies. The results and assets and liabilities of associates are incorporated in the consolidated 
financial statements using the equity method of accounting.
Equity method of accounting
Under the equity method, an investment in an associate is initially recognised in the consolidated balance sheet at cost and adjusted thereafter  
to recognise the Group’s share of the profit or loss and other comprehensive income of the investee. When the Group’s share of the losses of an 
associate exceeds the Group’s interest in that entity, the Group ceases to recognise its share of further losses. Additional losses are recognised 
only to the extent that the Group has incurred legal or constructive obligations or made payments on behalf of the investee.
Any excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities of an 
investee at the date of acquisition is recognised as goodwill, which is included within the carrying amount of the investment. Any excess of the 
Group’s share of the net fair value of the identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities over the cost of acquisition, after reassessment,  
is recognised immediately in profit or loss.
The requirements of IAS 39 are applied to determine whether it is necessary to recognise any impairment loss with respect to the Group’s 
investments. Where an indicator of impairment exists or the carrying value of the asset contains goodwill with an indefinite useful life, the entire 
carrying amount of the investment (including goodwill) is tested for impairment in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets as a single cash 
generating unit through the comparison of its recoverable amount (the higher of value in use and fair value less costs to sell) with its carrying 
amount. Any impairment loss recognised forms part of the carrying amount of the investment. Any reversal of that impairment loss is recognised  
in accordance with IAS 36 Impairment of Assets.
When a Group entity transacts with its investees, profits and losses resulting from the transactions with the investee are recognised in the Group’s 
consolidated financial statements only to the extent of interests in the associate that are not related to the Group.
Functional and presentation currency
The functional currency for each entity in the Group is determined as the currency of the primary economic environment in which it operates.  
For all Russian entities the functional currency is the Russian Rouble (RUB), as well as for the investment holding companies, including Polymetal 
International plc. The functional currency of the Group’s entities located and operating in Kazakhstan (JSC Varvarinskoye, Bakyrchik Mining  
Venture LLP, JSC Inter Gold Capital) is the Kazakh Tenge (KZT).
The Group has chosen to present its consolidated financial statements in US Dollars (US$), as management believes it is a more convenient 
presentation currency for international users of the consolidated financial statements of the Group as it is a common presentation currency in the 
mining industry. The translation of the financial statements of the Group entities from their functional currencies to the presentation currency is 
performed as follows:
•	 all assets and liabilities are translated at closing exchange rates at each reporting period end date;
•	 all income and expenses are translated at the average exchange rates for the periods presented, except for significant transactions that are 
translated at rates on the date of such transactions;
•	 resulting exchange differences are included in equity and presented as movements relating to the effect of translation to the Group’s presentation 
currency within the Translation reserve; and
•	 in the consolidated statement of cash flows, cash balances at the beginning and end of each reporting period presented are translated using 
exchange rates prevalent at those respective dates. All cash flows in the period are translated at the average exchange rates for the periods 
presented, except for significant transactions that are translated at rates on the date of transaction.
On the disposal of a foreign operation (i.e. a disposal of the Group’s entire interest in a foreign operation, or a disposal involving loss of control over 
a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, a disposal involving loss of joint control over a jointly controlled entity that includes a foreign 
operation, or a disposal involving loss of significant influence over an associate that includes a foreign operation), all of the exchange differences 
accumulated in equity in respect of that operation attributable to the owners of the Company are reclassified to profit or loss.
In the case of a partial disposal that does not result in the Group losing control over a subsidiary that includes a foreign operation, the proportionate 
share of accumulated exchange differences are re-attributed to non-controlling interests and are not recognised in the consolidated income 
statement. For all other partial disposals (i.e. reductions in the Group’s ownership interest in associates or jointly controlled entities that do not result 
in the Group losing significant influence or joint control), the proportionate share of the accumulated exchange differences is reclassified to the 
consolidated income statement.
Goodwill and fair value adjustments on identifiable assets and liabilities acquired arising on the acquisition of a foreign operation are treated as 
assets and liabilities of the foreign operation and translated at the rate of exchange prevailing at the end of each reporting period. Exchange 
differences arising are recognised in equity.
Due to significant devaluation of the Russian Rouble during second half of the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group translated income and 
expenses occurred in this period on monthly basis at average monthly exchange rates.

The Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge are not freely convertible currencies outside the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan and, accordingly,  
any translation of Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge denominated assets and liabilities into US Dollar for the purpose of the presentation of 
consolidated financial statements does not imply that the Group could or will in the future realise or settle in US Dollars the translated values  
of these assets and liabilities.
Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies other than an entity’s functional currencies (foreign currencies) are recorded at the exchange rates prevailing on the 
dates of the transactions. All monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated at the exchange rates prevailing  
at the reporting date. Non-monetary items carried at historical cost are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date of transaction. 
Non-monetary items carried at fair value are translated at the exchange rate prevailing on the date on which the most recent fair value was 
determined. Exchange differences arising from changes in exchange rates are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Property, plant and equipment
Mining assets
Mining assets include the cost of acquiring and developing mining assets and mineral rights. Mining assets are depreciated to their residual values 
using the unit-of-production method based on proven and probable ore reserves according to the JORC Code, which is the basis on which the 
Group’s mine plans are prepared. Changes in proven and probable reserves are dealt with prospectively. Depreciation is charged on new mining 
ventures from the date that the mining asset is capable of commercial production (Note 5). In respect of those mining assets whose useful lives are 
expected to be less than the life of the mine, depreciation over the period of the asset’s useful life is applied. 
Mineral rights for the assets under development are included within Exploration and development. When a production phase is started, mineral 
rights are transferred into Mining assets and are depreciated as described below.
Capital construction-in-progress
Capital construction-in-progress assets are measured at cost less any recognised impairment. Depreciation commences when the assets are 
ready for their intended use. 
Exploration and development assets
Mineral exploration and evaluation costs, including geophysical, topographical, geological and similar types of costs, are capitalised into 
Exploration and development assets if management concludes that future economic benefits are likely to be realised and determines that 
economically viable extraction operations can be established as a result of exploration activities and internal assessment of mineral resources. 
When it has been determined that a mining asset can be economically developed as a result of established proven and probable reserves, the 
costs to remove any overburden and other waste materials to initially expose the ore body, referred to as stripping costs, are capitalised as a part  
of mining assets when these costs are incurred.
Non-mining assets
Non-mining assets are depreciated to their residual values on a straight-line basis over their estimated useful lives. When parts of an item of 
property, plant and equipment are considered to have different useful lives, they are accounted for and depreciated separately. Depreciation 
methods, residual values and estimated useful lives are reviewed at least annually.
Estimated useful lives are as set out below:
Machinery and equipment Up to 20 years
Transportation and other assets Up to 10 years
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over the shorter of the lease term and the estimated useful lives of the assets.
Gains or losses on disposal of property, plant and equipment are determined by comparing the proceeds from disposal with the asset’s carrying 
amount at the date. The gain or loss arising is recognised in the consolidated income statement.
Stripping costs
During the production phase of a mine when the benefit from the stripping activity is the improved access to a component of the ore body in future 
periods, the stripping costs in excess of the average ore to waste ratio for the life of mine of that component are recognised as a non-current asset. 
After initial recognition, the stripping activity asset is depreciated on a systematic basis (unit-of-production method) over the expected useful life of 
the identified component of the ore body made accessible as a result of the stripping activity.
Estimated ore reserves
Estimated proven and probable ore reserves reflect the economically recoverable quantities which can be legally recovered in the future from 
known mineral deposits. The Group’s reserves are estimated in accordance with JORC Code.
Leases
Operating leases
Operating lease payments are recognised as an expense on a straight-line basis over the lease term. Contingent rentals arising under operating 
leases are recognised as an expense in the period in which they are incurred.
Impairment of property, plant and equipment
An impairment review of property, plant and equipment is carried out when there is an indication that those assets have suffered an impairment 
loss. If any such indication exists, the carrying amount of the asset is compared to the estimated recoverable amount of the asset in order to 
determine the extent of the impairment loss (if any). Where it is not possible to estimate the recoverable amount of an individual asset, the Group 
estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-generating unit to which the asset belongs. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell and value in use. The carrying amounts of all the cash-generating units are 
assessed against their recoverable amounts determined based on a fair value less costs to sell calculation. Fair value is based on the application  
of the Discounted Cash Flow Method (DCF) using post-tax cash flows. The DCF method is attributable to the development of proved and probable 
reserves and certain resources where a relevant resource-to-reserve conversion ratio can be reasonably applied.
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash generating unit) is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying amount of the asset  
(or cash generating unit) is reduced to its recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised as an expense immediately in the consolidated 
income statement.
Where an impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount of the asset (or cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised estimate  
of its recoverable amount, but only to the extent that the increased carrying amount does not exceed the original carrying amount that would have 
been determined had no impairment loss been recognised in prior periods.
A reversal of an impairment loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately.
Inventories
Metal inventories
Inventories including refined metals, metals in concentrate and in process, doré and ore stockpiles are stated at the lower of production cost  
or net realisable value. Production cost is determined as the sum of the applicable expenditures incurred directly or indirectly in bringing inventories 
to their existing condition and location. Refined metals are valued at the average total cost of production per saleable unit of metal. Work in-
process, metal concentrate and doré are valued at the average total production costs at each asset’s relevant stage of production. Ore stockpiles 
are valued at the average cost of mining that ore. Where ore stockpiles are not expected to be processed within 12 months, those inventories are 
classified as non-current.
Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price for that product based on prevailing spot metal prices, less estimated costs to complete 
production and selling costs.
Consumables and spare parts
Consumables and spare parts are stated at the lower of cost or net realisable value. Cost is determined on the weighted average moving cost.  
The portion of consumables and spare parts not reasonably expected to be used within one year is classified as a long-term asset in the Group’s 
consolidated balance sheet. Net realisable value represents the estimated selling price less all estimated costs of completion and costs to be 
incurred in marketing, selling and distribution.

Financial instruments
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised when a Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument.
Financial assets and financial liabilities are initially measured at fair value. Transaction costs that are directly attributable to the acquisition or issue of 
financial assets and financial liabilities (other than financial assets and financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss) are added to or deducted 
from the fair value of the financial assets or financial liabilities, as appropriate, on initial recognition. Transaction costs directly attributable to the 
acquisition of financial assets or financial liabilities at fair value through profit or loss are recognised immediately in the consolidated 
income statement.
Financial Instruments Designated as Fair Value Through Profit and Loss (FVTPL)
A financial instrument other than a financial instrument held for trading may be designated as at FVTPL upon initial recognition if:
•	 such designation eliminates or significantly reduces a measurement or recognition inconsistency that would otherwise arise; or
•	 the financial instrument forms part of a group of financial assets or financial liabilities or both, which is managed and its performance is evaluated 
on a fair value basis, in accordance with the Group’s documented risk management or investment strategy, and information about the grouping 
is provided internally on that basis; or
•	 it forms part of a contract containing one or more embedded derivatives, and IAS 39 Financial Instruments: Recognition and Measurement 
permits the entire combined contract (asset or liability) to be designated as at FVTPL.
Financial instruments at FVTPL are stated at fair value, with any gains or losses arising on remeasurement recognised in profit or loss. Fair value is 
determined in the manner described in Note 30.
Effective interest rate method
The effective interest rate method is a method of calculating the amortised cost of a financial instrument and of allocating interest income or 
expense over the relevant period. The effective interest rate is the rate that discounts estimated future cash receipts or payments (including all fees 
and points paid or received that form an integral part of the effective interest rate, transaction costs and other premiums or discounts) through the 
expected life of the financial instrument, or, where appropriate, a shorter period, to the net carrying amount on initial recognition.
Financial assets
Non-derivative financial assets are classified into the following specified categories: FVTPL, available for sale (AFS) financial assets and ‘loans  
and receivables’. The classification depends on the nature and purpose of the financial assets and is determined at the time of initial recognition.  
No financial instruments have been classified as available for sale.
Income is recognised on an effective interest basis for financial instruments other than those financial assets classified as at FVTPL.
Loans and receivables
Loans and receivables are non-derivative financial assets with fixed or determinable payments that are not quoted in an active market. Loans  
and receivables are measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less any impairment. Interest income is determined  
by applying the effective interest rate, except for short-term receivables when the recognition of interest would be immaterial.
Impairment of financial assets
Financial assets, other than those at FVTPL, are assessed for indicators of impairment at the end of each reporting period. Financial assets  
are considered to be impaired when there is objective evidence that, as a result of one or more events that occurred after the initial recognition  
of the financial asset, the estimated future cash flows of the investment have been affected. For equity investments classified as AFS, a significant 
or prolonged decline in the fair value of the security below its cost is considered to be objective evidence of impairment.
For all other financial assets objective evidence of impairment could include:
•	 significant financial difficulty of the issuer or counterparty; or
•	 breach of contract, such as a default or delinquency in interest or principal payments; or
•	 it becoming probable that the borrower will enter bankruptcy or financial re-organisation; or
•	 the disappearance of an active market for that financial asset because of financial difficulties.
For financial assets carried at amortised cost, the amount of the impairment loss recognised is the difference between the asset’s carrying amount 
and the present value of estimated future cash flows, discounted at the financial asset’s original effective interest rate.
The carrying amount of the financial asset is reduced by the impairment loss directly for all financial assets with the exception of trade receivables, 
where the carrying amount is reduced through the use of an allowance account. When a trade receivable is considered uncollectible, it is written off 
against the allowance account. Subsequent recoveries of amounts previously written off are credited against the allowance account. Changes in 
the carrying amount of the allowance account are recognised in the consolidated income statement.
For financial assets measured at amortised cost, if, in a subsequent period, the amount of the impairment loss decreases and the decrease can be 
related objectively to an event occurring after the impairment was recognised, the previously recognised impairment loss is reversed through the 
consolidated income statement to the extent that the carrying amount of the investment at the date the impairment is reversed does not exceed 
what the amortised cost would have been had the impairment not been recognised.
Derecognition of financial assets
The Group derecognises a financial asset only when the contractual rights to the cash flows from the asset expire, or when it transfers the financial 
asset and substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the asset to another entity. If the Group neither transfers nor retains substantially all 
the risks and rewards of ownership and continues to control the transferred asset, the Group recognises its retained interest in the asset and an 
associated liability for amounts it may have to pay. If the Group retains substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of a transferred financial 
asset, the Group continues to recognise the financial asset and also recognises a collateralised borrowing for the proceeds received.
Financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities
Other financial liabilities (including borrowings) are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method.
Derecognition of financial liabilities
The Group derecognises financial liabilities when, and only when, the Group’s obligations are discharged, cancelled or they expire. The difference 
between the carrying amount of the financial liability derecognised and the consideration paid and payable is recognised in the consolidated 
income statement.
Derivative financial instruments
The Group may enter into a variety of derivative financial instruments to manage its exposure to certain risks. Further details of derivative financial 
instruments are disclosed in Note 30.
Derivatives are initially recognised at fair value at the date the derivative contracts are entered into and are subsequently remeasured to their fair 
value at the end of each reporting period. The resulting gain or loss is recognised in the consolidated income statement immediately unless the 
derivative is designated and effective as a hedging instrument, in which event the timing of the recognition in the consolidated income statement 
depends on the nature of the hedge relationship.
Derivatives embedded in non-derivative host contracts are treated as separate derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely 
related to those of the host contracts and the hybrid contracts are not measured at FVTPL.
Borrowing costs
Borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of qualifying assets, which are assets that necessarily take  
a substantial period of time to get ready for their intended use or sale, are added to the cost of those assets, until such time as the assets are 
substantially ready for their intended use or sale.
Investment income earned on the temporary investment of specific borrowings pending their expenditure on qualifying assets is deducted from  
the borrowing costs eligible for capitalisation.
All other borrowing costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement in the period in which they are incurred.
Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, cash deposits and highly liquid investments with original maturities of three months or less, 
which are readily convertible to known amounts of cash and are subject to an insignificant risk of changes in value.
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, it is probable that the Group 
will be required to settle the obligation, and a reliable estimate can be made of the amount of the obligation.
The amount recognised as a provision is the best estimate of the consideration required to settle the present obligation at the reporting date, taking 
into account the risks and uncertainties surrounding the obligation. Where a provision is measured using the cash flows estimated to settle the 
present obligation, its carrying amount is the present value of those cash flows.
Environmental obligations
An obligation to incur environmental restoration, rehabilitation and decommissioning costs arises when disturbance is caused by the development 
or ongoing production of mining assets. Such costs arising from the decommissioning of plant and other site preparation work, discounted to their 
net present value using a risk-free rate applicable to the future cash flows, are provided for and capitalised at the start of each project, as soon as 
the obligation to incur such costs arises. These costs are recognised in the consolidated income statement over the life of the operation, through 
the depreciation of the asset in the cost of sales line and the unwinding of the discount on the provision in the finance costs line. Costs for 
restoration of subsequent site damage which is created on an ongoing basis during production are provided for at their net present values and 
recognised in the consolidated income statement as extraction progresses.
Changes in the measurement of a liability relating to the decommissioning of plant or other site preparation work (that result from changes in the 
estimated timing or amount of the cash flow or a change in the discount rate), are added to or deducted from the cost of the related asset in the 
current period. If a decrease in the liability exceeds the carrying amount of the asset, the excess is recognised immediately in the consolidated 
income statement.
The provision for closure cost obligations is remeasured at the end of each reporting period for changes in estimates and circumstances. Changes 
in estimates and circumstances include changes in legal or regulatory requirements, increased obligations arising from additional mining and 
exploration activities, changes to cost estimates and changes to the risk free interest rate.

2. Significant accounting policies continued
Employee benefit obligations
Remuneration paid to employees in respect of services rendered during a reporting period is recognised as an expense in that reporting period. 
The Group pays mandatory contributions to the state social funds, including the Pension Fund of the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan, which 
are expensed as incurred.
Taxation
Income tax expense represents the sum of the tax currently payable and deferred tax. Income taxes are computed in accordance with the laws  
of countries where the Group operates.
Current tax
The tax currently payable is based on taxable profit for the period. Taxable profit differs from profit as reported in the consolidated income 
statement because of items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other periods and items that are never taxable or deductible. 
The Group’s liability for current tax is calculated using tax rates that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the reporting date.
Deferred tax
Deferred tax is recognised on temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the consolidated financial statements 
and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit. Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary 
differences. Deferred tax assets are generally recognised for all deductible temporary differences to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits 
will be available against which those deductible temporary differences can be utilised. Such deferred tax assets and liabilities are not recognised if 
the temporary difference arises from goodwill or from the initial recognition (other than in a business combination) of other assets and liabilities  
in a transaction that affects neither the taxable profit nor the accounting profit.
Deferred tax liabilities are recognised for taxable temporary differences associated with investments in subsidiaries and associates, and interests in 
joint ventures, except where the Group is able to control the reversal of the temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. Deferred tax assets arising from deductible temporary differences associated with such investments and 
interests are only recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be sufficient taxable profits against which to utilise the benefits of the 
temporary differences and they are expected to reverse in the foreseeable future.
The carrying amount of deferred tax assets is reviewed at the end of each reporting period and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable 
that sufficient taxable profits will be available to allow all or part of the asset to be recovered.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are measured at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period in which the liability is settled or the asset 
realised, based on tax rates (and tax laws) that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the end of the reporting period. The measurement 
of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the tax consequences that would follow from the manner in which the Group expects, at the end of the 
reporting period, to recover or settle the carrying amount of its assets and liabilities.
Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset when there is a legally enforceable right to set off current tax assets against current tax liabilities and 
when they relate to income taxes levied by the same taxation authority and the Group intends to settle its current tax assets and liabilities on a 
net basis.
Current and deferred tax
Current and deferred tax is recognised in the consolidated income statement, except when it relates to items that are recognised in the 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity, in which case, the current and deferred tax is also recognised in 
consolidated statement of comprehensive income or directly in equity respectively. Where current tax or deferred tax arises from the initial 
accounting for a business combination, the tax effect is included in the accounting for the business combination.
Revenue recognition
Revenue is derived principally from the sale of gold and silver bullions and copper, gold and silver concentrate and is measured at the fair value  
of consideration received or receivable, after deducting discounts.
Revenue from the sale of gold and silver bullion and sale of copper, gold and silver concentrate is recognised when the risks and rewards of 
ownership are transferred to the buyer, the Group retains neither a continuing degree of involvement nor control over the goods sold, the amount  
of revenue can be measured reliably, and it is probable that the economic benefits associated with the transaction will flow to the Group. Revenue 
from the sale of gold and silver bullion represents the invoiced value of metal shipped to the buyer, net of value added tax (VAT).
Sale of gold and silver bullion
The Group processes doré produced in the Russian Federation (at Dukat, Khakanja, Voro, Omolon, and Amursk-Albazino) into London Good 
Delivery Bars prior to sale. This final stage of processing is carried out on a toll-treatment basis at four state-owned refineries. The Group sells  
gold and silver bullion to banks through long-term agreements. The sales price, as determined in the agreement, may be variable based upon the 
London Bullion Market Association (LBMA) spot or fixed price, however the Group does not enter into fixed price contracts. For domestic sales,  
title passes from the Group to the purchaser at the refinery gate with revenue recognised at that point. For export sales, once the gold and/or silver 
bars have been approved for export by Russian customs, they are then transported to the vault of the purchaser, which is typically located in 
London. Title passes and revenue is recognised at the point when the gold and/or silver bars are received by the purchaser.
Sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate
The Group sells copper, gold and silver concentrate under pricing arrangements where final prices are determined by quoted market prices in a 
period subsequent to the date of sale. Concentrate sales are initially recorded based on forward prices for the expected date of final settlement. 
Revenue is recorded at the time of shipment, which is also when risks and rewards pass to the buyer. Revenue is calculated based on the copper, 
gold and silver content in the concentrate and using the forward London Bullion Market Association (LMBA) or London Metal Exchange (LME) price 
to the estimated final pricing date, adjusted for the specific terms of the relevant agreement. Until final settlement occurs, adjustments to revenue 
are made to take into account the changes in metal quantities upon receipt of new information and assay. Revenue is presented net of refining and 
treatment charges which are subtracted in calculating the amount to be invoiced.
The Group’s sales of copper, gold and silver concentrate are based on a provisional price and as such, contain an embedded derivative that is 
required to be separated from the host contract for accounting purposes. The host contract is the receivable from the sale of the concentrate  
at the forward exchange price at the time of sale. The embedded derivative, which does not qualify for hedge accounting, is measured at FVTPL 
with changes in its fair value recognised within revenue in the consolidated income statement for each period prior to the final settlement.
Share-based compensation
The Group applies IFRS 2 Share-based Payments to account for share-based compensation. IFRS 2 requires companies to recognise 
compensation costs for share-based payments to employees based on the grant-date fair value of the award.
At the Annual General Meeting in June 2013, shareholders approved the new Long-Term Incentive Plan (the ‘LTIP’). Under the new LTIP options  
are awarded on the annual basis after the publication of annual results and before the AGM. The first grant of options under the LTIP took place  
on 22 April 2014. Total number of options granted under the LTIP amounts to 2,464,041 shares.
The fair value of the awards granted in April 2014 was estimated using a Monte Carlo model valuation (see note 33). 
Under the management bonus deferral award plan, which is defined in the Remuneration report, a total amount of 103,936 shares was granted, 
which will be released over a period of three years. Deferred bonus was measured at share price at grant date and will be prorated across periods 
to the different vest dates.
The fair value of the awards granted is recognised as a general, administrative and selling expense over the vesting period with a corresponding 
increase in the share-based compensation reserve. Upon the exercise of the awards, the proceeds received, net of any directly attributable 
transaction costs, are credited to the stated capital account, and the amounts recognised within the share-based compensation reserve 
transferred to retained earnings.
The previous LTIP scheme, which was granted in 2010, had fully vested by 30 June 2013. These options lapsed in H1 2014 and accordingly,  
the related balance of US$143.5 million in the share-based payment reserve was transferred into retained earnings.
Earnings per share
Earnings per share calculations are based on the weighted average number of common shares outstanding during the period. Diluted earnings  
per share are calculated using the treasury stock method, whereby the proceeds from the potential exercise of dilutive stock options with exercise 
prices that are below the average market price of the underlying shares are assumed to be used in purchasing the Company’s common shares  
at their average market price for the period.
3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
The following are the critical judgements, apart from those involving estimations (see below), that management has made in the process of 
applying the Group’s accounting policies and that have the most significant effect on the amounts recognised in consolidated financial statements.
Production start date
The Group assesses the stage of each mine or plant construction project to determine when an asset moves into the commercial production 
stage. The criteria used to assess the start date are determined by the unique nature of each construction project and include factors such  
as the complexity of a plant and its location.
The Group considers various relevant criteria to assess when the mine is substantially complete and ready for its intended use and moves into the 
production stage. Criteria considered include, but are not limited to the following:
•	 the level of capital expenditure incurred compared to the construction cost estimates;
•	 the completion of a sufficient level of testing on the mine plant and equipment;
•	 the ability to produce gold, silver or copper in saleable form (within specifications); and
•	 the ability to sustain ongoing commercial levels of production.
When a construction project moves into the commercial production stage and depreciation commences, the capitalisation of certain mine 
construction costs and interest ceases and costs are either regarded as inventory or expensed, except for capitalisable costs related to mining 
asset additions or improvements, underground mine development or ore reserve development.
The Mayskoye plant and underground mine reached commercial production in April 2013.
Acquisitions
IFRS 3 Business Combinations applies to a transaction or other event that meets the definition of a business combination. When acquiring new 
entities or assets, the Group applies judgement to assess whether the assets acquired and liabilities assumed constitute an integrated set of 
activities and thus whether the transaction constitutes a business combination, using the guidance provided in the standard. In making this 
determination, management evaluates the inputs, processes and outputs of the asset or entity acquired.

3. Critical accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty continued
Fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations
In accordance with the Group’s policy, the Group allocates the cost of the acquired entity to the assets acquired and liabilities assumed based  
on their fair values as estimated on the date of acquisition. Any difference between the cost of the acquired entity and the fair value of the assets 
acquired and liabilities assumed is recorded as goodwill. The Group exercises significant judgement in the process of identifying tangible and 
intangible assets and liabilities, valuing these assets and liabilities, and estimating their remaining useful lives. The valuation of these assets and 
liabilities is based on assumptions and criteria that, in some cases, include management’s estimates of discounted future cash flows. 
If actual results are not consistent with estimates and assumptions considered, the Group may have to adjust its estimates of the fair values of 
assets and liabilities recognised and the goodwill balance during the measurement period. Such a remeasurement could have an impact on the 
amounts reported in the consolidated income statement in current and future periods.
Key sources of estimation uncertainty
Preparation of the consolidated financial statements in accordance with IFRS requires management to make estimates and assumptions that affect 
the reported amounts of assets and liabilities and disclosure of contingent assets and liabilities at the date of the consolidated financial statements, 
and the reported amounts of revenues and expenses during the reporting period. The determination of estimates requires judgements which are 
based on historical experience, current and expected economic conditions, and all other available information. Actual results could differ from 
those estimates.
The following are the key assumptions concerning the future, and other key sources of estimation uncertainty at the end of the reporting period that 
have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next financial period.
The most significant areas requiring the use of management estimates and assumptions relate to:
•	 fair value of net assets acquired and liabilities assumed in business combinations;
•	 ore reserve estimates;
•	 depreciation;
•	 impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment;
•	 valuation of stockpiles and work in-process;
•	 share-based compensation;
•	 environmental obligations;
•	 contingencies; and
•	 income taxes.
Ore reserve estimates
An ore reserve estimate is an estimate of the amount of product that can be economically and legally extracted from the Group’s properties.  
Ore reserve estimates are used by the Group in the calculation of: depletion of mining assets using the units-of-production method; impairment 
charges and in forecasting the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land restoration costs. Also, for the purpose of impairment review 
and the assessment of the timing of the payment of decommissioning and land restoration costs, management may take into account mineral 
resources in addition to ore reserves where there is a high degree of confidence that such resources will be extracted.
In order to calculate ore reserves, estimates and assumptions are required about geological, technical and economic factors, including quantities, 
grades, production techniques, recovery rates, production costs, transport costs, commodity demand, commodity prices, discount rates and 
exchange rates. Estimating the quantity and/or grade of ore reserves requires the size, shape and depth of ore bodies to be determined by 
analysing geological data such as the logging and assaying of drill samples. This process may require complex and difficult geological judgements 
and calculations to interpret the data.
Ore reserve estimates may change from period to period as additional geological data becomes available during the course of operations or if there 
are changes in any of the aforementioned assumptions. Such changes in estimated reserves may affect the Group’s financial results and financial 
position in a number of ways, including the following:
•	 asset carrying values due to changes in estimated future cash flows;
•	 depletion charged in the consolidated income statement where such charges are determined by using the units-of-production method;
•	 provisions for decommissioning and land restoration costs where changes in estimated reserves affect expectations about the timing of the 
payment of such costs; 
•	 carrying value of deferred tax assets and liabilities where changes in estimated reserves affect the carrying value of the relevant assets and 
liabilities; and
•	 contingent consideration liabilities when it depends on future sales of metal produced by certain mines
Depreciation
Mining assets are depreciated using the units-of-production method except where the useful lives of the assets are shorter than the life of the mine. 
The units-of-production depreciation calculations are based on proved and probable reserves under the JORC Code, which is the basis on which 
the Group’s mine plans are prepared as the useful lives of these assets are considered to be limited to the life of the relevant mine. For other 
property, plant and equipment, the straight-line method is applied over the estimated useful life of the asset which does not exceed the estimated 
mine life. 
The calculation of the units-of-production rate of depreciation could be impacted to the extent that actual production in the future is different from 
current forecast production based on proved and probable ore reserves. This would generally arise when there are significant changes in any of the 
factors or assumptions used in estimating ore reserves.
Impairment of goodwill, mining assets and other property, plant and equipment
The Group considers both external and internal sources of information in assessing whether there are any indications that goodwill, mining assets 
or other property, plant and equipment owned by the Group are impaired. External sources of information the Group considers include: changes in 
the market and economic and legal environment in which the Group operates, that are not within its control and that affect the recoverable amount 
of goodwill, mining assets or other property, plant and equipment.
Internal sources of information the Group considers include the manner in which mining properties, plant and equipment are being used or 
expected to be used and indications of economic performance of the assets. In determining the recoverable amounts of the Group’s mining assets 
and other property, plant and equipment, the Group’s management determines the fair value less costs to sell by estimating the discounted future 
after-tax cash flows expected to be derived from the Group’s mining properties, costs to sell the mining properties and the appropriate post-tax 
discount rate. Reductions in metal price forecasts, increases in estimated future costs of production, increases in estimated future capital costs, 
reductions in the amount of recoverable reserves and resources and/or adverse current economics can result in a write-down of the carrying 
amounts of the Group’s goodwill, mining assets or other property, plant and equipment.
In making the assessment for impairment, assets that do not generate independent cash inflows are allocated to an appropriate cash-generating 
unit. Management necessarily applies its judgement in allocating assets that do not generate independent cash inflows to appropriate cash-
generating units, and also in estimating the timing and value of underlying cash flows within the value-in-use calculation. Subsequent changes  
to the cash-generating unit allocation or to the timing of cash flows could impact the carrying value of the respective assets.
Stockpiles and work in-process
In determining mine operating costs recognised in the consolidated income statement, the Group’s management uses survey and assay 
techniques to estimate quantities of ore stacked on leach pads and in process and the recoverable gold and silver in this material to determine the 
average costs of finished goods sold during the period. Changes in these estimates can result in a change in mine operating costs of future periods 
and carrying amounts of inventories. At 31 December 2014 the carrying value of the ore stockpiles was US$207 million and work in-process was 
US$51 million.
Environmental obligations
The Group’s mining and exploration activities are subject to various laws and regulations governing the protection of the environment. The Group’s 
provision for future decommissioning and land restoration cost represents management’s best estimate of the present value of the future cash 
outflows required to settle the liability which reflects estimates of future costs, inflation, movements in foreign exchange rates and assumptions  
of risks associated with the future cash outflows; and the applicable interest rate for discounting the future cash outflows. Actual costs incurred  
in future periods could differ materially from the estimates. Additionally, future changes to environmental laws and regulations, life of mine estimates 
and discount rates could affect the carrying amount of this provision.
Contingencies
By their nature, contingencies will only be resolved when one or more future events occur or fail to occur. The assessment of such contingencies 
inherently involves the exercise of significant judgements and estimates of the outcome of future events.
Income taxes and mining taxes
The Group is subject to income tax and mining taxes in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan. Mining taxes do not meet the definition of a tax 
under IAS 12 Income taxes. Significant judgement is required in determining the provision for these taxes due to the complexity of legislation.  
There are many transactions and calculations for which the ultimate tax determination is uncertain. The Group recognises liabilities for anticipated 
tax audit issues based on estimates of whether additional taxes, penalties and interest will be due. Where the final tax outcome of these matters  
is different from the amounts that were initially recorded, such differences will impact the income tax and deferred tax provisions in the period in 
which such determination is made.
Deferred tax assets are reviewed at each reporting date and reduced to the extent that it is no longer probable that sufficient taxable profit will be 
available to allow all or part of the deferred tax asset to be utilised. The estimation of that probability includes judgements based on the expected 
performance. Various factors are considered in order to assess the probability of the future utilisation of deferred tax assets, including past 
operating results, operational plan, expiration of tax losses carried forward, and tax planning strategies. If actual results differ from these estimates 
or if these estimates must be adjusted in future periods, the financial position, results of operations and cash flows may be negatively affected.

4. Acquisitions and disposals
(a) Business combinations and asset acquisitions
Kyzyl acquisition
On 4 September 2014 the Group acquired 100 per cent of the share capital of Altynalmas Gold Ltd (AAG), the holding company for the Kyzyl gold 
project in Kazakhstan. 
The initial consideration for this acquisition comprised US$318.5 million in cash and 31,347,078 new ordinary shares of Polymetal International plc 
issued to Sumeru Gold B.V., representing approximately 7.45% of the Company’s enlarged issued share capital. The number of shares issued was 
determined by dividing US$300 million by the unweighted mean average closing price of Polymetal shares on the Main Market of the London Stock 
Exchange in the 12 calendar months ending three trading days before completion which equated to US$9.57027 per share. Using the share price 
in completion gave a fair value for the share consideration of US$274.9 million. Deferred additional cash consideration up to an agreed cap, 
contingent on certain conditions being met and dependent on the relative dynamics of the gold price and the price of Polymetal’s shares,  
may be payable over the next seven years, and this forms the basis for a contingent consideration liability which was valued on acquisition  
at US$27.7 million. 
Sumeru Gold B.V. is entitled to a put option giving it a right to require Polymetal to acquire or procure acquirers for the consideration shares by 
notice to Polymetal during the one month period immediately following the first anniversary of completion at a price per consideration share equal 
to US$9.57027. On completion Polymetal recognised the repurchase obligation at the net present value of maximum repayment of US$300 million, 
which approximates to US$273 million, with a corresponding decrease in equity. The put option has an exercise period from 4 September to 
4 October 2015. When the option lapses or is exercised, both the liability and the corresponding balance in equity will be derecognised.  
After any cash payments to the vendor are taken into account, the balancing figure goes through retained earnings.
AAG meets the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 thus it was accounted for at fair value using the acquisition method. 
Assets acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition
The initial accounting of the acquisition of AAG has only been provisionally determined at the end of the reporting period based on the directors’ 
best estimate.
The management believes that this business acquisition does not give rise to goodwill and excess of consideration over net asset assets of the 
acquiree should be fully attributed the mineral rights. The amount recognised in respect of the identifiable assets acquired and liabilities assumed 
are set out in the table below.
 US$’000
Assets acquired and liabilities recognised at the date of acquisition
Cash and cash equivalents 4,156 
Mineral rights (Exploration and development assets) 853,600 
Other property, plant and equipment 6,144

Environmental obligations (16,346)
Contingent liabilities (5,627)

Contingent consideration 27,699 
Seller put option 54,565 
Total consideration 675,677 
Net cash outflow on acquisition 314,344 
Contingent liabilities assumed in the business combination of US$5.6 million represent social obligations set by the Sub-Soil Use contracts, being 
amounts committed to be spent on professional trainings and other social engagements over the life of project. The potential undiscounted amount 
of future payments that the Group could be required to make approximates to US$10 million (refer to Note 29).
No significant financial assets were acquired in the business combination.
Valuation of consideration
The fair value of the 31,347,078 ordinary shares issued as part of the consideration paid for AAG was determined based on the spot price at the 
acquisition date, being US$8.77.
The deferred additional cash consideration described above meets the definition of contingent consideration and was fair valued as of the 
acquisition date using a Monte Carlo valuation simulation. Potential amounts payable for each of the next seven years are linked to the average gold 
price in each period, with a deduction for the effect of the share value appreciation. The average annual gold price must exceed US$1,250/oz for 
any consideration to be payable. The total amount payable is limited to US$500 million. The key assumptions used in the contingent consideration 
calculation are set out below:
Gold price volatility 7.16%
Share price volatility 31.2%
Constant correlation between gold price and share price 93.3%
Dividend yield 2%
Gold price as of the acquisition date US$1,271.5
Share price as of the acquisition date US$8.77
Discount rate 9%
The acquisition date fair value was calculated at US$27.7 million.
At acquisition the fair value of the seller’s put option was calculated using a Black-Scholes option pricing model, using assumptions consistent  
with the Monte Carlo simulation. The fair value has been calculated at US$54.6 million.
Impact of the acquisition on the result of the Group
Acquisition-related costs (included in Other operating expenses) amount to US$4 million (Note 12). 
Altynalmas Gold Ltd (AAG) contributed US$3 million loss to the Group’s loss for the period between the acquisition date and year end. AAG 
generated no revenues in 2014. Had the acquisition completed on the first day of the financial year, it would have increased the Group’s loss  
by US$10.1 million.
North Kaluga deposit
On 29 August 2014 Polymetal International plc acquired 100% ownership in the North Kaluga property following the restructuring of the  
JSC Ural-Polymetal, which was previously classified as an associate in the IFRS consolidated financial statements.
Under the terms of the restructuring agreement, Ural-Polymetal was dissolved and the asset and liabilities of the former associate were distributed 
amongst the shareholders. Polymetal received a 100% interest in the North Kaluga property and assumed US$20 million of debt. The other assets 
and liabilities of the associate were transferred to the other shareholders. Polymetal owned 49.99% of Ural-Polymetal prior to the transaction and 
the asset had nil carrying value in the Group’s financial statements due to write-off in 2013 following the commodities price decline.
North Kaluga does not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) thus it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets.  
As a result the Group acquired mineral rights at cost of US$20.9 million, debt amounting to US$20.3 million and other current liabilities of 
US$0.6 million.
Other minor acquisitions
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group acquired several minor companies, which hold exploration licences and capital construction 
in progress assets. The acquired subsidiaries do not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) thus they were accounted for as 
an acquisition of a group of assets. The Group purchased mineral rights at total cost of US$1.7 million, capital construction in progress at a cost  
of US$2.6 million and other current liabilities of US$3.0 million for a total cash consideration of US$1.3 million.
Olymp Ltd.
On 24 January 2013 the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of Olymp Ltd., a Russian legal entity holding the mining and exploration licence 
for the Olcha gold-silver deposit in exchange for 775,000 new ordinary shares in Polymetal. 
Olymp Ltd. does not meet the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) thus it is accounted for as an acquisition of a group of assets.  
The Group purchased mineral rights at cost of US$13.4 million and other current liabilities of US$0.01 million.

Maminskoye gold mining field (‘Maminskoye’). 
On 9 April 2013 the Group completed the acquisition of 100% of the ordinary share capital and debt in MGK. The consideration for the equity 
investment was US$3.9 million payable in cash and 5,491,661 of Polymetal’s ordinary shares valued at the acquisition date at US$74.6 million.  
The debt investment in MGK was acquired for consideration payable in cash and equalling its carrying value of US$8.0 million.
MGK meets the definition of a business pursuant to IFRS 3 (2008) thus it was accounted for at fair value using the acquisition method.

5. Segment information
The Group has eight reportable segments (2013: seven):
•	 Voro (CJSC Gold of Northern Urals);
•	 Khakanja (LLC Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration Company; Svetloye LLC);
•	 Dukat (CJSC Magadan Silver; Olymp LLC);
•	 Omolon (Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC);
•	 Varvara (JSC Varvarinskoye);
•	 Amursk-Albazino (Albazino Resources Ltd, Amur Hydrometallurgical Plant LLC);
•	 Mayskoye (Mayskoye Gold Mining Company LLC); and
•	 Kyzyl (Bakyrchik Mining Venture LLP, JSC Inter Gold Capital).
Reportable segments are determined based on the Group’s internal management reports and are separated based on the Group’s geographical 
structure. Minor companies and activities (management, exploration, purchasing and other companies) which do not meet the reportable segment 
criteria are disclosed within the corporate and other segment. Each segment is engaged in gold, silver or copper mining and related activities, 
including exploration, extraction, processing and reclamation. The Group’s segments are all based in the Russian Federation, except for Varvara 
and Kyzyl which are based in Kazakhstan.
The measure which management and the Chief Operating Decision Maker (the CODM) use to evaluate the performance of the Group is segment 
Adjusted EBITDA, which is defined as profit for the period adjusted for depreciation and amortisation, impairment of non-current assets, write-
downs and reversals of inventory to net realisable value, share-based compensation expenses, rehabilitation expenses, gains or losses arising on 
acquisition or disposal of subsidiaries, foreign exchange gains or losses, changes in the fair value of contingent consideration, finance income, 
finance costs, income tax expenses and other tax exposure accrued within other operating expenses. The accounting policies of the reportable 
segments are consistent with those of the Group’s accounting policies under IFRS.
Revenue shown as corporate and other comprises, principally, intersegment revenue relating to the supply of inventories, spare parts and fixed 
assets, and rendering management services to the Group’s production entities. Intersegment revenue is recognised based on costs incurred plus  
a fixed margin basis. External revenue shown within corporate and other represents revenue from services provided to third parties by the Group’s 
non-mining subsidiaries. 
Business segment current assets and liabilities, other than current inventory, are not reviewed by the CODM and therefore are not disclosed in 
these consolidated financial statements.

Mining tax is a royalty payable in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan which is calculated based on the value of the precious metals extracted  
in the period. This value is usually determined based on the realised selling price of precious metals or, in the case where there were no sales 
during the period, cost of sales of metals extracted (Russian Federation) or the average market price (Kazakhstan) during the period. 
Mining tax in respect of the metal inventories produced during the year is recognised within cost of sales, while the additional mining tax accruals  
in respect of various disputes with tax authorities are recognised within other expenses (see Note 12).

and depreciation related to assets employed in development projects where the charge is capitalised. Depreciation expense, which is excluded 
from the Group’s calculation of Adjusted EBITDA (see Note 5), also excludes amounts absorbed into unsold metal inventory balances.
On-mine depreciation increased due to significant depreciation of the deferred stripping assets and increased mining volumes on several deposits 
during the year ended 31 December 2014.

by applying an effective interest rate of 3.5% and 2.99%, respectively, to cumulative expenditure on such assets.
The repurchase obligation relates to the put option issued to the seller of Altynalmas Gold Ltd (AAG), giving it a right during a specified period to 
require Polymetal International plc to acquire or procure acquirers for the 31,347,078 consideration shares issued by Polymetal International plc  
at a price of US$9.57027 per share (Note 4).

Tax effect of non-deductible expenses and other permanent differences 15,245  35,389 
Total income tax expense 71,965  40,417 
The actual tax expense differs from the amount which would have been determined by applying the statutory rate of 20% for the Russian Federation 
and Kazakhstan to profit before income tax as a result of the application of relevant jurisdictional tax regulations, which disallow certain deductions 
which are included in the determination of accounting profit. These deductions include share-based payment expenses, social related expenditures 
and other non-production costs, certain general and administrative expenses, financing expenses, foreign exchange related and other costs.
In the normal course of business, the Group is subject to examination by tax authorities throughout the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan.  
Out of the large operating companies of the Group, tax authorities have audited CJSC Gold of Northern Urals and CJSC Magadan Silver up to 
2012, Omolon Gold Mining Company LLC, LLC Okhotskaya Mining and Exploration Company CJSC and Mayskoye Gold Mining Company LLC  
up to 2010, and JSC Varvarinskoye for the period up to 2010. According to Russian and Kazakhstan tax legislation, previously conducted audits  
do not fully exclude subsequent claims relating to the audited period. 
Tax exposures recognised in income tax and other expenses
At 31 December 2014
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group has identified and provided for additional mining tax exposures amounting to 
US$2.4 million at Omolon, US$1.3 million at Mayskoye, US$0.4 million at Voro and various Varvara tax exposures of US$2.9 million. The Group has 
also accrued interest related to Magadan Silver tax exposures previously identified of US$4.1 million, and mining tax exposure for 2013 amounting 
to US$2.4 million. During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group has also identified a VAT exposure of US$2.4 million including penalties and 
interest and an income tax exposure of US$10.2 million including penalties and interest of US$3.6 million at Magadan Silver, which were provided 
for. VAT and mining tax exposures, including penalties and interest, as well as penalties and interest related to income tax exposure, are recognised 
within other operating expenses (Note 12).
Tax, penalties and interest of US$3.9 million previously accrued were paid at Magadan Silver and Varvara during the year.
Total provision as of 31 December 2014 is US$36.1 million. 
At 31 December 2013
During the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group paid US$8.3 million of mining taxes, interest and penalties in respect of the Magadan Silver 
Mineral Extraction Tax case, US$17.1 million of Varvara Excess Profits Tax provided for in 2012 and US$7.3 million of various Varvara exposures. 
In respect of the year ended 31 December 2013, no additional significant income tax and mining tax exposures have been provided for.
Deferred taxation
Deferred taxation is attributable to the temporary differences that exist between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and the amounts used for tax purposes.

Deferred tax assets and liabilities are offset where the Group has a legally enforceable right to do so. The following analysis shows deferred tax 
balances presented for financial reporting purposes:

Deferred tax assets 61,787 88,484

Tax losses carried forward represent amounts available for offset against future taxable income generated by ZK Mayskoye LLC, Albazino 
Resources LLC, Amursky Hydrometallurgy Plant LLC, Svetloye LLC and the JSC Polymetal during the period up to 2024. Each legal entity within 
the Group represents a separate tax-paying component for income tax purposes. The tax losses of one entity cannot be used to reduce taxable 
income of other entities of the Group. As at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 the aggregate tax losses carried forward were 
US$371.4 million (RUB 20.6 billion) and US$426.8 million (RUB 13.9 billion), respectively.
The Group believes that recoverability of the recognised deferred tax asset (DTA) of US$74.2 million at 31 December 2014 is more likely than not 
based upon expectations of future taxable income in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan and available tax planning strategies.
Losses incurred in certain taxable entities in recent years have created a history of losses as of 31 December 2014. The Group has concluded that 
there is sufficient evidence to overcome the recent history of losses based on forecasts of sufficient taxable income in the carry-forward period.
The Group’s estimate of future taxable income is based on established proven and probable reserves which can be economically developed.  
The related detailed mine plans and forecasts provide sufficient supporting evidence that the Group will generate taxable earnings to be able to fully 
realise its net DTA even under various stressed scenarios. The amount of the DTA considered realisable, however, could be reduced in the near term  
if estimates of future taxable income during the carry forward period are reduced due to delays in production start dates, decreases in ore reserve 
estimates, increases in environmental obligations, or reductions in precious metal prices. The Group’s tax losses carried forward expire as follows:

The deferred tax liabilities for taxes that would be payable on the unremitted earnings of certain of the Group subsidiaries have not been recognised 
as the Group has determined that the undistributed profit of its subsidiaries will not be distributed in the foreseeable future. The temporary 
differences associated with investments in subsidiaries, for which deferred tax liabilities have not been recognised, amount to US$1,231 million 
(2013: US$1,802 million).

17. Dividends
A final dividend has been proposed in relation to the year of 13 cents per share giving a total expected dividend of US$54.7 million. This is subject 
to approval by shareholders at the Annual General Meeting and has therefore not been included as a liability in these financial statements. 
On 4 December 2014 the Board of Directors approved a special dividend of 20 cents per share. The liability of US$84.2 million as at 
31 December 2014 is included within accounts payable and accrued liabilities.
Dividends paid during the year ended 31 December 2014 are detailed in the table below:

18. Impairment losses
The Group assesses the impairment of property, plant and equipment when indicators of impairment exist and assess cash generating units (CGU) 
where goodwill is attributed for impairment on an annual basis when updated proved and probable reserves and mineral resources estimates and 
life of mine plans are available or when indicators of impairment exist.
Each cash generating unit is determined on the basis of the Group’s geographical structure and equals the Group’s reporting segments  
(refer to Note 5). The carrying amount of cash generating units excludes certain exploration assets included within the segment assets which are 
currently under development, and have not reached a stage where there is enough information to estimate the future cash flows that might be 
eventually generated by the project. These were assessed for impairment separately.
The carrying amounts of all the cash-generating units were assessed against their recoverable amounts determined based on a fair value less 
costs to sell calculation. Fair value is based on the application of the Discounted Cash Flow Method (DCF) using post-tax cash flows. The DCF 
method is attributable to the development of proved and probable reserves and certain resources where a relevant resource-to-reserve conversion 
ratio can be reasonably applied.
Year ended 31 December 2014
The Group analyses whether indicators of impairment exist based on internal and external information, taking into account both global and 
domestic operating environment factors. 
Based on current proved and probable reserves and mineral resources estimates and life of mine plans no indicators of impairment were identified 
for individual cash generating units.
During the year ended 31 December 2014 gold, silver and copper market prices were stable, being close to commodity prices assumptions  
used in 2013 impairment tests performed (see below). At the same time the Russian economy experienced challenges resulting in a significant 
depreciation of Russian Rouble in the second half of 2014 and an increase in the key interest rate established by Central Bank of the  
Russian Federation. 
The Group benefits from Russian Rouble depreciation against the US Dollar, as it leads to decreases in the Group’s operating costs which are 
mainly denominated in Russian Rouble. The Group revised the discount rate used for DCF method arriving at a post-tax real discount rate of 9.0% 
(2013: 7.1%), which is equal to its nominal weighted average cost of capital of 11.7% (2013: 9.0%) translated into real terms.
No impairments or impairment reversals were recognised for the year ended 31 December 2014 both for Property, Plant and Equipment or 
Goodwill (see Note 20).
The carrying amount of the cash generating units excludes certain exploration and developments assets which are currently under development. 
These assets are assessed for impairment separately using the same assumptions set out below and where applicable impairment is recognised 
within Exploration expenses (Note 12).
Year ended 31 December 2013
During the year ended 31 December 2013, due to significant decline in gold, silver and copper market prices in first quarter 2013, the Group carried 
out an impairment review of its property, plant and equipment, goodwill and other non-current assets. As a result of this review, total impairment 
charges of US$213.4 million were recognised during 2013.
Summary of key assumptions used for impairment assessment
Commodity prices
Commodity prices are based on latest internal forecasts, benchmarked against external sources of information. In the impairment tests  
performed, the flat real long-term gold, silver and copper prices of US$1,200 per ounce (2013: US$1,200), US$17 per ounce (2013: US$18)  
and US$5,400 per tonne (2013: US$7,000), respectively, have been used to estimate future revenues. 
Discount rate
The Group used a post-tax real discount rate of 9.0% (2013: 7.1%).
Proved and probable reserves and mineral resources
Future annual production volumes are derived from the detailed long-term life of mine plans which are based on JORC proven and probable 
reserves and certain mineral resources (using a relevant resource-to-reserve conversion ratio) at the end of the period. 
Production costs
Production costs are based on management’s best estimates over the life of the mine, and reflect past experience.
Rouble exchange rates
Management have analysed RUB/US$ rate movements for the year ended 31 December 2014. For the purposes of the impairment test,  
RUB/US$ exchange rate is estimated at 50 RUB/US$ (2013: 33 RUB/US$).

Sensitivity analysis
For Dukat and Mayskoye management has performed an analysis as to whether a reasonably possible adverse change to any of the key 
assumptions would lead to impairment. 
The following scenarios were considered as reasonably possible and were used for this sensitivity analysis:
•	 5% simultaneous decrease in gold and silver prices over the life of mine;
•	 5% increase in operating expenses over the life of mine; and 
•	 0.5% increase in the discount rate applied.
Each of the sensitivities above has been determined by assuming that the relevant key assumption moves in isolation, and without regard to 
potential mine plan changes and other management decisions which would be taken to respond to adverse changes in existing management 
projections. An adverse change in a key assumption described above would not cause the aggregate carrying amount to exceed the aggregate 
recoverable amount of the Dukat and Mayskoye cash-generating units.

Total (5) 4,982  548  34,287  (5,845) 5,207  39,174  (153,327)
The write-downs were recognised in respect of the ore stockpiles with a low content of precious metal. Reversals of the previously recorded 
write-downs were driven by a costs reduction due to the Russian Rouble devaluation, changes in mine plans and favourable changes in contract 
terms with offtakers, which have the economic viability of the stockpiles.
The key assumptions used as at 31 December 2014 in determining net realisable value of inventories (including the commodity price assumptions) 
were consistent with the assumptions used in the impairment review (see Note 18), except for RUB/US$ exchange rate for the metal inventories 
that are expected to be realised during first half 2015. Analysis of such metal inventories was performed using the rate assumption of 60 RUB/US$.
During the year ended 31 December 2013 the Group provided for obsolete consumables and spare parts inventory in the amount of US$4.1 million 
(year ended 31 December 2013: write-down of US$10.7 million).
The amount of inventories held at net realisable value at 31 December 2014 is US$32.4 million (31 December 2013: US$100.7 million).

26. Borrowings continued
Bank loans
The Group has a number of borrowing arrangements with various lenders. These borrowings consist of unsecured and secured loans and credit 
facilities denominated in US Dollars, Euro and Canadian Dollars. Where security is provided it is in the form of pledge of revenue from certain 
sales agreements.
During the year ended 31 December 2014, the Group drew down a total of US$454 million and repaid US$252 million, a net drawdown  
of US$202 million. 
The Group secured new facilities in the year for a total amount of US$186.7 million with unrelated parties. These credit facilities are undrawn  
as at 31 December 2014 and have maturity dates between 2017 and 2020.
At 31 December 2014, the Group had undrawn borrowing facilities of US$1,038 million (31 December 2013: US$1,324 million). The Group 
complied with its debt covenants throughout 2014 and 2013. The table below summarises maturities of borrowings:

Amounts paid in the year (1,202) (901)
Translation to presentation currency (25,691) (4,322)
Closing balance 54,292  65,364 
Rehabilitation expenses relate to the increase of the environmental obligation which arises on the production phase of mining activities. During the 
year ended 31 December 2014 rehabilitation expenses amounting to US$0.7 million (2013: US$0.3 million) were removed from cost of production 
and capitalised through the application of IFRIC 20.
The principal assumptions used for the estimation of environmental obligations were as follows:
 2014 2013
Discount rates 8.12%-14.56% 5.78%-8.43%
Inflation rates 4.10%-11.8% 4.12%-5.77%
Expected mine closure dates 1-16 years 2-19 years
The Group does not hold any assets that are legally restricted for purposes of settling environmental obligations.

In 2014, the average credit period for payables was 22 days (2013: 34 days). There was no interest charged on the outstanding payables balance 
during the credit period. The Group has financial risk management policies in place, which include budgeting and analysis of cash flows and 
payment schedules to ensure that all amounts payable are settled within the credit period.
29. Commitments and contingencies
Commitments
Capital commitments
The Group’s budgeted capital expenditure commitments as at 31 December 2014 amounted to US$13.6 million (2013: US$22.3 million).
Forward sale commitments
The Group has certain physical gold and silver forward sale commitments which are priced at the prevailing market price, calculated with reference 
to the LBMA or LME gold price, which are accounted for as executed as the Group expects to and has historically physically delivered into 
these contracts.
Operating leases: Group as a lessee
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group recognised US$12.5 million as operating lease expenses (2013: US$13.5 million).
The land in the Russian Federation and Kazakhstan on which the Group’s production facilities are located is owned by the state. The Group leases 
this land through operating lease agreements, which expire in various years through to 2058.
Future minimum lease payments due under non-cancellable operating lease agreements at the end of the period were as follows:

Contingencies
Operating environment
Emerging markets such as Russia are subject to different risks than more developed markets, including economic, political and social, and legal 
and legislative risks. Laws and regulations affecting businesses in Russia continue to change rapidly, and tax and regulatory frameworks are 
subject to varying interpretations. The future economic direction of Russia is heavily influenced by the fiscal and monetary policies adopted by the 
government, together with developments in the legal, regulatory, and political environment.
Because Russia produces and exports large volumes of oil and gas, its economy is particularly sensitive to the price of oil and gas on the world 
market, which decreased significantly during 2014. Management is unable to reliably estimate the effects of any further price fluctuations on the 
Company’s financial position.
Starting from March 2014, sanctions have been imposed in several packages by the US and the EU on certain Russian officials, businessmen and 
companies. International credit agencies downgraded Russia’s long-term foreign currency sovereign rating with a negative outlook. In December 2014, 
the Central Bank of the Russian Federation significantly increased its key interest rate, which resulted in higher interest rates on domestic borrowings. 
The exchange rate of the Russian Rouble depreciated significantly. These developments may result in the reduced access of the – Russian businesses 
to international capital and export markets, capital flight, further weakening of the Rouble and other negative economic consequences. 
The impact of further political and economic developments in Russia on future operations and the financial position of the Group is at this stage 
difficult to determine.

29. Commitments and contingencies continued
Taxation
Russian tax, currency and customs legislation is subject to varying interpretations, and changes, which can occur frequently. Management’s 
interpretation of such legislation as applied to the transactions and activities of the companies of the Group may be challenged by the relevant 
regional and federal authorities and as a result, significant additional taxes, penalties and interest may be assessed. Fiscal periods remain open to 
review by the authorities in respect of taxes for three calendar years preceding the year of review. Under certain circumstances reviews may cover 
longer periods.
During 2014 and 2013 the Group has been involved in a number of litigations in Russia and in Kazakhstan. See Note 16 for details of these cases 
and their outcomes. In addition to the cases detailed within Note 16, management has identified a total exposure (covering taxes and related 
interest and penalties) of US$17.2 million in respect of contingent liabilities (2013: US$22.3 million).
Commitments and contingencies related to Kyzyl
On 4 September 2014 the Group acquired 100% of the share capital of Altynalmas Gold Ltd (AAG), the holding company for the Kyzyl gold project 
in Kazakhstan (refer to Note 4). AAG subsidiaries located in Kazakhstan have certain social and other obligations which were recognised as 
liabilities in the purchase price allocation if they could be measured reliably.
The Subsoil Use Contracts contain minimum work obligations for both Bakyrchik and Bolshevik projects. Non-compliance with these programs 
may, in certain circumstances, lead to the revocation of the Subsoil Use Contracts.
30. Fair value accounting
The following table provides an analysis of financial instruments that are measured subsequent to initial recognition at fair value, grouped into  
Levels 1 to 3 based on the degree to which the fair value is observable as follows:
•	 Level 1 fair value measurements are those derived from quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities;
•	 Level 2 fair value measurements are those derived from inputs other than quoted prices included within level 1 that are observable for the asset 
or liability, either directly or indirectly; and
•	 Level 3 fair value measurements are those derived from valuation techniques that include inputs for the asset or liability that are not based on 
observable market data (unobservable inputs).
At 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013, the Group held the following financial instruments:

During the reporting periods, there were no transfers between Level 1 and Level 2.
Receivables from provisional copper, gold and silver concentrate sales
The fair value of receivables arising from copper, gold and silver concentrate sales contracts that contain provisional pricing mechanisms is 
determined using the appropriate quoted forward price from the exchange that is the principal active market for the particular metal. As such, these 
receivables are classified within Level 2 of the fair value hierarchy.
Contingent consideration liabilities
In 2008, the Group recorded a contingent consideration liability related to the acquisition of 98.1% of the shares in JSC Omolon Gold Mining 
Company (Omolon). The fair value of the contingent consideration liability was determined using a valuation model which simulates expected 
production of gold and silver at the Kubaka mine and future gold and silver prices to estimate the future revenues of Omolon. This liability is 
revalued at each reporting date based on 2% of the life of mine revenues with the resulting gain or loss recognised in the consolidated income 
statement. The liability recognised at 31 December 2014 was US$12.9 million, including a current portion of US$1.8 million (2013: US$16.1 million).
During the year ended 31 December 2014 the Group completed acquisition of Altynalmas Gold Ltd, the holding company for the Kyzyl gold project 
in Kazakhstan (Note 4). The fair value of the related contingent consideration liability was estimated using a Monte Carlo model. The liability was 
revalued at 31 December 2014 using the same model with updated inputs as of the reporting date.
The table below sets forth a summary of changes in the fair value of the Group’s Level 3 financial liabilities for the year ended 31 December 2014:

Total 11,150 6,356 17,506 15,523
The Directors consider that a reasonably possible change in a valuation assumption would not have a material impact on the financial statements 
for Omolon contingent consideration payable. For Kyzyl contingent consideration, the key assumptions are set out within Note 4. The model used 
to assess the fair value of the consideration at 31 December 2014 is sensitive to changes in several key assumptions.
Commodity forward contracts
The Group enters into forward contracts for the physical delivery of metals which will be priced according to the prevailing London Bullion Market 
Association or London Metal Exchange index. The Group’s policy is not to enter into fixed priced contracts. The forward sales contracts qualify  
for the normal purchase/sales or ‘own use’ exemption for accounting purposes and are outside the scope of IAS 39 Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement.
 
31. Risk management activities
Capital management
The Group manages its capital to ensure that entities in the Group will be able to continue as a going concern while maximising the return to 
stakeholders through the optimisation of the debt and equity balance. The Group’s overall strategy remains from prior years.
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt (borrowings as detailed in Note 26 offset by cash and bank balances as detailed in Note 25) 
and equity of the Group comprising the Stated Capital account, reserves and retained earnings as detailed in Note 32.
The Group is not subject to any externally imposed capital requirements. The Group’s Board reviews the capital structure of the Group  
on a semi-annual basis. As part of this review, the Board considers the cost of capital and the risks associated with each class of capital.

Trade and other payables exclude employee benefits and social security.
The carrying values of cash and cash equivalents, trade and other receivables, trade and other payables and short-term debt recorded at 
amortised cost approximate to their fair values because of the short maturities of these instruments. The estimated fair value of the Group’s 
long-term debt, calculated using the market interest rate available to the Group as at 31 December 2014, is US$1,232 million, and the carrying 
value as at 31 December 2014 is US$1,323 million (see Note 26). Carrying values of the other long-term loans provided to related parties as at 
31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 approximated to their fair values.
The main risks arising from the Group’s financial instruments are foreign currency and commodity price risk, interest rate, credit and liquidity risks.
At the end of the reporting period, there are no significant concentrations of credit risk for receivables designated at FVTPL. The carrying amount 
reflected above represents the Group’s maximum exposure to credit risk for such receivables.

Foreign currency and commodity price risk
In the normal course of business the Group enters into transactions for the sale of its commodities, denominated in US Dollars. In addition, the 
Group has assets and liabilities in a number of different currencies (primarily Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge). As a result, the Group is subject 
to transaction and translation exposure from fluctuations in foreign currency exchange rates.
The Group does not use derivative instruments to currently hedge its exposure to foreign currency risk.
The carrying amounts of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies other than functional currencies of the individual Group 
entities at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 were as follows:

Currency risk is monitored on a monthly basis by performing a sensitivity analysis of foreign currency positions in order to verify that potential losses 
are at an acceptable level.

Provisionally priced sales
Under a long-established practice prevalent in the industry, copper, gold and silver concentrate sales are provisionally priced at the time of 
shipment. The provisional prices are finalised in a contractually specified future period (generally one to three months) primarily based on quoted 
LBMA or LME prices. Sales subject to final pricing are generally settled in a subsequent month. The forward price is a major determinant of 
recorded revenue.
Interest rate risk
The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because entities in the Group borrow funds at both fixed and floating interest rates. The risk is managed 
by the Group by maintaining an appropriate mix between fixed and floating rate borrowings. The Group does not currently hedge its exposure to 
interest rate risk.
The Group’s exposure to interest rates on financial assets and financial liabilities is detailed in the liquidity risk section of this note.
For floating rate liabilities, the analysis is prepared assuming the amount of the liability outstanding at the end of the reporting period was 
outstanding for the whole period. A 100 basis point increase or decrease is used when reporting interest rate risk internally to key management 
personnel and represents management’s assessment of the reasonably possible change in interest rates.
If interest rates had been 100 basis points higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the Group’s profit for the year ended  
31 December 2014 would have decreased/increased by US$11.6 million (2013: US$9.8 million). This is mainly attributable to the Group’s exposure 
to interest rates on its variable rate borrowings.
The Group’s sensitivity to interest rates has increased during the current period mainly due to the increase in variable rate debt instruments.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk that a customer may default or not meet its obligations to the Group on a timely basis, leading to financial losses to the Group. 
The Group’s financial instruments that are potentially exposed to concentration of credit risk consist primarily of cash and cash equivalents and 
loans and receivables.
Accounts receivable are regularly monitored and assessed and where necessary an adequate level of provision is maintained. Trade accounts 
receivable at 31 December 2014 and 31 December 2013 are represented by provisional copper, gold and silver concentrate sales transactions.  
A significant portion of the Group’s trade accounts receivable is due from reputable export trading companies. With regard to other loans and 
receivables the procedures of accepting a new customer include checks by a security department and responsible on-site management for 
business reputation, licences and certification, creditworthiness and liquidity. Generally, the Group does not require any collateral to be pledged  
in connection with its investments in the above financial instruments. Credit limits for the Group as a whole are not set up.
The credit risk on liquid funds is limited because the counterparties are banks with high credit-ratings assigned by international credit-rating 
agencies. The major financial assets at the balance sheet date other than trade accounts receivable presented in Note 25 are cash and cash 
equivalents at 31 December 2014 of US$157.2 million (2013: US$65.6 million).

Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not be able to settle its liabilities as they fall due.
The Group’s liquidity position is carefully monitored and managed. The Group manages liquidity risk by maintaining detailed budgeting, cash 
forecasting processes and matching the maturity profiles of financial assets and liabilities to help ensure that it has adequate cash available to meet 
its payment obligations.
The following tables detail the Group’s remaining contractual maturity for its financial liabilities with agreed repayment periods. The tables have been 
drawn up based on the undiscounted cash flows of financial liabilities based on the earliest date on which the Group can be required to pay. The tables 
include both interest and principal cash flows. To the extent that interest flows are floating rate, the undiscounted amount is derived from interest rate 
curves at the end of the reporting period. The contractual maturity is based on the earliest date on which the Group may be required to pay.

As at 31 December 2014, the Company’s issued share capital consisted of 420,819,943 ordinary shares (2013: 389,472,865 ordinary shares) of no 
par value, each carrying one vote. The Company does not hold any shares in treasury (2013: none). The ordinary shares reflect 100% of the total 
issued share capital of the Company.

Retained earnings
Reserves available for distribution to shareholders are based on the available cash in the Company under Jersey law. The ability to distribute cash up 
to the Company from the Russian and Kazakh operating companies will be based on the statutory historical information of each stand-alone entity, 
which is prepared in accordance with Russian or Kazakh accounting standards and which differs slightly from IFRS. Russian legislation identifies the 
basis of distribution as accumulated profit. However, current legislation and other statutory regulations dealing with distribution rights are open to legal 
interpretation; consequently, actual distributable reserves may differ from the amount of accumulated profit under Russian statutory accounting rules.
Weighted average number of shares: Diluted loss/earnings per share
Both basic and diluted loss/earnings per share were calculated by dividing loss/profit for the year attributable to equity holders of the parent by the 
weighted average number of outstanding common shares before/after dilution respectively. The calculation of the weighted average number of 
outstanding common shares after dilution is as follows:
Year ended
31 December 
2014
31 December
 2013
Weighted average number of outstanding common shares 399,606,989 387,932,387
Dilutive effect of share appreciation plan 83,149 –
Weighted average number of outstanding common shares after dilution 399,690,138 387,932,387
   
The outstanding LTIP awards at 31 December 2014 and 2013 represent anti-dilutive potential ordinary shares with respect to earnings per share for 
continuing operations. Therefore, basic and diluted earnings per share are the same for the current and prior year.
33. Share-based payments
For the year ended 31 December 2014, share-based compensation in the amount of US$2.4 million including US$0.3 million of management 
bonus deferral award (2013: US$24.2 million) was recognised in general, administrative and selling expenses in the consolidated income statement 
(Note 11). 
As at 31 December 2014 the Group has US$7 million of unrecognised share-based compensation expense related to non-vested equity-settled 
stock appreciated rights with an expected amortisation period of 3.2 years.
The previous LTIP scheme, which was granted in 2010, had fully vested by 30 June 2013. These options lapsed in H1 2014 and accordingly, the 
related balance of US$143.5 million in the share-based payment reserve was transferred into retained earnings.
34. Related parties 
Related parties are considered to include shareholders, affiliates, associates, joint ventures and entities under common ownership and control with 
the Group and members of key management personnel. 
Bank Otkritie (previously Nomos-Bank) ceased to meet the definition of a related party from 27 February 2013 due to changes in its shareholder 
structure and composition of its Board of Directors. However in line with IAS 24 Related Party Transactions, deposits or borrowings taken out with 
Nomos where terms were agreed prior to this date, continued to be recognised as related party transactions. Borrowings taken out with Nomos 
Bank were fully repaid during first quarter 2014.

in working capital derived in Russian Rouble and Kazakh Tenge are translated into US Dollars at average rates for the period or historical rates 
where applicable. Movements in working capital are also adjusted for non-cash movements such as depreciation absorbed into metal inventories 
and impairments (or impairment reversals).
Non-cash transactions during the year ended 31 December 2014 represent the issuance of shares amounting to US$275 million in respect of 
business combination (2013: the issuance of US$88 million of shares for the acquisition of assets).
Cash flows related to exploration amounted to US$67.4 million for the year ended 31 December 2014 (2013: US$58 million).
36. Subsequent events
On 3 February 2015 Polymetal International plc secured a new facility of US$100 million with Unicredit Bank. The loan will be repaid in equal 
quarterly instalments starting from May 2017 to February 2019.
A final dividend has been proposed in relation to the year of 13 cents per share (2013: 8 cents per share) giving a total expected dividend of 
US$54.7 million (2013: US$31.2 million).
On 18 March 2015 the Group increased its interest in LLC ‘Vostochny Basis’ (holder of the licence for the Tarutinskoye copper deposit (Tarutin) 
from 25% to 50%. The Group has purchased an additional 25% from an unrelated party for a consideration of US$14.2 million, payable through 
1,746,692 newly issued Polymetal International plc shares (0.41% of Polymetal’s increased ordinary share capital). The amount of shares was 
determined by dividing the consideration by the unweighted mean average of Polymetal’s closing share price during the 14 calendar day  
period ending two calendar days before completion. As result of the issuance of consideration shares, Polymetal’s share capital comprises 
422,566,635 shares.

cyanide in the presence of activated carbon. 
Gold is absorbed onto activated carbon in 
parallel with leaching
Carbon-in-pulp  
or CIP
 means a technological operation in which slurry 
containing gold and silver is leached by cyanide 
initially without and subsequently in the presence 
of activated carbon. Gold absorption onto carbon 
starts only after preliminary leaching
Concentrate a semi-finished product of mineral processing 
(flotation or gravity separation) containing 
significantly more value per unit of weight than 
ore and subject to further processing for the 
production of metals or other substances in final 
useful form
Cu copper
Cut-off grade the minimum grade at which mineralised material 
can be economically mined and processed  
(used in the calculation of ore reserves)
Cyanide leaching leaching with cyanide as the leaching agent
Decline a permanent inclined underground tunnel 
leading from the surface to an ore body
Dilution the share (percentage) of material below the 
cut-off grade that is extracted together and 
irretrievably mixed with ore during mining.  
All other things being equal, higher dilution leads 
to lower grade in ore mined
Doré one of the traditional end-products of a gold/
silver mine; an alloy containing 90% in sum of 
gold and silver as well as 10% of impurities
Exploration activity ultimately aimed at discovery  
of ore reserves for exploitation. Consists  
of sample collection and analysis, including 
reconnaissance, geophysical and geochemical 
surveys, trenching, drilling, etc
Flotation a technological operation in which ore-bearing 
minerals are separated from gangue minerals in 
the slurry based on variance in the interaction of 
different minerals with water. Particles of valuable 
concentrate are carried upwards with froth and 
collected for further processing
Strategic report Governance Financial statements Appendices
154 Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc Annual Report 2014 Polymetal International plc 155 Grade means the relative amount of metal in ore, 
expressed as grams per tonne for precious 
metals and as a percentage for most  
other metals
Head grade the grade of ore coming into a processing plant
Heap leach a technological operation in which crushed 
material is laid on a sloping, impervious pad 
where it is leached by cyanide solution  
to dissolve gold and/or silver. Metals are 
subsequently recovered from pregnant leach 
solution by CIC or the Merrill-Crowe process
Indicated  
resource 
means that part of a resource for which  
tonnage, grade and content can be estimated 
with a reasonable level of confidence. It is based 
on exploration, sampling and testing information 
gathered through appropriate techniques from 
locations such as outcrops, trenches, pits, 
workings and drill holes. The locations are  
too widely or inappropriately spaced to  
confirm geological and/or grade continuity  
but are spaced closely enough for continuity  
to be assumed
Inferred resource means that part of a resource for which tonnage, 
grade and content can be estimated with  
a low level of confidence. It is inferred from 
geological evidence and assumed but not  
verified geological and/or grade continuity.  
It is based on information gathered through 
appropriate techniques from locations such  
as outcrops, trenches, pits, workings and drill 
holes which may be limited or of uncertain  
quality and reliability
In-fill drilling a conventional method of detailed exploration on 
already defined resource of reserve, consisting of 
drilling on a denser grid to allow more precise 
estimation of ore bodyparameters and location
Leaching the process of dissolving mineral values from 
solid into liquid phase of slurry
Measured 
resource 
means that part of a resource for which tonnage, 
densities, shape, physical characteristics, grade 
and mineral content can be estimated with a high 
level of confidence. It is based on detailed and 
reliable exploration, sampling and testing 
information gathered through appropriate 
techniques from locations such as outcrops, 
trenches, pits, workings and drill holes.  
The locations are spaced closely enough  
to confirm geological and grade continuity
Merrill-Crowe 
process
a technological operation for extraction  
of gold and/or silver after cyanide leaching.  
In the first step slurry containing gold and/or 
silver is separated into liquid and solid phases  
by washing the solids off in countercurrent 
decantation thickeners. In the second step 
pregnant leach solution (liquid phase of slurry)  
is filtered to remove impurities and deaerated. 
Finally, gold and silver are deposited onto the 
solid bed of claylike material where they replace 
zinc particles which pass into a solution. 
Merrill-Crowe is preferentially used  
for silver-rich ores
Mill a mineral processing plant
Mineralisation a rock containing valuable components,  
not necessarily in the quantities sufficient  
for economically justifiable extraction.  
Consists of ore minerals and gangue
Open-pittable amenable for economically feasible mining  
by open-pit methods
Open-pit mine a mine that is entirely on surface. Also referred  
to as open-cut or open-cast mine
Ore the part of mineralisation that can be mined  
and processed profitably
Ore body a spatially compact and geometrically  
connected location of ore
Ore mined ore extracted from the ground for  
further processing
Ore processed ore subjected to treatment in a mineral 
processing plant
Ore stacked the ore stacked for heap leach operations.
Oxidised ore ore in which both ore minerals and gangue  
are fully or partially oxidised thus impacting its 
physical and chemical properties and influencing 
the choice of a processing technology
POX or pressure 
oxidation
a technological operation in which slurry is 
subjected to high pressure and high temperature 
in an autoclave with the goal to destroy sulphide 
particles enveloping gold particles and make 
slurry amenable to cyanide leaching
Precipitate the semi-finished product of mineral processing 
by Merrill-Crowe process, normally containing 
very high concentrations of silver and/or gold
Glossary

account mining dilution and losses. Appropriate 
assessments and studies have been carried out, 
and include consideration of and modification  
by realistically assumed mining, metallurgical, 
economic, marketing, legal, environmental, social 
and governmental factors. These assessments 
demonstrate at the time of reporting that 
extraction could reasonably be justified. Reserves 
are subdivided in order of increasing confidence 
into probable reserves and proved reserves
Resources a concentration or occurrence of material of 
intrinsic economic interest in or on the earth’s 
crust in such form, quality and quantity that  
there are reasonable prospects for eventual 
economic extraction. The location, quantity,

of resources are known, estimated or interpreted 
from specific geological evidence and 
knowledge. Resources are sub-divided

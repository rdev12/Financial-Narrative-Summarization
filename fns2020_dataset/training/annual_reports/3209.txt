Throughout this Report references to British Gas include Scottish Gas.
First half Second half British Gas delivered strong financial returns in a year when it also
reversed the decline in the size of its customer base. This was
achieved not only through lower commodity costs in the first half
but also through lower pricing, the continued removal of excess
costs, the launch of more innovative propositions and a dedication
to improving customer service. During the year Centrica Energy
completed a gas acquisition in the North Sea and acquired
additional gas exploration acreage with strong future potential. 
We continue to look for opportunities to acquire more substantial
gas assets.
Our growth businesses performed very strongly in 2007. British
Gas Business and British Gas Services delivered record results,
underpinned by ongoing growth in customer numbers. In North
America, Direct Energy also delivered record profits against 
the backdrop of a weakening housing market, early signs of an
economic downturn in the United States and adverse exchange
rate movements. It was also another year of record profits in
Centrica Storage. In Europe however, while the Commission
remains supportive of real network unbundling, meaningful
progress on market deregulation was limited.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 9.65 pence (2006: 
8.0 pence) for payment in June 2008 bringing our full-year 
dividend to13.0 pence (2006: 1 1 . 15 pence). This represents 
a17% year-on-year increase, in line with our policy and
commitment to sustained real growth in the ordinary dividend.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Performance review
Centrica delivered very strong financial results during another
challenging year for UK energy retailers.
New pipelines from Norway and the Netherlands, which were
underpinned by long-term gas contracts with British Gas, began 
to bring additional gas to the UK and helped to bring down wholesale
gas prices at the start of the year. This allowed us to show leadership
in the market by passing reductions in the wholesale price on 
to our customers by reducing our retail prices in March and April.
Unfortunately the spectre of high wholesale energy prices appeared
again in the second half of the year as global oil prices reached
record highs and this has continued into the start of 2008. As a
result it was necessary for us to raise customer tariffs in January.
The management team worked diligently through 2007 to minimise
the impact of rising wholesale energy prices, making substantial
inroads into the operating cost base of British Gas and extracting
efficiencies where possible. At the same time we must continue 
to invest in high quality energy assets to serve our UK and
international customers and this reinvestment in our business can
only be funded through the consistent delivery of reasonable and
sustainable profits.
In February 2007 Sam Laidlaw clearly set out four priorities for
Centrica and I believe that management has made some real
progress against these objectives. Sam reports on this progress 
in detail in his review of the year.

Centrica delivered very
strong financial results
during another challenging
year for UK energy retailers. We will, however, continue to take all possible actions 
to minimise the impact to our customers whilst delivering the level
of profitability required to underpin the investments necessary to
secure additional high quality upstream assets.
We have set out a clear agenda for Centrica in the form of four
strategic priorities and we will continue to focus on these as we
move forward. In doing this we will seek to strike the appropriate
balance between driving increased efficiencies in the current 
core UK energy business, providing growth across the Group 
and evaluating and securing additional quality upstream assets 
to reduce exposure to short-term commodity price movements. 
Only by delivering against our priorities will we be able to satisfy 
our customers and reward our employees while maximising returns
for our shareholders.

Board changes
Early in the year we changed the structure of our executive
management team, with Phil Bentley assuming the role of
Managing Director of British Gas, Jake Ulrich adding Europe to 
his responsibilities as Managing Director of our upstream activities
and Nick Luff joining Centrica from P&O as Group Finance Director.
I believe that under the leadership of Sam Laidlaw the team has
already begun to make a real difference to both the short-term
performance and the long-term prospects of Centrica.
Our employees
In a business such as Centrica, people are central to the delivery of
better service and improving financial results. Our employees have
worked hard to support the change in systems, working practices,
organisation structure and management within the Company. 
I thank them all for their loyalty, hard work and dedication. It is a
credit to them that British Gas Business and British Gas Services
were both recognised in the Financial Times T op 50 ‘Best
Workplaces for 2007’.
The future
Wholesale energy prices remain extremely volatile and the high 
gas price at the start of 2008 has squeezed retail supply margins 
in the UK. In these circumstances retail price increases have been
necessary in order to restore reasonable margins.

Delivering our strategy
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Centrica delivered a very strong set of financial results during 
this, my first full year as Chief Executive. We moved the structure 
and operational performance of the business forwards, but we 
still have some way to go.
2007 was a year of two very different halves. In the first half,
wholesale energy prices in the UK were low as a result of increased
supply (through new gas pipelines and liquefied natural gas 
(LNG) facilities) and reduced demand due to warm weather. 
Over two-thirds of our earnings were delivered in this period.
During the second six months, the day ahead wholesale gas 
price was, on average, 56% higher than during the first half. This
significantly reduced margins in our UK residential business. And,
unfortunately, these relatively high wholesale prices have persisted
in the first few months of 2008, necessitating a retail price increase.
Centrica operates in a complex, global and constantly changing
industry that is facing some profound long-term challenges.
Environmental issues will increasingly influence the shape of the
industry. T ougher targets on reducing energy consumption and
cutting greenhouse gases are likely to be implemented worldwide,
and these will push up the price of energy. 
The cost of developing new upstream resources in the UK has 
risen by 80% since 2000, and growth in demand for fossil fuels
from countries such as China and India is also driving a long-term
structural movement towards higher prices. We estimate that 
by 2015 around 75% of the UK’ s total annual gas demand 
could be being met by imports, compared to about 20% in 2007.
Increasing reliance on imports means that the UK, and Centrica, 
will not be cushioned from the impact of global market movements, 
either in terms of price fluctuation or security of supply.
Against this background, our strategy is to create an integrated
energy company, operating upstream by developing new sources 
of gas and power, and downstream with our strong brands and
innovative propositions, to succeed in our chosen markets.
Downstream
The UK gas market is the biggest in Europe. We are the largest
energy supplier in the UK and at the end of 2007 British Gas
Residential once again supplied 16 million customers. British Gas
Services is the largest central heating and gas appliance installation
and maintenance company in the UK, directly employing more than
9,000 engineers. British Gas is the country’ s best-recognised
energy brand. It is also one of the greenest, according to WWF 
and has the lowest carbon intensity* of all major suppliers. We are
one of the UK’ s largest producers and suppliers of wind energy and 
in April we set up British Gas New Energy to expand our offer in 
low-carbon products and services.
In our North American markets, we had over 5 million customers 
at the end of 2007. The combined volume of demand for our 
gas in Canada, the US and Europe will help us to do deals with
large-scale suppliers of LNG worldwide. 
Our experience of deregulated markets in the UK and North America
will also stand us in good stead when European energy markets
finally open up to competition. The European Commission published
proposals in September for the unbundling of electricity and gas
generation and transmission networks across the European Union.
When implemented, these should increase competition in Europe.
But it hasn’t happened yet. 
Upstream
Upstream, we have a strong and increasingly diverse portfolio of
long-term contracts for gas supplies to the UK from the North Sea,
Norway and the Netherlands, as well as our own production. 
These include our Morecambe gas fields, and interests in over 
20 southern North Sea gas fields, including those acquired from
Newfield UK Holdings Limited in October.
From October 2008, we will have LNG import capacity at the 
Isle of Grain which will be able to supply about 6% of Centrica’ s
annual gas demand. We are building our eighth gas-fired power station
(in Devon) and two wind farms off the Lincolnshire coast which will
have a combined capacity of 180MW. We have interests in three
operational wind farms which provide access to188MW of renewable
electricity and we are seeking consent for a further 250MW farm.
Internationally, offices are now established in Nigeria and Norway
following the award of exploration and production licence blocks. 
In 2007 we also acquired further exploration blocks in Norway and
Trinidad. Direct Energy bid for Rockyview Energy Inc, an Alberta-
based oil and gas company, completing the deal in early 2008.
Centrica has four strategic priorities that underpin how we run the
business. Over the next four pages I will explain what these mean
and how we have performed against them this year.
2007 was a year of
substantial achievement 
for Centrica during which 
we made further progress 
on addressing the key 
priorities for the business.
*carbon intensity is the amount of carbon dioxide emitted per unit of electricity produced Lower prices and better service 
led to an increase in the number 
of customers. This, combined with
a fall in commodity prices in the
first six months, meant we delivered
an excellent financial result.
09
Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Transforming British Gas is a priority because profitability and
service levels at British Gas Residential, which is the core 
of our business, have historically been low and variable. 
The transformation aims to:
3 improve our price competitiveness, service levels and product
offer in order to reverse the decline in customer numbers;
3 reduce our costs through ‘best-in-class’ efficiency and
productivity while ensuring that we remain a great place to work;
and 
3 achieve long-term margins of 6-7%.
Progress
We led the industry in reducing prices, cutting them twice during 2007 .
In March and April our tariffs were cut by a total of 1 7% in electricity
and by 20% in gas. We also provided the lowest dual fuel tariff through
our online Click Energy offer. However, because of sharply rising
wholesale energy prices during the second half of 2007 and
continuing into 2008, we were left with no alternative but to increase
retail tariffs in January 2008. Although this was disappointing, retail
prices were still lower when compared to January 2007. The1 5%
increase will help us to re-establish the profit margin we need to
invest in the core energy assets that will provide sustainable
long-term earnings.
Having completed the migration of all our customers to our new
billing system by March, we concentrated on improving the service
that had suffered during the migration process. Service levels
improved significantly. For example, our speed to answer the
telephone improved by almost 75% from the highest point in 
April and we eliminated the entire correspondence backlog.
As a result, we saw fewer complaints and customer losses. 
By December 2007, complaints to energywatch had fallen by 80%
since April and contacts to energywatch are now at their lowest
level since January 2006 when we began to move our customers to
a new billing system. Customer churn has also fallen sharply, and the
number of energy accounts grew by around15,000 during the year.
We continued to reduce operating costs within British Gas compared
to 2006. This, combined with a fall in commodity prices in the 
first six months, meant we delivered an excellent operating profit* 
for the year.

Changes to the organisation 
of the Group have improved
accountability and increased

cost savings achieved
in BGR in 2007
If we are to compete domestically and internationally in the long term,
we need to do what we do better, and at lower cost.
We need to upgrade our skills, increase our business discipline 
and accountability, and materially reduce costs in each business unit
and at the centre.
Progress
Over the past year we have strengthened our executive team with
several key appointments, including a new Group Finance Director
and a new Managing Director for British Gas, and we have
transferred responsibility for our European businesses to the
Managing Director of Centrica Energy. 
We have also focused on the structure of our operating businesses.
Recent initiatives include the separation of power generation in
Centrica Energy to form a line of accountability for our UK power
segment. In North America we introduced a new structure with 
the creation of four business units on functional rather than
geographic lines. 
We have also created three separate profit centres within British Gas
Residential (BGR) to better reflect different customer groups. 
The new units have different objectives and propositions, and a
management structure designed to enhance accountability.
Business discipline has been improved through the introduction 
of systematic quarterly cost reviews of each business unit, a tighter
capital allocation framework, and a new three-year planning horizon
to focus performance.
And we have reduced costs significantly. For example, the
restructuring of British Gas Services has removed £20 million 
of cost a year, and BGR is on track to deliver its £200 million cost
reduction target. Some £139 million of cost savings were achieved
in BGR in 2007 with the balance to be achieved in 2008. During the
year we moved 2,250 back-office jobs to India and rationalised the
corporate centre. This included outsourcing a number of support
services including many of the central finance, information system
and human resource functions.

We want to produce more of the energy that we sell. In the UK we
are able to supply around 25% of our gas requirements and around
67% of our peak electricity requirements from our own resources or
major contracts. The remainder has to be purchased in notoriously
volatile wholesale markets.
We aim to build a profitable UK upstream business to be able to
supply 50% of our gas needs. Our target is to have 35% of our 
retail load supplied from production capacity we own, and 15% 
from new long-term contracts. 
Progress
In October 2007 we bought Newfield UK Holdings Limited 
for £242 million. This brought us a producing gas field, two
development prospects and interests in six licences with the
potential to add around 300 billion cubic feet (bcf) of gas reserves 
in the North Sea. The location of the fields also offers synergies 
with our retail businesses in western Europe, with gas from one 
of the fields delivered in the Netherlands. We added a further 43bcf
of gas reserves by acquiring Rockyview Energy Inc in Alberta,
announced in November and completed in February 2008.
We also acquired interests in licences in Norway and Trinidad
bringing our total at the end of the year to19. From the winter 
of 2010/1 1 , we will have access to a further 2.4 billion cubic metres
(BCM) of LNG import capacity at the Isle of Grain terminal in
addition to the 3.4BCM we have available from October 2008.
Construction continues on our 885MW power station at Langage 
in Devon which will increase our UK generation capacity to over
5GW. It will come online early in 2009. We have also continued to
invest in wind generation capacity. We acquired a 50% share in 
the Braes of Doune wind farm in Stirlingshire in July and concluded
a new170MW power purchase agreement in T exas that brings to
813MW our total power offtake from T exas wind farms. Construction
work started on the180MW Lynn and Inner Dowsing farms off the
coast of Lincolnshire. Lynn and Inner Dowsing is currently the
world’ s largest offshore wind construction project and first power 
is due towards the end of 2008. 
Overall we have 430MW of offshore wind projects in construction 
or early planning stages, which will keep us at the forefront of
renewable generation.

Delivering our strategy
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Centrica’ s growth businesses in the UK, North America and 
Europe have considerable potential for increasing the Group’ s
profitability, and they made strong progress during 2007. In addition,
we are focusing on new opportunities to provide low-carbon products
and services to customers concerned about climate change.
Progress
British Gas Business delivered record profitability, a growing
customer base and improving levels of customer satisfaction; 
while in British Gas Services, account numbers grew by 7% and
operating profits* by 48% as service levels improved dramatically. 
We continued to strengthen our Direct Energy business in 
North America, which was restructured, delivering the targeted 
cost reductions. It also grew its operating profit^* by more than
15% before exchange rate movements, despite increased
competitive pressures and a weaker US housing market that
affected the residential and services businesses. We improved 
the balance of the business too, with one of its four sectors moving 
into profit for the first time and another doubling its contribution.
Ahead of the European Union becoming a fully competitive 
energy market, we are aiming to build a gas and power business 
in north western Europe. In 2007, our operating profits in Europe
more than doubled, we established SPE-Luminus as the
undisputed number two player in Belgium in the electricity and
gas market, and we added 500,000 customer accounts in the
newly liberalised Walloon part of the market.
In April we created a new business unit, British Gas New Energy
(BGNE). British Gas is already a noted force in the supply of ‘green’
electricity and appliances in the UK. BGNE is therefore well placed
to operate successfully in the low-carbon market that is expected
to grow exponentially in the coming years.
In a related move in North America, we formed a new group in 
the upstream and wholesale energy business to focus solely on
carbon and renewables. Direct Energy also launched its first carbon
neutral product as part of its successful market entry into British
Columbia. This has since been extended across Canada.

Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
During 2008, we will continue to focus our efforts on the four
priorities that I set in 2007.
Transforming British Gas 
Our critical short-term priority will be continued focus on our service
to customers while delivering sustainable returns. Longer term, 
we believe that for all energy suppliers to substantially improve
customer service will require a nationwide investment in smart
metering technology.
We will remove an additional £60 million of operating cost and will
invest in the British Gas brand to rebuild its relevance to consumers
not only as a provider of energy but of energy efficiency advice 
and services. 
Cutting costs
We are making cost reduction central to our business culture. 
We will continue to identify and re-engineer outdated processes
and procedures with the aim of becoming the most efficient energy
supplier with the lowest cost per customer. 
We will also introduce new trading and logistic systems into
Centrica Energy to better support our asset portfolio and
downstream businesses, phased over 2008 and 2009.
Strengthening our asset base
With wholesale energy costs still volatile, the importance of 
getting more of our gas and power from our own resources cannot
be overestimated. Our acquisition of the Newfield gas properties
and the investments we are making in both renewables and gas-
fired power generation are important steps in the right direction but
we need to do more. This will be a key strategic priority in 2008.
We will need to continue pursuing power generation and gas asset
opportunities both in the UK and internationally. But we will also
assess opportunities in gas storage and develop our gas exploration
prospects in the UK, Norway, Nigeria and Trinidad.
We will increase our involvement in LNG, where our aim is to become
the downstream partner of choice for the oil companies who own the
rights to the vast majority of the world’ s undeveloped gas resources.
Longer term we will also evaluate carefully the opportunity to participate
in the replacement of the UK’ s fleet of nuclear power stations.
Looking to grow
Our growth businesses are contributing well to the Group, but there
are opportunities for them to do even better, and we will continue 
to drive both top and bottom line improvement in these areas.
In the UK, in British Gas Business we will seek to maintain our
current growth trajectory through ongoing development of our 
routes to market while focusing also on further enhancing the
service we deliver.
British Gas Services is developing additional customer propositions
to make more rapid progress in the on-demand markets. Improving
the links between British Gas Residential, British Gas Services and
BGNE will enable us to make better use of our assets and to develop
new revenue by offering customers more cross-business packages. 
BGNE will become increasingly important in 2008 with growing
customer concern about energy efficiency and the positive effect
that this can have on climate change. In January we announced 
a stronger contractual relationship with Ceres Power on the
development of a domestic combined heat and power boiler using
ground-breaking fuel cell technology, supported by a £20 million
equity investment. We will seek to identify more ways of facilitating
the move towards a low-carbon society while keeping the British
Gas name at the forefront.
In North America there is real potential to grow our business both
organically and through acquisition in our existing markets and
geographies. Short-term prospects will be affected by the depth
and length of any economic downturn but we will seek to minimise
the impact through the increasing diversity of our business streams.
Developing our businesses in Europe remains challenging. This
year we will concentrate on simplifying the ownership structure of
SPE in Belgium as the merger of Suez and Gaz de France proceeds.
We will also continue to grow our Belgian, Dutch and Spanish
businesses, and to establish ourselves firmly in the industrial and
commercial market in Germany.
In summary, we will be following the same path in 2008 as we 
have in 2007, guided by the same priorities that we have laid down.
The UK market faces high wholesale energy prices which appear 
to be taking their lead from the oil-linked gas markets of continental
Europe and our other markets are feeling the effects of weakening
economic conditions. In this environment it is important that 
we remain single-minded in making our operations leaner and 
more efficient to give us the best chance of success in the UK 
and internationally.
Centrica is a strong business with a clear sense of direction and the
momentum to make the best of its unique strengths. I am confident
that we will be able to take significant strides in 2008.

^ Market shares for 2006 are based on a gas market size of 21,403,959 and an electricity
market size of 26,695,229, as stated by Ofgem in its Domestic Market Retail Report –
March 2006.
Market shares for 2007 are based on a gas market size of 21 ,567 ,261 and an electricity market
size of 26,917 ,561 , as stated by Ofgem in its Domestic Market Retail Report – June 2007.
Overall 2007 was a strong year for British Gas as we delivered 
an excellent financial result, with margins above our long-run
expectations. We also made considerable progress in improving
customer service and stabilising the size of our customer base.
The commodity price environment during the year was extremely
volatile, with a fall in wholesale gas prices early in the year leading 
to a rapid expansion in margins and enabling British Gas to be the
first energy supplier to announce reduced prices for customers. 
In March we lowered prices for credit customers in gas by17% 
and in electricity by 1 1 % and followed this up in April with a further
3% reduction in gas prices and 6% in electricity prices. However,
wholesale gas and power prices rose through the second half of the
year and squeezed margins in this period to just above breakeven. 
The quality of our customer service had suffered through 2006 
and into the early part of 2007 as we migrated all of our customers
to a new billing system. Since completing this migration operational
exceptions have been running at a higher level. We have continued
to improve the data quality in our systems and have focused on the
overall service levels we provide to our customers. In the second
half of the year we improved the time taken to answer inbound
customer telephone calls by 75% from its highest point in April 
and we eliminated the entire backlog of customer email and written
correspondence. The results of our improving service were reflected
in the level of customer complaints to energywatch which had fallen
from the high point in April by over 80% by December.
Our more competitive pricing and the improvements we have made
to customer service helped us to stabilise our customer base in 2007.
From a low point in April of 15.8 million energy accounts we have
returned once again to serving just over 16 million accounts.
As part of the transformation of British Gas we have improved
accountability for the customer experience and the operating
performance by reorganising into three separate lines of business.
This resulted in the creation of a dedicated ‘pay as you go’ business
to focus directly on customers who use prepayment meters, 
where fundamentally different processes are required. We have 
also split the remaining business between the lower volume
customers and those who make up the highest value segment. 
Revenue for the year decreased by 9% to £6,457 million 
(2006: £7 , 1 12 million) due to lower average customer numbers
across the year and lower average energy consumption levels 
as a result of unusually warm weather, particularly in the early part 
of the year.Operating profit* however increased to £571million
(2006: £95 million) with the majority delivered in the first half of the
year, £533 million (2006: a loss of £1 43 million). This was due to
lower commodity costs and lower controllable operating costs.
Commodity costs were down by just over £1billion to £3.2 billion,
more than offsetting the revenue reduction. This net benefit was
partially offset by the ongoing increases in energy transportation
and distribution costs which were up by £92 million over 2006. 
The cost of delivering our Energy Efficiency Commitment (EEC) in
the year was £91million (2006: £90 million). As EEC is a mandatory
cost of supply for all the major UK energy suppliers we now account 
for this cost within cost of goods rather than operating expenses
and have restated the comparable figures for 2006 accordingly.  17

Operating costs decreased by £1 39 million to £800 million (2006:
£939 million). While we continued our drive to reduce costs there
was a delay in this reduction in 2007 as we placed an even greater
priority on the improvement in customer service. We expect 
to remove an additional £60 million of operating costs in 2008,
achieving the full £200 million of targeted savings against the 
2006 baseline.
British Gas Business
We continued to have high contract renewal rates
We increased the number of customer supply
points by more than 2%
We increased our operating margins
British Gas Business sells gas, electricity and energy-related
services – including carbon-offsetting – to small, medium
and large corporate businesses. The introduction of our
dedicated account managers has helped to improve levels 
of customer service. 
British Gas Business performed well during the year. Against 
a backdrop of volatility in commodity markets we delivered 
a record financial result and grew our customer base while
continuing to improve our customer satisfaction measures.
Revenue increased by 6% to £2,431million (2006: £2,303 million)
due to the net positive impact of price changes during 2006 and
2007, higher customer numbers in both fuels and higher average
consumption in electricity driven by the increase in the number 
of large corporate customers. This was only partially offset by 
the lower average consumption in gas which resulted from warm
weather primarily in the first half of the year. Customer supply point
numbers increased by 2% to 954,000 (2006: 932,000) on strong
sales performance and the maintenance of high contract renewal
rates particularly in our SME business.
Operating profit* was up 38% to £120 million (2006: £87 million).
This included a contribution of £38 million (2006: £29 million) from 
a favourable historic electricity procurement contract. This contract
will also provide a small benefit in 2008 before it expires. The primary
drivers of the year-on-year uplift were the widening of margins
during the contract renewal process and the positive effect of the
lower commodity prices on the tariff book. These positive impacts
on gross margin enabled us to lift operating margins in the year 
to 4.9% (2006: 3.8%).
In customer service we are beginning to see positive results from
our implementation of a differentiated service model based on
dedicated account managers. During the year, while migrating 
the majority of our gas customer accounts to our new gas billing
system, we improved the level of customer satisfaction across 
the business. 
British Gas Services
We increased our operating profit* by 48%
We delivered improved levels of customer service 
British Gas Services is the largest domestic central

company in the UK. We directly employ more than 9,000
engineers who also provide comprehensive maintenance
and breakdown services for electrical white goods and
home wiring. Our Dyno brand provides plumbing, drains 
and home security services across the UK.
British Gas Services performed strongly in 2007 both financially 
and operationally. This was supported by the improvements made
to customer service, engineer deployment and system stability,
which provide us with a strong platform for continued growth.

Revenue was up by 16% at £1 ,279 million (2006: £1 , 104 million) 
as the total number of customer product relationships increased by
7% to 7 .6 million (2006: 7 . 1 million). During the year we increased
the number of customers who take our Homecare Flexi product,
which provides the customer with a lower price entry point to 
our services, we enhanced our online offerings and continued to
promote our wider product range through cross-selling. We also
strengthened our presence in the on-demand market through our
central heating repair service for non-contract customers, with our
number of repairs increasing by 19% to 414,000 (2006: 347,000).
Operating profit* increased by 48% to £151 million (2006: 
£102 million), ahead of revenue growth, due to the strong growth 
in higher margin care products outside the core central heating
range, combined with the continued focus on cost control and
overhead savings. In addition, profitability in the central heating
installation business grew as the number of installations, including
those for the Scottish Executive, increased by 24% to1 13,000

Centrica Energy
The acquisition of Newfield added 67bcfe 
to our gas reserves
We generated 36% more electricity
Centrica Energy sources the gas and electricity we supply
to our residential and business customers in the UK and
Europe. This comes from our own upstream gas production,
electricity generation and renewable energy operations, 
and through the management of our gas and electricity
purchase contracts and wholesale energy trading.
Centrica Energy performed well during a difficult year for our
upstream business when the day ahead wholesale gas price 
in the UK fluctuated between a low of 13 pence per therm (p/th) 
in April to a high of 59p/th in December. The operating profitability 
of Centrica Energy was adversely affected by the low wholesale 
gas prices in the first quarter of the year which reduced the gas
production results. This was partially offset by improved profitability
in the legacy industrial and commercial contracts resulting in 
overall operating profit* being down just 3% to £663 million 
(2006: £686 million).
The segmental reporting disclosure for Centrica Energy now
includes the results from our UK power generation assets as a
separate segment, with sales from this segment to the downstream
business based on market prices for power. The operating costs 
of Centrica Energy that were previously held within the industrial
sales and wholesaling segment have been allocated across the
appropriate business areas. As the power stations were managed
on a different basis in 2006, prior period figures have not been
restated and no result is reported for the power generation 
segment for 2006.
Gas production and development
Gas production and development includes all of the activities
relating to producing gas, oil and condensates and the related
exploration and development activities. It contains both our 
fully owned assets and our share of joint venture assets.
Operating profit* for gas production and development was down 
by 50% to £429 million (2006: £864 million). The total hydrocarbon
volume produced during the year was up17% on the previous year
after a difficult first half, with a recovery of production levels in the
second half of the year as the wholesale price rose and the newly
acquired Grove field came onstream. The low wholesale gas price
which affected the first half production levels brought down the
average price achieved for the gas produced by 43% at 30.4p/th
(2006: 53. 1p/th). Oil and condensate production volumes were in line
with 2006 at 5.6 million barrels of oil equivalent (Mboe).
The rate of variable operating costs per Mboe produced decreased
year-on-year by 5% due to proportionately higher production levels
from Morecambe. Other production costs increased due 
to the inclusion in the 2006 result of profits on disposal and the
underlying cost inflation across the industry which particularly
affected our joint venture operations. 19

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
During the year we added an additional 1 14 billion cubic feet
equivalent (bcfe) to our proven and probable gas and liquids 
reserve base, of which 67bcfe came from the acquisition of 
Newfield UK Holdings Limited in October. We also invested 
£154 million in developing our current portfolio of upstream assets,
primarily on the development of the Maria field, which is currently
being commissioned, and on the depressurisation of the Statfjord
field to bring forward gas recovery.
Following additional capital spend we expect to realise a 
further 238bcfe from the Newfield acquisition. During the year 
we also acquired seven licence interests in Norway and one in
Trinidad to add to our existing acreage in the UK, Egypt and Nigeria.

feasibility of developing LNG projects with our joint Nigerian assets
and we commenced seismic activities on one of these assets.
Industrial and commercial 
The industrial and commercial segment contains the results from
the long-term legacy gas sales contracts. These delivered a profit*
of £179 million in the year, of which £148 million was in the first half,
primarily due to the fall in gas prices in the early part of the year 
and the rising average selling price. The volume of gas delivered
reduced by 15% as three contracts ended in September 2006.
Power generation
This segment contains the results from all of the generation assets
including the Spalding power station which is recognised on the
Group Balance Sheet. T otal operating profit* for the year was 
£46 million. All of the profit was delivered in the first half of the 
year when the low gas prices pushed up spark spreads, making 
it profitable to run some of our gas-fired stations at baseload 
and displacing competitors’ coal stations in the merit order.
In the year we generated 19.8TWh (2006: 14.6TWh) from our 4. 3GW
fleet of gas-fired power stations and our 107MW of wind assets, up
by 36% as the overall load factor in the conventional fleet increased
to 55% (2006: 40%). The average load factor for the fleet was lower
in the second half of the year due to planned and unplanned
outages which also coincided with periods of high spark spreads.
In July, we acquired a 50% ownership in the 72MW Braes of Doune
wind farm from Airtricity for £42 million. We spent £104 million in the
ongoing development of the two 90MW wind farms at Lynn and
Inner Dowsing, currently the world’ s largest offshore wind construction
project. The onshore cabling and the turbine foundations are in place
and we expect to generate the first power from these assets in the
third quarter of 2008. In January 2007 we also submitted a planning
application for the 250MW Round T wo Lincs offshore wind farm.
We made good progress with our 885MW gas-fired plant at Langage
in Devon. This year we spent £143 million of the anticipated 
£400 million budget and expect to commence operations in the 
first quarter of 2009. We continued our feasibility study at Eston
Grange on T eesside for the potential development of an Integrated
Gasification Combined Cycle (IGCC) power station with the ability
to sequestrate carbon. However the government’ s decision to
provide economic support for only a post-combustion technology
station has made further material investment here less likely.
Energy procurement
In May we secured further gas import capacity at the Isle of Grain
allowing us to import an additional 2.4 billion cubic metres (BCM) 
per annum for 19 years from 2010/1 1. This increases our total
capacity at the Isle of Grain terminal to 5.8BCM per year. Late in 
the year, due to continued planning delays, we announced our
withdrawal from the consortium planning to construct an LNG
terminal at Canvey Island.
Accord trading
Accord delivered a reduced profit in the year, down 72% at

Centrica Storage
We delivered strong financial results
We launched a new virtual storage product
Centrica Storage owns and operates the UK’s largest gas
storage facility. We sell gas storage and other services 
to a wide range of gas market participants including
Centrica Energy.
Centrica Storage delivered a strong financial and operational result,
reporting a record operating profit* of £240 million (2006: £228
million). This improvement reflects both the increase in the average
Standard Bundled Unit (SBU) price for the year , up 1 .6% to 57.4 pence
(2006: 56.5 pence) driven by a wider spread between summer and
winter forward gas prices, and the continued growth in non-SBU
revenue. A subsequent narrowing of the summer/winter gas price
spread reduced the average SBU price for the 2007/08 storage
year to 53.4 pence (2006/07: 65.6 pence).
Ongoing investment in Rough to improve its injection and withdrawal
capabilities enabled us both to continue to sell significant volumes
of additional space, 172 million therms (mmth) in 2007 (2006:
157mmth), and generate additional revenue, particularly from the
new virtual storage product, V Store. Launched in May 2007 this
product has the equivalent rights to an SBU but delivery of gas is
guaranteed to the National Balancing Point. This guarantee meant
that this product sold at a substantial premium to the price of an SBU.
Operationally the Rough field performed well, delivering injection
and production availability of more than 98%. This was achieved
whilst also securing and improving our health and safety
performance. A recent review undertaken by the Health and Safety
Executive, into systems to ensure asset integrity, placed Rough 
in the top quartile of all North Sea installations surveyed.

Direct Energy
We delivered another successive year of 
profit growth*
We made continued progress on diversification 
of the business
Our Direct Energy brand is one of North America’s largest
energy and energy service providers, with over 5 million
residential and business customers in Canada and the US.
We own and operate gas reserves in Canada, and electricity
generation capacity in Texas.
Direct Energy performed well during a year in which we continued 
to develop our activities beyond the mass markets energy supply
operations. We also restructured the business into four pan-North
American lines of business. This enables greater focus on key groups
of customers to drive growth and efficiencies of scale through
shared operations.
Due to changes during the year in the relationship with 
The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund, which are explained 
in more detail under Discontinued Operations on page 22, 
the decision was taken to deconsolidate the Fund’ s results 
with effect from1December 2007. This commentary covers 
the results of the remaining Direct Energy operations.
Excluding the negative impact of exchange rate movements, 
Direct Energy delivered top and bottom line underlying growth. 
The reported results were adversely impacted by the weakness 
of the US dollar against sterling through the year and, to a lesser
extent, the Canadian dollar in the first half of the year. Whilst reported
revenue^ was down 1.4% at £3.99 billion (2006: £4.05 billion),
underlying revenue^ was up 4.9%. This was driven by strong growth
both in commercial and industrial energy and in upstream and
wholesale energy, which offset lower revenues in mass markets
energy and in home and business services. 
Reported operating profit*^ was up 8% at £187 million 
(2006: £173 million), with underlying profit* before exchange rate
movements up more than 15%. The significant fall in profits* in 
mass markets energy was more than offset by improvements 
in other areas of the business.

Mass markets energy
Mass markets energy comprises natural gas and electricity sales to
residential and small commercial customers across North America.
Mass markets energy experienced difficult trading conditions during
the year, particularly the second half, following the expiry of five-year
electricity contracts in Ontario, signed at market opening in 2002,
combined with the expected competitive pressures in our T exas
business following the expiry of Price to Beat regulation and the
impact on margins of the takeover of TXU. These factors resulted 
in a fall in customer numbers. However by the year end this position
had stabilised and we were once again growing the overall customer
base in the last two months of the year.
Reported revenue was down 12% to £2,437 million (2006: £2,765
million) and reported operating profit* was down 22% at £123 million
(2006: £157 million). Before the impact of exchange rate movements
underlying revenue was down 6% with operating profit* down15%.
Commercial and industrial energy
Commercial and industrial energy comprises natural gas and
electricity sales to medium and large-sized businesses, public
institutions and government.
Rapid growth in this segment continued during the year with
volumes up13% and 24% in gas and electricity respectively.
Reported revenue was up15% to £978 million (2006: £847 million),
with underlying revenues up 24%. The business moved into profit
during the second half as volumes grew and it recorded a £1million
profit* for the full year (2006: loss* of £12 million) with profits* in the
more mature Canadian and T exas businesses offset by the costs 
of continued rapid growth in the north eastern US. 
Home and business services
This line of business comprises home and business services 
across North America. 
Services had a good year despite challenging market conditions,
with continued deepening of the housing recession in the US.
During the year we grew our customer numbers by 3.5% to over 
2 million for the first time. In the US, our mainly residential new
construction business weathered the housing market downturn
well, gained market share in a shrinking market and expanded its
consumer service business. The acquisition in January of MABE, 
a service provider for white goods, enabled us to launch an
appliance protection and repair business across Canada.
Reported revenue^ was down 7% to £351million (2006: 
£378 million), although it remained flat on an underlying basis.
Following the restructuring of the business services operation and
the increased focus on cost control to improve competitiveness, 
this has resulted in a near doubling of operating profit*^ to 
£17 million (2006: £9 million). 
Upstream and wholesale energy
This business unit comprises our upstream and midstream
activities which include upstream gas, power generation, 
gas storage and transportation leases, wholesale power and 
gas transactions, wind power purchase agreements and
proprietary trading.
We delivered operating profit* of £46 million, up 142% on the prior
year (2006: £19 million) with strong contributions from our power
stations, wind power contracts as 433MW of new capacity came
onstream, wholesale energy auctions and proprietary trading.
Power generated increased by 14% to 5. 1TWh, whilst gas
production was broadly unchanged at 297 million therms. During
the year, through our ongoing drilling programme, we replaced
1 17% of the gas we produced.
In November we announced an agreed offer to acquire Rockyview
Energy Inc for around £57 million including debt. On successful
completion in February 2008, this added 2,700boe per day to our
hydrocarbon production, largely as natural gas. This acquisition 
is in line with our strategy of increasing the overall level of vertical
integration and further developing this revenue stream.

European Energy
We increased our customer base in Belgium
We re-entered the Spanish electricity market
We agreed a 20-year tolling contract for a new
gas-fired power station in the Netherlands
We are involved in power generation, energy management
and retail energy supply, particularly in the increasingly
interconnected energy markets of north western Europe. 
Our European Energy business performed well in 2007, more than
doubling its operating profit* to £17 million (2006: £7 million).
In Belgium in January 2007 we completed the transfer of around
500,000 Wallonian residential customer accounts to our
SPE-Luminus business, increasing our total energy customer base
to 1 .4 million. As part of the remedies required to enable the merger
of Gaz de France (GdF) and Suez, GdF must dispose of their 25.5%
holding in SPE. Centrica has pre-emption rights over this stake. 
In the Netherlands we continued to grow our customer base
through the Oxxio brand and now supply approximately 754,000
customer accounts. During the year we installed around 75,000
smart meters and are working with the regulator to ensure Oxxio’ s
meters are compatible with future industry standards. We also
entered into a 20-year tolling contract with Intergen for a 400MW
gas-fired power station in Rijnmond, near Rotterdam, which is
expected to be commercially operational by summer 2010.
In January 2007 we rebranded our Spanish operation from 
Luseo to Centrica Energía. As market conditions improved we
successfully re-entered the electricity supply market and have
already contracted 0.9TWh of annual consumption. We also grew
our portfolio of energy managed on behalf of ‘special regime’
generators to 650MW.
As a result of the positive developments in the legal and regulatory
framework for competition within the German energy market 
we opened an operation in Düsseldorf selling to the commercial
supply market through Centrica Energie GmbH.
Discontinued operations
The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund was deconsolidated on
1December 2007, the date of an Internalisation Agreement entered

Centrica’ s financial aim is to achieve a total shareholder return 
(TSR) ranking in the first quartile of UK FTSE 100 Index companies,
taking into account share price growth and dividends received and
reinvested over a sustained period. Centrica seeks to maximise the
return on capital it achieves in excess of its cost of capital, within a
prudent risk management framework. The Remuneration Report
summarises our TSR performance over recent years against our
comparator FTSE 100 Index group.
Financial statements
Group revenue
Group revenue from continuing operations remained broadly flat at
£16.3 billion (2006: £16.4 billion). Increases in British Gas Services
and British Gas Business as well as the first reported revenues 
from our Power Generation business were offset by the reduction
seen in British Gas Residential due to lower gas and power
consumption levels.
Group operating profit
Group operating profit* from continuing operations was up 40% to
£1,949 million (2006: £1,392 million). The year-on-year movement
was primarily due to the turnaround in the profitability of British Gas
Residential and the industrial and commercial gas supply contracts
due to the reduction in the wholesale gas price in the first half of 2007.
Record operating profits* were also made in British Gas Business,
British Gas Services, Centrica Storage and Direct Energy. 
The statutory profit for the year was £1,505 million (2006: loss of
£155 million). The reconciling items between adjusted Group profit* and
the statutory profit are exceptional items, certain re-measurements
and discontinued operations, which are explained below. 
Group earnings
Group earnings* on a continuing basis were up by 60% to £1,121
million (2006: £701 million). This growth in earnings* came from the
higher operating profit* combined with a significant change in profit
mix towards greater downstream contributions, resulting in a lower
effective group tax rate of 40% in the year (2006: 44%). Interest
payments were also lower, at £73 million (2006: £141 million),
following the favourable cash flow position held for most of the year.
The interest charge includes a one-off charge of £40 million relating
to the early repayment of the finance lease on the Humber power
station, which helps simplify the Group’ s debt structure.
Earnings per share and dividends
Adjusted earnings per share* improved by 58% to 30.6 pence 
in 2007, up from 19.4 pence in 2006. The Group reported basic
earnings per share of 41.0 pence, up from a basic loss per share 
of 4.3 pence in 2006, reflecting the post-tax impact of exceptional
charges and certain re-measurements which were positive in 
2007, having been negative in 2006.
In addition to the interim dividend of 3.35 pence, per share, 
we propose a final dividend of 9.65 pence, giving a total ordinary
dividend of 13.00 pence for the year (2006: 11.15 pence), 
an increase of 17%.
Cash flow
Group operating cash flow before movements in working capital
was up from £1,892 million in 2006 to £2,494 million. After working
capital adjustments, operational interest, tax, exceptional charges and
discontinued items, this stood at £2,357 million (2006: £737
million). This increase in operating cash flow is primarily due to
increased earnings and a decrease in the amount of tax paid. The
net cash outflow from investing activities increased to £964 million 
(2006: £720 million), 34% higher than last year due to the Group’ s
acquisition of Newfield UK Holdings Limited and a 50% share in 
the Braes of Doune wind farm. The net cash outflow from financing
activities increased to £888 million (2006: £597 million), an increase
of 49% on 2006, due mainly to the prepayment of the Humber
finance lease. This resulted in a net cash outflow of £368 million
relating to principal and £54 million relating to interest.
Net debt and interest
The Group’ s net recourse debt level at 31 December 2007 was
£795 million (2006: £1,527 million). This was down from 2006, 
due primarily to improved operating cash flow. This debt includes
£417 million of finance lease commitments on the Spalding 
power station.
As a result of changes in the relationship with The Consumers’
Waterheater Income Fund, with effect from 1 December 2007 
we no longer consolidate the period results and the Balance Sheet
of the Fund in Centrica’ s Group accounts. This has reduced the

Group’ s net borrowings by £573 million. These borrowings were
previously classified as non-recourse and hence not included in 
net recourse debt.
Net assets
During the year net assets increased to £3,382 million from 
£1,642 million as at 31 December 2006. In addition to the retained
earnings, net assets were increased by positive movements 
on the mark-to-market of the Group’ s financial instruments as
detailed below.
Exceptional items
There were no exceptional items reported in continuing operations
in 2007 (2006: pre-tax charge of £331 million).
Discontinued operations
The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund was deconsolidated 
on 1 December 2007, the closing date of an Internalisation
Agreement entered into between Direct Energy and the Fund 
which materially altered the relationship between the two entities.
Details of the impact of the deconsolidation are included in note 3(a)
and note 35(ii).
Certain re-measurements
In our business we enter into a portfolio of forward energy contracts
which include buying substantial quantities of commodity to meet
the future needs of our customers. A number of these arrangements
are considered to be derivative financial instruments and are
required to be fair-valued under IAS 39. 
Fair valuing means that we apply the prevailing forward market
prices to these contracts. The Group has shown the fair value
adjustments separately as certain re-measurements, as they are
unrealised and non-cash in nature. The profits* arising from the
physical purchase and sale of commodities during the year, 
which reflect the prices in the underlying contracts, are not
impacted by these re-measurements.
The statutory results include credits to operating profit relating 
to these re-measurements of £235 million (2006: net charge of
£931 million), primarily from marking-to-market some contracts
relating to our energy procurement activities. As gas and power
were delivered under these contracts, the net out-of-the-money
mark-to-market positions were unwound generating a net credit 
to the Income Statement in the period of £352 million (2006: 
net charge of £287 million). As the forward prices increased in 
2007, the portfolio of contracts fair valued under IAS 39 reported 
a net charge on revaluation of £104 million (2006: charge of 
£638 million). The remaining charge of £13 million (2006: charge 
of £6 million) reflects the proprietary trading positions relating 
to cross-border capacity and storage contracts.
Acquisition and capital expenditure
During the year the Group acquired Newfield UK Holdings Limited,
an exploration and production group with activities focused in the
UK Southern Gas Basin, for cash consideration of £242 million,
along with a number of smaller acquisitions. 
Accounting policies
UK listed companies are required to comply with the European
regulation to report consolidated financial statements in conformity
with International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS). The
Group’ s significant accounting policies, including changes of
accounting presentation, are explained in note 2 to the Financial
Statements. Note 3 to the Financial Statements explains the critical
accounting judgements and key sources of estimation uncertainty
arising in the preparation of the Financial Statements.

Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Centrica, like all businesses, faces risks and uncertainties as 
we conduct our operations and there are a number of risks that 
could impact the Group’ s short and long-term performance.
We place great importance on internal control and risk management.
A risk-aware and control-conscious environment is promoted and
encouraged throughout the Group. We take steps to understand and
evaluate risks to support the creation of long-term sustainable returns
for shareholders. We have a robust risk management process in
place, which is designed to identify , manage and mitigate business
risk. This process is described in more detail in the Corporate
Governance Report on page 36.
The factors described below highlight the principal risks and
uncertainties that affect the Group but are not intended to be an
exhaustive analysis of all the risks which may arise in the ordinary
course of business or otherwise. Some risks may be unknown 
to the Group and other risks, currently regarded as immaterial, 
could turn out to be material.
External market factors
Commodity prices 
Our energy requirements to serve our gas and electricity customers
are dependent on the wholesale commodity markets for gas, 
oil, coal, carbon and power prices, all of which have been volatile 
in recent years. The outlook for 2008 continues to be difficult to
predict due in part to the uncertain economic environment and the
impact of geopolitical events. The price of gas in the UK market is
particularly important for us given the high proportion of the retail
gas market we serve and our fleet of gas-fired power stations.
T o manage this risk, we optimise our asset and contract portfolio
through an approach based on extensive analysis of our supply 
and demand position and continuous assessment of the commodity
markets in which we operate (see note 4 to the Financial Statements
on page 69). Our policy is to hedge a proportion of the exposure 
for a number of years ahead linked to the underlying profiles of 
our customers’ energy requirements through bilateral agreements
for gas and power and the use of financial instruments such as 
oil and gas swaps.
While this hedging strategy has mitigated increases in commodity
prices for a period, we had to increase retail energy prices in
January 2008. A continuing volatile commodity price environment,
particularly with regard to gas costs, may lead to further retail price
adjustments. The combination of variable commodity costs and 
the extent to which these costs are passed through to consumers,
will mean that margins will remain volatile, thereby affecting Group
earnings. Furthermore, the unpredictability of commodity prices,
including carbon (particularly with the uncertainty of the future
trading regime), hampers the calculation of reliable forecasts 
to support investment decisions potentially leading to lower 
than expected returns.
Consumption
Gas sales volumes, and to a lesser extent electricity sales volumes,
are affected by temperature and other weather factors. Customers’
demand behaviour will also be influenced by the national economic
climate, gas and electricity prices and an increasing awareness 
of the environmental impact of energy use. The development and
application of new technologies, either from the use of domestic
energy generating units (such as micro-combined heat and power
units), and/or greater use of demand-side management technology
(such as smart metering), could also affect demand in the medium
term and therefore the Group’ s earnings. We monitor consumption
trends and have developed a portfolio of low-carbon products and
services for our customers.
In addition, we use historical consumption patterns to estimate
customer usage and therefore the value of the future benefits 
that will flow to us. Any change in those benefits would change 
the value of the revenue recognised. For further details see note 3
to Financial Statements on page 67.
Level of competitive activity
The markets in which we operate are highly competitive and subject
to customer churn rates that are sensitive to price changes and
levels of customer service.
T o ensure we retain our competitive position, we need to combine
attractive products and propositions with high quality customer
service, maintain an efficient cost structure and, for energy supply,
procure energy competitively. Accordingly, we actively monitor
customer trends and competitor activity to respond to changing
circumstances by developing retention campaigns and innovative
Principal Risks and
Uncertainties 
Managing our risks
The identification and 
assessment of risks, 
together with the
implementation of effective
mitigating controls, are 
fundamental to achieving 
our strategic
objectives. 26
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
customer offerings. In addition, we retain a strong focus on reducing
operating costs, as failure to sustain competitive cost levels will
challenge our ability to deliver sustainable operating margins.
Regulatory factors
The energy markets in the UK, North America and Europe are
subject to comprehensive operating requirements as defined by 
the relevant sector regulators and/or government departments.
Amendments to the regulatory regime could have an impact on our
ability to achieve our financial goals. Furthermore, we are obliged
to comply with supply and wholesale industry procedures,
amendments to which could have an impact on our operating
costs. We are also subject to regulated charges for transportation
and distribution of energy. Material increases in these charges 
will impact our margins, to the extent that any such increases 
cannot be passed on to our customers.
The UK Energy Bill has had little adverse impact on the Group. 
We continue to monitor drafting amendments and revisions during
the passage of the Bill which could introduce new requirements 
in relation to smart meters (with the potential for additional costs
if existing meters become obsolete) and supplier social tariffs.
In Europe, while the European Commission remains supportive of
network unbundling, meaningful progress on European market
deregulation continues to be limited. The need for effective
competition is emphasised by the current level of consolidation
activity in Europe, which could not only have an impact on our
participation in European energy markets but also the ability to
source and transport gas across Europe to the UK.
In North America the risk of political or regulatory intervention in
energy markets remains an uncertainty and could have an impact
on the projected growth of our operations. While the 2007 session
of the T exas legislature concluded without any material changes 
to the electricity market or competition rules, this issue remains in
the political spotlight and could be reviewed during the next
legislative session which begins in early 2009. Specific reviews
regarding electricity deregulation are ongoing in a limited number 
of jurisdictions but energy policy, particularly electricity, remains 
a highly politicised topic throughout North America.
In order to mitigate these risks, we continue to monitor political and
regulatory developments and engage with the relevant stakeholders
through targeted contact programmes with regulators, government
ministers and senior officials.
Operational factors
Climate change
With the increasing recognition of the impact of climate change on
our environment, we believe we can make an important contribution
to support a low-carbon economy. Our climate change strategy
recognises both the risks and opportunities that will shape our future
operations and ultimately the longer-term success of our business.
Our strategy is designed to address the risks this may present,
such as new legislation, changing customer behaviour including
growing demand for low-carbon products and services, and the
reputational risks of not taking a leadership position.
Further information on our approach to climate change is available 
in the Corporate Responsibility Review on page 30.
Information systems
Large, effective and secure information systems are critical for 
the efficient management and accurate billing of our customers 
and to support our energy trading and optimisation activities. 
Any significant disruption to these systems could adversely affect
our operations and so there are business continuity plans in place.
T o improve efficiency, we continue to invest in our systems supported
by strong project management to minimise the associated
implementation risk. In addition, controls to ensure the confidentiality,
availability and integrity of customer and Company data remain a
core element of system development and continuous improvement.
Security of supply
As UK gas reserves have declined, the UK energy market has
become increasingly reliant on pipelines from Norway and mainland
Europe together with liquefied natural gas supplies from other 
parts of the world. Accordingly, a key element of security of supply 
is access to these reserves and the reliability of the pipeline and 
gas processing infrastructure operated by Centrica and third parties
both in the UK and abroad. Any break in this supply chain could
jeopardise the supply to customers and impact our earnings.
T o respond to this changing environment, we have supported new
infrastructure development to bring gas to the UK, such as the
Langeled pipeline. In addition, we continue to acquire assets, such 
as Newfield UK Holdings Limited, and sign long-term supply contracts 
to replace declining gas reserves. We will continue to seek
opportunities to secure and develop gas and power assets in the 
UK and overseas, and continually review our security arrangements
to protect those assets.
Health and safety
We manage significant health and safety risks associated with the
operation of our onshore and offshore gas production, gas storage
and power generation assets. In addition, our service engineers 
in the UK and North America complete more than 8 million home
visits each year to carry out essential work on gas and electrical
installations, appliance maintenance and plumbing and drain
services. We are committed to maintaining high standards of health
and safety and our risk management and governance processes
meet internationally recognised standards of good practice.
Significant health and safety events could have an adverse impact
on personal safety, gas and/or power production or our reputation.
Although the likelihood of such events is low, we continue to 
target risk reduction in our operations to minimise the possibility 
of incidents occurring. 
Further information on our approach is available in the Corporate
Responsibility Review on page 31 .
UK customer service
The delivery of good quality customer service is central to our
business strategy. The implementation of a new billing system for
our UK residential energy customers led to levels of customer service
that were lower than we aspire to. Through continued focus in this
area during 2007 we are now seeing improved levels of customer

service and reduced customer complaints. We carefully monitor
these service levels and performance throughout our retail
operations, to ensure continual improvement.
Outsourcing and offshoring
We have entered into a number of outsourcing contracts, some of
which are offshore, in respect of certain support functions for our
businesses in the UK and North America. As with any contractual
relationship, there are inherent risks to be considered and mitigated. 
We have worked closely with our chosen suppliers to ensure 
the delivery of benefits with strong focus by management in the
retained organisation playing an important part in the successful
transition and implementation. The Centrica Executive Committee
regularly reviews progress and, in addition, a centre of expertise 
has been developed to capture and share best practice.
Brand and reputation
Our business principles, which apply to all employees and business
partners, set out our commitment to operate professionally, fairly
and with integrity wherever we work in the world. Failure to follow
these principles could harm our reputation, damage our brand 
and affect our operational performance and financial position. 
A combination of awareness training and targeted controls
(including fraud and data protection) is in place to encourage 
and monitor adherence to these principles.
As part of the demerger in 1997 , Centrica was assigned ownership
of the British Gas trademark and related logos for use in the UK. BG
Group plc has the right to call for a reassignment of this intellectual
property if control of Centrica is acquired by a third party. If, as a
result of a change of control, we are unable to continue to use the
British Gas trademark and logos, this could adversely affect our
competitive position.
Financial factors
Liquidity
Cash forecasts identifying the liquidity requirements for the Group
are produced frequently. These are stress-tested for different
scenarios and are reviewed regularly by the Board to ensure that
sufficient headroom exists for at least a 12-month period. Any 
failure to maintain sufficient headroom could have an impact on our
operations. Our policy is to maintain a minimum level of committed
facilities and ensure that a proportion of debt should be long-term
and spread over a range of maturities. 
Currency
Through wholly-owned US and Canadian subsidiaries and 
wholly-owned and partly-owned European entities, the Group 
has operational exposure in US and Canadian dollars and euros.
Our policy is to maintain the sterling book value of our foreign
currency investment through balance sheet hedging instruments.
US dollar, Canadian dollar and euro balance sheet translation
exposure is hedged by maintaining foreign currency borrowings
and/or derivative financial liabilities which approximate to the 
net asset value of the foreign operations.
Other material foreign currency cash flow exposures are hedged
where there is sufficient certainty that the cash flows will occur.
Where there is significant uncertainty over the potential timing 
of material currency exposures the senior treasury and finance
management decide on the appropriate hedging activity required
on a case-by-case basis.
Interest rate
Our policy is to manage interest rate risk on long-term borrowings
while ensuring that the exposure to fixed rates remains within a
30% to 70% range. This is achieved by using derivative financial
instruments, such as interest rate swaps, to adjust the interest
basis of the portfolio of long-term debt.
Counterparty
Our policy is to limit counterparty exposures by setting credit limits
for each counterparty, where possible by reference to published
credit ratings. Exposures are measured in relation to the nature,
market value and maturity of each contract or financial instrument.
Surplus cash is invested in short-term financial instruments and
only deposited with counterparties with minimum long-term and
short-term credit ratings of A3/A-/A-or P1/A1/F1 from any of Moody’ s,
S&P or Fitch Ratings. Energy trading activities are undertaken with
counterparties for whom specific credit limits are set. Exposures 
are reviewed by the Financial Risk Management Committee.
Credit rating
The current strong credit rating of the Group (long-term debt: 
A3 stable outlook (Moody’ s), A negative outlook (S&P); short-term
debt: P-2 stable outlook (Moody’ s), A- 1 negative outlook (S&P)),
means that it benefits from high levels of credit for its existing
counterparty relationships. Any material deterioration of this rating
would mean that we would need to increase our levels of security for
existing energy procurement and hedging contracts, which may
have a material effect on our cash position or limit our ability to 
trade in commodity markets. As described above, sufficient liquidity
headroom is maintained to limit the immediate financial impact of 
a reduction in the credit rating. Further details on these financial
risks can be found in notes 4 and 5 to the Financial Statements 
on pages 69 and 74. 
Pensions
We maintain a variety of pension schemes including defined benefit
schemes. The pension fund liabilities are partially matched with a
portfolio of assets, which leaves potential risk around the mortality
rate, wage inflation and returns on assets. The scheme contains 
a high proportion of equity assets that are expected to provide 
a better return in the long term than alternative investments such as
bonds. However, in the short term, the difference between the value
of liabilities and assets may vary significantly, potentially resulting in
a large deficit having to be recognised on the Group’ s balance sheet.
In addition, actions by the pension regulators or the trustees 
and/or any material revisions to the existing pension legislation
could require increased contributions by the Group to the pension
fund. The risks associated with the pension schemes are regularly
reviewed and, in combination with expert external advice, any
appropriate action is identified and acted upon accordingly. For
further details see note 34 to the Financial Statement on page 126. Corporate

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Introduction 
We operate in a society which puts an increasingly high value 
on sustaining the physical environment and nurturing people 
and communities. For any organisation, this shift in values raises
issues of judgement between short-term gain and longer-term
sustainability. We must therefore devote time and energy to
understand and manage effectively the social, environmental and
economic impact of our operations. If we do so successfully, we
can win business advantage and deliver value to our shareholders.
If we fail, we face reputational and financial risks.
Governance and management 
The Corporate Responsibility Committee oversees Centrica’ s
corporate responsibility (CR) strategy and activities on behalf of 
the Board. Since its formation in January 2006, our objectives 
have been to increase the time devoted to these matters by the
Board and senior management; to ensure that the Group has clear
policies on managing its key environmental and social impacts; 
and to monitor the implementation of our policies through clear
targets and performance indicators. Above all, the Committee’ s 
role is to ensure that our day-to-day business operations respond
to the opportunities, and avoid the risks, posed by CR issues.
I am pleased that both the Board and the senior management team
have given strong leadership to the Group’ s CR work during the
year. In September 2007, I made recommendations to the Board
with regard to the Committee’ s ongoing effectiveness and as a
result Andrew Mackenzie, Non-Executive Director, and Sam Laidlaw,
Chief Executive, joined the Committee and we revised the terms 
of reference. The reconstituted Committee met for the first time in
December 2007 and will provide strong governance in the future.
In 2007 the Committee reviewed our strategy for managing key
risks and opportunities including climate change, supporting
vulnerable customers, health and safety and the way we operate 
in developing countries. We also strengthened the Group’ s risk
management and internal audit processes for CR, received regular
reports on the views of external stakeholder groups and contributed
to the development of CR communications and reporting.
The following sections highlight the challenges we face, the actions
we are taking, our performance during the year and our future
commitments and targets. While we cover a broad range of issues,
our most material CR impact areas continue to be climate change
and the environment; vulnerable customers; and health and safety.
Business conduct 
Our Group-wide business principles create a framework to help us
make decisions in line with a consistent set of operating behaviours
based on trust, integrity and openness.
In 2007 Sam Laidlaw demonstrated his personal commitment 
by leading a programme to update and communicate our
principles. This ongoing campaign will help our employees,
business partners and external audiences understand the
standards we expect. For example, our managers received 
a guide called ‘Building a better business’ and were each 
required to complete an online learning programme.
In addition, we began working with our most senior leaders 
to create a common set of management behaviours which will 
help us to build a stronger culture in the business. These will 
be developed further in 2008 and will help us to increase our
leadership capability and develop our next generation of leaders.
We also introduced a new responsible procurement policy to
extend our business principles into our supply chain activities. 
In 2008 we will work with our business partners and suppliers 
to increase their awareness of our policy and our expectations 
in relation to its implementation.

Listening to stakeholders
It is essential that we are alert to evolving trends and opinions –
among employees, customers, policy-makers, investors and 
wider stakeholders – so that we can fully understand our impact 
on society and the environment and contribute our expertise and
experience to public debate.
Helping shape the policy environment
We are committed to playing a full and active role in the political
process to support the creation of competitive energy markets 
that deliver consumer choice, support vulnerable customers,
promote security of supply and facilitate the move towards a 
low-carbon society.
Competitive markets
In 2007 we continued to support the creation of a truly competitive
European energy market. We welcomed the European Commission’ s
proposals for the unbundling of electricity and gas transmission
networks and will support their implementation. In addition, Direct
Energy continued to advocate market change across North America
to improve energy market competitiveness and consumer choice. 
Reducing carbon emissions
We played an active part in the debate on reducing carbon
emissions, including the development of EU emissions reduction
targets and phase three of the EU Emissions Trading Scheme
(ETS). In North America, we continued to engage with federal, state
and provincial policy-makers as well as industry groups to inform
thinking on carbon legislation. The price of carbon is a significant
factor in our investment decisions and we believe that effective cap
and trade systems such as the ETS will provide long-term visibility.
Talking to investors
In 2007 we hosted our fourth annual CR investor roadshow to 
brief analysts on our CR strategy and performance on key areas of
impact. We continued to be included in the Dow Jones Sustainability
Index and FTSE4Good indices during the year. We were recognised
as a sector leader by the Carbon Disclosure Project and ranked first
in an assessment of UK energy suppliers’ action on climate change,
undertaken by Innovest on behalf of WWF . Our online CR report was
ranked third best in Europe by internet consultancy Jungle Rating.

Tackling climate change
Reducing carbon emissions while securing future energy supplies
for our customers is a very significant challenge. But climate
change science makes unequivocal the case for a low-carbon
future and we have an important role to play in making it happen.
Our strategy is to lead the market in responding to growing
consumer demand for low-carbon products and services; 
to maintain our low-carbon position on power generation; 
and to work with our employees and suppliers to reduce 
the environmental impact of our operations. 
Commercial opportunities
In 2007 we launched a new business unit – British Gas New Energy
– to lead our low-carbon strategy in the UK. In North America, 
we formed a cross-business team to co-ordinate Direct Energy’ s
climate change activities within each business unit. On both sides
of the Atlantic, our increased focus on developing innovative 
low-carbon products and services for our customers is an
important growth opportunity. 
Low-carbon products
British Gas launched ‘Zero Carbon’
11
, our greenest tariff available to
domestic customers, and introduced a scheme offering a council tax
rebate of £500 to customers installing solar panels. Direct Energy
extended its carbon neutral gas programme to Ontario, Alberta and
Manitoba after a successful launch in British Columbia. It provides
customers with the ability to reduce their carbon footprint by
offsetting the greenhouse gases they produce in their homes with
carbon credits that fund clean energy projects around the world.
Energy efficiency
British Gas remained the largest provider of household energy
efficiency products in the UK, providing more than 17 million
products in 2007. Our Green Streets campaign, which links 
64 households in eight cities across the UK, aims to highlight the
positive impact simple energy efficiency products and behaviours
can have.
Low-carbon power generation
The carbon intensity of the power we generate for our British Gas
customers is already significantly lower than the other five major 
UK suppliers. In 2007, 394 grams of carbon dioxide were emitted
for every kilowatt hour (g CO2/kWh) of power we generated*. 
T o ensure we maintain this leadership position, we have set a 
target to reduce our UK power generation carbon intensity to 
380g CO2/kWh by 2012 and aim to go even further by cutting 
our intensity to 350g CO2/kWh by 2020.
†
This is a significant challenge, but we believe that our focus on
relative, rather than absolute, targets will enable us to reduce 
CO2 emissions and continue to provide secure energy supplies 
for our customers. Our strategy to invest in low-carbon generation
such as high-efficiency gas-fired power stations and offshore wind
farms will not only enable us to meet our own targets but enable
Centrica to play a key role in meeting broader UK and European
emissions reduction targets.
Investing in renewables 
During the year we acquired 50% ownership of the 72MW Braes 
of Doune onshore wind farm in Stirlingshire, Scotland. We made
good progress with our Lynn and Inner Dowsing development and
submitted a planning application for the construction of the Lincs
offshore wind farm. T ogether with other wind farms in development,
our UK generation capacity in the next few years is expected to reach
more than1 .6GW. In T exas Direct Energy signed a seven-year deal
to buy the output of AES Corporation’ s 170MW Buffalo Gap Wind
Farm 3, bringing our total wind power offtake commitment in 
North America to 813MW.
Reducing our operational footprint 
We introduced a new Group-wide environment policy to provide
clear direction for our programmes and developed a Group
Environmental Management System ready for implementation,
commencing with British Gas in 2008. We launched a new
company car policy to remove the most polluting vehicles, enabling
all eligible employees to select from cars emitting less than 200g of
CO2 per km. Green parking spaces were also created for cars with
emissions below 120g of CO2 per km and for those car-sharing. 
We initiated a ‘Being Green’ campaign across the Company to
encourage employees to help reduce our operational footprint.

Serving our customers 
As a multinational energy company providing essential services to
millions of customers every day, understanding their evolving needs is
very important. Being responsible and responsive in how we manage
relationships with our customers is central to our business strategy. 
Delivering value 
Our priority is to provide our customers with the best value in the
marketplace by delivering good quality customer service and being
competitive on price. In March 2007 British Gas was the first UK
supplier to announce a reduction in its retail prices when wholesale
energy costs began to fall and we reduced prices again in April.
Although this helped us retain customers, our quality of service
remained lower than the standards we expect. We invested 
£60 million to help restore service standards in 2007, benefited
from the recruitment of 800 new customer service agents and
made an extensive commitment to training. As a result, complaints
to energywatch fell by 80% during the year and our average time 
to answer calls reduced by 75%. Further improving levels of
customer service is a key priority in 2008.
In response to a significant increase in wholesale energy costs over
the winter period, British Gas was forced to increase retail prices 
in January 2008. However, we protected 340,000 of our most
vulnerable customers from this increase until 1March 2008. 
Supporting vulnerable customers
Although UK retail energy prices were lower in 2007 than in the
previous 12 months, fuel poverty continued to be an issue. It is our
priority to identify and support these households with a tailored
range of services including energy efficiency, debt alleviation,
priority service, financial assistance and support from partner
organisations. 
In March 2007 British Gas received widespread recognition from
government and industry groups following the launch of ‘Essentials’,
the UK’ s largest social tariff on the energy market. This £32 million
commitment guarantees that up to 750,000 eligible vulnerable
customers can receive our lowest cost offline tariff.
Our new ‘Winter Warmer’ initiative offers sustainable support to
25,000 of the UK’ s most vulnerable elderly households including
free insulation and a winter credit of up to £90 for eligible
customers. We are also investing £3.3 million a year in a further
four-year commitment to the British Gas Energy Trust, an
independent body which helps customers who have the greatest
difficulty paying their household bills. Including these commitments,
British Gas will be responsible for around 70p of every £1spent by
UK suppliers on fuel poverty initiatives.
Direct Energy’ s T exas operation expanded its support for the
‘Neighbor-to-Neighbor’ programme to include Dallas and Houston
and now serves 32 agencies across T exas. Our contribution of
C$500,000 (£255,000) supplements existing energy-assistance
programmes for families experiencing financial emergencies.
Focusing on health and safety
The health and safety of our employees, customers and others 
who could be affected by our activities is a top priority for us. 
During 2007 we conducted a detailed internal review of our
management systems. This included consideration of the Baker
Report into BP’ s ‘T exas Refinery Incident’ and a strong focus on
process safety. We identified opportunities to reinforce our
approach and implemented an action plan with oversight from the
Centrica Executive Committee. A progress report on those actions
was presented to the Board at its meeting in December.
Although our proactive improvement programmes helped our
business units to achieve their performance targets overall, 
the Group experienced an increase in accident incidence rates.
This increase can be linked to a concerted campaign over 
the last 12- 18 months to improve incident reporting in our 
main UK downstream businesses. We will continue to target a 
year-on-year 4% reduction in time lost from injuries and to support
those businesses that have consistently reduced or achieved low
injury incidence rates.
T o build on our strong performance, we have developed a
programme called ‘Performance Plus’ to heighten our performance
expectations and provide greater resilience in our risk management
systems through proactive leadership, behavioural change and
continual challenge and review at all levels.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Valuing our people
The calibre and the conduct of our people are central to building
successful relationships with our customers, shareholders,
business partners and the communities in which we operate. 
During the year we employed an average of 33,908 people: 
28,829 in the UK; 4,839 in North America; and 240 in the rest 
of the world.
Employee engagement
Employees are regularly updated on our performance against our
strategy. We want Centrica to be a great place to work and our
engagement survey helps us to measure the attitudes and opinions
of our employees. In 2007 more than 84% of employees responded
and our overall engagement score increased by 3%, demonstrating
a high level of commitment from our people. We maintain regular
dialogue with representatives of local employee consultative bodies
and recognised trade unions to ensure we fully understand
employees’ views. 
Diversity and inclusion 
We are committed to pursuing equality and diversity in all 
our activities and we continue to support initiatives to provide
employment opportunities for people from minority groups in 
the community, including people with a disability, carers and lone
parents. For example, we pledged our support to the Local
Employment Partnerships scheme, which aims to help 250,000
disadvantaged people in the UK get back into work. 
Following the introduction of the Employment Equality (Age)
Regulations 2006, we delivered an awareness and training
programme to enable employees to understand the new legislation,
for which we won an award from the Employers’ Forum on Age. 
Canada’ s Association for the Fifty Plus recognised Direct Energy 
for the opportunities we have created for older employees. 
In addition, we received the Alfred P Sloan Award for business
excellence in workplace flexibility for our programmes in T exas 
and the Stevie Award for the ‘Best Multinational Company’ 
in North America.
In the UK we were recognised as an ‘exemplar employer’ 
by Opportunity Now for our flexible working initiatives and 
our diversity recruitment strategy for engineers. 
Training and development 
Our British Gas Engineering Academy achieved ‘grade one’
performance in an Ofsted inspection. Ofsted commended our
efforts to recruit from underrepresented groups, with female
trainees accounting for almost 13% of all those recruited in 2007.
We also introduced a General Management Development
Programme. It is an integral part of our talent strategy, which aims
to build our senior management capability and develop successors
for key roles.
Reward 
In 2007 we conducted a fifth comparative review of the levels of 
pay for male and female employees. The results showed that the
gender pay gap in Centrica is much narrower than published
national norms. We were the first organisation to enable UK
employees to make a direct contribution to fighting climate change
via their flexible benefits allowance which offers a personal carbon
offset in partnership with Pure, the Clean Planet Trust. 
We encourage our employees to own shares in the company by
operating a number of all-employee share schemes. In the UK
12, 186 employees participated in Sharesave and 5,873 participated
in our Share Incentive Plan. In North America1 , 100 employees
participated in our Employee Share Purchase Plan.
We also operate a Share Award Scheme and a Restricted Share
Scheme. Participation in these share schemes is on a highly
selective basis at the discretion of the Chief Executive and Group
Director, Human Resources. Neither the Executive Directors nor 
the next tier of executive management is eligible to participate.
Further information on these schemes is given in note 33 to the
Financial Statements on page 1 18.
Investing in communities 
By understanding our impact on the communities in which we
work, we can develop successful partnerships of mutual benefit.
We aim to deepen our understanding of social and environmental
issues and contribute to action that addresses them. We do this 
by supporting outside agencies and encouraging our own
employees to get involved. 
In 2007 we contributed £5.2 million
6
to community causes through 
a combination of cash, time and in-kind support
5
. Across the
Company , our people invested more than 1 8,000 hours in volunteering
activities, which equates to more than £260,000 of in-kind support.
In June a memorial service was held for those who lost their lives in
the Morecambe Bay helicopter tragedy on 27 December 2006. The
first donation from the fund, set up in memory of those who died,
was made to North West Air Ambulance and a memorial stone was
unveiled outside our Heysham base. 
Direct Energy completed its three-year support of ‘Youthworks’, 
an initiative tackling homelessness among young people, run by
Canadian charity Raising The Roof. In Canada, we supported
Habitat for Humanity’ s first EnergyStar
®
building project with a
financial donation and products including high-efficiency furnaces. 
In addition, British Gas launched the third phase of ‘Help

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Corporate  
Governance Report 
The Board of Directors of Centrica plc is committed to the 
highest standards of corporate governance. Throughout 
the year ended 31 December 2007, the Company fully 
complied with the provisions set out in Section 1 of the 
Combined Code on Corporate Governance (the ‘Code’). 
The Company applied the relevant principles of the Code
as set out in this report.
Board of Directors  
An effective Board of Directors leads and controls the Group,  
and has a schedule of matters reserved for its approval. This 
schedule and the terms of reference for the Executive, Audit, 
Remuneration, Nominations, Corporate Responsibility  
and Disclosure Committees are available on request and on the 
Company’s website at www.centrica.com.
The powers of the Directors are set out in the Company’s  
Articles of Association, which are also available on the 
Company’s website. 
The Board is specifically responsible for: 
  the development of strategy and major policies; 
  the review of management performance; 
  the approval of the annual operating plan, the financial 
statements and major acquisitions and disposals; 
  the Group’s corporate responsibility arrangements including 
health, safety and environment matters; 
  the Group’s system of internal control; and 
  corporate governance. 
One of the Board’s meetings is specifically devoted to the 
development of the Group’s strategic direction. This is continually 
monitored and a half-year review is presented to and discussed 
by the Board. 
Guidelines are in place concerning the content and presentation 
of Board briefing papers. Comprehensive papers are provided  
to Directors one week ahead of each Board meeting. 
A procedure is in place for the Directors to seek independent 
professional advice in respect of their duties at the cost of  
the Company. The Directors also have access to the advice 
and services of the General Counsel and Company Secretary.
Board meetings and attendance 
The Board has regular scheduled meetings throughout the  
year and supplementary meetings are held as and when 
necessary. The Board had 9 scheduled and 4 unscheduled
supplementary meetings during the year. A table detailing 
individual Director attendance at Board and committee meetings 
during 2007 is set out below. 
Non-attendance at meetings was due to prior business or 
personal commitments and illness. All Directors who were unable 
to attend specific Board or Committee meetings reviewed the 
relevant briefing papers and provided their comments to the 
Chairman of the Board or committee, as appropriate. 
The Chairman and each Non-Executive Director has provided
assurance to the Board that they remain fully committed to their 
respective roles and can dedicate sufficient time to meet what is 
expected of them.

Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Board membership and appointments 
The roles of Chairman and Chief Executive are separate and their 
responsibilities are clearly established, formalised in writing and 
agreed by the Board. There is also a balance of Executive and 
independent Non-Executive Directors. The Board of Directors’ 
biographies including their Board committee membership are  
set out on pages 34 and 35. 
Nick Luff was appointed to the Board as Group Finance Director 
on 1 March 2007 and was subsequently elected by shareholders 
at the 2007 Annual General Meeting (AGM). Nick Luff replaced 
Phil Bentley, who became Managing Director of British Gas on  
1 March 2007.  
As part of its annual review of corporate governance, the Board 
considered the independence of the Non-Executive Directors 
(other than the Chairman) against the criteria specified in the
Code and determined that each remained independent.  
Mary Francis, the Senior Independent Director, is available to 
shareholders if they have concerns that contact through the 
normal channels has either failed to resolve or is inappropriate.  
During the year the Non-Executive Directors, including the 
Chairman, met independently of management on a regular basis.  
Full details of Directors’ service contracts, emoluments and  
share interests are set out in the Remuneration Report on
pages 42 to 51.
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent process in place for 
the appointment of new Directors to the Board. This process  
is described in the section on the Nominations Committee on
page 39. 
In accordance with the Code and the Company’s Articles of 
Association, all Directors are subject to election by shareholders
at the first AGM following their appointment to the Board and 
thereafter are subject to re-election every third year. Non-
Executive Directors are initially appointed for a three-year term
and, subject to rigorous review and re-election, can serve up 
to a maximum of three such terms. Upon the recommendation  
of the Nominations Committee, Jake Ulrich, Mary Francis and
Paul Rayner will be proposed for re-election at the 2008 AGM,
each to serve a further three-year term. 
Directors’ insurance and indemnities 
In accordance with the Company’s Articles of Association,  
the Company has granted a deed of indemnity, to the extent
permitted by law, to each of the Directors and the General 
Counsel and Company Secretary. The Company also maintains 
directors’ and officers’ liability insurance for its Directors  
and officers. 
Board evaluation 
During the year the Board conducted a formal and rigorous 
performance evaluation of its own performance and that of its 
committees and individual Directors, with the assistance of an 
independent external facilitator, Egon Zehnder International.  
The 2007 Board evaluation built upon the positive results and 
output of such previous exercises and focused on a number 
of key topics including: 
  Board structure and composition; 
  Board dynamics and relationships; 
  Board meetings; 
  information flows and decision-making processes; 
  committees; 
  people and succession planning; and 
  reporting to shareholders. 
The evaluation process was carried out with one-to-one 
interviews between the facilitator and each of the Directors  
and the General Counsel and Company Secretary. In addition, 
the Senior Independent Director chaired a meeting of the 
independent Non-Executive Directors in the absence of the 
Chairman to appraise the Chairman’s performance. The output
from those interviews was compiled into a report prepared by  
the facilitator and this was presented to the Board at its meeting 
in December 2007, along with a number of recommendations
to address the issues raised.  
The evaluation report concluded that the Board and its 
committees continue to operate effectively and build upon the 
progress of previous years. A small number of actions and 
improvements was identified from the evaluation and these will  
be incorporated into the future Board programme. The report also 
highlighted the importance of maintaining a focus on key subjects 
from the Board Planning Conference at future Board meetings. 
The Board will continue to review its procedures, its effectiveness 
and development throughout the year ahead. 
As part of the Company’s performance management system that 
applies to management at all levels across the Group, the Chief 
Executive’s performance is reviewed regularly by the Chairman 
and that of the other Executive Directors by the Chief Executive. 
The Remuneration Committee also assesses the performance  
of the Executive Directors in connection with its determination
of remuneration levels as explained in the Remuneration Report  
on pages 42 to 51. 
Board training
An induction programme tailored to meet the needs of individual 
Directors is provided for each new Director. Directors also receive 
training throughout the year. 
At Board meetings and, where appropriate, committee meetings, 
the Directors receive regular updates and presentations on 
changes and developments to the business, and to the legislative 
and regulatory environments. During 2007 the Board was briefed 
on a variety of issues including: 
  commodity risk and hedging strategy; 
  the risks and opportunities of upstream exploration activities; 
  climate change strategy; 
  improvements to customer service;  
  Health & Safety – Baker Report review; and 
  changes introduced by the Companies Act 2006, including 
the codification of Directors’ duties.  38

Board committees 
The Board has delegated authority to its committees on
specific aspects of management and control of the Group. 
Written terms of reference for each of the Board committees  
have been approved by the Board and published on the 
Company’s website.  
Minutes of committee meetings are made available to all Directors 
on a timely basis. 
All of the independent Non-Executive Directors are members of 
the Audit, Remuneration and Nominations Committees. This 
membership structure gives the Non-Executive Directors insight 
into the nature of the matters being discussed, brings continuity 
to membership and avoids undue reliance on particular members. 
The full membership of each committee is detailed within the 
following committee reports: 
Executive Committee  
During 2007 the Executive Committee comprised the Executive 
Directors and those key senior managers whose biographical 
details are set out on pages 34 and 35. Sam Laidlaw is Chairman
of the Committee.  
The Committee oversees the management of the Group and 
is the decision-making body for those matters not specifically 
reserved to the Board and within the limits set out in the Group’s 
delegated authority and expenditure control policy. 
Following a review of decision-making arrangements during the 
year, the Committee moved from weekly to monthly meetings 
from November 2007. At this time, the Committee established  
a separate Investment Sub-Committee to consider and approve 
proposed investment opportunities. The core members of the 
Investment Sub-Committee are Sam Laidlaw, Nick Luff and 
Grant Dawson with other members of the Executive Committee 
attending, as appropriate. The Investment Sub-Committee  
meets on a regular basis as business dictates, and the papers 
and minutes are made available to all members of the  
Executive Committee. 
The following are also sub-committees of the Executive 
Committee, with membership drawn from among the Executive 
Committee members and appropriate senior management: 
  the Group Risk Management Committee; 
  the Group Financial Risk Management Committee; and 
  the Health, Safety and Environment Committee.  
Audit Committee 
During 2007 the Audit Committee comprised Paul Rayner 
(Chairman), Helen Alexander, Mary Francis, Andrew Mackenzie 
and Paul Walsh. Paul Rayner, the finance director of a FTSE100 
company, is identified as having recent and relevant financial 
experience, as required by the Code. The Board has determined 
that the members of the Committee are independent and that  
the membership meets the requirements of the Code. 
In accordance with its terms of reference, the Committee,  
which reports its findings to the Board, is authorised to: 
  monitor the integrity of the interim and annual financial 
statements, including a review of the significant financial 
reporting judgements contained in them; 
  review the Company’s internal financial controls, internal
control and risk management systems; 
  monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s 
internal audit function; 
  establish and oversee the Company’s relationship with
the external auditors, including the monitoring of their 
independence; and 
  monitor matters raised pursuant to the Company’s 
whistleblowing arrangements. 
During 2007 the Audit Committee met four times and  
received comprehensive reports from the Director of Business 
Assurance, senior management and the external auditors, 
PricewaterhouseCoopers LLP. The Committee also 
commissioned further reports in response to developing issues, 
as appropriate, and, in respect of all ongoing issues, requested 
clear objectives, timetables and achievement milestones against 
which performance could be measured. The output from each  
of these meetings was reported by the Committee Chairman
to the next Board meeting. 
At each of its scheduled meetings, the Committee met privately 
with the external auditors, and separately with the Head of 
Business Assurance.  
Significant areas of review by the Committee during the  
year included: 
  the new British Gas billing system; 
  information technology general controls; 
  risk profile of the Group’s business model and risk mitigation; 
  the internal financial control improvement programme; 
  electricity prepayment debt and industry reconciliation 
process; and 
  ongoing compliance with the undertakings in respect  
of Centrica Storage Ltd. 
The Board has approved policies that restrict the types of non-
audit work that can be undertaken by the external auditors and 
restrict the employment by the Group of former employees of the 
external auditors. The award of non-audit work, within categories 
that the external auditors are permitted to carry out under the 
Board-approved policies, is subject to pre-clearance by the Audit 
Committee if the fee exceeds specified thresholds. The Group’s 
policy to seek competitive tenders for all major consultancies and 
advisory projects is set out in note 7 to the Financial Statements 
on page 81. In addition, the Committee was provided with reports 
of all non-audit assignments awarded to the external auditors 
and, on a quarterly basis, a full breakdown of non-audit fees 
incurred during the year. 
In accordance with International Standard on Auditing (UK & 
Ireland) 260 and Ethical Statement 1 issued by the Accounting 
Practices Board and as a matter of best practice, the external
auditors have confirmed their independence as auditors of the 
Company in a letter addressed to the Directors.  39

Remuneration Committee 
A report detailing the composition, responsibilities and work 
carried out by the Remuneration Committee during the year,
including an explanation of how it applies the principles of the
Code in setting Executive Directors’ remuneration, is included 
within the Remuneration Report on pages 42 to 51.  
Nominations Committee 
During 2007 the Nominations Committee comprised Roger Carr 
(Chairman), Helen Alexander, Mary Francis, Sam Laidlaw, Andrew 
Mackenzie, Paul Rayner and Paul Walsh. Throughout the year  
a majority of the Committee’s members were independent  
Non-Executive Directors. 
The Committee is responsible for making appropriate 
recommendations to the Board for the appointment of 
replacement or additional Directors. It is also responsible for 
succession planning and Board evaluation. In making its 
recommendations, the Committee reviews the balance of  
skills, knowledge and experience on the Board against current 
and future requirements of the Company and, as appropriate,  
draws up a list of required attributes.  
The Committee met twice during the year and considered  
the proposed appointment of a new Group Finance Director,  
Nick Luff, as replacement for Phil Bentley. The Committee  
also considered: 
  the reappointment of Directors retiring by rotation at the  
2007 AGM; 
  senior management succession planning; and 
  talent management. 
Corporate Responsibility Committee 
During 2007 the Corporate Responsibility Committee comprised 
Mary Francis (Chairman), Phil Bentley (from 1 March 2007),  
Deryk King, Sam Laidlaw (from 11 December 2007), Andrew 
Mackenzie (from 11 December 2007) and Catherine May. Ian 
Peters and John Way ceased to be members of the Committee 
on 1 March 2007 and 31 July 2007 respectively. Mark Crosbie, 
Grant Dawson, Anne Minto, Jake Ulrich and Chris Weston
ceased to be members of the Committee on 11 December  
2007. A report detailing the work carried out by the Corporate
Responsibility Committee during the year is included within the 
Corporate Responsibility section on pages 28 to 32.  
At its November meeting, the Board approved the Committee’s 
revised terms of reference and membership.  
Disclosure Committee 
The Disclosure Committee, which met on a number of occasions 
throughout the year, comprised Sam Laidlaw, Nick Luff (from 
1 March 2007) and Grant Dawson. Phil Bentley was a member  
of the Committee until 28 February 2007. The Committee is 
responsible for implementing and monitoring systems and 
controls in respect of the management and disclosure of  
inside information.  
Relations with shareholders 
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining an effective 
investor relations and communication programme as part of its 
ongoing relationship with the Company’s shareholders.  
Centrica’s website contains a wealth of up-to-date information
for shareholders including share price information, news releases, 
annual reports, speeches from the AGM, presentations to the 
investment community and a section on shareholder services. 
At its 2007 AGM, the Company passed a resolution allowing
the website to be used as the primary means of communication 
with its shareholders. This facility provides significant benefits for
shareholders and the Company. Shareholders can still opt to receive 
their communications in a paper format.
The AGM provides all shareholders with the opportunity to 
develop their understanding of the Company and ask questions 
of the Board on the matters put to the meeting, including this 
Annual Report and Accounts. At the AGM, the Chairman and  
the Chief Executive present a review of the Group’s business.  
All shareholders also have the opportunity to cast their votes in 
respect of proposed AGM resolutions by proxy, either electronically 
or by post, at least 48 hours before the start of the meeting.  
The Chief Executive and Group Finance Director hold regular 
meetings with the Company’s major shareholders. The Chairman 
and the Senior Independent Director attend the meetings at 
which the annual and interim results are presented to major 
investors and analysts. The Chairman also met a number of major 
institutional shareholders during the year to gain a first-hand 
understanding of any issues or concerns they may have had.
Formal reports of investor feedback are included in the papers
for each Board meeting. The Board also commissioned an 
external survey of investors in order to assist in developing an
understanding of the views of major shareholders. The results  
of this survey were circulated to the Directors. 
Risk management and internal control 
The Board regards the identification and assessment of risks, 
together with the mitigating internal controls, to be fundamental  
to achieving the Group’s strategic objectives. It either directly or 
through its committees, sets objectives, performance targets and 
policies for management of key risks facing the Group. The Board 
has overall responsibility for the Group’s system of internal control 
and risk management, which is designed to manage rather than
eliminate the risk of failure to achieve the objectives and can 
provide only reasonable, and not absolute, assurance against 
material misstatement or loss. 
Across the Group, each business has a Risk Management 
Committee that seeks to identify, assess and advise on the 
management of risks. These assessments are reported to the 
Group Risk Management Committee to develop the Company’s 
overall risk profile including those risks that might affect the 
Company at a Group level. Where significant risks have been 
identified, a control infrastructure has been established to ensure 
day-to-day monitoring and management of risks. Centrica 
Storage Ltd, which is subject to undertakings given to the  40
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Corporate  
Governance Report 
continued 
Secretary of State for Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform,
operates separately but to the same standards of internal control
and risk management as the rest of the Group. The processes  
of newly acquired companies are integrated with those of  
the Group. 
At each of its four meetings in 2007, the Audit Committee 
received a Group Risk Report providing an assessment of the  
key risks facing the Company including the adequacy of the 
associated controls. Details of the principal risks and uncertainties 
are set out on pages 25 to 27 of this report. In addition, the  
Audit Committee is provided with the results of internal audit 
reviews conducted by the Business Assurance function  
according to a plan approved by the Committee. These reports, 
supplemented by management presentations, enable the Audit 
Committee to track a number of issues, monitor performance 
against objectives and ensure that necessary actions were taken 
to remedy any significant failings or weaknesses identified from 
those reports. The Chairman of the Audit Committee reported  
the issues discussed and conclusions reached at the following  
Board meeting. 
The Board’s review of the system of internal control 
A process of hierarchical self-certification has been established 
throughout the Group whereby the effectiveness of internal 
controls and compliance with Group business principles and 
policies is assessed. The results of this certification process, 
together with the conclusions of the internal reviews by business 
assurance, informs the annual assessment performed by the  
Audit Committee.  
The Board, with the advice of the Audit Committee, has reviewed 
the effectiveness of the system of internal control, for the period 
from 1 January 2007 to the date of this report, and is satisfied 
that the Group complies with the Turnbull Guidance. The Board 
will continue to routinely challenge management to ensure the
system of internal control is constantly improving. 
Going concern
After making enquiries, the Board has a reasonable expectation 
that the parent Company and the Group as a whole has adequate 
resources to continue in operational existence for the foreseeable 
future. For this reason, we continue to adopt the going concern
basis in preparing the Financial Statements, which are shown on
pages 54 to 148. 
Directors’ responsibility statement 
The Directors are responsible for preparing, in respect of each 
financial year, the Annual Report and Group Financial Statements. 
They are also responsible for ensuring that the Financial 
Statements give a true and fair view and that they have been
properly prepared in accordance with applicable law and 
International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRS) as adopted  
by the European Union. 
The Group Financial Statements have been prepared in 
accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and IFRS pursuant to 
Article 4 of the IAS Regulations. The Parent Company Financial 
Statements have been prepared in accordance with the 
Companies Act 1985 and United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice. The Directors’ Report and the Remuneration
Report have been prepared in accordance with the Companies 
Act 1985 and the UK Listing Authority Listing Rules.  
In preparing the Financial Statements the Directors are  
required to: 
  select suitable accounting policies and then apply  
them consistently; 
  make judgements and estimates that are reasonable  
and prudent; 
  state whether applicable accounting standards have been
followed, subject to any material departures disclosed and 
explained in the Financial Statements; and 
  prepare the Financial Statements on the going concern  
basis, unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group  
will continue in business. 
The Directors confirm that they have complied with the above 
requirements in preparing the Financial Statements. 
The Directors are responsible for keeping proper accounting 
records that disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time the 
financial position of the Company and the Group and enable

Remuneration Report  
Composition and role of the Remuneration Committee
Throughout 2007, the Remuneration Committee comprised  
Helen Alexander (Chairman), Roger Carr, Mary Francis, Andrew 
Mackenzie, Paul Rayner and Paul Walsh. The Committee met  
five times during the year. Its terms of reference are available at 
www.centrica.com.
The Committee makes recommendations to the Board, within
formal terms of reference, on the policy and framework of 
executive remuneration and its cost to the Company. The 
Committee is also responsible for the implementation of 
remuneration policy and determining specific remuneration 
packages for each of the Executive Directors. It has access 
to the advice and views of the Group Reward Director (Cathy
Aldwinckle), the Group Human Resources Director (Anne Minto), 
the General Counsel and Company Secretary (Grant Dawson), 
the Chief Executive (Sam Laidlaw) and external consultants.  
At its meetings in 2007, the Committee considered, amongst 
other things, the following: 
  the 2006 Remuneration Report; 
  the achievement of the performance targets in respect of  
the 2006 AIS and the vesting of existing awards made under 
the long-term share-based incentive arrangements; 
  levels of base salary; 
  the setting of levels of award and performance targets in
respect of the 2007 AIS and awards made under the long-
term share-based incentive arrangements; 
  the proposed terms of appointment of the new Group  
Finance Director; and 
  the effectiveness of the annual incentive scheme (AIS). 
During the year, Kepler Associates (Kepler) acted as independent 
executive remuneration adviser to the Committee, having been 
formally appointed in 2005. Kepler provided advice on executive 
compensation to assist in the formulation of the Committee’s 
recommendations. The Committee also consulted, but did not
formally appoint, Towers Perrin.
This report, which will be submitted to the forthcoming Annual 
General Meeting (AGM) for approval, explains how the Company 
has applied the principles of the Combined Code on Corporate 
Governance (the ‘Code’) that relate to directors’ remuneration 
during the year. No Director is involved in the determination of,
or votes on any matter relating to, his or her own remuneration. 
Executive Directors’ remuneration policy and framework 
It is the role of the Committee to ensure that the Group’s 
remuneration policy and framework provides competitive reward 
for its Executive Directors and other senior executives, taking into 
account the Company’s performance, the markets in which it 
operates and pay and conditions elsewhere in the Group. 
In constructing the remuneration packages, the Committee aims 
to achieve an appropriate balance between fixed and variable
compensation for each executive. Accordingly, a significant 
proportion of the remuneration package depends on the 
attainment of demanding performance objectives, both short  
and long-term. The AIS is designed to incentivise and reward
the achievement of demanding financial and business-related 
objectives. Long-term share-based incentives are designed 
to align the interests of Executive Directors and other senior 
executives with the longer-term interests of shareholders  
by rewarding them for delivering sustained, increased  
shareholder value.  
The Committee reviews the packages and varies individual 
elements when appropriate from year to year. Those reviews are 
conducted with the assistance of Kepler and the internal advisers 
named above to ensure that the remuneration arrangements 
continue to provide a strong alignment with the achievement 
of strategic objectives and the delivery of value to shareholders; 
reflect current best practice, while meeting the Group’s particular 
business needs; and enable the Group to continue to attract and 
retain high calibre management in a highly challenging business
environment. In agreeing the level of base salaries and the 
performance-related elements of the remuneration package, 
the Committee considers the potential maximum remuneration 
that executives could receive. 
Having conducted a review against those criteria, the Committee 
proposed changes in 2006 to the future policy and framework of 
executive remuneration arrangements, which were endorsed by 
shareholders upon the approval of the Remuneration Report and 
new share-based incentive schemes at the 2006 AGM. These 
new arrangements were fully implemented in 2007 and are 
described in this report. 
In 2007, the Committee conducted a review of the overall 
effectiveness of the AIS including: the appropriateness of the 
architecture to ensure that the targets set in the future would 
satisfy the criteria described above; the robustness of the targets 
and their evaluation; the target and maximum levels as a 
proportion of total reward and the degree of stretch in the targets 
compared with other FTSE 50 companies. Following that review, 
the Committee approved a number of changes to the AIS 
architecture and target setting for future years. It was agreed  
in respect of the Executive Directors that consideration should
be given to increasing the target and maximum AIS levels, with
some of the increase being linked to individual performance as
measured by robust, stretching personal objectives. It was also 
agreed to introduce a differential in the maximum bonus 
opportunity between the Chief Executive and the other  
Executive Directors.  
In 2007, executive remuneration comprised base salary, AIS,  
an allocation of shares under the Long Term Incentive Scheme
(LTIS), and an allocation of shares under the new Deferred and
Matching Share Scheme (DMSS). No Executive Share Option 
Scheme (ESOS) grants were made during the year, although the 
Committee retains the discretion to make grants under the ESOS 
in the future if there are exceptional circumstances in which it 
considers it is appropriate to do so. 
A minimum shareholding policy requires the retention of a value  
of shares as follows: the Chief Executive – twice his base salary; 
all other Executive Directors – 1.25 times their base salary; and 
executives immediately below Board level – base salary. 
Achievement against this requirement for Executive Directors  
is set out in the table on page 48.  43
Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
The Centrica Management Pension Scheme (CMPS)
(a contributory final salary arrangement) was closed to new 
employees on 30 June 2003. Executive Directors in office prior  
to this date participated in that scheme during 2007. Alternative 
arrangements are made for new employees, including Executive 
Directors, after that date. Full disclosure of the pension
arrangements for the Executive Directors is given on page 51. 
The Committee believes that these arrangements, which are 
further explained below, are important in providing a potential 
remuneration package that will attract, retain and continue to 
motivate Executive Directors and other senior executives in  
a marketplace that is challenging and competitive in both 
commercial and human resource terms. It is currently intended
that this remuneration policy and framework, which is fully 
endorsed by the Board, will continue for 2008 and thereafter. 
In 2007, the total emoluments of the Executive Directors,  
detailed on page 47, consisted of components in the  
following proportions: 
Relative proportions of the components of each 
Executive Director’s remuneration (%): 2007 
Note: Salary and benefits are the actual amounts received during 2007; other payments include  
a salary supplement in lieu of pension paid to Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff – see page 51; pension,
for those Directors in the Centrica Management Pension Scheme, is the increase in actual transfer 
value for 2007 over the notional transfer value for 2006 less the Director’s contributions during
2007; pension for Sam Laidlaw is the actual amount of the contribution made by the Company
to his personal pension; AIS is that payable in respect of 2007 as reflected in the emoluments table 
on page 47; and DMSS and LTIS are the estimated value in accordance with note 2 to the 
Financial Statements on page 61, of the awards made in 2007, provided that all performance 
conditions are met in full at the end of the relevant performance periods.
The total emoluments of the five senior executives immediately 
below Board level for 2007, calculated on the same basis as 
the emoluments of the Executive Directors detailed on page 47, 
fell into the following bands: 
Bands £000  No. of senior executives
900–1,000 1
800–900 –
700–800 1
600–700  2
500–600  1
Components of remuneration 
Base salary
The Committee seeks to establish a base salary for each 
Executive Director and other senior executives, determined by
individual performance and having regard to market salary levels 
for similar positions in comparable companies derived from 
independent sources. Base salaries are reviewed annually.  
For members of the CMPS, base salary is the only element of 
remuneration that is pensionable. 
Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) 
At the beginning of each year, the Committee reviews the AIS to 
ensure that it remains competitive in the marketplace, continues 
to incentivise the Executive Directors and other executives and 
aligns their interests with those of shareholders. For 2007, the 
maximum bonus payable to Executive Directors, should every 
element of every objective be achieved in full, was 125% of base 
salary. The maximum bonus payable to executives immediately 
below Board level, assuming all objectives are achieved in full,
ranges between 100% and 125%. In 2007, the maximum 
achievable bonus related to financial performance targets and
business-related targets, split 64% and 36% respectively for 
Executive Directors and 60% and 40% respectively for executives 
immediately below Board level. From 2007 20% of any annual 
bonus paid is deferred automatically and invested in the DMSS 
(see below). In line with current policy, a bonus will be forfeited if 
overall performance is deemed to be unsatisfactory. The 
Committee will also take into consideration performance in
relation to corporate responsibility including health, safety and
environmental matters when determining the level of bonuses  
to be paid. 
In 2008, the maximum bonus opportunity will be 180% of base
salary for the Chief Executive and 150% of base salary for the 
other Executive Directors.  
Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) 
Following approval at the 2006 AGM, an initial award under the 
DMSS was made in 2007 to Executive Directors and other senior
executives. 20% of the annual bonus payable was deferred
automatically for a period of three years and invested in Centrica
shares (deferred shares), during which time they cannot be
withdrawn. Participants were given the opportunity to invest an
additional amount in Centrica shares (investment shares) to be
funded from the actual bonus payable which, when added to
the value of the deferred shares, would bring the total amount
invested up to 50% of the individual’s maximum bonus entitlement in
respect of 2006. The Remuneration Committee approved certain
initial arrangements in respect of Sam Laidlaw (who joined the 
Company on 1 July 2006 and whose bonus was paid in respect of a 
half-year only) and Nick Luff (who joined the Company on 1 March 
2007 and therefore was not entitled to a bonus in respect of 2006) to 
ensure that they were incentivised on the same basis as the other 
Executive Directors. These arrangements, which are explained in
detail in the footnotes to the table on page 49, involved those 
participants investing their own funds into the scheme as investment
shares up to an amount equal to 50% of the maximum bonus 
opportunity that they would have been entitled to had they been
employed throughout 2006. Deferred and investment shares were 
matched with conditional shares (matching shares), which will be
released upon the achievement of a performance target (see table on
page 44). For the purposes of matching, the investment shares are 
grossed up for income tax and National Insurance contributions. To 
provide a closer alignment with the interests of shareholders, the 
number of matching shares that are released following the
satisfaction of the performance condition will be increased to reflect 
the dividends that would have been paid during the three-year
performance period. In the event of a change of control the number
of matching shares that vest will be subject to time-apportionment
in line with best practice.

Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS) 
Conditional allocations of shares up to a maximum of 200%  
of base salary may be made to Executive Directors and other 
senior executives under the LTIS approved by shareholders  
at the 2006 AGM.  
In 2007, LTIS allocations equal to 200% of base salary were 
awarded to Executive Directors and, at lower rates, to other 
senior executives. Before approving the maximum permitted 
allocation of LTIS for the Executive Directors, the Remuneration
Committee carefully considered the adjusted earnings per share 
(EPS) performance condition attaching to the award to ensure  
it was sufficiently stretching. Having reviewed the challenging 
growth and cost reduction targets inherent in the strategic plan, 
the Committee concluded that the proposed EPS growth target  
(to exceed the Retail Prices Index (RPI) by 30% or more over the  
performance period for full vesting) was sufficiently stretching,  
but nevertheless agreed that a proportion of the increased award  
should be subject to an even more demanding performance 
condition as summarised below. The maximum number of  
shares that could be transferred to each Executive Director upon 
satisfaction of the performance conditions in full appears on page 
49. The release of allocations will be subject to the performance 
conditions set out in the table below.  
To create a closer alignment with the interests of shareholders, 
the number of shares that are released following the satisfaction  
of the performance conditions will be increased to reflect the 
dividends that would have been paid during the three-year 
performance period. In the event of a change of control the 
number of shares that vest will be subject to time-apportionment 
in line with best practice.

Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Prior to 2006, allocations of shares were made annually to 
Executive Directors and other senior executives under the old 
LTIS, in accordance with the remuneration policy adopted in 
2001. Such allocations were subject to a performance condition 
as set out in the table below. 
Prior to the release of share allocations under both the old and 
new LTIS arrangements, the Committee reviews whether the
extent to which the performance conditions have been achieved 
is a genuine reflection of the Company’s financial performance.  
In assessing the extent of satisfaction of the performance 
conditions, the Committee uses data provided by Alithos Ltd  
(an independent third party) in respect of comparative TSR and 
audited figures in respect of EPS. 
Executive Share Option Scheme (ESOS) 
No grants of options were made during 2007. Details of options 
granted prior to 2007 and still held by Executive Directors are 
shown on page 50.  
If, and to the extent that, performance conditions are satisfied,
options normally become exercisable three years after the date  
of grant and remain so until the tenth anniversary of grant.  
The EPS performance conditions in respect of options granted 
from 2001 to March 2004 under the ESOS (as set out in the table 
on page 44) can be measured annually for a further two years 
from the date of grant of the options, with the performance 
conditions increasing proportionately. Having reviewed market 
practice, the Committee removed the provision for retesting of 
performance measures in respect of all option grants from 
September 2004.  
Performance conditions under IFRS 
Following the adoption of IFRS in 2005, the Committee agreed, 
having taken advice from Kepler and having consulted with
the ABI and the RREV, to continue: with the financial target of 
economic profit in respect of the AIS and new DMSS; and EPS  
in respect of the ESOS and the new LTIS, both subject to certain
adjustments to the figures calculated in accordance with IFRS.  
It was agreed that for the purposes of determining performance  
in respect of those schemes, the relevant figures produced under 
IFRS should be adjusted for exceptional items and certain re-
measurements arising on the application of IAS 32 and IAS 39.

31 December 2002 = 100 
The graph below compares the Company’s TSR performance  
with that of the FTSE 100 Index for the five years ended  
31 December 2007. 
As required by Schedule 7A of the Companies Act 1985, a rolling 
definition of the FTSE 100 has been used, whereas the definition
used for the purposes of the LTIS is the FTSE 100 as constituted 
at the beginning of the period. In order to demonstrate the 
delivery of shareholder value during the relevant performance 
period, the TSR graph for the LTIS award that vested in April 
2007 is shown on page 50. 
Funding of share schemes 
It is the Company’s current intention to satisfy the requirements  
of its share schemes, in a method best suited to the interests of 
the Company, either by acquiring shares in the market or, subject 
to institutional guidelines, issuing new shares or using shares
held in treasury. To satisfy the release of shares under the LTIS 
and meet the requirements of the ESOS in 2007, newly-issued 
shares were used. 
Pension 
The pension arrangements of the Executive Directors are fully 
disclosed on page 51. 
Other employment benefits
In common with other senior management, Executive Directors 
are entitled to a range of benefits, including a company car,  
life assurance, private medical insurance and a financial 
counselling scheme. Sam Laidlaw and Jake Ulrich were also 
provided with a driver for limited personal mileage. Such benefits 
are subject to financial limits as set out in appropriate policies. 
They are also eligible to participate in the Company’s HMRC-
approved Sharesave Scheme and Share Incentive Plan, which 
are open to all eligible employees on the same basis, providing  
a long-term savings and investment opportunity. 
Service contracts 
It is the Company’s policy that the notice period in Executive 
Directors’ service contracts does not exceed one year. The 
Executive Directors’ service contracts have no fixed term but 
provide that either the Director or the Company may terminate  
the employment by giving one year’s written notice and that the 
Company may pay compensation in lieu of notice.  
In the case of new external appointments to the Board, the 
Committee retains a level of flexibility, as permitted by the Code, 
in order to attract and retain suitable candidates. It therefore 
reserves the right to offer contracts which contain an initial notice 
period in excess of one year, provided that at the end of the first 
such period the notice reduces to one year. The Committee 
exercised this discretion in respect of the appointment of Sam 
Laidlaw on 1 July 2006 and Nick Luff on 1 March 2007. Each has 
a service contract that contains a notice period of two years, 
which will reduce to one year on the second anniversary of their 
respective date of appointment.
The dates of the Executive Directors’ service contracts are set  
out in the table on page 47.

External appointments of Executive Directors 
The Board believes that experience of other companies’ practices 
and challenges is valuable both for the personal development of 
its Executive Directors and for the Company.  
It is therefore the Company’s policy to allow each Executive 
Director to accept one non-executive directorship of another 
company, although the Board retains the discretion to vary this 
policy. Fees received in respect of external appointments are 
retained by the individual Director. 
In 2007, Phil Bentley received £65,625 as a Non-Executive 
Director of Kingfisher plc, Sam Laidlaw received £37,556 as  
a Non-Executive Director of Hanson plc and, in respect of the 
period he was a Director of the Company, Nick Luff received
£35,083 as a Non-Executive Director of QinetiQ Group plc. 
Non-Executive Directors 
Non-Executive Directors including the Chairman do not hold 
service contracts. Their appointment is subject to the Articles of 
Association and the dates they joined the Board are shown in the 
table on page 47. Roger Carr’s letter of appointment contains a 
six-month notice period. The fees of the Non-Executive Directors 
are approved by the Board upon the recommendation of the 
Executive Committee, whose members are: the Executive 
Directors (Sam Laidlaw, Phil Bentley, Nick Luff and Jake Ulrich)
and five other senior executives (Grant Dawson, Deryk King, 
Catherine May, Anne Minto and Chris Weston) whose biographies 
are included on pages 34 and 35. 
Centrica’s policy on Non-Executive Directors’ fees takes into 
account the need to attract individuals of the right calibre and 
experience, their responsibilities and time commitment, as 
envisaged in the Code, and the fees paid by other companies.  
The current annual fees payable to the Non-Executive  
Directors are:  
Chairman £450,000
Other Non-Executive Directors £60,000
Additional fees:
Chairman of Audit Committee £18,000
Chairman of Remuneration Committee £12,000
Chairman of Corporate Responsibility Committee £12,000
Senior Independent Director £20,000
The fees are normally reviewed every two years. The Non-
Executive Directors, including the Chairman, do not participate  
in any of the Company’s share schemes, incentive plans or 
pension schemes. 
The Remuneration Report from page 42 to page 46 up to this 
statement has not been audited. From this point until the end of 
the report on page 51, the disclosures, with the exception of the

(i) Normally, 20% of gross bonus (before the deduction of income tax and National Insurance contributions) is automatically deferred and invested in Centrica shares
(deferred shares). 
Participants have the opportunity to make a further investment (investment shares), funded from net annual performance bonus, so that the maximum total investment 
(on a gross basis) is 50% of the individual’s maximum bonus entitlement for the preceding year. 
Certain initial arrangements were agreed in respect of Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff who joined the Board on 1 July 2006 and 1 March 2007 respectively. Sam Laidlaw 
invested his entire bonus paid in respect of the period 1 July to 31 December 2006. He also transferred shares into the scheme that he already held, such that the
total value of the investment as calculated on the basis as set out above was equal to 50% of the maximum bonus opportunity had he been employed for the whole
year. Nick Luff transferred shares into the scheme that he already held equal in value to 50% of the maximum bonus opportunity had he been employed for the
whole of 2006.  
(ii) The calculation of the conditional matching shares is made on a gross basis. Investment shares are grossed up (to reflect the impact of income tax and National 
Insurance contributions) for the calculation of the matching shares so that the deferred and investment shares are matched on the same basis. The number of matching
shares that vest will be determined on a straight-line basis from a zero match for no growth in economic profit to a two-times match for growth of 25% or above over a 
three-year period. The number of matching shares that will be released following the satisfaction of the performance condition will be increased to reflect the dividends 
that would have been paid during the three-year performance period. Dividends are paid on the deferred and investment shares to the participants on the normal
dividend payment date.
(iii) The scheme commenced in 2007. The purchase of deferred and investment shares, the transfer of shares already held and the conditional award of matching shares
were made on 4 April 2007.

(i) At the end of the performance period to 31 March 2007, the Company ranked 38th in the relevant comparator group. Accordingly, 78.3% of the original allocations were
released to participants on 4 April 2007. The released shares were subject to income tax at the individual’s marginal rate and National Insurance contributions (NICs)  
at the rate of 1%, based on the market value of the shares at the date of vesting. The income tax and NICs liability was satisfied by the sale of sufficient shares and,
accordingly, the Executive Directors only received the net number of shares following disposal, which, to the extent retained, is reflected in the shareholdings as at
31 December 2007 on page 48. 
(ii) At the end of the performance period the Company’s TSR performance will be assessed against that of the relevant LTIS comparator group. If, and to the extent that
the performance conditions are met, the relevant number of shares will be released to the Directors at the Trustee’s discretion as soon as practicable thereafter.
(iii) The percentage of the allocation eventually to vest is dependent on the satisfaction of performance criteria over a three-year performance period: half of the shares  
(EPS shares) will be subject to a performance condition based on the Group’s adjusted EPS growth relative to the growth in RPI over three financial years. EPS growth 
will be calculated by comparing the Group’s adjusted EPS figure for the financial period preceding the date of allocation with that for the financial period three years later;
and half of the shares will be determined by the Company’s Total Shareholder Return (TSR) performance relative to the other companies comprising the LTIS
comparator group – the FTSE 100 at the start of the three-year performance period (the TSR shares). At the end of the performance period, the TSR performance 
condition will be measured, the same calculation made for all the other 99 companies in the LTIS comparator group and a ranking list will be compiled. 
(iv) The first awards under the new LTIS (approval was sought and given by shareholders at the AGM held on 19 May 2006) were made to participants other than the
Executive Directors on 3 April 2006 (on the date that allocations would normally be made under the previous LTIS and within the 42-day period following the release of 
the Company’s annual results). The awards to the Executive Directors then in office could only be made after shareholder approval, but in order to align their awards with
those of other participants, their first awards were deemed to have been made on 3 April 2006 for all purposes of the new LTIS, including the calculation of the number 
of shares, the adjusted EPS and relative TSR performance tests and the three-year vesting period.  50

Directors’ pensions
Of the four Executive Directors, Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich are members of the Centrica Management Pension Scheme (CMPS).  
Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff, who joined the Company in recent years, are not members of any of Centrica’s pension schemes.  
CMPS 
The CMPS is a funded, HMRC-registered, final salary, occupational pension scheme. Its rules provide for the following main features: 
  normal retirement at age 62; 
  right to an immediate, unreduced pension on leaving service after age 60 at own request with employer consent, or on leaving 
service at Company’s request after age 55;  
  life assurance cover of four times pensionable salary for death in service;
  spouse’s pension on death in service payable at the rate of 50% of the member’s prospective pension and, on death after 
retirement, half of the accrued pension. Children’s pensions are also payable;
  members’ contributions payable at the rate of 6% of pensionable earnings. Contributions made by the Executive Directors who  
are also members of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme (CUPS) are payable at the rate of 6% of their total pensionable 
earnings above the scheme earnings cap;
  pension payable in the event of retirement due to ill health; 
  pensions in payment and in deferment guaranteed to increase in line with the increase in the RPI (a maximum of 6% applies  
to pension accrued after 6 April 2004); and 
  no discretionary practices are taken into account in calculating transfer values. 
All registered scheme benefits are subject to HMRC limits. Where these limits would restrict the pension promise due, the CUPS 
provides benefits on the salary in excess of the CMPS earnings cap to the level that would otherwise have been paid by the registered 
scheme. The benefits that arise under this are treated as being subject to the same rules as apply in respect of the registered portion 
of members’ benefits. No individual will receive benefits from Centrica which, when added to their retained benefits elsewhere, exceed 
two-thirds of their final pensionable earnings. CUPS is unfunded but the benefits are secured by a charge over certain Centrica assets. 
An appropriate provision in respect of the accrued value of these benefits has been made in the Company’s balance sheet.

(i) Accrued pension is that which would be paid annually on retirement at age 62, based on eligible service to and pensionable salary at 31 December 2007. The pension 
accrual rates for 2007 for Phil Bentley and Jake Ulrich were, 2.65% and 3.71% respectively. 
(ii) The increase in accrued pension has been adjusted to exclude inflation by revaluing the accrued pension as at 31 December 2006 by the rate of inflation (3.9%) and
deducting this from the accrued pension as at 31 December 2007. The rate of inflation used was 3.9%, the annual rate to 30 September 2007, the date used for 
pension increases under the scheme.
Pay in lieu of pension provision 
Under the terms of their contracts of employment, Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff are entitled to a salary supplement in lieu of pension 
provision of 40% and 30% of base salary, respectively. With the exception of £168,750 paid directly by the Company into Sam 
Laidlaw’s personal pension plan, these amounts are disclosed in the Directors’ emoluments table on page 47.

Independent Auditors’ 
Report to the Members  
of Centrica plc  
Independent Auditors’ report to the members of  
Centrica plc 
We have audited the Group Financial Statements of Centrica plc 
for the year ended 31 December 2007 which comprise the Group 
Income Statement, the Group Balance Sheet, the Group Cash
Flow Statement, the Group Statement of Recognised Income 
and Expense and the related notes. These Group Financial 
Statements have been prepared under the accounting policies
set out therein.
We have reported separately on the parent Company Financial 
Statements of Centrica plc for the year ended 31 December 2007 
and on the information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that 
is described as having been audited. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report and 
the Group Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law 
and International Financial Reporting Standards (IFRSs) as 
adopted by the European Union are set out in the Statement  
of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the Group Financial Statements in
accordance with relevant legal and regulatory requirements and 
International Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland). This report, 
including the opinion, has been prepared for and only for the
Company’s members as a body in accordance with Section 235 
of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, 
in giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any 
other purpose or to any other person to whom this report is 
shown or into whose hands it may come save where expressly 
agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the Group Financial 
Statements give a true and fair view and whether the Group 
Financial Statements have been properly prepared in accordance 
with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of the IAS Regulation. 
We also report to you whether, in our opinion the information 
given in the Directors’ Report (comprising the Directors’ Report – 
Business Review and the Directors’ Report – Governance) is 
consistent with the Group Financial Statements. 
In addition we report to you if, in our opinion, we have not 
received all the information and explanations we require for our 
audit, or if information specified by law regarding Directors’ 
remuneration and other transactions is not disclosed. 
We review whether the Corporate Governance Report reflects the 
Company’s compliance with the nine provisions of the Combined 
Code (2006) specified for our review by the Listing Rules of the 
Financial Services Authority, and we report if it does not. We are 
not required to consider whether the Board’s statements on 
internal control cover all risks and controls, or form an opinion 
on the effectiveness of the Group’s corporate governance 
procedures or its risk and control procedures. 
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited Group Financial 
Statements. The other information comprises only the Chairman’s 
Statement, the Directors’ Report, the Gas and Liquids Reserves, 
Five Year Record and Shareholder Information. We consider the 
implications for our report if we become aware of any apparent
misstatements or material inconsistencies with the Group 
Financial Statements. Our responsibilities do not extend to any 
other information. 
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the Group 
Financial Statements. It also includes an assessment of the 
significant estimates and judgements made by the Directors in
the preparation of the Group Financial Statements, and of
whether the accounting policies are appropriate to the Group’s 
circumstances, consistently applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary  
in order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the Group Financial Statements are free from 
material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the Group 
Financial Statements. 
Opinion 
In our opinion:
  the Group Financial Statements give a true and fair view, in 
accordance with IFRSs as adopted by the European Union, 
of the state of the Group’s affairs as at 31 December 2007 
and of its profit and cash flows for the year then ended;
  the Group Financial Statements have been properly prepared 
in accordance with the Companies Act 1985 and Article 4 of 
the IAS Regulation; and 
  the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent
with the Group Financial Statements.

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Notes to the  
Financial Statements  
1. General information 
Centrica plc is a Company domiciled and incorporated in the 
United Kingdom under the Companies Act 1985. The address  
of the registered office is given on page 41. The nature of the 
Group’s operations and its principal activities are set out in note 6 
and in the Directors’ Report – Business Review on pages 8 to 32.  
The consolidated Financial Statements of Centrica plc are
presented in pounds sterling. Operations and transactions 
conducted in currencies other than pounds sterling are included 
in the consolidated Financial Statements in accordance with 
the foreign currencies accounting policy set out in note 2. 
2. Summary of significant  
accounting policies 
The principal accounting policies applied in the preparation of 
these consolidated Financial Statements are set out below.  
These policies have been consistently applied to all the years 
presented, unless otherwise stated.  
Basis of preparation 
The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared in
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards 
(IFRS) as adopted by the European Union (EU) and therefore 
comply with Article 4 of the EU IAS Regulation. 
The consolidated Financial Statements have been prepared on
the historical cost basis, except for derivative financial instruments 
and available-for-sale investments, and the assets and liabilities  
of the Group pension schemes that have been measured at fair 
value. The carrying values of recognised assets and liabilities that 
are hedged items in fair value hedges, and are otherwise carried 
at cost, are adjusted to record changes in the fair values
attributable to the risks that are being hedged. The principal
accounting policies adopted are set out below. 
The preparation of Financial Statements in conformity with
IFRS requires the use of certain critical accounting estimates.
It requires management to exercise its judgement in the 
processes of applying the Group’s accounting policies. The 
areas involving a higher degree of judgement, complexity or 
areas where assumptions and estimates are significant to the 
consolidated Financial Statements are described in note 3. 
(a) Standards, amendments and interpretations  
effective in 2007 
In the current year the Group has adopted IFRS 7, Financial 
Instruments: Disclosures, which is effective for annual reporting 
periods beginning on or after 1 January 2007, and the related 
amendments to IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements.  
The impact of the adoption of IFRS 7 and the changes to IAS 1 
has been to expand the disclosures provided in these Financial 
Statements regarding the Group’s financial instruments and 
management of capital. 
Four interpretations issued by the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee are effective for the current 
period. These are IFRIC 7, Applying the Restatement Approach 
under IAS 29, Financial Reporting in Hyperinflationary Economies; 
IFRIC 8, Scope of IFRS 2; IFRIC 9, Re-assessment of Embedded 
Derivatives; and IFRIC 10, Interim Financial Reporting and 
Impairment. The adoption of these interpretations has not led  
to any changes in the Group’s accounting policies.  
(b) Standards, amendments and interpretations that are 
not yet effective and that have not been early adopted 
by the Group 
At the date of authorisation of these Financial Statements, the 
following standards, amendments to existing standards and 
interpretations which have not been applied in these Financial
Statements were in issue but not yet effective:  
  IAS 23 (Amendment), Borrowing Costs, effective from  
1 January 2009. The amendment to this standard is subject 
to EU endorsement. It requires an entity to capitalise 
borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, 
construction or production of a qualifying asset (one that 
takes a substantial period of time to get ready for use or sale) 
as part of the cost of that asset. The option of immediately 
expensing such borrowing costs will be removed. The Group 
intends to apply IAS 23 (Amended) from 1 January 2008, 
subject to endorsement by the EU. Subject to being endorsed, 
it will require a change to the Group’s existing accounting 
policy, where such costs are immediately expensed; 
  IFRS 8, Operating Segments, effective from 1 January 2009. 
This standard replaces IAS 14, Segment Reporting and 
requires segmental information reported to be based on that 
which Directors use internally for evaluating the performance 
of operating segments. The Group will apply IFRS 8 from  
1 January 2009. The impact of adopting IFRS 8 is under 
assessment; 
  IFRS 3 (Revised), Business Combinations was issued on  
10 January 2008 and is subject to EU endorsement. It is 
applicable to business combinations effected on or after  
1 January 2010, with earlier application permitted. The impact
of adopting IFRS 3 in future periods will be considered in
the event of a future business combination; and 
  IAS 27 (Revised), Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements was issued on 10 January 2008 and is subject to 
EU endorsement. The revised standard is effective for annual 
periods beginning on or after 1 July 2009. The impact of 
adopting IAS 27 in future periods is under assessment. 
The Directors anticipate that the adoption of the following
amendments to standards and interpretations in future periods, 
which were also in issue but not effective at the date of 
authorisation of these Financial Statements, will have no material 
impact on the Financial Statements of the Group:  
  IAS 1 (Amendment), Presentation of Financial Statements, 
effective from 1 January 2009, subject to EU endorsement;
  IAS 32 (Amendment), Financial Instruments: Presentation and
IAS 1 (Amendment), Presentation of Financial Statements, 
effective from 1 January 2009, subject to EU endorsement;
  IFRS 2 (Amendment), Share Based Payment – Vesting 
Conditions and Cancellations, effective from 1 January 2009, 
subject to EU endorsement; 59
Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
  IFRIC 11, IFRS 2 – Group and Treasury Share Transactions, 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 March 2007; 
  IFRIC 12, Service Concession Arrangements, effective for 
annual periods beginning on or after 1 January 2008; 
  IFRIC 13, Customer Loyalty Programmes, effective for  
annual periods beginning on or after 1 July 2008; and
  IFRIC 14, IAS 19 – The Limit on a Defined Benefit Asset, 
Minimum Funding Requirements and their Interaction, 
effective for annual periods beginning on or after  
1 January 2008.
(c) Changes of accounting presentation 
The Group has adopted the following changes of accounting 
presentation in the year: 
  Domestic energy suppliers are given energy savings targets 
by the Government related to the size of their customer base. 
Costs incurred by British Gas Residential under such energy 
saving programmes are presented as part of cost of sales in 
the Income Statement. Previously such costs were presented 
as operating costs. The Directors consider the change of 
accounting presentation better reflects the nature of the costs 
as a direct cost of supplying energy to domestic customers. 
The impact of the change of accounting presentation is to 
report £91 million of costs in the year within cost of sales.  
The impact on comparatives is to reclassify £90 million from 
operating costs to cost of sales. 
  Capitalised exploration and evaluation costs associated  
with oil and gas activities, such as licence acquisition costs, 
exploratory drilling costs, trenching and sampling costs,  
are presented as intangible assets. Previously the Group 
presented such capitalised costs as property, plant and
equipment. The Directors consider the change of accounting 
presentation better reflects the nature of such costs.  
The impact of the change in accounting presentation is to 
report £41 million of exploration and evaluation costs within 
intangible assets as at 31 December 2007 and £29 million  
in investing cash outflows relating to purchases of intangible 
assets for the year ending 31 December 2007. The impact 
on comparatives is to reclassify £24 million of capitalised 
costs from property, plant and equipment to intangible assets
as at 31 December 2006 and to reclassify £23 million of 
investing cash outflows from purchases of property, plant  
and equipment to purchases of intangible assets for the year 
ending 31 December 2006. 
(d) Change to reported segments 
In 2007 the Group changed its reportable segments creating 
a Power generation segment and an Industrial and commercial 
reportable segment. Prior to 2007 these two segments were 
reported together as Industrial sales and wholesaling.  
The new Power generation segment comprises the Group’s 
UK generation assets including the Spalding power station,
associated emissions activity, as well as flexible volume power 
procurement contracts. Beginning in 2007, sales of generated 
power from Centrica Energy to other Group segments is 
transferred and reported at fair value. Prior to 2007, the sale of 
generated power from Centrica Energy to other Group segments 
was transferred and reported at cost. As a result of the change, 
Power generation and Industrial and commercial are now 
reported separately. Consequently, the basis on which operating 
costs are allocated to other Group segments has also changed. 
Prior period comparatives have not been restated as it is 
impracticable to provide this information on an equivalent basis. 
For the purpose of comparison, had the Group continued with
its previous basis of segmental reporting with inter-segment 
transfers of power reported on a cost basis, and operating costs 
allocated to segments with reference to the cost methodology, 
the Power generation and Industrial and commercial segments 
together would have reported gross segment revenues of  
£1,027 million, inter-segment revenue of £185 million and
externally reported segment revenue of £842 million and an
operating profit before exceptional items and certain re-
measurements of £130 million (loss of £8 million after exceptional 
items and certain re-measurements) for the year ending  
31 December 2007. In addition for the year ending 31 December 
2007, British Gas Residential would have reported an increase  
to operating profit of £61 million, British Gas Business would
have reported an increase to operating profit of £9 million, Gas 
production and development would have reported an increase  
in operating profit of £24 million and Accord energy trading would 
have reported an increase in operating profit of £1 million, all 
before exceptional items and certain re-measurements. 
(e) Income statement presentation 
The Group’s Income Statement and segmental note separately 
identify the effects of re-measurement of certain financial 
instruments, and items which are exceptional, in order to provide 
readers with a clear and consistent presentation of the Group’s 
underlying performance, as described below. 
Certain re-measurements 
As part of its energy procurement activities the Group enters into 
a range of commodity contracts designed to achieve security of 
energy supply. These contracts comprise both purchases and 
sales and cover a wide range of volumes, prices and timescales. 
The majority of the underlying supply comes from high volume 
long-term contracts which are complemented by short-term 
arrangements. These short-term contracts are entered into for the 
purpose of balancing energy supplies and customer demand and 
to optimise the price paid by the Group. Short-term demand can
vary significantly as a result of factors such as weather, power 
generation profiles and short-term movements in market prices. 
Many of the energy procurement contracts are held for the 
purpose of receipt or delivery of commodities in accordance  
with the Group’s purchase, sale or usage requirements and 
are therefore out of scope of IAS 39, Financial Instruments: 
Recognition and Measurement. However, a number of contracts 
are considered to be derivative financial instruments and are
required to be fair valued under IAS 39, primarily because their 
terms include the ability to trade elements of the contracted 
volumes on a net-settled basis.  
The Group has shown the fair value adjustments arising on these 
contracts separately in the certain re-measurements column. 
This is because the intention of management is, subject to short-
term demand balancing, to use these energy supplies to meet
customer demand. Accordingly, management believe the ultimate 
net charge to cost of sales will be consistent with the price of 
energy agreed in these contracts and that the fair value  60
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Notes to the  
Financial Statements  
continued 
adjustments will reverse as the energy is supplied over the life 
of the contract. This makes the fair value re-measurements very 
different in nature from costs arising from the physical delivery  
of energy in the period. 
At the balance sheet date the fair value represents the difference 
between the prices agreed in the respective contracts and the 
actual or anticipated market price of acquiring the same amount 
of energy on the open market. The movement in the fair value 
taken to certain re-measurements in the Income Statement 
represents the unwind of the contracted volume delivered or 
consumed during the period, combined with the change in fair
value of future contracted energy as a result of movements in 
forward energy prices during the year.  
These adjustments represent the significant majority of the  
items included in certain re-measurements. In addition to these, 
however, the Group has identified a number of comparable 
contractual arrangements where the difference between the 
price which the Group expects to pay or receive under a  
contract and the market price is required to be fair valued
by IAS 39. These additional items relate to cross-border 
transportation or transmission capacity, storage capacity and 
contracts relating to the sale of energy by-products, on which 
economic value has been created which is not wholly recognised 
under the requirements of IAS 39. For these arrangements the
related fair value adjustments are also included under certain 
re-measurements.  
These arrangements are managed separately from proprietary 
energy trading activities where trades are entered into 
speculatively for the purpose of making profits in their own right. 
These proprietary trades are included in the results before certain 
re-measurements. 
Exceptional items 
As permitted by IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, 
certain items are presented separately. The items that the Group 
separately presents as exceptional are items which are of a non-
recurring nature and, in the judgement of the Directors, need to 
be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or incidence  
in order to obtain a clear and consistent presentation of the 
Group’s underlying business performance. Items which may be 
considered exceptional in nature include disposals of businesses, 
business restructurings, the renegotiation of significant contracts 
and asset write-downs.  
Basis of consolidation 
The Group Financial Statements consolidate the Financial 
Statements of the Company and entities controlled by the 
Company (its subsidiaries) made up to 31 December each 
year, and incorporate the results of its share of jointly controlled 
entities and associates using the equity method of accounting.  
Control is achieved where the Company has the power to govern
the financial and operating policies of an investee entity so as to 
obtain benefits from its activities. 
The results of subsidiaries acquired or disposed of during the  
year are consolidated from the effective date of acquisition or up 
to the effective date of disposal, as appropriate. Where necessary 
adjustments are made to the financial statements of subsidiaries, 
associates and jointly controlled entities to bring the accounting 
policies used into line with those used by the Group. 
All intra-group transactions, balances, income and expenses
are eliminated on consolidation.
Interests in joint ventures 
A jointly controlled entity is a joint venture which involves  
the establishment of an entity to engage in economic activity, 
which the Group jointly controls with its fellow venturers. Under 
the equity method, investments in jointly controlled entities are 
carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s 
share of net assets of the jointly controlled entity, less any 
impairment in value in individual investments. The Income 
Statement reflects the Group’s share of the results of operations 
after tax of the jointly controlled entity. 
Certain of the Group’s exploration and production activity is 
conducted through joint ventures where the venturers have
a direct interest in and jointly control the assets of the venture.  
The results, assets, liabilities and cash flows of these jointly 
controlled assets are included in the consolidated Financial 
Statements in proportion to the Group’s interest. 
Interests in associates
An associate is an entity in which the Group has an equity  
interest and over which it has the ability to exercise significant
influence. Under the equity method, investments in associates  
are carried at cost plus post-acquisition changes in the Group’s 
share of the net assets of the associate, less any impairment in
value in individual investments. The Income Statement reflects 
the Group’s share of the results of operations after tax of the 
associate.  
Revenue 
Revenue is recognised to the extent that it is probable that the 
economic benefits will flow to the Group and the revenue can
be reliably measured. Revenue includes amounts receivable for 
goods and services provided in the normal course of business, 
net of discounts, rebates, VAT and other sales related taxes. 
Energy supply: Revenue is recognised on the basis of energy 
supplied during the period. Revenue for energy supply activities 
includes an assessment of energy supplied to customers 
between the date of the last meter reading and the year end 
(unread). Unread gas and electricity is estimated using historical 
consumption patterns, taking into account the industry 
reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage  
by supplier, and is included in accrued energy income  
within trade and other receivables.  
Proprietary energy trading: Revenue comprises both realised 
(settled) and unrealised (fair value changes) net gains and losses 
from trading in physical and financial energy contracts.  
Storage services: Storage capacity revenues are recognised 
evenly over the contract period, whilst commodity revenues for 
the injection and withdrawal of gas are recognised at the point  
of gas flowing into or out of the storage facilities. 
Home services and fixed-fee service contracts: Where the Group 
has an ongoing obligation to provide services, revenues are  61
Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
apportioned on a time basis and amounts billed in advance are 
treated as deferred income and excluded from current revenue. 
For one-off services, such as installations, revenue is recognised 
at the date of service provision. Revenue from fixed-fee service 
contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of 
the contract, reflecting the benefits receivable by the customer, 
which span the life of the contract as a result of emergency 
maintenance being available throughout the contract term. 
Gas production: Revenue associated with exploration and 
production sales (of natural gas, crude oil and condensates) is 
recognised when title passes to the customer. Revenue from  
the production of natural gas, oil and condensates in which the 
Group has an interest with other producers is recognised based 
on the Group’s working interest and the terms of the relevant
production sharing arrangements (the entitlement method). 
Differences between production sold and the Group’s share 
of production are not significant. 
Power generation: Revenue is recognised on the basis of power 
supplied during the period.  
Interest income: Interest income is accrued on a time basis,
by reference to the principal outstanding and at the effective 
interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts 
estimated future cash receipts through the expected life of the
financial asset to that asset’s net carrying value.  
Cost of sales
Energy supply includes the cost of gas and electricity produced 
and purchased during the period taking into account the industry 
reconciliation process for total gas and total electricity usage by 
supplier, and related transportation, distribution, royalty costs and 
bought in materials and services.  
Home services’ and fixed-fee service contracts cost of sales 
includes direct labour and related overheads on installation
work, repairs and service contracts in the period.  
Employee share schemes 
The Group has a number of employee share schemes, detailed  
in the Directors’ Report – Corporate Responsibility Review on 
page 32, the Remuneration Report on pages 42 to 45 and in note 
33, under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments to 
certain employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are 
measured at fair value at the date of grant (excluding the effect of 
non market-based vesting conditions). The fair value determined 
at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together 
with a corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period,  
based on the Group’s estimate of the number of awards that  
will vest and adjusted for the effect of non market-based  
vesting conditions. 
Fair value is measured using methods appropriate to each of the 
different schemes as follows: 
LTIS: awards up to 
2005 
A Black-Scholes valuation augmented  
by a Monte Carlo simulation to predict  
the total shareholder return performance

Foreign currencies 
The consolidated Financial Statements are presented in pounds 
sterling, which is the functional currency of the Company and 
the Group’s presentational currency. Each entity in the Group 
determines its own functional currency and items included in the 
Financial Statements of each entity are measured using that 
functional currency. Transactions in foreign currencies are initially 
recorded at the functional currency rate ruling at the date of the 
transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign 
currencies are retranslated at the functional currency rate of 
exchange ruling at the balance sheet date. All differences are 
included in the Income Statement for the period with the 
exception of exchange differences on foreign currency 
borrowings that provide a hedge against a net investment in a
foreign entity. These are taken directly to equity until the disposal 
of the net investment, at which time they are recognised in the 
Income Statement. Non-monetary items that are measured in
terms of historical cost in a currency other than the functional
currency of the entity concerned are translated using the
exchange rates as at the dates of the initial transactions.  
For the purpose of presenting consolidated Financial  
Statements, the assets and liabilities of the Group’s foreign 
subsidiary undertakings, jointly controlled entities and associates 
are translated into pounds sterling at exchange rates prevailing  
on the balance sheet date. The results of foreign subsidiary 
undertakings, jointly controlled entities and associates are 
translated into pounds sterling at average rates of exchange
for the relevant period. Exchange differences arising from the
retranslation of the opening net assets and the results are 
transferred to the Group’s foreign currency translation reserve,  
a separate component of equity, and are reported in the 
Statement of Recognised Income and Expense. In the
event of the disposal of an undertaking with assets and liabilities 
denominated in a foreign currency, the cumulative translation
difference arising in the foreign currency translation reserve is 
charged or credited to the Income Statement on disposal.  
Exchange differences on foreign currency borrowings, foreign 
currency swaps and forward exchange contracts used to  
hedge foreign currency net investments in foreign subsidiary
undertakings, jointly controlled entities and associates are  
taken directly to reserves and are reported in the Statement  
of Recognised Income and Expense. All other exchange 
movements are recognised in the Income Statement for  
the period. 
Business combinations and goodwill 
The acquisition of subsidiaries is accounted for using the
purchase method. The cost of the acquisition is measured as 
the cash paid and the aggregate of the fair values, at the date of 
exchange, of other assets given, liabilities incurred or assumed,  62
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Notes to the  
Financial Statements  
continued 
and equity instruments issued by the Group in exchange for 
control of the acquiree, plus any costs directly attributable to the 
business combination. The acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities 
and contingent liabilities that meet the conditions for recognition 
under IFRS 3, Business Combinations are recognised at their  
fair value at the acquisition date, except for non-current assets  
(or disposal groups) that are classified as held for resale in 
accordance with IFRS 5, Non-Current Assets Held for Sale and 
Discontinued Operations, which are recognised and measured
at fair value less costs to sell.  
Goodwill arising on a business combination represents the 
excess of the cost of acquisition over the Group’s interest in the 
fair value of the identifiable assets and liabilities of a subsidiary, 
jointly controlled entity or associate at the date of acquisition.
Goodwill is initially recognised as an asset at cost and is 
subsequently measured at cost less any accumulated impairment 
losses. If, after reassessment, the Group’s interest in the net fair 
value of the acquiree’s identifiable assets, liabilities and contingent 
liabilities exceeds the cost of the business combination, the 
excess is recognised immediately in the Income Statement. 
The interest of minority shareholders in the acquiree is initially 
measured at the minority’s proportion of the net fair value of 
the assets, liabilities and contingent liabilities recognised.  
Goodwill which is recognised as an asset is reviewed for 
impairment, annually, or more frequently if events or changes 
in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may be 
impaired. Any impairment is recognised immediately in the
Income Statement and is not subsequently reversed.  
For the purpose of impairment testing, goodwill is allocated to 
each of the Group’s cash-generating units or groups of cash-
generating units that expect to benefit from the business 
combination in which the goodwill arose. Cash-generating units
to which goodwill has been allocated are tested for impairment 
annually, or more frequently when there is an indication that the 
unit may be impaired. If the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit or groups of cash-generating units is less than  
the carrying amount of the unit, the impairment loss is allocated
first to reduce the carrying amount of any goodwill allocated to
the unit and then to the other assets of the unit pro-rata on the 
basis of the carrying amount of each asset in the unit. 
On disposal of a subsidiary, associate or jointly controlled  
entity, the attributable amount of goodwill is included in the
determination of the profit or loss on disposal. 
Other intangible assets
Intangible assets acquired separately are measured on initial 
recognition at cost. Intangible assets include emissions trading 
schemes, renewable obligation certificates and certain exploration 
and evaluation expenditures, the accounting policies for which are 
dealt with separately below. For purchased application software, 
for example investments in customer relationship management 
and billing systems, cost includes contractors’ charges, materials, 
directly attributable labour and directly attributable overheads.  
Capitalisation begins when expenditure for the asset is being 
incurred and activities necessary to prepare the asset  
for use are in progress. Capitalisation ceases when substantially 
all the activities that are necessary to prepare the asset for use 
are complete. Amortisation commences at the point of 
commercial deployment. The cost of intangible assets acquired  
in a business combination is their fair value as at the date of 
acquisition. Following initial recognition, intangible assets are 
carried at cost less any accumulated amortisation and any 
accumulated impairment losses. The useful lives of intangible
assets are assessed to be either finite or indefinite. Intangible
assets with finite lives are amortised over the useful economic life 
and assessed for impairment whenever there is an indication that 
the intangible asset may be impaired. The amortisation period
and the amortisation method for an intangible asset are reviewed 
at least at each financial year-end. Changes in the expected 
useful life or the expected pattern of consumption of future 
economic benefits embodied in the asset are accounted for on a 
prospective basis by changing the amortisation period or method, 
as appropriate, and treated as changes in accounting estimates.  
Intangible assets are derecognised on disposal, or when no future 
economic benefits are expected from their use.
Intangible assets with indefinite useful lives are tested for 
impairment annually either individually or at the cash-generating 
unit level. Such intangibles are not amortised. The useful life of an 
intangible asset with an indefinite useful life is reviewed annually
to determine whether the indefinite life assessment continues to 
be supportable. If not, the change in the useful life assessment 
from indefinite to finite is made on a prospective basis.  
The amortisation period for the principal categories of intangible 
assets are as follows: 
Application software up to 10 years 
Licences up to 20 years 
Consents up to 25 years 
Contractual customer relationships up to 20 years 
Identifiable acquired brand  Indefinite 
EU Emissions Trading Scheme and renewable  
obligations certificates 
Granted CO2 emissions allowances received in a period are 
initially recognised at nominal value (nil value). Purchased CO2
emissions allowances are initially recognised at cost (purchase
price) within intangible assets. A liability is recognised when the 
level of emissions exceed the level of allowances granted. The
liability is measured at the cost of purchased allowances up to the 
level of purchased allowances held, and then at the market price 
of allowances ruling at the balance sheet date, with movements  
in the liability recognised in operating profit. Forward contracts for 
the purchase or sale of CO2 emissions allowances are measured 
at fair value with gains and losses arising from changes in fair 
value recognised in the Income Statement. The intangible asset  
is surrendered at the end of the compliance period reflecting the 
consumption of economic benefit. As a result no amortisation
is recorded during the period. 
Purchased renewable obligation certificates are initially 
recognised at cost within intangible assets. A liability for the 
renewables obligation is recognised based on the level of 
electricity supplied to customers, and is calculated in accordance 
with percentages set by the UK Government and the renewable  63
Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
obligation certificate buyout price for that period. The intangible
asset is surrendered at the end of the compliance period 
reflecting the consumption of economic benefit. As a result 
no amortisation is recorded during the period. 
Property, plant and equipment 
Property, plant and equipment is included in the Balance Sheet  
at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions  
for impairment.
The initial cost of an asset comprises its purchase price or 
construction cost and any costs directly attributable to bringing
the asset into operation. The purchase price or construction
cost is the aggregate amount paid and the fair value of any other 
consideration given to acquire the asset. 
Freehold land is not depreciated. Other property, plant and 
equipment, except upstream production assets, are depreciated 
on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less 
estimated residual values, of individual assets over their estimated 
useful lives. The depreciation periods for the principal categories 
of assets are as follows: 
Freehold and leasehold buildings up to 50 years 
Plant 5 to 20 years 
Power stations and wind farms up to 30 years 
Equipment and vehicles 3 to 10 years 
Storage up to 28 years 
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their 
expected useful economic lives on the same basis as for owned 
assets, or where shorter, the lease term.  
The carrying values of property, plant and equipment are reviewed 
for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate 
that the carrying value may not be recoverable. 
Residual values and useful lives are re-assessed annually and 
if necessary changes are accounted for prospectively. 
Exploration, evaluation and production assets 
Centrica uses the successful efforts method of accounting  
for exploration and evaluation expenditure. Exploration and 
evaluation expenditure associated with an exploration well, 
including acquisition costs related to exploration and evaluation 
activities, are initially capitalised as intangible assets. Certain 
expenditures such as geological and geophysical exploration 
costs are expensed. If the prospects are subsequently 
determined to be successful on completion of evaluation,  
the relevant expenditure including licence acquisition costs is
transferred to property, plant and equipment and depreciated 
on a unit of production basis. If the prospects are subsequently 
determined to be unsuccessful on completion of evaluation, 
the associated costs are expensed in the period in which that 
determination is made.  
All field development costs are capitalised as property, plant and 
equipment. Such costs relate to the acquisition and installation  
of production facilities and include development drilling costs, 
project-related engineering and other technical services costs. 
Property, plant and equipment, including rights and concessions 
related to production activities, are depreciated from the 
commencement of production in the fields concerned, using 
the unit of production method, based on all of the proven and 
probable reserves of those fields. Changes in these estimates 
are dealt with prospectively.  
The net carrying value of fields in production and development  
is compared on a field-by-field basis with the likely discounted
future net revenues to be derived from the remaining commercial 
reserves. An impairment loss is recognised where it is considered 
that recorded amounts are unlikely to be fully recovered from the 
net present value of future net revenues. Exploration and production
assets are reviewed annually for indicators of impairment.  
Decommissioning costs 
Provision is made for the net present value of the estimated cost 
of decommissioning gas production facilities at the end of the 
producing lives of fields, and storage facilities and power stations 
at the end of the useful life of the facilities, based on price levels 
and technology at the balance sheet date.  
When this provision gives access to future economic benefits,
a decommissioning asset is recognised and included within 
property, plant and equipment. Changes in these estimates and 
changes to the discount rates are dealt with prospectively and 
reflected as an adjustment to the provision and corresponding 
decommissioning asset included within property, plant and 
equipment. For gas production facilities and offshore storage 
facilities the decommissioning asset is amortised using the unit  
of production method, based on proven and probable reserves. 
For power stations the decommissioning asset is amortised on a 
straight-line basis over the useful life of the facility. The unwinding 
of the discount on the provision is included in the Income 
Statement within interest expense.  
Leases 
The determination of whether an arrangement is, or contains, a 
lease is based on the substance of the arrangement and requires 
an assessment of whether the fulfilment of the arrangement  
is dependent on the use of a specific asset or assets and the 
arrangement conveys a right to use the asset. Leases are 
classified as finance leases whenever the terms of the lease
transfer substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership to
the lessee. All other leases are classified as operating leases. 
Assets held under finance leases are capitalised and included
in property, plant and equipment at their fair value, or if lower,
at the present value of the minimum lease payments, each 
determined at the inception of the lease. The obligations relating 
to finance leases, net of finance charges in respect of future 
periods, are included within bank loans and other borrowings, 
with the amount payable within 12 months included in bank
overdrafts and loans within current liabilities. Lease payments 
are apportioned between finance charges and reduction of the 
finance lease obligation so as to achieve a constant rate of 
interest on the remaining balance of the liability. Finance charges 
are charged directly against income.  
Payments under operating leases are charged to the Income 
Statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the  
relevant lease. 64

Impairment of property, plant and equipment and 
intangible assets excluding goodwill 
At each balance sheet date, the Group reviews the carrying 
amounts of its intangible assets and property, plant and 
equipment to determine whether there is any indication that those 
assets have suffered an impairment loss. If any such indication 
exists, the recoverable amount of the asset is estimated in order 
to determine the extent of any impairment loss. Where the asset 
does not generate cash flows that are independent from other 
assets, the Group estimates the recoverable amount of the cash-
generating unit to which the asset belongs. An intangible asset 
with an indefinite useful life is tested for impairment annually and 
whenever there is an indication that the asset may be impaired. 
Recoverable amount is the higher of fair value less costs to sell 
and value in use. In assessing value in use, the estimated future 
cash flows are discounted to their present value using a pre-tax 
discount rate that reflects current market assessments of the time 
value of money and the risks specific to the asset concerned. 
If the recoverable amount of an asset (or cash-generating unit)  
is estimated to be less than its carrying amount, the carrying 
amount of the asset (cash-generating unit) is reduced to its 
recoverable amount. An impairment loss is recognised 
immediately as an expense.
An impairment loss is reversed only if there has been a change in 
the estimate used to determine the asset’s recoverable amount 
since the last impairment loss was recognised. Where an
impairment loss subsequently reverses, the carrying amount  
of the asset (cash-generating unit) is increased to the revised 
estimate of its recoverable amount, but so that the increased 
carrying amount does not exceed the carrying amount that would 
have been determined had no impairment loss been recognised 
for the asset (cash-generating unit) in prior years. A reversal of  
an impairment loss is recognised as income immediately. After 
such a reversal the depreciation or amortisation charge, where 
relevant, is adjusted in future periods to allocate the asset’s 
revised carrying amount, less any residual value, on a systematic 
basis over its remaining useful life. 
Non-current assets held for sale  
Non-current assets (and disposal groups) classified as held for 
sale are measured at the lower of carrying amount and fair value 
less costs to sell. No depreciation is charged in respect of non-
current assets classified as held for sale. 
Non-current assets and disposal groups are classified as held
for sale if their carrying amount will be recovered through a sale
transaction rather than through continuing use. This condition 
is regarded as met only when the sale is highly probable and 
the asset (or disposal group) is available for immediate sale in  
its present condition. Management must be committed to the  
sale which should be expected to qualify for recognition as a 
completed sale within one year from the date of classification.
Inventories 
Inventories, excluding inventories of gas and oil, are valued on  
a first-in, first-out basis, at the lower of cost and estimated net 
realisable value after allowance for redundant and slow-moving 
items. Inventories of gas and oil are valued on a weighted average 
basis, at the lower of cost and estimated net realisable value.
Take-or-pay contracts 
Where payments are made to external suppliers under  
take-or-pay obligations for gas not taken, they are treated as 
prepayments and included within other receivables, as they 
generate future economic benefits. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension 
schemes. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit 
schemes is determined separately for each scheme using the
projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. 
They are recognised outside the Income Statement and
presented in the Statement of Recognised Income and Expense.  
The cost of providing retirement pensions and other benefits is 
charged to the Income Statement over the periods benefiting
from employees’ service. Past service cost is recognised 
immediately to the extent that the benefits are already vested, and 
otherwise is amortised on a straight-line basis over the average 
period until the benefits become vested. The difference between 
the expected return on scheme assets and the change in present 
value of scheme obligations resulting from the passage of time is 
recognised in the Income Statement within interest income or 
interest expense.  
The retirement benefit obligation/asset recognised in the Balance 
Sheet represents the present value of the defined benefit 
obligation of the schemes as adjusted for unrecognised past 
service cost, and the fair value of the schemes’ assets. 
Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present 
obligation (legal or constructive) as a result of a past event, that
can be reliably measured, and it is probable that the Group will  
be required to settle that obligation. Provisions are measured at
the Directors’ best estimate of the expenditure required to settle 
the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to 
present value where the effect is material. Where discounting 
is used, the increase in the provision due to the passage of  
time is recognised in the Income Statement included within
interest expense. 
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax, UK petroleum revenue
tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid 
(or recovered) using the tax rates and laws that have been 
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all temporary differences 
identified at the balance sheet date, except to the extent that 
the deferred tax arises from the initial recognition of goodwill  
(if amortisation of goodwill is not deductible for tax purposes) or 
the initial recognition of an asset or liability in a transaction which 
is not a business combination and at the time of the transaction 
affects neither accounting profit nor taxable profit and loss. 
Temporary differences are differences between the carrying 
amount of the Group’s assets and liabilities and their tax base.  
Deferred tax liabilities may be offset against deferred tax assets 
within the same taxable entity or qualifying local tax group. Any 
remaining deferred tax asset is recognised only when, on the 65
Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
basis of all available evidence, it can be regarded as probable that 
there will be suitable taxable profits, within the same jurisdiction, 
in the foreseeable future, against which the deductible temporary 
difference can be utilised. 
Deferred tax is provided on temporary differences arising on 
subsidiaries, jointly controlled entities and associates, except 
where the timing of the reversal of the temporary difference can
be controlled and it is probable that the temporary difference will 
not reverse in the foreseeable future. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are 
expected to apply in the periods in which the asset is realised
or liability settled, based on tax rates and laws that have been
enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.
Measurement of deferred tax liabilities and assets reflects the 
tax consequences expected to fall from the manner in which  
the asset or liability is recovered or settled. 
Financial instruments  
Financial assets and financial liabilities are recognised in the 
Group Balance Sheet when the Group becomes a party to the 
contractual provisions of the instrument. Financial assets are 
de-recognised when the Group no longer has the rights to cash
flows, the risks and rewards of ownership or control of the asset. 
Financial liabilities are de-recognised when the obligation under 
the liability is discharged, cancelled or expires.
(a) Trade receivables 
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at original invoice 
amount less an allowance for any uncollectible amounts. 
Provision is made when there is objective evidence that the 
Group may not be able to collect the trade receivable. Balances 
are written off when recoverability is assessed as being remote. 
(b) Share capital 
Ordinary shares are classified as equity. Incremental costs directly 
attributable to the issue of new shares are shown in equity as a 
deduction from the proceeds received. Own equity instruments
that are reacquired (treasury shares) are deducted from equity. 
No gain or loss is recognised in the Income Statement on
the purchase, sale, issue or cancellation of the Group’s own
equity instruments.  
(c) Cash and cash equivalents 
Cash and cash equivalents comprise cash in hand and current
balances with banks and similar institutions, which are readily 
convertible to known amounts of cash and which are subject to
insignificant risk of changes in value and have an original maturity 
of three months or less. 
For the purpose of the consolidated Cash Flow Statement,  
cash and cash equivalents consist of cash and cash equivalents 
as defined above, net of outstanding bank overdrafts. 
(d) Interest-bearing loans and other borrowings 
All interest-bearing loans and other borrowings are initially 
recognised at fair value net of directly attributable transaction costs. 
After initial recognition, interest-bearing loans and other 
borrowings are subsequently measured at amortised cost using 
the effective interest method, except when they are the hedged
item in an effective fair value hedge relationship where the 
carrying value is also adjusted to reflect the fair value movements 
associated with the hedged risks. Such fair value movements 
are recognised in the Income Statement. Amortised cost is 
calculated by taking into account any issue costs, and any 
discount or premium. 
(e) Units issued by The Consumers’ Waterheater  
Income Fund 
Prior to deconsolidation as explained in note 3, units issued  
by The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund which contain 
redemption rights providing unit holders with the right to redeem 
units back to the Fund for cash or another financial asset are 
treated as a financial liability and recorded at the present value  
of the redemption amount. Gains and losses related to changes 
in the carrying value of the financial liability up to the date of 
deconsolidation are included in the Income Statement within 
discontinued operations.  
(f) Other financial assets 
Available-for-sale financial assets are those non-derivative 
financial assets that are designated as available-for-sale, which 
are initially recognised at fair value, and included within other 
financial assets within the Balance Sheet. Available-for-sale 
financial assets are subsequently recognised at fair value with 
gains and losses arising from changes in fair value recognised
directly in equity and presented in the Statement of Recognised 
Income and Expense, until the asset is disposed of or is 
determined to be impaired, at which time the cumulative gain  
or loss previously recognised in equity is included in the Income
Statement for the period. Accrued interest or dividends arising  
on available-for-sale financial assets are recognised in the  
Income Statement.  
Impairment losses recognised in the Income Statement for equity 
investments classified as available-for-sale are not subsequently 
reversed through the Income Statement. Impairment losses 
recognised in the Income Statement for debt instruments 
classified as available-for-sale are subsequently reversed if an 
increase in the fair value of the instrument can be objectively 
related to an event occurring after the recognition of the 
impairment loss.  
(g) Derivative financial instruments  
The Group routinely enters into sale and purchase transactions 
for physical delivery of gas, power and oil. A portion of these 
transactions take the form of contracts that were entered into and 
continue to be held for the purpose of receipt or delivery of the 
physical commodity in accordance with the Group’s expected 
sale, purchase or usage requirements, and are not within the 
scope of IAS 39. 
Certain purchase and sales contracts for the physical delivery  
of gas, power and oil are within the scope of IAS 39 because  
they net settle or contain written options. Such contracts are 
accounted for as derivatives under IAS 39 and are recognised 
in the Balance Sheet at fair value. Gains and losses arising  
from changes in fair value on derivatives that do not qualify  
for hedge accounting are taken directly to the Income Statement 
for the year.   66
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Notes to the  
Financial Statements  
continued 
The Group uses a range of derivatives for both trading and to 
hedge exposures to financial risks, such as interest rate, foreign 
exchange and energy price risks, arising in the normal course of 
business. The use of derivative financial instruments is governed 
by the Group’s policies approved by the Board of Directors. 
Further detail on the Group’s risk management policies is 
included within the Directors’ Report – Governance on pages 39 
to 40 and in note 4 to the Financial Statements.  
The accounting treatment for derivatives is dependent on whether 
they are entered into for trading or hedging purposes. A derivative 
instrument is considered to be used for hedging purposes when  
it alters the risk profile of an underlying exposure of the Group  
in line with the Group’s risk management policies and is in
accordance with established guidelines, which require that the
hedging relationship is documented at its inception, ensure that 
the derivative is highly effective in achieving its objective, and 
require that its effectiveness can be reliably measured. The Group 
also holds derivatives which are not designated as hedges and 
are held for trading.  
All derivatives are recognised at fair value on the date on which
the derivative is entered into and are re-measured to fair value
at each reporting date. Derivatives are carried as assets when  
the fair value is positive and as liabilities when the fair value is 
negative. Derivative assets and derivative liabilities are offset 
and presented on a net basis only when both a legal right  
of set-off exists and the intention to net settle the derivative 
contracts is present.  
The Group enters into certain energy derivative contracts 
covering periods for which observable market data does not 
exist. The fair value of such derivatives is estimated by reference 
in part to published price quotations from active markets, to the 
extent that such observable market data exists, and in part by
using valuation techniques, whose inputs include data, which 
is not based on or derived from observable markets. Where the 
fair value at initial recognition for such contracts differs from the 
transaction price, a fair value gain or fair value loss will arise.
This is referred to as a day-one gain or day-one loss. Such gains 
and losses are deferred and amortised to the Income Statement 
based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual 
period until such time observable market data becomes available. 
When observable market data becomes available, any remaining 
deferred day-one gains or losses are recognised within the 
Income Statement. Recognition of the gain or loss that results 
from changes in fair value depends on the purpose for issuing or 
holding the derivative. For derivatives that do not qualify for hedge 
accounting, any gains or losses arising from changes in fair value 
are taken directly to the Income Statement and are included 
within gross profit or interest income and interest expense. 
Gains and losses arising on derivatives entered into for 
speculative energy trading purposes are presented on a net 
basis within revenue.  
Embedded derivatives: Derivatives embedded in other financial
instruments or other host contracts are treated as separate 
derivatives when their risks and characteristics are not closely 
related to those of the host contracts and the host contracts 
are not carried at fair value, with gains or losses reported in the 
Income Statement. The closely related nature of embedded 
derivatives is re-assessed when there is a change in the terms  
of the contract which significantly modifies the future cash flows 
under the contract. Where a contract contains one or more 
embedded derivatives and providing that the embedded 
derivative significantly modifies the cash flows under the contract, 
the option to fair value the entire contract may be taken and the 
contract will be recognised at fair value with changes in fair 
value recognised in the Income Statement.  
(h) Hedge accounting 
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified
either as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations. 
Fair value hedges: A derivative is classified as a fair value hedge 
when it hedges the exposure to changes in the fair value of a 
recognised asset or liability. Any gain or loss from re-measuring 
the hedging instrument at fair value is recognised immediately 
in the Income Statement. Any gain or loss on the hedged item 
attributable to the hedged risk is adjusted against the carrying 
amount of the hedged item and recognised in the Income 
Statement. The Group discontinues fair value hedge accounting  
if the hedging instrument expires or is sold, terminated or 
exercised, the hedge no longer qualifies for hedge accounting
or the Group revokes the designation. Any adjustment to the 
carrying amount of a hedged financial instrument for which the 
effective interest method is used is amortised to the Income 
Statement. Amortisation may begin as soon as an adjustment
exists and shall begin no later than when the hedged item ceases 
to be adjusted for changes in its fair value attributable to the risk 
being hedged. 
Cash flow hedges: A derivative is classified as a cash flow 
hedge when it hedges exposure to variability in cash flows that is 
attributable to a particular risk either associated with a recognised 
asset, liability or a highly probable forecast transaction. The
portion of the gain or loss on the hedging instrument which is 
effective is recognised directly in equity while any ineffectiveness 
is recognised in the Income Statement. The gains or losses that 
are recognised directly in equity are transferred to the Income 
Statement in the same period in which the highly probable 
forecast transaction affects income, for example when the future 
sale of physical gas or physical power actually occurs. Where the 
hedged item is the cost of a non-financial asset or liability, the 
amounts taken to equity are transferred to the initial carrying 
amount of the non-financial asset or liability on its recognition. 
Hedge accounting is discontinued when the hedging instrument 
expires or is sold, terminated or exercised without replacement  
or rollover, no longer qualifies for hedge accounting or the Group 
revokes the designation.  
At that point in time, any cumulative gain or loss on the hedging 
instrument recognised in equity remains in equity until the highly
probable forecast transaction occurs. If the transaction is no 
longer expected to occur, the cumulative gain or loss recognised 
in equity is recognised in the Income Statement. 
Net investment hedges: Hedges of net investments in foreign 
operations are accounted for similarly to cash flow hedges. Any 
gain or loss on the effective portion of the hedge is recognised in 
equity, any gain or loss on the ineffective portion of the hedge is 
recognised in the Income Statement. On disposal of the foreign 67

operation, the cumulative value of any gains or losses recognised 
directly in equity is transferred to the Income Statement.  
3. Critical accounting judgements  
and key sources of estimation 
uncertainty 
(a) Critical judgements in applying the Group’s  
accounting policies 
In the process of applying the Group’s accounting policies 
as described in note 2, management has made the following
judgements that have the most significant effect on the amounts 
recognised in the Financial Statements (apart from those involving 
estimations which are dealt with below). 
The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund  
The Group has deconsolidated The Consumers’ Waterheater 
Income Fund (the ‘Fund’) with effect from 1 December 2007,
the date of an Internalisation Agreement entered into between
Centrica and the Fund.  
Centrica created the Fund in 2002 to refinance the water heater 
assets acquired with the Enbridge Services acquisition.  
The Group consolidated the Fund in accordance with the 
requirements of SIC-12, Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities, 
as the substance of the agreements put in place by Centrica 
indicated that the Fund was created for and on behalf of the
Group. These agreements both predetermined the Fund’s
activities and provided Centrica with operational control, via 
responsibilities for servicing the Fund’s asset portfolio and 
administering the Fund’s activities.  
In October 2006 the Trustees of the Fund appointed an
independent Chief Executive Officer. The activities undertaken  
by the Fund started to change following this appointment through
the independent acquisition of an immaterial business in late 
2006, and the independent acquisition of the Toronto Hydro 
water heater rental business in February 2007, which provided 
the Fund with a limited number of rental customers held outside 
of the original contractual arrangements entered into with
Centrica. Almost all the significant parts of the relationship, 
however, remained predetermined or controlled by Centrica. 
These changes in the conduct of the Fund were judged not to  
be sufficiently material to alter the Fund’s status as a subsidiary  
in the 2006 Group accounts. 
In 2007 the Trustees of the Fund have sought further changes in
the conduct of the Fund. The Fund has recruited an independent
Chief Financial Officer and has made further small acquisitions 
outside of the original contractual arrangements entered into with
Centrica. On 1 December 2007, the existing Administration 
Agreement was replaced, at the instigation of the Fund, by a new 
Internalisation Agreement, which provides the Fund with access 
rights to key operational data and provides a basis for employees 
and business infrastructure to transfer to the Fund, such that it
is capable of independent operation from Centrica. Subsequent 
to this Agreement the Fund has independently refinanced its 
activities. The Directors believe that the Internalisation Agreement 
represents a change to the original contractual arrangements 
with the Fund, and demonstrates that the Fund has both the 
desire and the ability to manage its own affairs. Accordingly, in
2007 the Directors judge that the Fund’s activities are no longer 
predetermined such that its activities are being conducted  
on behalf of Centrica, and thus the Fund ceases to represent  
a subsidiary of the Centrica Group. 
The Group has deconsolidated the Fund with effect from  
1 December 2007, the date the Internalisation Agreement 
became effective and the date of the resultant loss of control, 
recognising an exceptional profit on disposal amounting to  
£227 million. The Fund’s activities represented a separate major  
line of business of the Direct Energy segment, and contributed 
materially to Group borrowings. In order to provide a clear 
presentation of the impact of deconsolidating the Fund, the 
results in the current year and prior year have been presented as 
a discontinued operation distinct from continuing operations 
within the Group Income Statement. The details of the disposal 
and discontinued results are provided in note 35. 
Finance lease – Third-party power station
tolling arrangement  
The Group has entered into a long-term tolling arrangement with 
the Spalding power station. The contract provides Centrica with 
the right to nominate 100% of the plant output until 2021 in return
for a mix of capacity payments and operating payments. The 
capacity payments comprise both fixed-price and market-priced 
elements and are dependent on plant availability. Centrica holds 
an option to extend the tolling arrangement for a further 8 years, 
notice of which must be provided to the power station operator 
by 30 September 2020. If the extension option is exercised, 
Centrica is granted an option to purchase the station at the  
end of the extended tolling period. The option to purchase  
must be exercised by serving notice to the generator between
30 September 2027 and 30 September 2028. Should Centrica 
exercise the purchase option the generator can exercise an 
option to retain the station. Should both options be exercised 
the valuation of the options, and hence ownership of the asset, 
will be determined by an expert panel, appointed by both parties. 
Market-based compensation will be payable to Centrica if
ownership is retained by the generator. The Directors have 
judged that the arrangement should be accounted for as a 
finance lease as the lease term is judged to be a major part of  
the economic life of the power station and the present value 
of the minimum lease payments at inception date of the 
arrangement amounted to a large part of the fair value of the 
power station at that time. Details of the finance lease asset, 
finance lease creditor and interest charges are included in
notes 17, 25 and 10 respectively. 
EU Emissions Trading Scheme  
The Group has been subject to the European Emissions Trading 
Scheme (EU ETS) since 1 January 2005. IFRIC 3, Emission
Rights was withdrawn by the IASB in June 2005, and has not yet 
been replaced by definitive guidance. The Group has adopted an 
accounting policy, which recognises CO2 emissions liabilities 
when the level of emissions exceeds the level of allowances 
granted by the Government in the period. The liability is measured 
at the cost of purchased allowances up to the level of purchased 
allowances held, and then at market price of allowances ruling at 
the balance sheet date. Movements in the liability are reflected 
within operating profit. Forward contracts for sales and purchases 
of allowances are measured at fair value. 68

Financial Statements

Petroleum revenue tax (PRT) 
The definitions of an income tax in IAS 12, Income Taxes, have
led management to judge that PRT should be treated consistently 
with other income taxes. The charge for the year is presented 
within taxation on profit from continuing operations in the Income 
Statement. Deferred amounts are included within deferred tax 
assets and liabilities in the Balance Sheet. 
(b) Key sources of estimation uncertainty  
The key assumptions concerning the future, and other key 
sources of estimation uncertainty at the balance sheet date,
that have a significant risk of causing a material adjustment to 
the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities within the next 
financial year, are discussed below. 
Revenue recognition – unread gas and electricity meters 
Revenue for energy supply activities includes an assessment of
energy supplied to customers between the date of the last meter 
reading and the year end (unread). Unread gas and electricity is 
estimated applying industry standards and using historical 
consumption patterns taking into account the industry 
reconciliation process for total gas and electricity usage by 
supplier. Management applies judgement to the measurement of 
the estimated energy supplied to customers and to the valuation
of that energy consumption. An assessment is made of any 
factors that are likely to materially affect the ultimate economic
benefits which will flow to the Group, including delays in 
processing, bill cancellation and re-bill rates and any customer or 
industry data quality issues. In the period subsequent to the 
implementation of the new billing system, operational exceptions 
have been running at a higher level and this has been taken 
account of in the judgements made. To the extent that the 
economic benefits are not expected to flow to the Group, the 
value of the revenue is not recognised. The judgements applied, 
and the assumptions underpinning these judgements, are 
considered to be appropriate. However, a change in these 
assumptions would have an impact on the amount of  
revenue recognised. 
Industry reconciliation process – cost of sales 
The industry reconciliation process is required as differences arise 
between the estimated quantity of gas and electricity the Group 
deems to have supplied and billed customers, and the estimated 
quantity the industry system operator deems the individual 
suppliers, including the Group, to have supplied to customers. 
This difference in deemed supply is referred to as imbalance. 
The reconciliation process can result in either a higher or lower 
value of industry deemed supply than has been estimated as 
being supplied to customers by the Group, but in practice tends 
to result in a higher value of deemed supply. The Group then 
reviews the difference to ascertain whether there is evidence that 
its estimate of amounts supplied to customers is inaccurate or 
whether the difference arises from other causes. The Group’s 
share of the resulting imbalance is included within commodity 
costs charged to cost of sales. Management estimates the level 
of recovery of imbalance which will be achieved either through 
subsequent customer billing or through the developing industry 
settlement process.  
Determination of fair values – energy derivatives 
Derivative contracts are carried in the Balance Sheet at fair value, 
with changes in fair value recorded in either the Income 
Statement or equity. Fair values of energy derivatives are 
estimated by reference in part to published price quotations in
active markets and in part by using valuation techniques. More 
detail on the assumptions used in determining fair valuations is 
provided in notes 4 and 28.  
Gas and liquids reserves 
The volume of proven and probable gas and liquids reserves is  
an estimate that affects the unit of production depreciation of 
producing gas and oil property, plant and equipment as well as 
being a significant estimate affecting decommissioning estimates 
and impairment calculations. The factors impacting gas and 
liquids estimates, and the process for estimating reserve 
quantities, are described on page 147. 
The impact of a change in estimated proven and probable 
reserves is dealt with prospectively by depreciating the remaining 
book value of producing assets over the expected future 
production. If proven and probable reserves estimates are revised 
downwards, earnings could be affected by higher depreciation 
expense or an immediate write-down (impairment) of the asset’s 
book value.  
Decommissioning costs 
The estimated cost of decommissioning at the end of the 
producing lives of fields is reviewed periodically and is based 
on proven and probable reserves, price levels and technology  
at the balance sheet date. Provision is made for the estimated 
cost of decommissioning at the balance sheet date. The payment 
dates of total expected future decommissioning costs are 
uncertain and dependent on the lives of the facilities, but are 
currently anticipated to be between 2008 and 2042.  
Impairment of goodwill and indefinite lived
intangible assets  
The Group determines whether goodwill and indefinite lived 
intangible assets are impaired at least on an annual basis. This
requires an estimation of the value in use of the cash-generating
units to which goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are 
allocated. Estimating the value in use requires the Group to make 
an estimate of the expected future cash flows from the cash-
generating unit and also to choose a suitable discount rate in
order to calculate the present value of those cash flows. Further 
detail on the assumptions used in determining value in use 
calculations is provided in note 16. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Group operates a number of defined benefit pension 
schemes. The cost of providing benefits under the defined benefit 
schemes is determined separately for each scheme under the
projected unit credit actuarial valuation method. Actuarial gains 
and losses are recognised in full in the period in which they occur. 
The key assumptions used for the actuarial valuation are based 
on the Group’s best estimate of the variables that will determine 
the ultimate cost of providing post-employment benefits, on
which further detail is provided in note 34.  69

4. Financial risk management  
The Group’s normal operating, investing and financing activities expose it to a variety of financial risks: market risk (including 
commodity price risk, currency risk, interest rate risk and equity price risk), credit risk and liquidity risk. The Group’s overall risk 
management process is designed to identify, manage and mitigate business risk, which includes, among others, financial risk. Further 
detail on the Group’s overall risk management process is included within the Directors’ Report – Governance on pages 39 to 40. 
Financial risk management is overseen by the Group Financial Risk Management Committee (FRMC) according to objectives, targets 
and policies set by the Board. Commodity price risk management, and the associated credit risk management, is carried out in 
accordance with individual business unit financial risk management policies, as approved by the FRMC and the Board. Treasury risk 
management, including management of currency risk, interest rate risk, equity price risk and liquidity risk, and the associated credit  
risk management, is carried out by a central Group Treasury function in accordance with the Group’s financing and treasury policy,  
as approved by the Board. Downstream credit risk management is carried out in accordance with business unit credit policies.  
(a) Market risk management 
Market risk is the risk of loss that results from changes in market prices (commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates  
and equity prices). The level of market risk to which the Group is exposed at a point in time varies depending on market conditions, 
expectations of future price or market rate movements and the composition of the Group’s physical asset and contract portfolios.  
(i) Commodity price risk management 
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in its energy procurement, downstream and proprietary energy trading activities.  
Energy procurement and downstream activities 
The Group’s energy procurement and downstream activities consist of downstream positions, equity gas and liquids production and
power generation, strategic procurement and sales contracts, market-traded purchase and sales contracts and derivative positions 
taken on with the intent of securing gas and power for the Group’s downstream customers in the UK, Europe and North America  
from a variety of sources at an optimal cost. The Group actively manages commodity price risk by optimising its asset and contract 
portfolios making use of volume flexibility.  
The Group is exposed to commodity price risk in its energy procurement and downstream activities because the cost of procuring 
gas and electricity to serve its downstream customers varies with wholesale commodity prices. The risk is primarily that market prices 
for commodities will fluctuate between the time that sales prices are fixed or tariffs are set and the time at which the corresponding 
procurement cost is fixed, thereby potentially reducing expected margins or making sales unprofitable. 
The Group uses specific volumetric limits to manage the exposure to market prices associated with the Group’s energy procurement 
and downstream activities to an acceptable level. Volumetric limits are supported by a Profit at Risk (PaR) methodology in the UK  
and a Value at Risk (VaR) methodology in North America and Europe to measure the Group’s exposure to commodity price risk. PaR 
measures the estimated potential loss in a position or portfolio of positions associated with the movement of a commodity price for  
a given confidence level, over the remaining term of the position or contract portfolio. VaR measures the estimated potential loss for  
a given confidence level, over a predetermined holding period. The standard confidence level used is 95%. 
The Group measures and manages the commodity price risk associated with the Group’s entire energy procurement and downstream 
portfolio. Only certain of the Group’s energy procurement and downstream contracts constitute financial instruments under IAS 39
(note 2). As a result, while the Group manages the commodity price risk associated with both financial and non-financial energy
procurement and downstream contracts, it is the notional value of energy contracts being carried at fair value that represents the 
exposure of the Group’s energy procurement and downstream books to commodity price risk according to IFRS 7. This is because 
energy contracts that are financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for on a fair value basis and changes in fair value
immediately impact profit or equity. Conversely, energy contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39 are accounted for as 
executory contracts and changes in fair value do not immediately impact profit or equity, and as such, are not exposed to commodity 
price risk as defined by IFRS 7. So while the PaR or the VaR associated with energy procurement and downstream contracts outside 
the scope of IAS 39 is monitored for internal risk management purposes, these measures are not required to comply with IFRS 7. 
The carrying value of energy contracts used in energy procurement and downstream activities at 31 December 2007 is disclosed in note
21 and a sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group’s financial position and performance to changes in the 
fair value or future cash flows of financial instruments associated with the Group’s energy procurement and downstream activities as a 
result of changes in commodity prices is provided below in section (v). 70
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Notes to the  
Financial Statements  
continued 
Proprietary energy trading 
The Group’s proprietary energy trading activities consist of physical and financial commodity purchases and sales contracts taken  
on with the intent of benefiting in the short-term from changes in market prices or differences between buying and selling prices.  
The Group conducts its trading activities over the counter and through exchanges in the UK, North America and parts of the rest
of Europe. The Group is exposed to commodity price risk as a result of its proprietary energy trading activities because the value  
of its trading assets and liabilities will fluctuate with changes in market prices for commodities.  
The Group sets volumetric and VaR limits to manage the commodity price risk exposure associated with the Group’s proprietary 
energy trading activities. The VaR used measures the estimated potential loss for a 95% confidence level over a one-day holding
period. The holding period used is based on market liquidity and the number of days the Group would expect it to take to close off  
a trading position.  
As with any modelled risk measure, there are certain limitations that arise from the assumptions used in the VaR analysis. VaR 
assumes that the future will behave like the past and that the Group’s trading positions can be unwound or hedged within the  
predetermined holding period. Furthermore the use of a 95% confidence level, by definition, does not take into account changes in
value that might occur beyond this confidence level.  
The VaR, before taxation, associated with the Group’s proprietary energy trading activities at 31 December 2007 was £9 million 
(2006: £8 million). The carrying value of energy contracts used in proprietary energy trading activities at 31 December 2007 is
disclosed in note 21.  
(ii) Currency risk management
The Group is exposed to currency risk on foreign currency denominated forecast transactions, firm commitments, monetary assets 
and liabilities (transactional exposure) and on its net investments in foreign operations (translational exposure).  
Transactional currency risk 
The Group is exposed to transactional currency risk on transactions denominated in currencies other than the underlying functional
currency of the commercial operation transacting. The Group’s primary functional currencies are pounds sterling in the UK, Canadian 
dollars in Canada, US dollars in the US and euros in Europe. The risk is that the functional currency value of cash flows will vary as a 
result of movements in exchange rates. Transactional exposure arises from the Group’s energy procurement activities in the UK and in
Canada, where a proportion of transactions are denominated in euros or US dollars and on certain capital commitments denominated 
in foreign currencies. In addition, in order to optimise the cost of funding, the Group has, in certain cases, issued foreign currency 
denominated debt, primarily in US dollars, euros or Japanese yen.  
It is the Group’s policy to hedge all material transactional exposures using forward contracts to fix the functional currency value of  
non-functional currency cash flows. At 31 December 2007, there were no material unhedged non-functional currency monetary  
assets or liabilities, firm commitments or probable forecast transactions (2006: £nil).  
Translational currency risk 
The Group is exposed to translational currency risk as a result of its net investments in North America and Europe. The risk is that the 
pounds sterling value of the net assets of foreign operations will decrease with changes in foreign exchange rates. The Group’s policy 
is to protect the pounds sterling book value of its net investments in foreign operations, subject to certain targets monitored by the 
FRMC, by holding foreign currency debt, entering into foreign currency derivatives or a mixture of both.  
The Group measures and manages the currency risk associated with all transactional and translational exposures. In contrast, IFRS 7 
requires disclosure of currency risk arising on financial instruments denominated in a currency other than the functional currency of the 
commercial operation transacting only. As a result, for the purposes of IFRS 7, currency risk excludes the Group’s net investments in 
North America and Europe as well as foreign currency denominated forecast transactions and firm commitments. A sensitivity analysis 
that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group’s financial position and performance to changes in the fair value or future cash 
flows of foreign currency denominated financial instruments as a result of changes in foreign exchange rates is provided below in 
section (v).  
(iii) Interest rate risk management 
In the normal course of business the Group borrows to finance its operations. The Group is exposed to interest rate risk because the
fair value of fixed rate borrowings and the cash flows associated with floating rate borrowings will fluctuate with changes in interest 
rates. The Group’s policy is to manage the interest rate risk on long-term recourse borrowings by ensuring that the exposure to
floating interest rates remains within a 30% to 70% range, including the impact of interest rate derivatives. Note 25 details the interest
rates on the Group’s bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings by the earlier of contractual re-pricing and maturity date and a 
sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group’s financial position and performance to changes in interest 
rates is provided below in section (v).   71
Directors’ Report – Business Review Directors’ Report – Governance Financial Statements Shareholder Information
Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
(iv) Equity price risk management 
The Group is exposed to equity price risk because certain available-for-sale financial assets, held by the Law Debenture Trust on
behalf of the Company as security in respect of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme, are linked to equity indices (note 34).
Investments in equity indices are inherently exposed to less risk than individual equity investments because they represent a naturally 
diverse portfolio. Note 34 details the Group’s other retirement benefit assets and liabilities.  
(v) Sensitivity analysis
A financial instrument is defined in IAS 32 as any contract that gives rise to a financial asset of one entity (effectively the contractual 
right to receive cash or another financial asset from another entity) and a financial liability (effectively the contractual obligation to  
deliver cash or another financial asset to another entity) or equity instrument (effectively a residual interest in the assets of an entity) of 
another. IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a sensitivity analysis that is intended to illustrate the sensitivity of the Group’s financial position 
and performance to changes in market variables (commodity prices, foreign exchange rates, interest rates and equity prices) as a 
result of changes in the fair value or cash flows associated with the Group’s financial instruments. The sensitivity analysis provided 
discloses the effect on profit or loss and equity at 31 December 2007 assuming that a reasonably possible change in the relevant risk 
variable had occurred at 31 December 2007 and been applied to the risk exposures in existence at that date to show the effects of 
reasonably possible changes in price on profit or loss and equity to the next annual reporting date. The reasonably possible changes in
market variables used in the sensitivity analysis were determined based on implied volatilities where available or historical data.
The sensitivity analysis has been prepared based on 31 December 2007 balances and on the basis that the balances, the ratio of fixed 
to floating rates of debt and derivatives, the proportion of energy contracts that are financial instruments, the proportion of financial 
instruments in foreign currencies and the hedge designations in place at 31 December 2007 are all constant. Excluded from this 
analysis are all non-financial assets and liabilities and energy contracts that are not financial instruments under IAS 39. The sensitivity 
to foreign exchange rates relates only to monetary assets and liabilities denominated in a currency other than the functional currency  
of the commercial operation transacting, and excludes the translation of the net assets of foreign operations to pounds sterling, but not 
the corresponding impact of net investment hedges. 
The sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical only and should be used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily 
indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced because the Group’s actual exposure to market rates is constantly 
changing as the Group’s portfolio of commodity, debt, foreign currency and equity contracts changes. Changes in fair values or cash 
flows based on a variation in a market variable cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the change in market variable 
and the change in fair value or cash flows may not be linear. In addition, the effect of a change in a particular market variable on fair 
values or cash flows is calculated without considering interrelationships between the various market rates or mitigating actions that 
would be taken by the Group. The sensitivity analysis provided below excludes the impact of proprietary energy trading assets  
and liabilities because the VaR associated with the Group’s proprietary energy trading activities has already been provided above  
in section (i).   72

(b) Credit risk management 
Credit risk is the risk of loss associated with a counterparty’s inability or failure to discharge its obligations under a contract. The Group 
is exposed to credit risk in its treasury, trading, energy procurement and downstream activities.  
Treasury, trading and energy procurement activities 
Counterparty credit exposures are monitored by individual counterparty and by category of credit rating, and are subject to approved 
limits. The majority of significant exposures are with A-rated counterparties or better. The Group uses master netting agreements to 
reduce credit risk and net settles payments with counterparties where net settlement provisions exist. In addition, the Group employs  
a variety of other methods to mitigate credit risk: margining, various forms of bank and parent company guarantees and letters 
of credit.  
100% of the Group’s credit risk associated with its treasury, trading and energy procurement activities is with counterparties in related 
energy industries or with financial institutions. The Group measures and manages the credit risk associated with the Group’s entire 
treasury, trading and energy procurement portfolio. In contrast, IFRS 7 defines credit risk as the risk that one party to a financial 
instrument will cause a financial loss for the other party by failing to discharge an obligation and requires disclosure of information
about the exposure to credit risk arising from financial instruments only. Only certain of the Group’s energy procurement contracts 
constitute financial instruments under IAS 39 (note 2). As a result, while the Group manages the credit risk associated with both
financial and non-financial energy procurement contracts, it is the carrying value of financial assets within the scope of IAS 39 (note 28) 
that represents the maximum exposure to credit risk in accordance with IFRS 7 because credit losses associated with contracts that
are not recognised on the Balance Sheet will not be recognised as such in the Income Statement.   74

4. Financial risk management continued 
Downstream activities 
In the case of business customers credit risk is managed by checking a company’s creditworthiness and financial strength both before 
commencing trade and during the business relationship. For residential customers, creditworthiness is ascertained normally before 
commencing trade by reviewing an appropriate mix of internal and external information to determine the payment mechanism required 
to reduce credit risk to an acceptable level. Certain customers will only be accepted on a prepayment basis. 
In some cases, an ageing of receivables is monitored and used to manage the exposure to credit risk associated with both business 
and residential customers. In other cases, credit risk is monitored and managed by grouping customers according to method of 
payment or profile.  
Note 21 provides further detail of the Group’s exposure to credit risk on derivative financial instruments, note 20 provides detail of the 
Group’s exposure to credit risk on trade and other receivables, note 23 provides detail of the Group’s exposure to credit risk on cash 
and cash equivalents and note 28 provides the carrying value of all financial assets representing the Group’s maximum exposure to 
credit risk.   
(c) Liquidity risk management
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group will not have sufficient funds to meet it obligations as they come due. Cash forecasts identifying 
the Group’s liquidity requirements are produced regularly and are stress-tested for different scenarios to ensure sufficient financial 
headroom exists for at least a 12-month period to safeguard the Group’s ability to continue as a going concern.  
In order to manage liquidity risk it is the Group’s policy to maintain committed facilities of at least £1,000 million less available surplus 
cash resources, to raise at least 50% of its net debt (excluding non-recourse debt) over £200 million in the long-term debt market, to 
hold a maximum of £400 million of debt maturing in the same calendar year (excluding finance leases and non-recourse borrowings) 
and to maintain an average term to maturity in the recourse long-term debt portfolio greater than three years.  
At 31 December 2007, the Group had undrawn committed bank borrowing facilities of £1,300 million (2006: £1,300 million), 321% 
(2006: 76%) of the Group’s net debt over £200 million has been raised in the long-term debt market, the average term to maturity  
of the long-term debt portfolio was 7.1 years (2006: 7.3 years) and there is no calendar year where more than £400 million of debt 
(excluding finance leases and non-recourse borrowings) will be maturing (2006: same).  
5. Capital management 
The Group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain an optimal capital structure and strong credit rating to minimise the cost  
of capital. In addition, in a number of areas in which the Group operates, the Group’s strong capital structure and good credit standing 
are important elements of the Group’s competitive position.  
At 31 December 2007, the Group’s long-term credit rating was A3 for Moody’s Investor Services Inc. (2006: A3) and A for  
Standard & Poor’s Rating Services (2006: A).
The Group monitors capital, using a medium-term view of 3-5 years, on the basis of a number of financial ratios generally used by 
industry and by the rating agencies. This includes monitoring gearing ratios, interest cover and cash flow to debt ratios. The Group  
is not subject to externally imposed capital requirements but as is common for most companies the level of debt that can be raised  
is restricted by the Company’s Articles of Association. Net debt is limited to the greater of £5 billion and a gearing ratio of three times 
adjusted capital and reserves. This restriction can be amended or removed by the shareholders of the Company passing an ordinary 
resolution. As a result of the volatility introduced to the Group’s reserves resulting from IAS 39, Financial Instruments: Recognition and 
Measurement, and IAS 19, Employee Benefits, changes are being sought to the definition of reserves in the Articles of Association at 
this year’s Annual General Meeting.  
The Group’s capital structure is managed against the various financial ratios as required to maintain strong credit ratings.  
In order to maintain or adjust the capital structure, the Group may adjust the amount of dividends paid to shareholders, return capital 
to shareholders, issue new shares, repurchase shares, issue debt or repay debt.   75

(i) Inter-segment revenue arising in Gas production and development is derived from sales of gas produced for other Group segments.
(ii) Beginning in 2007, sales of generated power from Power generation to other Group segments is transferred and reported at fair value. Prior to 2007, the sale of 
generated power from Centrica Energy to other Group segments was transferred and reported at cost. 
(iii) Inter-segment revenue arising within Centrica Storage represents the provision of storage facilities to other Group companies, on an arm’s length basis.
(iv) In 2007, the Group changed its reportable segments creating a Power generation reportable segment and an Industrial and commercial reportable segment. Prior to
2007, these two segments were reported together as Industrial sales and wholesaling. The change to reported segments is detailed in note 2. Prior period comparatives
have not been restated as it is impracticable to provide this information on an equivalent basis.
(v) The external revenue presented for Accord energy trading comprises both realised (settled) and unrealised (fair value changes) from trading in physical and financial 
energy contracts. Inter-segment revenue arising in Accord represents the recharge of brokerage fees to other Group segments. Gross segment revenue and inter-
segment revenue for Accord have both been increased by £18 million in 2006 to reflect the recharge of brokerage fees as inter-segment revenue to be consistent with
the presentation provided in 2007.   
(vi) Direct Energy was disclosed as North American Energy and Related Services in the 2006 Annual Report and Accounts. This change was made to align with internal
management reporting. 
(vii) Restated to present The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund as a discontinued operation as explained in note 3. Discontinued operations previously formed
part of the Direct Energy segment. Direct Energy gross segment revenue inclusive of gross revenue from discontinued operations amounted to £4,034 million

Exceptional items and certain re-measurements of the Direct Energy segment inclusive of discontinued operations amounted to a credit of £280 million (2006:
£264 million charge).
(iv) In 2006, operating profit before exceptional items and certain re-measurements includes a £20 million gain arising on revisions to the assumptions made in calculating 
the Group’s defined benefit pension liability. The Schemes’ rules were amended from 1 April 2006 to allow employees to commute a larger amount of their pension
to a cash lump sum on retirement, in line with changes in the Finance Act. 77

(i) Systems write-down costs in 2006 comprised the write-down of certain major systems developments following a review of their existing and required future functionality.
The cost comprises write-downs in British Gas Residential (£178 million) and British Gas Services (£18 million). A tax credit of £59 million was recognised in respect of
these costs.
(ii) Business restructuring costs in 2006 comprised £67 million from staff reductions at the corporate centre (£3 million), British Gas Residential (£16 million) and
British Gas Services (£48 million), and £20 million related to the closure of the head office of British Gas Residential. A tax credit of £20 million was recognised
in respect of these costs. 
(iii) Centrica Storage operations at Rough suffered a major interruption caused by a fire in February 2006. Our investment in emergency shutdown systems and prompt
management action mitigated the damage to ensure no loss of life. Following a full assessment of the work needed to restore operations, the costs of the incident
resulted in an exceptional charge before taxation of £48 million (of which £24 million was recognised within Other operations). A tax credit of £14 million was recognised
in respect of the charge.

(ii) The effect of the decrease of 2% to the standard rate of UK corporation tax from 1 April 2008 on the relevant temporary differences at 31 December 2007 was a credit
of £12 million. No other material amounts arose as a result of changes introduced by the Finance Act 2007. The effect of changes to foreign tax rates on the relevant
temporary differences at 31 December 2007 was a charge of £3 million. The effect of the increase of 10% to the UK supplementary charge from 1 January 2006 on
the relevant temporary differences at 31 December 2005 was a charge of £9 million.
(iii) Tax on items taken directly to equity is disclosed in note 30. 
The Group earns its profits primarily in the UK, therefore the tax rate used for tax on profit on ordinary activities is the standard rate for 
UK corporation tax, which is currently 30%. A supplementary charge of 20% is also currently applicable on the Group’s UK upstream 
profits. Taxation for other jurisdictions is calculated at the rates prevailing in those respective jurisdictions.  86

(c) Factors that may affect future tax charges 
The Group earns income from many activities, including oil and gas production in the UK, North America and elsewhere. On average, 
the Group pays taxes at higher rates than the UK statutory rate of 30% (2006: 30%). The impact of higher rates, including petroleum 
revenue tax and the supplementary charge on UK Continental Shelf profits, is subject to the mix of the Group’s income. In the 
medium-term, the Group’s effective tax rate is expected to remain above the UK statutory rate.

13. Earnings per ordinary share 
Basic earnings per ordinary share has been calculated by dividing the earnings attributable to equity holders of the Company for  
the year of £1,505 million (2006: loss of £155 million) by the weighted average number of ordinary shares in issue during the year  
of 3,673 million (2006: 3,643 million).  
The Directors believe that the presentation of adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share, being the basic earnings per ordinary share 
adjusted for certain re-measurements and exceptional items, assists with understanding the underlying performance of the Group.
The reconciliation of basic to adjusted basic earnings per ordinary share is as follows:

In addition to basic and adjusted earnings per ordinary share, information is presented for diluted and adjusted diluted earnings per 
ordinary share. Under this presentation, no adjustments are made to the reported earnings for either 2007 or 2006, however the 
weighted average number of shares used as the denominator is adjusted for potentially dilutive ordinary shares. In 2006 no adjustment 
was made to the denominator for diluted earnings per share to reflect potentially dilutive ordinary shares, as to do so would decrease 
the loss per share.

(i) Brands represent the Dyno-Rod brand, acquired on the acquisition of the Dyno group of companies during 2004. In accordance with IAS 38 paragraph 88, 
management has ascribed the brand an indefinite useful life because there is no foreseeable limit to the period over which the Dyno brand is expected to generate net
cash inflows. In reaching this determination, management has reviewed potential threats from competition, the risks of technological obsolescence and the expected
usage of the brand by management. 
(ii) Restated to present exploration and evaluation expenditure, previously reported in property, plant and equipment, in other intangible assets on the Balance Sheet.

(i) Carrying amount of goodwill also contains goodwill from other Canada home services acquisitions which are not significant compared with the aggregate carrying  
value of goodwill reported within the Group. The Group has deconsolidated The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund with effect from 1 December 2007. Goodwill
has been attributed to the Fund on its disposal as explained in note 35. 
(ii) Goodwill balances allocated across multiple cash-generating units. The amount of goodwill allocated to each cash-generating unit is not significant compared with the 
aggregate carrying value of goodwill reported within the Group. 
Goodwill and indefinite lived intangibles are tested for impairment annually, or more frequently if there are indications that amounts 
might be impaired. The impairment test involves determining the recoverable amount of the cash-generating units, which corresponds 
to the fair value less costs to sell or the value in use. Value in use calculations have been used to determine recoverable amounts for 
the cash-generating units noted above. These are determined using cash flow budgets, which are based on business plans for a 
period of three years. These business plans have been approved by the Board and are valid when the impairment test is performed. 
The plans are based on past experience as well as future expected market trends. Cash flows beyond the three-year plan period used 
in the value in use calculations are increased in line with historic long-term growth rates in the UK, or where applicable the US,
Canada, Belgium and the Netherlands. Discount rates applied to the cash flow forecasts in determining recoverable amounts are 
derived from the Group’s weighted average cost of capital. Discount rates applied to North American cash-generating units range from 
9.4% to 9.5%, and from 8.5% to 11.2% for UK and Europe cash-generating units on a pre-tax basis. Growth rates used to extrapolate 
cash flow projections beyond the period covered by the most recent forecasts range from 1% to 2.5%. 
The key assumptions in the value in use calculations determining recoverable amounts for the specific cash-generating units noted 
above are: 
British Gas Business
  Budgeted gross margin: for existing contract customers this is based on contracted margins. For new and renewal contract 
customers this is based on achieved gross margin in the period prior to the approval of the business plan, adjusted in some areas  
to reflect market conditions. For tariff customers this is based on current prices in the period prior to the approval of the business 
plan, adjusted for the Group’s view of the forward energy curve.  
  Budgeted market share: based on the average market share achieved immediately prior to the approval of the business plan, 
adjusted for growth forecasts based on sales and marketing activity.  
British Gas Services – Dyno-Rod 
  Budgeted franchise fee income: based on the average income achieved immediately prior to the approval of the business plan, 
adjusted for growth forecasts based on sales and marketing activity.  
  Budgeted cost growth: based on the cost growth in the period prior to the approval of the business plan.  92

16. Impairment testing of goodwill and intangibles with indefinite useful lives continued
Texas residential energy 
  Budgeted gross margin: based on the average gross margin achieved prior to the approval of the business plan, adjusted to reflect 
market conditions.  
  Budgeted market prices: based on a combination of the Group’s view of forward gas and power prices immediately prior to the 
approval of the business plan and the price impact of targeted margins.   
  Budgeted consumption: based on past experience of the average consumption per customer prior to the approval of the  
business plan. 
  Budgeted customer numbers: based on past experience in the three years prior to the approval of the business plan adjusted  
for an expected marginal decline in customer numbers. 
Canada mass markets 
  Budgeted gross margin: for existing customers this is based on contracted margins. For new and renewal contract customers this 
is based on gross margin achieved in the period immediately prior to the approval of the business plan. 
  Budgeted market share: based on average market share achieved in the period immediately prior to the approval of the business 
plan, adjusted for growth and decline assumptions specific to each of the competitive and regulated businesses.  
  Budgeted market prices: for existing customers this is based on contracted prices. For new or renewal customers this is based  
on the Group’s view of forward gas and power prices in Canada.  
  Budgeted cost growth: based on current and forecasted experience required to support customer acquisition, renewal, retention 
and other servicing activities. 
Canada Direct Energy business services 
  Budgeted gross margin: based on gross margins achieved through recent sales and renewal activity and potentially adjusted  
for future expected market conditions.  
  Budgeted churn: based on historic actual attrition and renewal rates prior to the approval of the business plan.  
  Budgeted revenue growth: based on management’s view of forward commodity cost curves as provided by the internal energy 
management group at the time of approval of the business plan to determine future selling prices. Volume growth is estimated 
based on average achieved growth in the past, uplifted by expected future growth as a result of the planned sales activities that 
management believes to be reasonably attainable. 
Canada home services 
  Budgeted gross margin: based on gross margins achieved in the period immediately prior to the approval of the business plan. 
  Budgeted revenue growth: based on the average revenue growth achieved for the three-year period prior to the approval of the 
business plan, uplifted for additional product offerings. 
US home services 
  Budgeted gross margin: based on gross margins achieved in the period immediately prior to the approval of the business plan.  
  Budgeted revenue growth: based on the average revenue growth achieved over the last three years prior to the approval of the 
business plan, uplifted for growth targets based on expected market penetration in certain key US state markets. 
Europe – Oxxio 
  Budgeted revenue growth: based on revenue in the period immediately prior to the approval of the business plan, uplifted  
for expected growth in customer base, cross-selling of products and reduction of customer churn.
  Budgeted gross margin: based on the average gross margin achieved in periods prior to the approval of the business plan,
adjusted for the expected impact arising from the unbundling of the gas and electricity markets going forward.  
  Budgeted operating expenditure: based on historical trends, adjusted for cost improvement programmes implemented. 
The Group is of the opinion that, based on current knowledge, expected changes in the aforementioned key assumptions on which 
the determination of the recoverable amounts are based would not cause the recoverable amounts to be less than the carrying 
amounts of the cash-generating units.  93

At 31 December 2007 there were £87 million of receivables, net of provisions for credit losses, from residential customers  
(2006: £98 million) that were considered to be individually impaired. There were no individually impaired receivables, net of provisions 
for credit losses, from business customers or from treasury, trading and energy procurement counterparties. Receivables from 
residential customers are generally reviewed for impairment on an individual basis once a customer discontinues their relationship  
with the Group.  
The provision for credit losses is based on an incurred loss model and is determined by application of expected default and loss 
factors, determined by historical loss experience and current sampling to the various balances receivable from residential and business 
customers on a portfolio basis, in addition to provisions taken against individual accounts. Balances are written off when recoverability 
is assessed as being remote. Movements in the provision for credit losses by class are as follows:

At 31 December 2007 the Group held £36 million (2006: £16 million) of customer deposits for the purposes of mitigating the credit risk 
associated with receivables from residential and business customers. 
At 31 December 2007 there was no provision for credit losses associated with receivables from treasury, trading and energy 
procurement counterparties (2006: £nil) because all balances are considered to be fully recoverable. Exposure to credit risk associated 
with receivables from treasury, trading and energy procurement counterparties is monitored by counterparty credit rating

The unrated counterparty receivables are comprised primarily of amounts due from subsidiaries of rated entities, exchanges or clearing 
houses. Receivables from treasury, trading and energy procurement counterparties are managed in accordance with the Group’s 
credit risk management policies as described in note 4.  
21. Derivative financial instruments 
Derivative financial instruments are generally held for the purposes of proprietary energy trading, treasury management or energy 
procurement. Derivatives held for the purposes of proprietary energy trading are carried at fair value, with changes in fair value 
recognised in the Group’s results for the year before exceptional items and certain re-measurements, with the exception of certain 
derivatives related to cross-border transportation and capacity contracts (note 2). Derivative financial instruments held for the purposes 
of treasury management or energy procurement are also carried at fair value, with changes in the fair value of derivatives relating to 
treasury management reflected in the results for the year before exceptional items and certain re-measurements, and those relating to 
energy procurement reflected in certain re-measurements. In cases where a derivative qualifies for hedge accounting, derivatives are 
classified as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of a net investment in a foreign operation. Notes 2 and 22 provide further 
detail on the Group’s hedge accounting.  
Energy contracts designated at fair value through profit and loss include certain energy contracts that the Group has, at its option, 
designated at fair value through profit and loss under IAS 39 because the energy contract contains one or more embedded derivatives 
that significantly modify the cash flows under the contract (note 2).  99

Derivative-related credit risk – assets  
Credit risk from derivative transactions is generated by the potential for the counterparty to default on its contractual obligations. 
Therefore, derivative-related credit risk is represented by the positive fair value of the instrument and is normally a small fraction of  
the contract’s notional amount. Credit risk from derivatives is measured and managed by counterparty credit rating as follows:

To manage derivative-related counterparty credit exposure, the Group employs the use of margining and set-off rights in some 
agreements. Under margining agreements, the Group has the right to request that the counterparty pay down or collateralise the 
current fair value of its derivatives position when the position passes a specified threshold. At 31 December 2007 the Group was 
holding £93 million (2006: £33 million) of cash as collateral against counterparty balances, and had pledged £118 million (2006: £61 
million) of cash as collateral, principally under margin calls to cover exposure to mark-to-market positions on derivative contracts. 
Generally, cash paid or received as collateral is interest-bearing and is free from any restriction over its use.
Maturity profiles of derivative financial instruments – liabilities 
IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a maturity analysis for financial liabilities that shows remaining contractual maturities on an undiscounted 
basis. The following maturity analysis shows the remaining contractual maturities on an undiscounted basis for the Group’s derivative 
financial instruments that are in a loss position at the balance sheet date and will be settled on a net basis:

Certain of the Group’s energy contracts that are accounted for as derivatives are for the physical purchase of energy. In these
cases IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a maturity analysis that shows cash outflows on all purchase contracts on an undiscounted basis,

The Group’s foreign exchange derivative contracts will be settled on a gross basis. In these cases IFRS 7 requires disclosure of a 
maturity analysis that shows cash outflows on all derivative contracts on an undiscounted basis, including those derivative contracts  
in a gain position at the balance sheet date. In addition to cash outflows on all foreign exchange derivative contracts that are gross 
settled on an undiscounted basis, the following analysis also provides disclosure of the related cash inflows as follows:

22. Hedge accounting 
For the purposes of hedge accounting, hedges are classified either as fair value hedges, cash flow hedges or hedges of net 
investments in foreign operations. Note 2 details the Group’s accounting policies in relation to derivatives qualifying for hedge
accounting under IAS 39. The fair values of derivative and primary financial instruments in hedge accounting relationships at 
31 December were as follows:

Cash flow hedges  123 67  21 538
Net investment hedges: 
Primary financial instruments – 74  – 117
Derivative financial instruments – 16  6–
Fair value hedges  
The Group’s fair value hedges consist of interest rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements used  
to protect against changes in the fair value of fixed-rate long-term debt due to movements in market interest rates. For qualifying fair 
value hedges, all changes in the fair value of the hedging instrument and in the fair value of the hedged item in relation to the risk being
hedged are recognised in income within net interest expense.   102

Cash flow hedges
The Group’s cash flow hedges consist primarily of: (a) physical and financial gas and power purchase contracts used to protect 
against the variability in future cash flows associated with highly probable forecast purchases of gas and power due to movements  
in market commodity prices; (b) forward foreign exchange contracts used to protect against the variability of functional currency 
denominated cash flows associated with non-functional currency denominated highly probable forecast transactions; and (c) interest 
rate swaps, cross-currency interest rate swaps and forward rate agreements used to protect against the variability in cash flows 
associated with floating-rate borrowings due to movements in market interest rates.  
Gains and losses are initially recognised in the cash flow hedging reserve in equity and are transferred to the Income Statement when
the forecast cash flows affect the Income Statement. Note 30 details movements in the cash flow hedging reserve. The ineffective 
portion of gains and losses on cash flow hedging are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. During 2007 the Group 
recognised a gain of £nil (2006: loss of £9 million) due to cash flow hedge ineffectiveness.  
Net investment hedges
The Group’s net investment hedges consist of foreign currency debt issued in the same currency as the net investment, foreign 
exchange forwards and cross-currency interest rate swaps used to protect against the variability in the pounds sterling value of the
Group’s net investments in foreign operations due to movements in the relative strength of foreign currencies to pounds sterling.  
Gains and losses on the effective portion of the hedge are recognised in equity and transferred to the Income Statement on disposal  
of the foreign operation. Gains and losses on the ineffective portion of the hedge are recognised immediately in the Income Statement. 
During 2007 the Group did not recognise any gains or losses due to net investment hedge ineffectiveness (2006: £nil).

At the balance sheet date the Group had certain deductible temporary differences of £376 million (2006: £318 million) available for 
utilisation against future profits. No deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these temporary differences, due to the 
unpredictability of future profit streams. These assets may be carried forward indefinitely. At the balance sheet date temporary 
differences of £62 million (2006: £36 million) existed in respect of the Group’s overseas investments. The deferred tax liability arising  
on these temporary differences is estimated to be £3 million (2006: £8 million), which has been provided for.  
Current tax assets of £40 million (2006: £98 million) include £20 million (2006: £94 million) of recoverable petroleum revenue tax (PRT). 
These sums represent refunds of instalment payments made during the second half of the year which are in excess of the final liability. 
PRT instalment payments are calculated by reference to the previous period’s profitability, not the profits of the period in which they 
are paid. The 2006 sum was recovered in March 2007.  107

(i) The restructuring provisions relate to significant restructuring programmes undertaken to achieve the Group’s stated cost reduction targets. Included within the provision 
are costs related to surplus properties of £51 million (2006: £60 million) estimated with reference to the expected cost to be incurred to the point of lease termination,
including costs for dilapidations and sub-letting. The provisions are expected to be utilised between 2008 and 2022.  
(ii) The sales contract loss provision relates to the acquisition of a portfolio of gas customers by the Group. Certain of the contracts acquired were identified as being out  
of the money at the date of acquisition, and the sales contract loss provision was established in respect of them.
(iii) Provision has been made for the estimated net present cost of decommissioning gas production and storage facilities at the end of their useful lives. The estimate has 
been based on proven and probable reserves, price levels and technology at the balance sheet date. The timing of decommissioning payments is dependent on the lives 
of the facilities but is anticipated to occur between 2008 and 2042. The charge to income includes £13 million of notional interest (2006: £10 million).  
(iv) In previous years, the Group renegotiated certain long-term take-or-pay contracts which would have resulted in commitments to pay for gas that would be in excess of 
requirements and/or at prices above likely market rates. The provision represents the net present cost of estimated payments due to suppliers as consideration for the
renegotiations, which are due for settlement in 2008 based on the reserves in a group of third-party fields. The movement in the year included £nil released to the Income
Statement following a revision of the estimated future payments (2006: £11 million). The charge for the year includes £6 million of notional interest (2006: £5 million). 
(v) Other provisions include outstanding litigation for a number of items (none of which are individually significant) and provision for National Insurance payable in respect
of Long Term Incentive Scheme liabilities. The National Insurance provision was based on a share price of 358.75 pence at 31 December 2007 (2006: 354.50 pence) 
and is expected to be utilised between 2008 and 2010.   109

28. Fair value of financial instruments  
The fair value of a financial instrument is the amount at which the financial instrument could be exchanged in an arm’s length 
transaction between knowledgeable and willing parties under no compulsion to act. The Group has documented internal policies  
for determining fair value, including methodologies used to establish valuation adjustments required for credit risk.  
The fair values of the Group’s financial instruments together with the carrying amounts included in the Balance Sheet are analysed

28. Fair value of financial instruments continued 
Financial instruments valued at their carrying values
Due to their nature and/or short-term maturity, the fair values of trade and other receivables, cash and cash equivalents, trade and 
other payables and provisions are estimated to approximate their carrying values.  
Available-for-sale financial assets
The fair values of available-for-sale financial assets are based on quoted market prices, when available. If quoted market prices are  
not available fair values are estimated using observable market data.  
Bank overdrafts, loans and other borrowings  
The fair values of bonds, Canadian dollar bonds and units of The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund (prior to deconsolidation
of the Fund as explained in note 3) are based on quoted market prices. The fair values of bank loans have been determined by 
discounting cash flows with reference to relevant market rates of interest. The fair values of overdrafts and commercial paper are 
assumed to equal their book values due to the short-term nature of these amounts. The fair values of obligations under finance leases 
have been determined by discounting contractual cash flows with reference to the Group’s cost of borrowing. 
Derivative financial instruments and energy contracts designated at fair value through profit and loss 
The fair values of foreign exchange and interest rate derivatives are determined by reference to closing market rates at the balance
sheet date. The fair values of energy derivatives are determined using valuation techniques based in part on observable market data 
and in part on internal estimates not currently supported by observable market data. The extent to which fair values of energy 
derivatives are based on observable market data is determined by the extent to which the market for the underlying commodity is
judged to be active. The Group has judged each of the markets in which it operates as active, in both 2007 and 2006, for the 
purposes of accounting as follows:  
Active period of markets 
Gas Power Coal Emissions Oil 
UK (years)  2 2 4 5 4
North America (years) 5 5 N/A N/A N/A
The fair values of energy contracts within the scope of IAS 39 that settle inside the active period of the market are based on quoted 
market prices and expected volumes, discounted at a rate of 6% (2006: 5%). The fair values of derivative financial instruments in  
North America and Europe are based primarily on quoted market prices. In the UK, however, certain energy contracts extend beyond 
the active period of the market. The fair values of energy contracts that extend beyond the active period of the market are determined 
by reference in part to published price quotations in active markets and in part by using valuation techniques based on commodity 
prices derived using assumptions that are based on internal market expectations and expected volumes, discounted using a discount
rate of 5% (2006: 5%).  
The net fair value of energy contracts recorded in the Financial Statements determined using valuation techniques based on non-
observable market variables at 31 December 2007 is a £322 million liability (2006: £262 million liability). The total change in fair value
of energy contracts estimated using valuation techniques based on variables not supportable by market prices that was recognised  
in the Income Statement during the year ended 31 December 2007 amounted to a loss of £100 million (2006: loss of £117 million).
While internal market forecasts outside the active period of the market reasonably reflect all factors that market participants would 
consider in setting a price, these expectations are not currently supportable by active forward market quotes. The fair values of these 
contracts would change significantly if the assumptions in respect of gas, power, coal, emissions or oil prices were changed to
reasonably possible alternatives. The impacts of reasonably possible changes to assumed gas, power, emissions, coal and oil prices 
on the net fair value of the Group’s derivative financial instruments determined using valuation models based on non-observable
market data are as follows:   111

The impacts disclosed above result from changing the assumptions used for fair valuing energy contracts in relation to gas, power, 
emissions, coal and oil prices to reasonably possible alternative assumptions at the balance sheet date. The fair value impacts only 
concern those contracts entered into which are within the scope of IAS 39 and are marked-to-market based on valuation models 
using assumptions that are not currently observable in an active market. The sensitivity analysis provided is hypothetical only and 
should be used with caution as the impacts provided are not necessarily indicative of the actual impacts that would be experienced 
because the Group’s actual exposure to market rates is constantly changing as the Group’s portfolio of energy contracts changes. 
Changes in fair values based on a variation in a market variable cannot be extrapolated because the relationship between the change 
in market variable and the change in fair value may not be linear.  
Where the fair value at initial recognition for such contracts differs from the transaction price a day-one gain or loss will arise. Such 
gains and losses are deferred and amortised to the Income Statement based on volumes purchased or delivered over the contractual 
period until such time as observable market data becomes available (see note 2 for further detail). The amount that has yet to be 
recognised in the Income Statement relating to the difference between the fair value at initial recognition (the transaction price) and  
the amount that would have arisen had valuation techniques used for subsequent measurement been applied at initial recognition,
less subsequent releases, is as follows:

Merger reserve 
On 17 February 1997 BG plc (formerly British Gas plc) demerged certain businesses (grouped together under GB Gas Holdings 
Limited (GBGH)) to Centrica plc. Prior to demerger, the companies comprising the Centrica businesses were transferred to GBGH, 
a subsidiary undertaking of BG plc. Upon demerger the share capital of GBGH was transferred to Centrica plc and was recorded at
the nominal value of shares issued to BG plc shareholders. In accordance with sections 131 and 133 of the Companies Act 1985,  
no premium was recorded on the shares issued. On consolidation, the difference between the nominal value of the Company’s shares 
issued and the amount of share capital and share premium of GBGH at the date of demerger was credited to a merger reserve.  115

Capital redemption reserve 
In accordance with section 170 (1) of the Companies Act 1985, the Company has transferred to the capital redemption reserve an 
amount equal to the nominal value of shares repurchased and subsequently cancelled. The repurchase of shares includes transaction
costs charged directly to the profit and loss reserve of £nil (2006: £nil).  
Revaluation reserve 
During 2005 the revaluation of the Group’s existing interest in Humber Power Limited to fair value, following the acquisition by the 
Group of the remaining 40% stake in the company, was recorded as a revaluation reserve adjustment. 
Foreign currency translation and net investment hedging reserve 
The foreign currency translation and net investment hedging reserve comprises exchange translation differences on foreign currency
net investments, offset by exchange translation differences on borrowings and derivatives classified as net investment hedges under 
the requirements of IAS 39. Exchange gains of £48 million (2006: £105 million loss) on net investments in overseas undertakings have
been offset in reserves against exchange losses of £32 million (2006: £82 million gain) on foreign currency borrowings and other 
instruments used for hedging purposes. 
Cash flow hedging reserve 
The cash flow hedging reserve comprises fair value movements on instruments designated as cash flow hedges under the 
requirements of IAS 39. Note 22 provides further detail on cash flow hedging.

Cumulative actuarial gains arising on defined benefit pension schemes recognised in the profit and loss reserve amounted to  
£723 million (2006: £439 million). Cumulative gains of £3 million (2006: £2 million) on available-for-sale financial assets were  
included within the profit and loss reserve.  
Aggregate tax taken directly to reserves amounted to a charge of £248 million (2006: £169 million credit), of which a charge of
£75 million relates to deferred tax arising on actuarial gains on the Group’s defined benefit schemes (2006: £143 million), and
a charge of £173 million relates to deferred tax arising on gains and losses on available-for-sale investments and cash flow hedges 
(2006: £312 million credit). The deferred tax charge relating to actuarial gains on the Group’s defined benefit schemes includes an

33. Share-based payments
Employee share schemes are designed to encourage participants to align their objectives with those of shareholders. Centrica 
operates eight employee share schemes – the Deferred and Matching Share Scheme (DMSS) beginning in 2007, the Executive Share 
Option Scheme (ESOS), the Long Term Incentive Scheme (LTIS), Sharesave, the Share Award Scheme (SAS), the Restricted Share 
Scheme (RSS) beginning in 2007, the Share Incentive Plan (SIP) and the Employee Share Purchase Plan (ESPP). These are described
in the Directors’ Report – Corporate Responsibility Review on page 32 and in the Remuneration Report on pages 42 to 45. There were 
no other share-based payment transactions during the period. 
DMSS 
Awards under the DMSS are generally reserved for employees within the senior executive group. The scheme operates over a four-
year vesting period. Under normal conditions the grant date of the scheme is the first day of each bonus year. This is followed by a 
vesting period of four years, being the bonus year plus a three-year performance period. In 2006, the first year of the scheme,
shareholders’ approval was obtained at the AGM on 19 May 2006 and as such the grant date reflects the date of this approval. The 
fair value of the award reflects the market value of the shares at the grant date. The scheme comprises three separable elements: 
(a) Deferred shares 
The scheme requires participants to defer 20% of their annual bonus into the scheme. The shares are held in trust over the three-year 
performance period, during which time they cannot be withdrawn. An employee who leaves prior to the vesting date will forfeit their 
right to the shares. All shares held in trust will be eligible to receive dividends. The number of shares deferred is estimated from the 
participant’s maximum bonus and the likelihood of bonus payout in the bonus year. Subsequent revisions are made based on the 
actual bonus paid in the year.
(b) Investment shares
The scheme allows participants to elect to invest an additional amount of their annual bonus into the scheme up to a maximum of 50% 
of their total potential bonus for the year. This 50% limit includes the amount automatically deferred each year. The number of shares 
invested is estimated based on the maximum bonus in year one. The shares may be funded directly from the employee or through a 
release of the employee’s LTIS shares. Subsequent to the bonus year, the shares are held in trust over the three-year performance 
period and vest unconditionally at election, thus the shares carry no additional IFRS 2 expense. Participants can unconditionally 
withdraw the invested shares at any point throughout the vesting period. The shares are eligible to receive dividends.  
(c) Matching shares
Deferred and investment shares will be matched with conditional matching shares, which will be released upon the achievement, over 
a three-year performance period, of three-year cumulative Group economic profit performance targets. Group economic profit is 
calculated by taking Group operating profit before exceptional items and certain re-measurements after tax and subtracting a charge 
for capital employed based on the weighted average cost of capital. The number of matching shares that will vest will be determined 
on a straight-line basis from a zero match for no growth in economic profit up to a two-times match for growth of 25% or above. The
number of matching shares, subject to the performance conditions, is grossed up to reflect the impact of tax and National Insurance. 
The number of matching shares released following the satisfaction of the performance condition will be increased to reflect the
dividends that would have been paid during the three-year performance period. The likelihood of achieving the performance conditions 
is taken into account in calculating the number of awards expected to vest. Estimates are made in year one and revised in subsequent 
years. An employee that leaves prior to the vesting date will forfeit their right to the shares.  
The fair values and the related assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:

ESOS 
Under the ESOS the Board may grant options over shares in Centrica plc to employees of the Group. Options are granted with a fixed 
exercise price equal to the market price of the shares at the legal date of grant which approximates, or is the same as, the grant date 
for accounting purposes. The contractual life of an option is ten years. Awards under the ESOS are generally reserved for employees 
within the senior executive group. The most recent award was made in 2006. There are no further awards planned at this time. 
Options granted under the ESOS will become exercisable on the third anniversary of the date of grant, subject to the growth in 
earnings per share over that period exceeding RPI growth by more than 18 percentage points. The number of options becoming 
exercisable is reduced on a sliding scale if EPS growth exceeds RPI growth by between nine and 18 percentage points. Options 
granted up to March 2004 also permit retesting of EPS growth annually for a further two years. Exercise of options is subject to 
continued employment within the Group. Options were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. No performance 
conditions were included in the fair value calculations. Early exercise has been taken into account by estimating the expected life  
of the options. The fair values and the related assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:

was reassessed ignoring this period. The expected life is the average expected period to exercise. The risk-free rate of return is the yield on zero-coupon UK government

LTIS 
Under the LTIS, allocations of shares in Centrica plc are made to employees of the Group. Awards under the LTIS are generally 
reserved for employees at senior management level. For awards made up to 2005, the number of shares to be released to participants 
is calculated subject to the Company’s total shareholder return (TSR) during the three years following the grant date, compared with 
the TSR of other shares in the FTSE 100 Index over the same period. The number of shares released is reduced on a sliding scale if
Centrica’s TSR is ranked between 50th and 25th. Shares are released to participants immediately following the end of the period in 
which TSR performance is assessed, but release of shares is subject to continued employment within the Group at the date of release.
Allocations were valued using the Black-Scholes option pricing model. Performance conditions were included in the fair value 
calculations, through the use of a Monte Carlo simulation model. For awards made from 2006, the vesting of only half of each award is 
made on the basis of TSR performance. For this half of the award, the calculation of TSR performance as compared with the TSR of 
other FTSE 100 Index shares is consistent with awards made to the end of 2005, except that allocations are valued using a Monte
Carlo simulation model. The number of shares released is increased on a sliding scale between 25% and 100% if Centrica’s TSR is
ranked between 50th and 20th. The vesting of the remaining half of awards made since 2006 is dependent on earnings per share 
(EPS) growth. This is considered a non-market condition under IFRS 2 and dividends attach to the awards, requiring the shares to be 
fair valued at market value on the date of grant. The likelihood of achieving the performance conditions is taken into account in 
calculating the number of awards expected to vest. For shares that vest on awards made from 2006 (for both TSR and EPS portions) 
the cash payment is increased to reflect the dividends that would have been paid on them during the performance period. The fair 
values and the related assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:

Sharesave 
Under Sharesave, the Board may grant options over shares in Centrica plc to UK-based employees of the Group. Options are granted 
with a fixed exercise price equal to 80% of the average market price of the shares for the three days prior to invitation which is three
to four weeks prior to the grant date. Employees pay a fixed amount from salary into a savings account each month, and may elect to 
save over three or five years. At the end of the savings period, employees have six months in which to exercise their options using the 
funds saved, including interest earned. If employees decide not to exercise their options, they may withdraw the funds saved, and the 
options expire. Exercise of options is subject to continued employment within the Group. Options were valued using the Black-Scholes 
option pricing model. The fair values and the related assumptions used in the calculations are as follows:

SAS 
Under the SAS, allocations of shares in Centrica plc are made to selected employees of the Group. Awards under the SAS are 
generally reserved for certain selected employees at middle management levels, based on recommendation by the Chief Executive and 
the Group Director, Human Resources. There is no contractual eligibility for SAS and each year’s award is made independently from 
previous awards. Allocations are subject to no performance conditions and vest unconditionally subject to continued employment with 
the Group in two stages – half of the award vesting after two years, the other half vesting after three years. On vesting, additional 
shares or a cash payment are made to reflect dividends that would have been paid on the allocations during the retention period.  
The fair value is therefore considered to be the market value at date of grant. The fair values and related assumptions used to calculate

RSS 
Under the RSS, allocations of shares in Centrica plc are made to employees of the Group on a highly selective basis. Awards under 
the RSS are reserved for certain selected key employees at senior management levels, based on recommendation by the Chief
Executive and the Group Director, Human Resources. Neither the Executive Directors nor the next tier of executive management is
eligible to participate. There is no contractual eligibility for RSS and each year’s award is made independently from previous awards. 
2007 was the first year of awards. Allocations are subject to no performance conditions and vest unconditionally subject to continued 
employment within the Group in one or two stages dependent on the individual awards. On vesting, additional shares or a cash 
payment are made to reflect dividends that would have been paid on the allocations during the retention period. The fair value is 
therefore considered to be the market value at date of grant. The fair values and related assumptions used to calculate the cost to the 
Group are as follows:

SIP 
Under SIP, employees in the UK may purchase ‘partnership shares’ through monthly salary deductions. The Company then grants one
‘matching share’ for every two purchased, up to a maximum of 20 matching shares per employee per month. Both partnership shares
and matching shares are held in a trust initially. Partnership shares may be withdrawn at any time, but matching shares are forfeited if 
the related partnership shares are withdrawn within three years from the original purchase date. Matching shares vest unconditionally 
for employees after being held for three years in the trust. Vesting of matching shares is also subject to continued employment within 
the Group. Matching shares are valued at the market price at the grant date. The average fair value of these awards during the year 
was £3.72 (2006: £2.97). A reconciliation of matching shares held in trust is as follows:

Under the ESPP, employees in North America purchase ‘partnership shares’ through salary deductions. The Company then grants one
‘matching share’ for every two shares purchased. Partnership shares may be withdrawn at any time, but the entitlement to matching
shares is forfeited if the related partnership shares are withdrawn within two years from the original purchase date. Matching shares 
vest unconditionally for employees after being held for two years. Vesting of matching shares is also subject to continued employment
within the Group. Matching shares are valued at the market price at the grant date. The average fair value of these awards during the

34. Pensions 
Substantially all of the Group’s UK employees at 31 December 2007 were members of one of the three main schemes: the Centrica 
Pension Scheme, the Centrica Engineers’ Pension Scheme and the Centrica Management Pension Scheme (together the approved 
pension schemes). The Centrica Pension Scheme (final salary section) and the Centrica Management Pension Scheme (a final salary
scheme) were closed to new members from 1 April 2003. The Centrica Pension Scheme has an open career average salary section. 
The Centrica Engineers’ Pension Scheme (final salary section) was closed to new members from 1 April 2006, and a career average
salary section was added to the scheme at that date. These schemes are defined benefit schemes and are tax-approved funded
arrangements. They are subject to independent valuations at least every three years, on the basis of which the qualified actuary 
certifies the rate of employer contributions which, together with the specified contributions payable by the employees and proceeds 
from the schemes’ assets, are expected to be sufficient to fund the benefits payable under the schemes. 
The Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme is an unfunded arrangement which provides benefits to certain employees whose benefits 
under the main schemes would otherwise be limited by the earnings cap. The Group also has a commitment to provide certain 
pension and post-retirement benefits to employees of Direct Energy Marketing Limited (Canada). 
The latest full actuarial valuations were carried out at the following dates: the approved pension schemes at 31 March 2006, the 
Unapproved Pension Scheme at 6 April 2005 and the Direct Energy Marketing Limited pension plan at 14 June 2005. These have 
been updated to 31 December 2007 for the purposes of meeting the requirements of IAS 19. Investments have been valued, for this
purpose, at market value.

The assumptions relating to longevity underlying the pension liabilities at the balance sheet date have been based on a combination
of standard actuarial mortality tables, scheme experience and other relevant data, and include a medium cohort allowance for future 
improvements in longevity, as published by the Institute of Actuaries. The assumptions are equivalent to future longevity for members 
in normal health approximately as follows:

At 31 March 2006, the date of the most recent actuarial review, the schemes had approximately 31,900 members and beneficiaries 
(20,850 male and 11,050 female). 
The other demographic assumptions have been set having regard to the latest trends in scheme experience and other relevant data. 
The assumptions are reviewed and updated as necessary as part of the periodic actuarial valuation of the pension schemes.

The overall expected rate of return on assets is a weighted average based on the actual plan assets held and the respective expected 
returns on separate asset classes. The returns on separate asset classes were derived as follows: the expected rate of return on 
equities is based on the expected median return over a ten-year period, as calculated by the independent company actuary. The 
median return over a longer period than ten years was not expected to be materially dissimilar. The expected rate of return on bonds 
was measured directly from actual market yields for UK gilts and corporate bond stocks. The rate above takes into account the actual 
mixture of UK gilts, UK corporate bonds and overseas bonds held at the balance sheet date. The expected rate of return on property 
takes into account both capital growth and allowance for expenses, rental growth and depreciation. The expected rate of return on
cash is comparable to current bank interest rates. 
Included within the schemes’ liabilities above are £31 million (2006: £27 million) relating to unfunded pension arrangements. Included 
within non-current available-for-sale financial assets are £30 million (2006: £29 million) of investments, held by the Law Debenture 
Trust on behalf of the Company, as security in respect of the Centrica Unapproved Pension Scheme.

recognised in Group operating profit before exceptional items and certain re-measurements. Future revisions to the assumptions will be reflected within the Statement
of Recognised Income and Expense.

(i) Acquisitions
During the year, the Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Newfield UK Holdings Limited from Newfield International 
Holdings Inc for cash consideration of £250 million (£242 million base consideration, plus adjustments for working capital and 
indebtedness arising between the effective date and the completion date). Other smaller acquisitions are described in section (b).  
The purchase method of accounting was adopted in all cases. The analysis of assets and liabilities acquired, and the fair value of  
these acquisitions, are as shown below. All intangible fixed assets were recognised at their respective fair values.  
The residual excess over the net assets acquired on each acquisition is recognised as goodwill in the Financial Statements.  
The fair values stated are provisional because the Directors have not yet reached a final determination on all aspects of  
the fair value exercise.

Cash consideration  250
The Group acquired 100% of the issued share capital of Newfield UK Holdings Limited on 5 October 2007 for cash consideration
of £250 million. Newfield UK Holdings Limited is an exploration and production group with activities focused in the UK Southern
Gas Basin. The acquired business contributed a profit after tax of £7 million to the Group for the period from 5 October 2007 to  
31 December 2007. The book values of assets and liabilities have been adjusted to align with the fair values of assets and liabilities 
acquired. The adjustments to recognise other intangible assets and property, plant and equipment at fair value mainly relate to the 
acquired exploration assets and producing gas field assets. Goodwill has principally arisen in relation to the recognition of deferred  
tax on these fair value adjustments. 
(b) Other acquisitions
On 8 February 2007, the Group’s subsidiary The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund acquired the water heater rental business of 
Toronto Hydro Energy Services Inc. for cash consideration of £18 million. The fair value of net assets acquired comprised £10 million 
for water heater fixed assets and £8 million for intangible assets representing acquired contractual customer relationships. In addition, 
the Fund acquired approximately 3,400 water heaters from Festival Hydro Inc. for cash consideration of £0.7 million on 1 November 
2007. Net assets acquired, including intangible assets, were recorded at their determined fair values of £0.7 million. No goodwill  
was recorded on these acquisitions. The Group has deconsolidated The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund with effect from  
1 December 2007 as explained in note 3. These acquired businesses are included in the assets and liabilities of the Fund as
deconsolidated with effect from 1 December 2007, with associated cash flows included within discontinued activities.  
The Group acquired the home appliance service assets of Mabe Canada Inc. on 22 January 2007 (consideration £3 million, goodwill
£2.5 million) and the home appliance service/repair business of Factory Appliance (consideration £0.5 million, goodwill £0.4 million)  
on 7 May 2007. On 14 September 2007 the residential new construction, service and replacement business CA Woods was acquired 
by the Group (consideration £0.8 million, goodwill £0.5 million).  131

35. Acquisitions and disposals continued 
The pro forma consolidated results of the Group, as if the 2007 acquisitions had been made at the beginning of the period, include 
revenues from continuing operations of £16,382 million and a profit after tax of £1,506 million. The pro forma results have been 
calculated using the Group’s accounting policies. In preparing the pro forma results, revenue and costs have been included as if the
businesses were acquired on 1 January 2007 and inter-company transactions had been eliminated. This information is not necessarily 
indicative of the results of the combined Group that would have occurred had the purchases actually been made at the beginning of 
the period presented, or indicative of the future results of the combined Group. 
During 2007, the Group paid £11 million of contingent and deferred consideration, £10 million representing the final contingent
payment relating to the acquisition of CPL/WTU in 2002 and £1 million representing a deferred payment relating to the acquisition
of Wainstones Power Limited in 2004. 
(ii) Disposals
(a) Discontinued operation – The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund 
As explained in note 3, the Group has deconsolidated The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund (the Fund) with effect from  
1 December 2007. The Group previously consolidated the Fund in accordance with SIC-12, Consolidation – Special Purpose Entities. 
An analysis of assets and liabilities disposed of and the pre-tax profit arising on disposal is presented below:

Gain on disposal of discontinued operation 227
Proceeds on disposal –
Attributable goodwill represents the portion of goodwill within the Canada home services cash-generating unit which is allocated to the 
operations of the Fund on its deconsolidation. Goodwill arose on the Enbridge Services acquisition in 2002. The water heater assets 
acquired as part of this acquisition were transferred to the Fund on its creation in 2002. Goodwill has been attributed to the Fund on its 
deconsolidation on the basis of the relative fair value of both the Fund and the remaining operations contained within the Canada home 
services cash-generating unit. 
At the date of deconsolidation the Group held a nil% interest in the Fund. Accordingly, £nil proceeds arise on deconsolidating the Fund 
from the Group accounts. The units in the Fund have historically been accounted for as a financial liability of the Group as opposed to 
a minority interest in equity due to the redemption rights which attach to them. This liability has only ever represented a liability of the 
Fund and has therefore been previously presented as non-recourse borrowings. On deconsolidating the Fund, a gain of £227 million 
arises principally as a result of extinguishing this liability, net of attributable goodwill. Given its materiality and non-recurring nature this 
gain is presented as exceptional within the Income Statement.    132

The Fund’s activities represent a separate major line of business for the Direct Energy segment and contributed materially to Group 
borrowings. In order to provide a clear and consistent presentation of the impact of deconsolidating the Fund, the results in the current 
year and prior year have been presented as a discontinued operation distinct from continuing operations within the Group Income
Statement. The effect of the discontinued operation on the Direct Energy segment results is presented in note 6. An analysis of the

(i) Included in discontinued operations is elimination of the cost of sales incurred on sales of water heaters from Direct Energy to the Fund resulting in a credit to the cost
of sales reported above.
In previous years, the Group has been subject to capital gains tax on the sell-down of its equity in the Fund. At the date of 
deconsolidation the Group held a nil equity interest in the Fund and £nil proceeds arose on deconsolidating the Fund from  
the Group accounts. Accordingly, £nil tax arises on the gain on deconsolidation.  
Centrica continues to service the majority of the Fund’s assets and continues to procure water heater assets for the Fund. 
The revenues received from the Fund for undertaking these activities is included as part of the continuing operations of the  
Direct Energy segment as shown in note 37. 
(b) Discontinued operation – OneTel 
In 2006, the finalisation of the OneTel disposal resulted in a charge to the Income Statement of £8 million net of a £3 million tax credit.   133

The Group has provided certain guarantees and indemnities to BG Group plc in respect of the decommissioning costs of the 
Morecambe gas fields. The Company and its wholly owned subsidiary, Hydrocarbon Resources Limited, have agreed to provide 
security, in respect of such guarantees and indemnities, to BG International Limited, which, as original licence holder for the
Morecambe gas fields, will have exposure to decommissioning costs relating to the Morecambe gas fields should liabilities not be fully 
discharged by the Group. The security is to be provided when the estimated future net revenue stream from the Morecambe gas fields 
falls below 150% of the estimated cost of such decommissioning. The nature of the security may take a number of different forms and 
will remain in force until the costs of such decommissioning have been irrevocably discharged and the relevant Department of 
Business, Enterprise and Regulatory Reform (formerly Department of Trade and Industry) decommissioning notice in respect of the
Morecambe gas fields has been revoked.

operating sub-leases at 31 December 8 17
Lease and sub-lease payments recognised as an expense in the year were as follows: 
 Minimum leasepayments 60 67
Contingent rents – renewables 
(i)
48 30
(i) The Group has entered into long-term arrangements with renewable providers to purchase physical power, renewable obligation certificates and levy exemption 
certificates from renewable sources. Payments made under these contracts are contingent upon actual production and therefore the commitment to a minimum lease
payment included above is £nil (2006: £nil). Payments made for physical power are charged to the Income Statement as incurred and disclosed as contingent rents. 
(d) Contingent liabilities 
There are no contingent liabilities.  
(e) Guarantees and indemnities 
In connection with the Group’s energy trading, transportation and upstream activities, certain Group companies have entered  
into contracts under which they may be required to prepay or provide credit support or other collateral in the event of a significant 
deterioration in creditworthiness. The extent of credit support is contingent upon the balance owing to the third party at the point  
of deterioration.
(f) Commodity purchase contracts 
The Group procures gas and electricity through a mixture of production from owned gas fields and power stations and procurement
contracts. Procurement contracts include short-term forward market purchases of gas and electricity at fixed and floating prices.  
They also include gas contracts indexed to market prices and long-term gas contracts with non-gas indexation.  
Commodity purchase commitments are estimated, on an undiscounted basis, as follows: 
2007
£m 
2006
£m
Within one year 8,400 7,800
Between one and five years 18,100 16,100
After five years 9,100 10,400
35,600 34,300
The total volume of gas to be taken under certain long-term structured contracts depends on a number of factors, including the actual
reserves of gas that are eventually determined to be extractable on an economic basis. The resulting monetary commitment is based 
on the minimum quantities of gas that the Group is contracted to pay at estimated future prices. 
The estimated commitment to make payments under gas procurement contracts differs in scope and in basis from the maturity 
analysis of energy derivatives disclosed in note 21. Only certain procurement and sales contracts are within the scope of IAS 39 and 
included in note 21. In addition, the volumes used in calculating principal values are estimated using valuation techniques. Contractual 
commitments which are subject to fulfilment of conditions precedent are excluded.

domestic purposes on an arm’s length basis. 
38. Fixed-fee service contracts 
Fixed-fee service contracts are entered into with home services customers in the UK and North America (HomeCare: 100, 200, 300,
400, HomeCare Flexi: 100, 200, 300, 400, Gas Appliance Care, Gas Appliance Check, Plumbing and Drains Care, Plumbing and 
Drains Care Flexi, Kitchen Appliance Care, Home Electrical Care and Home Electrical Care Flexi in the UK, and Heating Protection, 
Cooling Protection and Plumbing and Drains Protection in North America). These contracts continue until cancelled by either party  
to the contract. These plans incorporate both an annual service element and a maintenance element. 
Fixed-fee service contracts protect purchasers of these contracts against the risk of breakdown of electrical, plumbing, heating, 
cooling and household appliances, resulting in the transfer of an element of risk from contract holders to Centrica. Benefits provided  
to customers vary in accordance with terms and conditions of the contracts entered into, however, generally include repair and/or 
replacement of the items affected. 
The risk and level of service required within the maintenance element of the contracts is dependent upon the occurrence of uncertain 
future events, in particular the number of call-outs, the cost per call-out and the nature of the fault. Accordingly, the timing and amount
of future cash outflows related to the contracts is uncertain. 
The key terms and conditions that affect future cash flows are as follows: 
  provision of labour and parts for repairs, dependent on the agreement and associated level of service; 
  one safety and maintenance inspection in every year of the agreement (for HomeCare: 100, 200, 300, 400 (excluding electrical 
fixtures), HomeCare Flexi: 100, 200, 300, 400 (excluding electrical fixtures), Gas Appliance Care and Gas Appliance Check in the 
UK, and Heating Protection Plus and Cooling Protection Plus in North America); 
  one safety and maintenance inspection in every continuous two-year period of the agreement (for HomeCare 400 (electrical fixtures 
only), HomeCare Flexi: 400 (electrical fixtures only), Home Electrical Care, Home Electrical Care Flexi, Kitchen Appliance Care, 
Plumbing and Drains Care and Plumbing and Drains Care Flexi); 
  no limit to the number of call-outs to carry out work included within the selected agreement; and 
  caps on certain maintenance and repair costs within fixed-fee contracts.  136

Notes to the  
Financial Statements

38. Fixed-fee service contracts continued 
Revenue from fixed-fee service contracts is recognised on a straight-line basis over the life of the contract, reflecting the benefits 
receivable by the customer which span the life of the contract as a result of emergency maintenance potentially being required at any 
point within the contract term. 
Cost of sales relates directly to the engineer workforce employed by Centrica within home services, the cost of which is accounted  
for over a 12-month period with adjustments made to reflect the seasonality of workload over a given year.
The costs of claims under the fixed-fee service contracts will be the costs of the engineer workforce employed by Centrica within home 
services. These costs are accounted for over a 12-month period with adjustments made to reflect the seasonality of workload over a 
given year. No further claims costs are accrued. 
Weather conditions and the seasonality of maintenance can affect the number of call-outs, the cost per call-out and the nature of  
the fault. Centrica’s obligations under the terms of its home services fixed-fee service contracts are based on the following types of 
uncertain future events taking place within the contract period: 
  boiler, radiator, controls, hot water cylinder and pipe work breakdown; 
  gas fire, water heater, wall heater and gas cooker breakdown; 
  hot and cold water pipe, overflow, cold tank, toilet siphon and radiator valve breakdown; 
  washing machine, tumble drier, dishwasher, fridge, freezer, cooker, oven, hob and microwave oven breakdown; 
  fixed electrical wiring system, fuse box, light switch, wall socket, circuit breaker and transformer breakdown; 
  ventor motor, circuit board, direct drive motor and flame sensor breakdown; and 
  evaporator and condenser fan motor breakdown. 
Centrica actively manages the risk exposure of these uncertain events by undertaking the following risk mitigation activities: 
  an initial service visit is performed for central heating care. If, at the initial visit, faults that cannot be rectified are identified, the fixed-
fee service contract will be cancelled and no further cover provided; 
  an annual or bi-annual safety and maintenance inspection is performed to ensure all issues are identified prior to them developing 
into significant maintenance or breakdown issues; and 
  caps on certain maintenance and repair work are incorporated into fixed-fee service contracts to limit liability in areas considered  
to be higher risk in terms of prevalence and cost to repair. 
The Group considers the adequacy of estimated future cash flows under the contracts to meet expected future costs under the 
contracts. Any deficiency is charged immediately to the Income Statement. 
Service requests are sensitive to the reliability of appliances as well as the impact of weather conditions. Each incremental 1% increase 
in service requests would impact profit and equity by approximately £7 million (2006: £7 million). The contracts are not exposed to any 
interest rate risk or significant credit risk and do not contain any embedded derivatives.

39. Events after the balance sheet date 
The Directors propose a final dividend of 9.65 pence per share (totalling £355 million) for the year ended 31 December 2007. The
dividend will be submitted for formal approval at the Annual General Meeting to be held on 12 May 2008. These Financial Statements 
do not reflect this dividend payable, which will be accounted for in shareholders’ equity as an appropriation of retained earnings in the 
year ending 31 December 2008. 
On 14 January 2008 the Group acquired 88.4% of the outstanding common shares of publicly traded oil and gas company Rockyview 
Energy Inc. (Rockyview) for cash consideration of C$68 million (£34 million) and the remaining 11.6% of the outstanding common 
shares of Rockyview by 19 February 2008 in a series of transactions for additional cash consideration of C$9 million (£5 million).

Independent Auditors’ report to the members  
of Centrica plc 
We have audited the parent Company Financial Statements
of Centrica plc for the year ended 31 December 2007 which 
comprise the Balance Sheet and the related notes. These parent
Company Financial Statements have been prepared under the 
accounting policies set out therein. We have also audited the 
information in the Directors’ Remuneration Report that is 
described as having been audited. 
We have reported separately on the Group Financial Statements 
of Centrica plc for the year ended 31 December 2007. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and Auditors 
The Directors’ responsibilities for preparing the Annual Report,  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report and the parent Company 
Financial Statements in accordance with applicable law and 
United Kingdom Accounting Standards (United Kingdom 
Generally Accepted Accounting Practice) are set out in the 
Statement of Directors’ Responsibilities. 
Our responsibility is to audit the parent Company Financial 
Statements and the part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report  
to be audited in accordance with relevant legal and regulatory 
requirements and International Standards on Auditing (UK and 
Ireland). This report, including the opinion, has been prepared for 
and only for the Company’s members as a body in accordance 
with Section 235 of the Companies Act 1985 and for no other 
purpose. We do not, in giving this opinion, accept or assume 
responsibility for any other purpose or to any other person to 
whom this report is shown or into whose hands it may come  
save where expressly agreed by our prior consent in writing. 
We report to you our opinion as to whether the parent Company 
Financial Statements give a true and fair view and whether the 
parent Company Financial Statements and the part of the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been properly 
prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 1985. We also 
report to you whether in our opinion the information given in the 
Directors’ Report (comprising the Directors’ Report – Business
Review and the Directors’ Report – Governance) is consistent 
with the parent Company Financial Statements.  
In addition, we report to you if, in our opinion, the Company has 
not kept proper accounting records, if we have not received all
the information and explanations we require for our audit, or if
information specified by law regarding Directors’ remuneration
and other transactions is not disclosed.  
We read other information contained in the Annual Report and 
consider whether it is consistent with the audited parent
Company Financial Statements. The other information comprises 
only the Chairman’s Statement, the Directors’ Report, the Gas 
and Liquids Reserves, Five Year Record and Shareholder 
Information. We consider the implications for our report if we 
become aware of any apparent misstatements or material 
inconsistencies with the parent Company Financial Statements. 
Our responsibilities do not extend to any other information.
Basis of audit opinion 
We conducted our audit in accordance with International 
Standards on Auditing (UK and Ireland) issued by the Auditing 
Practices Board. An audit includes examination, on a test basis, 
of evidence relevant to the amounts and disclosures in the parent 
Company Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited. It also includes an 
assessment of the significant estimates and judgements made  
by the Directors in the preparation of the parent Company 
Financial Statements, and of whether the accounting policies  
are appropriate to the Company’s circumstances, consistently 
applied and adequately disclosed. 
We planned and performed our audit so as to obtain all the 
information and explanations which we considered necessary in 
order to provide us with sufficient evidence to give reasonable 
assurance that the parent Company Financial Statements and the 
part of the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are free 
from material misstatement, whether caused by fraud or other 
irregularity or error. In forming our opinion we also evaluated the 
overall adequacy of the presentation of information in the parent
Company Financial Statements and the part of the Directors’ 
Remuneration Report to be audited.
Opinion 
In our opinion:
  the parent Company Financial Statements give a true and fair 
view, in accordance with United Kingdom Generally Accepted 
Accounting Practice, of the state of the Company’s affairs as 
at 31 December 2007; 
  the parent Company Financial Statements and the part of  
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited have been 
properly prepared in accordance with the Companies Act 
1985; and 
  the information given in the Directors’ Report is consistent
with the parent Company Financial Statements.

Notes to the  
Company Balance Sheet  
i. Principal accounting policies of the Company 
Accounting principles
The Company Balance Sheet has been prepared in accordance with applicable UK accounting standards and under the historical cost
convention and the Companies Act 1985. 
Basis of preparation 
No profit and loss account is presented for the Company as permitted by Section 230(3) of the Companies Act 1985. The Company’s
profit after tax for the year ended 31 December 2007 was £5 million (2006: £1,939 million). 
Employee share schemes 
The Group has a number of employee share schemes, detailed in the Directors’ Report – Corporate Responsibility Review on page 32,  
the Remuneration Report on pages 42 to 45 and in note 33, under which it makes equity-settled share-based payments to certain 
employees. Equity-settled share-based payments are measured at fair value at the date of grant (excluding the effect of non-market-
based vesting conditions). The fair value determined at the grant date is expensed on a straight-line basis together with a 
corresponding increase in equity over the vesting period, based on the Group’s estimate of the number of awards that will vest 
and adjusted for the effect of non-market-based vesting conditions. 
Fair value is measured using methods appropriate to each of the different schemes as follows: 
LTIS: awards up to 2005 A Black-Scholes valuation augmented by a Monte Carlo simulation to predict the total 
shareholder return performance 
LTIS: after 2005 EPS awards Market value on the date of grant 
LTIS: after 2005 TSR awards A Monte Carlo simulation to predict the total shareholder return performance 
Sharesave Black-Scholes 
ESOS Black-Scholes using an adjusted option life assumption to reflect the possibility  
of early exercise 
SAS, SIP, DMSS and RSS Market value on the date of grant  
Foreign currencies 
Transactions in foreign currencies are translated at the rate of exchange ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are translated into pounds sterling at closing rates of exchange. Exchange differences  
on monetary assets and liabilities are taken to the profit and loss account. 
Tangible fixed assets
Tangible fixed assets are included in the Balance Sheet at cost, less accumulated depreciation and any provisions for impairment. 
Tangible fixed assets are depreciated on a straight-line basis at rates sufficient to write off the cost, less estimated residual values,  
of individual assets over their estimated useful lives at periods ranging from three to 20 years.
Leases 
Rentals under operating leases are charged to the profit and loss account on a straight-line basis. 
Investments 
Fixed asset investments are held in the Balance Sheet at cost, less any provision for impairment as necessary. Current asset 
investments are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. 
Pensions and other post-retirement benefits 
The Company’s employees participate in a number of the Group’s defined benefit pension schemes as described in note 34 to the 
Group Financial Statements. The Company is unable to identify its share of the underlying assets and liabilities in the schemes on a 
consistent and reasonable basis and therefore accounts for the schemes as if they were defined contribution schemes. The charge to 
the profit and loss account is equal to the contributions payable to the schemes in the accounting period. Details of the defined benefit 
schemes of the Group (accounted for in accordance with the Group’s accounting policies detailed in note 2 to the Group Financial 
Statements) can be found in note 34 to the Group Financial Statements.  142

Notes to the  
Company Balance Sheet

i. Principal accounting policies of the Company continued 
Taxation
Current tax, including UK corporation tax and foreign tax, is provided at amounts expected to be paid (or recovered) using the tax 
rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated, but not reversed, at the balance sheet date where 
transactions or events that result in an obligation to pay more tax in the future, or a right to pay less tax in the future, have occurred at 
the balance sheet date. Timing differences are differences between the Group’s taxable profits and its results as stated in the Financial 
Statements that arise from the inclusion of gains and losses in tax assessments in periods different from those in which they are 
recognised in the Financial Statements. 
A deferred tax asset is regarded as recoverable and therefore recognised only when, on the basis of all available evidence, it can  
be regarded as more likely than not that there will be suitable taxable profits in the foreseeable future from which the reversal of the 
underlying timing differences can be deducted. 
Deferred tax is not recognised when fixed assets are revalued unless, by the balance sheet date, there is a binding agreement to sell 
the revalued assets and the gain or loss expected to arise on sale has been recognised in the Financial Statements. Deferred tax is not 
recognised when fixed assets are sold and it is more likely than not that the taxable gain will be rolled over, being charged to tax only  
if and when the replacement assets are sold. 
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of the retained earnings of overseas subsidiaries and associates only to the extent that, at the 
balance sheet date, dividends have been accrued as receivable or a binding agreement to distribute past earnings in the future has 
been entered into by the subsidiary or associate. 
Deferred tax is measured at the average tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences are
expected to reverse, based on tax rates and laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date. 
Deferred tax is measured on a non-discounted basis. 
Financial instruments 
The Company’s accounting policies for financial instruments are consistent with those of the Group, and are disclosed in note 2 to  
the Group Financial Statements. The Company’s financial risk management policies are consistent with those of the Group and are
described in the Directors’ Report – Governance on pages 39 to 40 and in note 4 to the Group Financial Statements.  
The Company is exempted by FRS 29 from providing detailed disclosures in respect of its financial instruments because the Company
is included within the Group’s consolidated accounts and its financial instruments are incorporated into the disclosures in note 4 to the 
Group Financial Statements. 
ii. Directors and employees 
Included within the Company’s profit and loss account for the year are wages and salaries costs of £74 million (2006: £91 million),  
social security costs of £7 million (2006: £9 million) and other pension and retirement benefit costs of £17 million (2006: £25 million). 
Details of Directors’ remuneration, share-based payments and pension entitlements in the Remuneration Report on pages 42 to 51
form part of these Financial Statements. Details of employee share-based payments are given on pages 32, 43, 44, and 45 and in
note 33. Details of the remuneration of key management personnel are given in note 37. 
The average number of employees of the Company during the year was 1,174 (2006: 1,529), all of whom were employed in the UK.  143

Centrica plc Annual Report and Accounts 2007
Gas and Liquids Reserves 
(unaudited)
The Group’s estimates of reserves of gas and liquids are reviewed as part of the half year and full year reporting process and updated 
accordingly. A number of factors affect the volumes of gas and liquids reserves, including the available reservoir data, commodity 
prices and future costs. Due to the inherent uncertainties and the limited nature of reservoir data, estimates of reserves are subject to 
change as additional information becomes available.  
The Group discloses proven and probable gas and liquids reserves, representing the central estimate of future hydrocarbon recovery. 
Reserves for Centrica operated fields are estimated by in-house technical teams composed of geoscientists and reservoir engineers. 
Reserves for non-operated fields are estimated by the operator, but are subject to internal review and challenge.   
As part of the internal control process related to reserves estimation, an audit of the reserves, including the application of the reserves 
definitions, is undertaken by an independent technical auditor. Reserves are estimated in accordance with a formal policy and 
procedure standard. 
The Group has estimated proven and probable gas and liquids reserves in the UK and North America. 
The principal fields in the UK are South Morecambe, North Morecambe, Statfjord and the Rough field associated with Centrica 
Storage. The UK reserves estimates are consistent with the guidelines and definitions of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and
World Petroleum Congress. An annual reserves audit has been carried out by ERC Energy Resource Consultants Ltd. 
The principal fields in North America are Medicine Hat, Entice and Bashaw, located in the province of Alberta, Canada. The North
American reserves estimates have been evaluated in accordance with the Canadian Oil and Gas Evaluation Handbook (COGEH) 
reserves definitions and are consistent with the guidelines and definitions of the Society of Petroleum Engineers and the World
Petroleum Congress. The North American reserves evaluation has been carried out by Sproule Associates Limited.

Shareholder Information Electronic communications and the Centrica website
At the 2007 Annual General Meeting (AGM), the Company
passed a resolution allowing the Centrica website to be
used as the primary means of communication with its
shareholders. A shareholder consultation card was sent with
the proxy forms to shareholders in March 2007 enabling them
to choose to either:
3 receive shareholder documentation by website
communication by providing an email address; or
3 continue to receive shareholder documentation in
hard copy by returning the personalised card attached
to the AGM proxy form.
If the completed card was not returned, shareholders were
deemed in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 to have
agreed to receive shareholder documentation via the Centrica
website. These shareholders, and those who positively
elected for website communication, were sent, immediately
prior to the publication date, a written notification that the
2007 shareholder documents are available to view on the
Centrica website at www.centrica.com/reports2007.
The new electronic arrangements provide shareholders
with the opportunity to access information in a timely manner
and help Centrica to reduce both its costs and its impact on
the environment.

CE40001_Cent_Review_P07_Q6  10/3/08  12:48  Page 02 Our year in focus
We have achieved very strong financial results during another
challenging year for UK energy retailers.
New pipelines from Norway and the Netherlands, underpinned by
long-term gas contracts with British Gas, began to bring additional
supplies to the UK and helped to bring down gas prices at the start
of the year. 
Unfortunately the spectre of high wholesale prices reappeared 
in the second half of the year and this has continued into 2008. 
As a result we had to raise customer tariffs in January.
The management team worked diligently throughout 2007 to
minimise the impact of rising wholesale energy prices, making
substantial inroads into operating costs and extracting efficiencies
where possible. But we must continue to invest in high quality
energy assets to serve our UK and international customers; and this
reinvestment can only be funded through the consistent delivery 
of reasonable and sustainable profits.
Dividend
The Board is proposing a final dividend of 9.65 pence for payment 
in June 2008 bringing our full-year dividend to 13.0 pence, which
represents a 17% year-on-year increase.
Board changes
We changed the structure of our executive management team, with
Phil Bentley assuming the role of Managing Director of British Gas,
Jake Ulrich adding Europe to his responsibilities as Managing
Director of our upstream activities and Nick Luff joining Centrica
from P&O as Group Finance Director. Under the leadership of 
Sam Laidlaw the team has already begun to make a real difference
to both the short-term performance and the long-term prospects 
of Centrica.
Our employees
In a business such as Centrica, people are central to the delivery of
better service and improving financial results. Our employees have
worked hard to support the change in systems, working practices,
organisation structure and management within the Company. 
I thank them all for their loyalty, hard work and dedication. It is a
credit to them that British Gas Business and British Gas Services
were both recognised in the Financial Times T op 50 ‘Best
Workplaces for 2007’.
The future
We have set out a clear agenda for Centrica in the form of Sam
Laidlaw’ s four strategic priorities and we will continue to focus 
on these as we move forward. Only by delivering against these
priorities will we be able to satisfy our customers and reward our
employees while maximising returns for our shareholders.

Upstream, we have long-term contracts for gas supplies to 
the UK from the North Sea, Norway and the Netherlands, 
as well as our own production, which now includes a number 
of North Sea gas fields acquired from Newfield UK Holdings
Limited in October. In November, we bid for Rockyview 
Energy Inc in Alberta and completed the deal early in 2008. 
This adds an additional 43 billion cubic feet of gas to our 
Direct Energy business.
We are building our eighth gas-fired power station (at Langage in
Devon) and two wind farms off the Lincolnshire coast which will
have a combined capacity of 180MW. We already have interests 
in three operational wind farms which provide access to 188MW 
of renewable electricity and are seeking consent for a further
250MW farm.
In Centrica Storage the creation of an innovative virtual storage
product helped to drive a year of record profitability.
Strategy
In February 2007, I set out four priorities for Centrica that 
underpin how we run the business, and we have continued to 
focus on them.
In 2008, our critical short-term priority in transforming British Gas
will be on improving our service to customers while delivering
sustainable returns. We made good progress in 2007 . Our service
levels are improving and we removed £139 million of costs from 
the business. But we have more to do. We will remove an additional

Delivering our strategy
Centrica plc Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements 2007
A year in review with Chief Executive, Sam Laidlaw
2007 was a year of two distinct periods. In the first half, wholesale
energy prices in the UK were low. This was a result of increased gas
supply through new gas pipelines and additional liquefied natural
gas (LNG) facilities and reduced demand due to warm weather.
Over two-thirds of our earnings came in this period.
During the second six months, however, the day ahead 
wholesale gas price rose sharply, averaging 56% higher than 
during the first half. This significantly reduced margins in our UK
residential business. 
Centrica operates in a complex, global industry that is facing some
profound challenges, which will push up the price of energy long
term. Our strategy is to create an integrated energy company,
operating upstream by developing new sources of gas and power, 
and downstream with strong brands in a few chosen markets.
Downstream
We are the UK’ s largest energy supplier to residential customers
and the largest domestic central heating and gas installation and
maintenance company. We are one of the UK’ s largest producers
and suppliers of wind energy and British Gas is one of the country’ s
greenest energy brands. In April we set up British Gas New Energy
to expand our offer in low-carbon products and services.
In our North American markets, we have more than 5 million
customers. Our experience of deregulated markets in the UK and
North America will stand us in good stead when European energy
markets finally open up to competition. 
Strategy
2007 was a year of
substantial achievement 
for Centrica during which 
we made further progress 
on addressing the key 
priorities for the business.
CE40001_Cent_Review_P07_Q7:Layout 1  10/3/08  09:24  Page 04 £60 million of operating cost and will also invest in the British Gas
brand as not only a provider of energy but of energy efficiency
advice and services. 
We are making cost reduction central to our business culture and
aim to become the most efficient energy supplier with the lowest
cost per customer. 
With wholesale energy costs still volatile, the importance of getting
more of our gas and power from our own resources cannot be
over-estimated. Our acquisition of the Newfield gas properties and
the investments we are making in both renewables and gas-fired
power generation are important steps in the right direction. This will
be a key strategic priority in 2008.
We will increase our involvement in LNG and from October 2008 
will have LNG import capacity at the Isle of Grain which will be able
to supply approximately 6% of Centrica’ s annual gas demand. 
In British Gas Business we will seek to maintain our current
growth trajectory through ongoing development of our routes 
to market while also focusing on further enhancing the service 
we deliver. 
In British Gas Services we will develop additional customer
propositions to continue our rapid progress in the on-demand
market, enabling us to further expand our customer base and to
drive growth. Our new business British Gas New Energy is well
positioned to supply energy efficiency products and services to 
our increasingly climate change aware customers.
In North America there is real potential to grow our business both
organically and through acquisition. Near term prospects will be
affected by the depth and length of any economic downturn but we
will seek to minimise the impact through increasing the diversity of
our business. 
Europe remains challenging. This year we will concentrate on
simplifying the ownership structure of SPE in Belgium as the merger
of Suez and Gaz de France proceeds. We will also continue to grow
our Belgian, Dutch and Spanish businesses and establish ourselves
firmly in the industrial and commercial market in Germany.
In summary, we will be following the same path in 2008 as we have
in 2007 , guided by the same priorities that we have laid down. On
the next two pages I will explain in more detail how we have
performed against these priorities.
The UK market faces high wholesale energy prices and it is
important that we remain single-minded in making our operations
leaner and more efficient. But Centrica is a strong business with a
clear sense of direction and the momentum to make the best of its
unique strengths.

CE40001_Cent_Review_P07_Q7:Layout 1  10/3/08  09:24  Page 05 Transform
British Gas
Transforming British Gas is a priority because profitability and
service levels at British Gas Residential, which is the core of our
business, have historically been low and variable. 
Progress
We led the industry in reducing prices, cutting them twice during
2007 by a total of 17% in electricity and by 20% in gas. We also
established the lowest dual fuel tariff through our online Click
Energy offer. However, because of higher wholesale energy prices
in the second half of 2007 , we had to increase retail tariffs in 
January 2008. Although this was disappointing, retail prices are still
lower than at the same time in 2007 . The 15% increase will help us
to re-establish the profit margin we need to provide sustainable 
long-term earnings.
Having completed the move of all of our customers to our new
billing system by March 2007 , we concentrated on improving 
the service that had slipped during the process. Service levels
improved significantly. As a result, we saw fewer complaints and
customer losses. By December 2007 , complaints to energywatch
had fallen by 80% since April, and customer churn had also 
fallen sharply.
We continued to reduce operating costs within British Gas
compared to 2006, and recovered the market share which we 
had lost during the first quarter to finish 2007 with 16 million
customer accounts.
Sharpen up the organisation 
and reduce costs
If we are to compete domestically and internationally in the long
term, we need to do what we do better, and at lower cost. Our
goal is to be the most efficient energy supplier, with the lowest 
cost per customer. 
Progress 
Over the past year we have strengthened our executive team with
several key appointments including a new Group Finance Director
and a new Managing Director for British Gas. We looked at the
structure of our operating businesses, and this resulted in changes
within Centrica Energy, in our North American operation and within
British Gas Residential (BGR) that have improved clarity and
accountability.
Better business discipline has been introduced through systematic
quarterly cost reviews of each business unit, a tighter capital
allocation framework, and a new three-year planning horizon to
focus performance.
And we have reduced costs significantly. For example, the
restructuring of British Gas Services has removed £20 million of cost
a year, and BGR is on track to deliver its £200 million cost reduction
target. Some £139 million of cost savings were achieved in 2007
with the balance to come in 2008. During the year we moved 2,250
back-office jobs to India outsourcing a number of support services
including many of the central finance, information system and
human resource functions.

increased integration
In the UK we currently supply around 25% of the gas and 67% of
our peak electricity requirements from our own resources or major
contracts. We aim to reduce this risk by building a profitable
upstream business to supply 50% of our gas needs. 
Progress
In October 2007 we bought Newfield UK Holdings Limited with 
the potential to add 300 billion cubic feet of gas reserves in the
North Sea. Further gas reserves were added by the acquisition 
in February 2008 of Rockyview Energy Inc in Alberta.
We obtained interests in licences in the UK, Norway and Trinidad
bringing our total to19. From the winter of 2010/11, we will also
have access to a further 2.4 billion cubic metres (BCM) of liquefied
natural gas import capacity at the Isle of Grain terminal in addition 
to the 3.4BCM available from October 2008. 
Construction continues on our 885MW power station in Devon, 
which will increase our UK generation capacity to almost 5GW. 
We also began construction of the 180MW Lynn and Inner 
Dowsing wind farms off the coast of Lincolnshire and acquired 
a 50% share in the Braes of Doune wind farm in Stirlingshire in 
July. In T exas we concluded a new 170MW power purchase
agreement that brings our total power offtake from T exas wind
farms to 813MW. 
Build on our 
growth platforms
Centrica’ s growth businesses in the UK, North America and Europe
have considerable potential for increasing the Group’ s profitability and
our opportunities for providing low-carbon products and services.
Progress 
British Gas Business delivered record profits*, a growing customer
base and improving levels of customer satisfaction; while in British
Gas Services, account numbers grew by 7% and operating profits*
by 48% as service levels improved dramatically. 
Our Direct Energy business in North America was restructured,
delivering the targeted cost reductions and increased operating
profit^*, despite increased competitive pressures and a slowing 
US property market. 
We more than doubled our operating profits* in Europe in 2007 . 
In Belgium we added around 500,000 Wallonian customer accounts
to our SPE-Luminus business, now established as the undisputed
number two player . We also opened an office in Düsseldorf as a result
of developments in Germany .
In April we created British Gas New Energy to operate in the
increasingly important market for low-carbon products and services
that is expected to grow exponentially in the coming years. And in
North America, we formed a new group to focus on renewables.
We also launched our first carbon neutral product across Canada.

British Gas Residential
British Gas Residential has around 16 million customer
accounts in the UK, and is the country’s largest supplier
of both gas and electricity to residential customers. We
are also playing a leading role in providing customers
with low-carbon products.
This was a strong year for British Gas Residential. 
We delivered excellent financial results and reduced operating
costs by £139 million. Although revenue fell by 9% to £6,457
million due to lower average customer numbers and lower energy
consumption because of warm weather, operating profit*
increased to £571 million (2006: £95 million). Most of this increase
came in the first half of the year, when wholesale gas prices fell. 
We were the first energy supplier to announce reduced prices for
customers. We cut our prices by a total of 20% in gas and 17%
in electricity in March and April.
We also improved our customer service which had suffered as
we moved customers to a new billing system. By the end of the
year complaints to energywatch had fallen by 80% from the high
point in April 2007 . 
Our more competitive pricing and the improvements we’ve made
to customer service helped us to stabilise our customer base in
2007 . We are once again serving just over 16 million accounts.
3 We reorganised the business to improve accountability 
and performance
3 We stabilised customer accounts at 16 million
3 We increased our operating profit* by £476 million

CE40001_Cent_Review_P07_Q6  10/3/08  12:49  Page 14 British Gas Services
British Gas Services is the largest domestic central
heating and gas appliance installation and maintenance
company in the UK. We directly employ more than 9,000
engineers who also provide comprehensive maintenance
and breakdown services for electrical white goods and 
home wiring. Our Dyno brand provides plumbing, drains
and home security services across the UK.
During 2007, we increased the number of customer product
holdings by 7% to 7 .6 million, and revenue was up by 16% 
at £1,279 million.
We increased the number of customers who take our Homecare
Flexi product, improved what we offer online and focused on
cross-selling our products. We also strengthened our position 
in the on-demand market, with the number of central heating
repairs for non-contract customers increasing by 19% to
414,000.
Operating profit* grew by 48% to £151 million due to the strong
growth in higher margin care products, together with cost and
overhead savings. Profitability also grew in the central heating
installation business as the number of installations, including
those for the Scottish Executive, increased by 24% to 113,000.
Our strong financial and operational performance was supported
by improvements in customer service and engineer deployment,
which provide a strong platform for continued growth.

British Gas New Energy
We launched British Gas New Energy as a separate
business in April 2007 to supply the growing UK market for
low-carbon and energy efficient products and services. 
In July 2007 we launched ‘Zero Carbon’ our greenest tariff
available to domestic customers, which is linked to carbon
offsets certified by the United Nations.
Now, in addition to loft and cavity wall insulation, our engineers
are able to install solar panels; and our Green Streets challenge
aims to highlight the positive impact simple energy efficiency
products and behaviours can have in reducing UK domestic 
CO2 emissions.
In January 2008 we bought a £20 million equity stake in Ceres
Power, which is developing combined heat and power (CHP)
units for domestic use. They will operate as central heating
boilers, but will also generate low-carbon electricity in the home,
cutting energy bills and carbon footprints.
During the year we delivered on our Energy Efficiency
Commitment ahead of schedule and under budget.
3 We provided more than 17 million energy efficiency products
to UK households
3 We launched two industry-leading green energy tariffs

British Gas Business
British Gas Business sells gas, electricity and energy-
related services – including carbon-offsetting – to small,
medium and large corporate businesses. The introduction
of our dedicated account managers has helped to
improve levels of customer service.
Against a backdrop of volatile gas prices we delivered a record
financial result, grew our customer base and continued to
improve customer satisfaction.
Revenue increased by 6% to £2,431 million. This was because
of price changes during 2006 and 2007, higher customer
numbers in both fuels and higher electricity consumption by our
increased number of large corporate customers. Customer
supply point numbers increased by 2% to 954,000 on a strong
sales performance and high contract renewal rates, particularly
in the small business sector. 
Operating profit* was up 38% to £120 million. This was mainly
due to the widening of margins during contract renewals, and
the positive effect of falling wholesale gas prices. Operating
margins in the year rose to 4.9% (2006: 3.8%).
In customer service we are now seeing positive results from
having dedicated account managers, and during the year we
improved the level of customer satisfaction across the business. 
3 We continued to have high contract renewal rates

than 2%

Centrica Energy
Centrica Energy sources the gas and electricity we supply
to our residential and business customers in the UK and
Europe. This comes from our own upstream gas production,
electricity generation and renewable energy operations, 
and through the management of our gas and electricity
purchase contracts and wholesale energy trading.
The day ahead wholesale gas price in the UK fluctuated between
a low of 13 pence per therm (p/th) in April and a high 
of 59p/th in December. This is what price volatility means. 
Low wholesale prices in the first quarter of the year reduced
operating profit* for gas production and development by 50% 
to £429 million.
However, during the year we added 114 billion cubic feet
equivalent (bcfe) to our gas reserves of which 67bcfe came 
from the purchase of Newfield UK Holdings Limited in October.
Electricity generation was up by 36% on 2006, and we made
good progress with our new plant at Langage in Devon, which
should begin operations early in 2009. 
We bought 50% of the 72MW Braes of Doune wind farm for 
£42 million and spent £104 million on the ongoing development
of the two 90MW Lynn and Inner Dowsing wind farms, as well 
as securing further valuable gas import capacity at the Isle of Grain
LNG terminal. 
3 The acquisition of Newfield added 67bcfe to our gas reserves

Centrica Storage owns and operates the UK’s largest gas
storage facility. We sell gas storage and other services 
to a wide range of gas market participants including
Centrica Energy.
Ongoing investment in our Rough storage facility to improve its
injection and withdrawal capabilities enabled us to sell significant
volumes of additional space, and generate additional revenue,
particularly from our new virtual storage product, V Store. This
product has the equivalent rights to a Standard Bundled Unit
(SBU) but delivery of gas is guaranteed to the National Balancing
Point. This guarantee meant that the product could be sold at a
substantial premium to the price of an SBU.
Operationally Rough performed well, delivering injection and
production availability of more than 98%. This was achieved at
the same time as improving our health and safety performance.
A review undertaken by the Health and Safety Executive placed
Rough in the top quartile of all North Sea installations surveyed.
A record operating profit* of £240 million reflected both the
increase in the average SBU price for the year, and the continued
growth in non-SBU revenue.

European Energy
We are involved in power generation, energy management
and retail energy supply, particularly in the increasingly
interconnected energy markets of north western Europe. 
Our European Energy business more than doubled its operating
profit* to £17 million.
We increased our total energy customer base in Belgium to 
1.4 million, and in the Netherlands (through our Oxxio brand) 
we now supply 754,000 customer accounts. During the year we
installed around 75,000 smart meters and are working with the
regulator to ensure Oxxio’ s meters are compatible with 
future industry standards. We also entered into a 20-year tolling
contract with Intergen for a 400MW gas-fired power station 
in Rijnmond, near Rotterdam, which is expected to be
commercially operational by summer 2010.
In January 2007 we re-branded our Spanish operation from
Luseo to Centrica Energía. As market conditions improved 
we re-entered the Spanish electricity supply market and have
already contracted 0.9TWh of annual consumption. 
As a result of developments within the German energy market
we opened an operation in Düsseldorf selling to the commercial
supply market through Centrica Energie GmbH.

A strong business
Direct Energy
Our Direct Energy brand is one of North America’s 
largest energy and energy service providers, with over 
5 million residential and business customers in Canada
and the US. We own and operate gas reserves in Canada,
and electricity generation capacity in Texas.
Direct Energy performed well during a year in which we
continued to develop our activities beyond mass market energy
supply. We restructured into four pan-North American operations
to drive growth and efficiencies of scale through shared operations.
Excluding the negative impact of exchange rate movements,
Direct Energy delivered top and bottom line growth. While
reported revenue^ was down 1.4% at £3.99 billion, underlying
revenue^ was up 4.9%. 
Reported operating profit*^ was up 8% at £187 million, with
underlying profit* before exchange rate movements up more
than 15%.
The mass markets energy business, which comprises 
gas and electricity sales to residential and small commercial
customers, experienced difficult trading conditions, particularly 
in Ontario and T exas where customer numbers fell. However, 
by the end of the year numbers were growing again.
Revenue was down 12% to £2,437 million and operating profit*
was 22% lower at £123 million.
Commercial and industrial energy comprises gas and
electricity sales to medium and large-sized businesses, public
institutions and government. Rapid growth in this segment
continued during the year with volumes up 13% and 24% in gas
and electricity respectively. 
Reported revenue was up 15% to £978 million with underlying
revenues up 24%. The business moved into profit during the
second half as volumes grew and it recorded a £1 million profit*
for the full year.
Home and business services had a good year despite the
housing recession in the US. Customer numbers grew by 3.5%
to over 2 million for the first time. The acquisition in January of
MABE, a service provider for white goods, enabled us to launch
an appliance protection and repair business across Canada.
Reported revenue^ was down 7% to £351 million, although it
remained flat on an underlying basis. Following restructuring of
the business services operation and increased focus on cost
control to improve competitiveness, operating profit*^ almost
doubled to £17 million.
Our upstream and wholesale energy business delivered
operating profit* of £46 million, up 142% on the year with strong
contributions from our power stations, wind power contracts as
433MW of new capacity came onstream, wholesale energy
auctions and proprietary trading. 
Power generated increased by 14% while gas production was
broadly unchanged. By the end of 2007, through our ongoing drilling
programme, we had replaced 117% of the gas we produced.
Early in 2008 we acquired Rockyview Energy Inc of Alberta for
around £57 million, in line with our strategy of increasing the overall
level of vertical integration within Direct Energy.

on society and the environment helps us to win business 
advantage and deliver value to our shareholders. We maintain 
close dialogue with employees, customers, policy-makers,
investors and wider stakeholders to ensure we are alert to their
opinions and evolving trends.
Our Corporate Responsibility Committee, chaired by Mary Francis
CBE, oversees Centrica’ s corporate responsibility strategy and
activities on behalf of the Board. 
Taking responsibility 
In 2007 Sam Laidlaw launched an initiative to communicate our
business principles to our employees and business partners. 
Our principles describe the standards we expect of ourselves 
and those we work with. 
Tackling climate change 
Reducing carbon emissions, while securing future energy supplies
for our customers, is a significant challenge. In 2007 we launched 
a new business unit – British Gas New Energy – to lead our low-
carbon strategy in the UK while, in North America, Direct Energy
formed a cross-business climate change team.
British Gas launched ‘Zero Carbon’
1
, our greenest tariff available to
domestic customers, and Direct Energy extended its carbon neutral
gas programme after a successful launch in British Columbia. 
T o ensure we maintain our leading low-carbon position in the UK,
we are investing in high-efficiency gas-fired power stations and
offshore wind farms. We have also set targets to reduce the carbon
dioxide emissions from our UK power generation activities.
Supporting vulnerable customers
Although UK retail energy prices were lower in 2007 than in the
previous 12 months, fuel poverty continued to be an issue. 
In March 2007 British Gas received widespread recognition 
from government and industry groups following our £32 million
commitment to ‘Essentials’, the UK’ s largest social tariff on the
energy market. 
Focusing on health and safety 
The health and safety of our employees, customers and others 
who could be affected by our activities is a top priority for us. 
A concerted campaign to improve incident reporting in our main 
UK customer-facing businesses led to an overall increase in
accident incidence rates in 2007 . A detailed internal review has
identified opportunities to reinforce our approach and we will
continue to target a year-on-year 4% reduction in time lost 
from injuries. 
Valuing our people 
More than 84% of employees responded to our engagement
survey and we recorded an increase of 3% in our overall score. 
We received awards for our age awareness activities in the UK 
and our workplace flexibility programme in North America. Female
trainees accounted for 13% of all those recruited by the British Gas
Engineering Academy in 2007 .
Investing in communities
By understanding our impact on the communities in which we work,
we can develop successful partnerships to mutual benefit. In 2007
we contributed £5.2 million
2
to community causes and employees
volunteered more than 18,000 hours. We invested a further £76
million
3
in social programmes for our vulnerable customers. In June, 
a memorial service was held for those who lost their lives in the
Morecambe Bay helicopter tragedy on 27 December 2006. The first
donation from the fund, set up in memory of those who died, was
made to North West Air Ambulance.
1  Zero Carbon is the name of the tariff. We offset the CO2 emissions from the gas and electricity
customers consume using carbon offsets certified by the United Nations.
2  Cash, time and in-kind support in accordance with London Benchmarking Group model, including
a donation of £1.1 million to the British Gas Energy Trust, which supports vulnerable customers.
3  Combined cost of voluntary and mandatory programmes to support vulnerable customers in the UK.

(i) Certain re-measurements included within operating profit comprise re-measurement arising on our energy procurement activities and re-measurement of proprietary trades in relation to cross-
border transportation or capacity contracts. In our business we enter into a portfolio of forward energy contracts which include buying substantial quantities of commodity to meet the future needs
of our customers. A number of these arrangements are considered to be derivative financial instruments and are required to be fair valued under IAS 39. Fair valuing means that we apply the
prevailing forward market prices to these contracts. The Group has shown the fair value adjustments separately as certain re-measurements as they are unrealised and non-cash in nature. 
The profits arising from the physical purchase and sale of commodities during the year, which reflect the prices in the underlying contracts, are not impacted by these re-measurements. 
As permitted by IAS 1, Presentation of Financial Statements, certain items are presented separately. The items that the Group separately presents as exceptional are items which are of a non-
recurring nature and, in the judgement of the Directors, need to be disclosed separately by virtue of their nature, size or incidence in order to obtain a clear and consistent presentation of the
Group’s underlying business performance. Items which may be considered exceptional in nature include disposals of businesses, business restructurings, the renegotiation of significant contracts
and asset write-downs. 
Exceptional items and certain re-measurements included within discontinued operations comprise the gain on disposal of The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund and re-measurement of the
publicly traded units of The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund. All other re-measurement is included within results before exceptional items and certain re-measurements. 
(ii) Restated to present costs incurred under the energy savings programmes in cost of sales and to present The Consumers’ Waterheater Income Fund as a discontinued operation.

CE40001_Cent_Review_P07_Q7:Layout 1  10/3/08  09:29  Page 23 Independent auditors’ statement to the members 
of Centrica plc
We have examined the Summary Financial Statements of Centrica
plc which comprise the Summary Group Income Statement,
Summary Group Balance Sheet, Summary Group Statement of
Recognised Income and Expense, Summary Group Cash Flow
Statement and the Summary Remuneration Report. 
Respective responsibilities of Directors and auditors 
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Review and
Summary Financial Statements in accordance with United Kingdom
law. Our responsibility is to report to you our opinion on the
consistency of the Summary Financial Statements within the Annual
Review and Summary Financial Statements with the full Annual
Financial Statements, the Directors’ Report (comprising the
Directors’ Report – Business Review and the Directors’ Report –
Governance) and the Remuneration Report, and its compliance
with the relevant requirements of section 251 of the United
Kingdom Companies Act 1985 and the regulations made
thereunder. We also read the other information contained in the
Annual Review and Summary Financial Statements and consider
the implications for our statement if we become aware of any
apparent misstatements or material inconsistencies with the
Summary Financial Statements. This statement, including the
opinion, has been prepared for and only for the Company’ s
members as a body in accordance with section 251 of the
Companies Act 1985 and for no other purpose. We do not, in
giving this opinion, accept or assume responsibility for any other
purpose or to any other person to whom this statement is shown 
or into whose hands it may come save where expressly agreed by
our prior consent in writing. 
Basis of opinion 
We conducted our work in accordance with Bulletin 1999/6, ‘The
auditors’ statement on the summary financial statement’ issued by
the Auditing Practices Board. Our reports on the Company’ s full
Annual Financial Statements describe the basis of our audit opinions
on those Financial Statements and the Remuneration Report. 
Opinion
In our opinion the Summary Financial Statements are consistent
with the full Annual Financial Statements, the Directors’ Report
(comprising the Directors’ Report – Business Review and the
Directors’ Report – Governance) and the Remuneration Report of
Centrica plc for the year ended 31 December 2007 and comply
with the applicable requirements of section 251 of the Companies
Act 1985, and the regulations made thereunder.

Full Report and Accounts
The auditors have issued an unqualified report on the Annual
Financial Statements and Remuneration Report containing no
statement under section 237 (2) or section 237 (3) of the
Companies Act 1985. The auditors report in respect of consistency
between the Directors’ Report and the Group Financial Statements
is also unqualified. These Summary Financial Statements are a
summary of the full Centrica Annual Report and Accounts and the
narrative reports contain information from the Directors’ Report but
not the full text of that report. They do not contain sufficient
information to allow as full an understanding of the results and state
of affairs of the Group and of its policies and arrangements
concerning the Directors’ remuneration as would be provided by
the full Report and Accounts. The full Report can be downloaded
from our website at www.centrica.com or can be obtained for
2007 and/or future years, free of charge, by contacting the Centrica
shareholder helpline (see page 29 for contact details). 
Dividends
An interim dividend for 2007 of 3.35 pence per share was paid on
14 November 2007 . The Directors recommend that, subject to
approval at the AGM, a final dividend of 9.65 pence per share will
be paid on 11 June 2008 to those shareholders registered on 
25 April 2008. This would make a total ordinary dividend for the
year of 13.0 pence per share (2006: 11.15 pence per share). 
Corporate Governance
The Board of Directors of Centrica plc is committed to the highest
standards of corporate governance. Throughout the year ended 
31 December 2007, the Company fully complied with the provisions
set out in Section 1 of the Combined Code on Corporate
Governance (the ‘Code’). A report on how the Code’ s principles
were applied is set out in the Corporate Governance Report in the
full Annual Report and Accounts and is summarised below. 
Board of Directors
An effective Board of Directors leads and controls the Group, and
has a schedule of matters reserved for its approval. This schedule
and the terms of reference for the Executive, Audit, Remuneration,
Nominations, Corporate Responsibility and Disclosure Committees
are available on request and on the Company’ s website at
www.centrica.com.
The Board is specifically responsible for:
3 the development of strategy and major policies;
3 the review of management performance;
3 the approval of the annual operating plan, the financial
statements and major acquisitions and disposals;
3 the Group’ s corporate responsibility arrangements including
health, safety and environment matters;
3 the Group’ s system of internal control; and
3 corporate governance.
One of the Board’ s meetings is specifically devoted to the
development of the Group’ s strategic direction. This is continually
monitored and a half year review is presented to, and discussed 
by the Board.

CE40001_Cent_Review_P07_Q7:Layout 1  10/3/08  09:29  Page 24 Board appointments, evaluation and training 
There is a formal, rigorous and transparent procedure in place for
the appointment of new Directors to the Board. This is described 
on page 39 of the full Annual Report and Accounts. In accordance
with the Code and the Company’ s Articles of Association, all
Directors are subject to election by shareholders at the first AGM
following their appointment to the Board and thereafter are subject
to re-election every third year.
During the year the Board conducted a formal and rigorous
performance evaluation of its own performance and that of its
committees and individual Directors, with the assistance of an
independent external facilitator, Egon Zehnder International. The
evaluation report concluded that the Board and its committees
continue to operate effectively and builds upon the progress of
previous years.
An induction programme tailored to meet the needs of individual
Directors is provided for each new Director. Directors also receive
training and updates throughout the year.
Internal control 
The Audit Committee reviews regular internal control reports, 
tracks issues, monitors performance against objectives and
ensures necessary actions are taken to remedy any significant
failings or weaknesses identified from those reports.
The Board, with the advice of the Audit Committee, has reviewed
the effectiveness of the system of internal control, for the period
from 1 January 2007 to the date of this report, and is satisfied that
the Group complies with the Turnbull Guidance. The Board will
continue to routinely challenge the management to ensure the
system of internal control is constantly improving.
Summary Remuneration Report
This is a summary of the full Remuneration Report, which is
contained in the Annual Report and Accounts, copies of which 
are available from our website at www.centrica.com.
It is the responsibility of the Remuneration Committee to make
recommendations to the Board on the policy, framework and cost
of executive remuneration, and the implementation of remuneration
policy and determining specific remuneration packages for each of
the Executive Directors. It consists exclusively of Non-Executive
Directors and has access to the advice of external consultants.
Summary remuneration policy
The Committee ensures that the Group’ s remuneration policy and
framework provides competitive reward for its Executive Directors
and other senior executives, taking into account the Company’ s
performance, the markets in which it operates and pay and
conditions elsewhere in the Group. In constructing the
remuneration packages, the Committee aims to achieve an
appropriate balance between fixed and variable compensation for
each executive through the following key elements:
3 a significant proportion depends on the attainment of demanding
performance objectives;
3 Annual Incentive Scheme (AIS) incentivises and rewards the
achievement of demanding objectives; and
3 long-term share-based incentives align interests with the longer
term interests of the shareholders. 
The Committee reviews the packages to ensure they continue to
promote the achievement of strategic objectives while delivering
shareholder value; reflect current best practice and meet the
Group’ s business needs; and enable the Group to attract and retain
high calibre management. Changes to the future policy and
framework of executive remuneration arrangements were endorsed
by shareholders at the 2006 AGM and fully implemented in 2007 .
In 2007 executive remuneration comprised base salary, AIS, an
allocation of shares under the Long T erm Incentive Scheme (LTIS),
and an allocation of shares under the new Deferred and Matching
Share Scheme (DMSS). No Executive Share Option Scheme
(ESOS) grants were made during the year, although the Committee
retains the discretion to make grants under the ESOS in the future.
As a matter of policy, the notice periods in the Executive Directors’
service contracts do not exceed one year. The Committee
exercised its discretion in respect of the appointment of Sam
Laidlaw on 1 July 2006 and Nick Luff on 1 March 2007 . Each has a
service contract that contains a notice period of two years, which
will reduce to one year on the second anniversary of their respective
date of appointment. 
The Committee believes that these arrangements are important in
providing a potential remuneration package that will attract, retain
and continue to motivate Executive Directors and other senior
executives in a marketplace that is challenging and competitive 
in both commercial and human resource terms. It is currently
intended that this remuneration policy and framework, which is 
fully endorsed by the Board, will continue for 2008 and thereafter. 
Components of remuneration 
For 2007 the maximum bonus payable under the AIS to the
Executive Directors, should every single element of every objective
be achieved in full, was 125% of base salary. The current objectives
comprise financial performance targets (64%) and business-related
targets (36%). A bonus will be forfeited if the Committee considers
overall performance to have been unsatisfactory. 
In 2007 initial awards under the DMSS were made to Executive
Directors and other Senior Executives. 20% of the AIS payable in
respect of 2006 was deferred automatically for a period of three
years and invested in deferred shares. Participants were given the
opportunity to invest an additional amount in investment shares
from their actual bonus, up to 50% of the individual’ s maximum
bonus entitlement in respect of 2006. Initial arrangements in
respect of Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff were put in place. Full details
can be found in the Annual Report and Accounts. 
Deferred and investment shares were matched with conditional
matching shares, which will be released upon the achievement 
of a performance target (see table on page 26). For the purposes 
of matching, the investment shares are grossed up for income tax
and National Insurance contributions.

that would have been paid during the three-year performance
period. In the event of a change of control the number of matching 
shares that vest will be subject to time-apportionment in line with
best practice.
In 2007 LTIS allocations were awarded to Executive Directors 
equal to 200% of base salary and at lower rates to other senior
executives. The release of allocations will be subject to the
performance conditions set out in the table below. 
Prior to 2006 allocations were made annually to Executive Directors
and other senior executives under the old LTIS, in accordance with
the remuneration policy adopted in 2001. Such allocations were
subject to a performance condition as set out in the table below.
No grants of options were made during 2007 under the ESOS. 
The adjusted EPS performance conditions for the ESOS are set 
out below.

The Centrica Management Pension Scheme (a contributory final
salary arrangement) was closed to new employees on 30 June 2003.
Executive Directors in office prior to this date participated in that
scheme during 2007 . Alternative arrangements are made for new
employees, including Sam Laidlaw and Nick Luff, after that date. 
The Executive Directors are also eligible, on the same basis 
as other employees, to participate in the Company’s HMRC-
approved Sharesave and Share Incentive Plan.

Electronic communications and the
Centrica website
At the 2007 Annual General Meeting (AGM), the Company passed
a resolution allowing the Centrica website to be used as the primary
means of communication with its shareholders. A shareholder
consultation card was sent with the proxy forms to shareholders 
in March 2007 enabling them to choose to either:
3 receive shareholder documentation by website communication
by providing an email address; or
3 continue to receive shareholder documentation in hard copy 
by returning the personalised card attached to the AGM 
proxy form. 
If the completed card was not returned, shareholders were
deemed in accordance with the Companies Act 2006 to have
agreed to receive shareholder documentation via the Centrica
website. These shareholders, and those who positively elected
for website communication, were sent, immediately prior to the
publication date, a written notification that the 2007 shareholder
documents are available to view on the Centrica website at
www.centrica.com/reports2007 .
The new electronic arrangements provide shareholders with the
opportunity to access information in a timely manner and help
Centrica to reduce both its costs and its impact on the environment.
The Centrica website at www.centrica.com provides news and
details of the Company’s activities, plus information on the share
price and links to its business sites.
The investors’ section of the website contains up-to-date
information for shareholders including comprehensive share price
information, financial results, dividend payment dates and
amounts, and shareholder documents.

Governance Financial statements Portfolio and other 
information
3 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 In my first statement to you last year, I said that our 
strategy would be to retain our financial strength, 
to continue to take a measured and highly selective 
approach to investment and to keep an absolute 
focus on improving every aspect of our business. 
It has undoubtedly been a challenging year for 
3i but we have stuck firmly to this agenda.
We have retained our financial strength, realised 
more than we have invested and made a number 
of improvements to 3i, especially in our Private 
Equity business line. We have also, following a 
rigorous process that considered a strong field 
of both external and internal candidates, 
announced the appointment of a new Chief 
Executive, Simon Borrows. 
Simon will succeed Michael Queen, who in March 
this year, after almost 25 years at 3i and three as 
Chief Executive, announced his intention to leave 
the Company. Michael has given tremendous 
service to 3i. His leadership through the period of 
the global financial crisis in restoring 3i’s financial 
strength, his founding of our highly successful 
Infrastructure business, his actions to reduce costs 
and the strong management team he has put in 
place are just some of his many achievements. 
Currently Chief Investment Officer, Simon has 
been a member of the Group Board since he joined 
3i in October 201 1. Prior to that, he was Chairman 
of Greenhill & Co. International LLP , having 
previously been Co-Chief Executive Officer 
of Greenhill & Co. Inc., a leading independent 
investment bank listed on the New York Stock 
Exchange. Before founding the European 
operations of Greenhill & Co. in 1998, he was the 
Managing Director of Baring Brothers International 
Limited. He is also a non-executive director of 
The British Land Company plc and of Inchcape plc. 
Chairman’s statement
“ A clear and concrete set of measures 
to maximise shareholder value.”
4 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Simon has already made a significant positive 
impact as Chief Investment Officer, bringing a fresh 
focus and discipline to 3i’s investment processes 
and to our approach to asset management. 
His immediate priorities as Chief Executive will be 
to pursue a clear and concrete set of measures 
that he and the Board have agreed to maximise 
shareholder value. These will include determining 
the best shape and investment strategy for the 
business going forward and ensuring that the 
operating costs of the Group are consistent with 
this. A key component of this will be improving 
the focus and discipline around the Group’s 
asset management approach and investment 
capabilities, to the benefit of the Group’s 
shareholders and co-investors. He will continue 
to chair 3i’s Investment Committee.
In our pre-close briefing statement in March, we 
said that we expected a more positive economic 
outlook to result in a stronger overall performance 
from our Private Equity portfolio, although the 
effect of this improvement in sentiment was 
unlikely to have an impact upon our results for 
the financial year to 31 March 201 2. It is clear 
that uncertainties over the environment remain, 
especially with respect to the Eurozone. It is early 
days but the performance of our recent Private 
Equity vintages is more encouraging, as can be 
seen from the additional disclosure that we have 
provided on the portfolio this year.
At the time of our half-yearly results in November 
201 1, the Board declared an interim dividend of 
2.7p and announced its intention to significantly 
increase the total dividend for the year to 8.1p, 
1 25% higher than the previous year. The Board 
is therefore recommending a final dividend 
of 5.4p, subject to the approval of shareholders 
at the AGM. In addition, the Board has decided 
to further strengthen its distribution policy 
in order to give shareholders a direct share in 
the success of the Group’s realisation activities 
by adopting a policy of returning a share of 
gross cash realisations.
The Board therefore intends to distribute to 
shareholders, whilst gearing remains less than 
20%, further amounts such that the aggregate 
level of distribution by the Company, including the 
dividend, represents at least 15% and up to 20% of 
gross cash realisations. Incremental distributions 
will be either through special dividends, the use of 
the standing share buy-back authority, or by way 
of other capital distribution methods.
The Board expects to implement this new policy 
progressively in the light of the performance of 
the business, progress in implementing the Chief 
Executive’s strategic mandate and the strength 
of the Group’s cash flow. In the next 1 2 months 
it regards the reduction of gross debt to £1 billion 
as a priority. In view of the uncertainty generated 
by the difficult conditions in the banking and 
M&A markets in Europe, the projected flow 
of realisations in the current financial year 
is expected to be lower than those in 201 1/1 2.
The Board will inform shareholders on the 
progress that it is making towards this new 
distribution policy, as well as in reducing gross 
debt on a half-yearly basis.
We were pleased to welcome Martine Verluyten 
to the Board during the year. Martine, who is based 
in Brussels, joined the Board as a non-executive 
Director in January 201 2. She was formerly the 
Chief Financial Officer of Umicore and brings a 
wide range of international and financial experience. 
In summary, this has been a challenging year for 
3i and the stability of the Eurozone remains central 
to the outlook. Whatever the environment, I and the 
Board believe that we have a clear set of measures 
to maximise shareholder value and returns for the 
co-investors in our funds.

5 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Private Equity portfolio 
performance: growth in 
challenging times
The 10 highest performing Private Equity portfolio companies 
increased their sales and earnings by an average of 25%  
and 27% respectively in the year to December 201 1. Based in 
Europe, Asia and North America, these businesses operate 
across a broad range of sectors. What they all have in 
common is international growth, operational effectiveness 
and a strong focus on delivering excellent products and 
services. The combined value increase in these companies 
in the year was £166 million. 
Action and Hilite: demonstrating 
3i’s market access
Two new investments typify the strength of 3i’s market 
access. 3i’s deep sector and local relationships, combined 
with its track record of growing businesses internationally, 
provided the access to these investments with high 
growth potential.
Action, in which Eurofund V invested €229 million, is a 
€700 million revenue Dutch-based non-food discount  
retailer with 275 stores, aiming to expand its presence  
from the Benelux and Germany to other countries.
Hilite, a business in which Eurofund V invested €190 million, is 
a €370 million revenue automotive components business at 
the cutting edge of fuel efficiency and emissions controls 
technology. Being well positioned to benefit from these global 
trends, international growth will be key to Hilite’s success. 
International growth: 
driving realisation success
The three largest realisations in the year, MWM, Hyva and 
Ålö, grew the proportion of their international sales during 
the time that 3i was invested. They delivered an aggregate  
of 4.2x their original investment, an average IRR of 32% 
and created £412 million of value for 3i and £173 million 
for investors in the relevant private equity funds.

6 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Brazil: access to a rapidly 
growing market for 3i and 
its portfolio
In April 201 1, 3i appointed Marcelo Di Lorenzo to lead a team 
of experienced private equity investors, based in São Paulo, 
to build a business in this rapidly growing region. With the 
support of a strong local advisory board, the team also 
provides 3i’s portfolio in other countries with increased 
knowledge of, and access to the Brazilian market. 20%  
of 3i’s existing portfolio has sales or operations in  
Latin America.
In December 201 1, 3i announced its first investment in  
Brazil, a $55 million investment in Blue Interactive Group. 
Blue is the largest independent cable TV and broadband 
provider in Brazil and the investment will be used to expand 
Blue’s footprint from the 14 cities it currently operates in.
Building on our success 
in Debt Management
3i first established a debt management capability in 2007 
and, in 201 1, following the acquisition of MIM from Mizuho, 
formed a distinct Debt Management business line. 
During the year we launched the Credit Opportunities Fund, 
Palace Street I and closed our second private equity fund 
of funds, Vintage II. This, combined with the improvement 
in performance of the funds acquired, has resulted in a 
business generating fees of £32 million and with assets 
under management of £3,358 million.
 
 
LNI: a powerful combination 
of infrastructure expertise 
and Nordic knowledge
3i and 3i Infrastructure plc invested £28 million and 
£195 million respectively in January 2012 in a €1.5 billion 
transaction to form LNI through the acquisition of two 
businesses from Vattenfall AB.
LNI now comprises the second-largest electricity 
distribution network in Finland, as well as a broad-based 
local district heating network. This further diversifies the 
Infrastructure portfolio geographically.
Improved investment 
and portfolio management 
processes
The restructuring of our Private Equity business in Europe 
and the appointment of Simon Borrows as Chief Investment 
Officer (“CIO”) reinforced the changes being made to improve 
investment quality. 
Net operating expenses: 
more than halved since 2008
A further £23 million reduction in annual net operating 
expenses brings the total reduction in annual net operating 
expenses to £126 million since 2008. This 58% decrease  
was achieved as the business has been funding growth  
in several key areas, most notably in Infrastructure and  
Debt Management, growing its Private Equity business in 
developing markets, as well as developing its approach to 
responsible investing.
Responsible Investing: 
a key element of the 3i brand
We have invested in new Responsible Investing (“RI”) 
systems and processes, linked these to a series of values 
workshops for our staff and placed even greater emphasis 
on Environmental, Social and Governance (“ESG”) issues 
in our investment and portfolio processes.

10 3i Group plc  Annual   report  and  accounts  2012 Chief Executive’s review
My  last  review  for  you  as  Chief  Executive  provides  the  opportunity  to  give  you  my  perspective  on  the transformation  of  the  business  over  the  last  three  years,  as  well  as  on  the  performance  and  development  of  the  business  over  the  last  year.  When  I  was  appointed  as  CEO  in  January  2009,  the Company  faced  a  significant  crisis  requiring  extensive  management  action.  The  causes  of  this  crisis  have  been  well  chronicled  but,  in  summary,  were  a  combination  of  over  investment  in  highly  priced  and  highly  leveraged  private  equity  assets  bought  at  the  top  of  the  cycle,  combined  with  a balance  sheet  which  was  insufficiently  strong  for the  testing  conditions  at  that  time.  Less  visible  was  the  need  for  major  cultural  change  and  a  significant  reduction  in  operating  costs.  Extensive  management  action  was  required.
So  three  years  on,  where  have  we  got  to,  and  how should  this  year’s  performance  be  seen  in  the context  of  the  change  programme  overall?
In  terms  of  financial  position,  the  objectives  were  to restore  balance  sheet  strength,  to  reduce  leverage,  both  in  terms  of  the  Group  itself  and  the underlying  portfolio  and  to  build  much  stronger  liquidity.  We  end  the  year  to  31  March  201 2  with  net  debt  of  £464 million,  gross  debt  of  £1.6 billion  and  liquidity  of  £1.7 billion.  The  corresponding  numbers  for  March  2009  were  £1.9 billion,  £2.1 billion  and  £734 million.  Alongside  the  reduction  in  debt  at  a  Group  level,  we  have  also  made  good  progress  in  reducing  the  leverage  in  the  Private  Equity  buyouts  portfolio  in  particular,  with  the  average  debt  to  EBITDA  ratio  on  a  value  weighted  basis  now  down  to  4.2x  (2009:  5.3x).  “ We have used our strengthened balance sheet 
to take advantage of opportunities to create value 
for shareholders for the long term.”

11 3i Group plc  Annual   report  and  accounts  2012
Strategy,  Business  model  and  KPIs
Overview The  year  to  31  March  201 2  was  another  challenging  one  for  the  business,  but  it  was  also  one  in  which  the  benefits  of  this  transformation  are  becoming  more  evident.  The  combination  of  successful  realisations,  more  encouraging  earnings  performance  from  the  portfolio,  and  the  performance  of  high  potential  new  investments  such  as  Action  and  Hilite,  are  all  evidence  of  the  strengthening  of  our  Private  Equity  business.
Our  Infrastructure  business  continued  to  develop  well  and  to  build  its  portfolio.  The  investment  in LNI, the  second  largest  electricity  distribution  network  in  Finland,  is  of  particular  note.  Our  Debt  Management  business  received  a  further  boost  with  the  launch  of  the  Credit  Opportunities  Fund,  Palace  Street  I.  It  wasn’t  all  good  news.  The  strong  overall  performance  from  more  recent  Private  Equity  vintages  was  offset  by  a  continued  drag  on  returns  from  pre-credit  crisis  investments.  Their  impact  on future  returns  is  likely  to  diminish.  The  value  of our  largest  Asian  asset,  reinsurance  business  ACR,  was  also  impacted  by  natural  disasters.  These  factors,  together  with  the  impact  of  economic  uncertainty  on  both  the  multiples  used  to value  the  portfolio,  as  well  as  the  earnings  used  for  valuations,  adverse  movements  on  currency  and  pensions,  meant  that  our  total  return  for  the  year  was  £(656) million.  This  was  a  disappointing  result  in  the  light  of  the  progress  that  we  have  made  and  our  potential  for  the  future.
We  have  also  made  good  progress  in  improving  cost  efficiency.  Net  operating  expenses  fell  a  further  £23 million  in  the  year  to  31  March  201 2,  to £91 million,  just  half  of  those  in  the  year  to  31 March  2009.  This,  combined  with  the  growth  of our  Infrastructure  and  Debt  Management  businesses,  which  now  represent  49%  of  our  assets  under  management,  has  further  increased our  resilience.  In  terms  of  cultural  change,  our  Private  Equity  business  has  been  completely  restructured  with  a much  greater  emphasis  on  performance,  on  values,  on  responsible  investing  and  on  teamwork.  The  appointment  of  Simon  Borrows  as  Chief  Investment  Officer,  combined  with  the  changes  that we  have  made  throughout  the  investment  and  portfolio  management  process,  have  led  to  further  significant  improvements  in  investment  quality.  The investments  made  since  the  rights  issue  in  2009  grew  earnings  by  1 7%  on  a  value  weighted  basis,  versus  9%  for  the  portfolio  overall.
At  a  time  of  considerable  restructuring,  we  have  also  been  ambitious  and  used  our  strengthened  balance  sheet  to  take  advantage  of  opportunities  to create  value  for  shareholders  for  the  long  term.  The  launch  of  our  Debt  Management  business,  and the  recruitment  of  a  strong  team  in  Brazil,  are both  good  examples  of  this.
Chief Executive’s review
“ Further significant improvements 
in investment quality.”
12 3i Group plc  Annual   report  and  accounts  2012 I  have  been  incredibly  fortunate  to  spend  a  large  part  of  my  career  at  3i,  latterly  as  CEO.  I  believe  that 3i  is  a  wonderful  company  that  genuinely  makes  a  difference  to  the  companies  in  which  we invest  –  stimulating  investment,  job  creation  and  wealth  –  all  desperately  needed  in  the  global  economy.  I  am  confident  that  our  performance  over the  next  few  years  will  show  the  real  benefits  of  the  changes  that  I  have  been  responsible  for  over  the  last  three  years.  However,  I  took  the  view  at  the  end  of  March  that  frustration  with  our  short-term  performance  was  likely  to  become  personalised.  I  didn’t  want  to  risk  3i’s  good  name  and  prospects  being  tarnished  by unhelpful  agitation  so  therefore  came  to  the  conclusion  that  a  change  of  leadership  would  be  the  most  effective  way  to  create  the  time  and  space  to  help  the  business  achieve  its  full  potential.
Since  the  announcement  at  the  end  of  March  of  my intention  to  step  down,  I  have  been  focused  on  ensuring  that  the  momentum  of  the  business  has  continued  to  improve.  I  am  delighted  that  the  Board  has  appointed  Simon  Borrows  as  Chief  Executive,  who  is  well  placed  to  lead  3i  in  the  next  phase  of  its development.
3i  has  gone  through  a  very  difficult  turnaround  over  the  last  few  years  and  is  now  emerging  with  much  improved  prospects  for  the  future,  with  a  stronger  financial  position  and  a  higher  quality  and  more  focused  investment  business.  I  would  like  to  thank  the  Board  and  3i’s  staff  for  their  tremendous  support  and  wish  them  every  success.

Strategy,  Business  model  and  KPIs
Overview This  section  sets  out  our  business  model  and  the  way  in  which  we generate returns  at  a  Group  and  business  line  level.  Our  business  model  takes  into  account  the  distinctive  characteristics  of  the  Private  Equity,  Infrastructure  and  Debt  Management  businesses,  as  well  as  the  different  ways  in  which  they  draw  upon  Group  resources  to  deliver  returns.
Each  business  line  benefits  from  the  strengths  of  the  Group.  Some  elements  of  the  business  model,  such  as  the  ability  to  secure  access  to  capital  from  multiple  sources  or  the  strength  of  the  3i  brand,  have  equal  importance  for  all  business  lines.  Others  may  differ  in  emphasis,  for  example,  with  respect  to  Active  Partnership.  The  nature  and  intensity  of  the  relationship  that we  have  with  the  team  of  a  private  equity  or  infrastructure  portfolio  company,  where  we  hold  significant  equity,  will  differ  from  the  relationship  we  have  with  the  management  team  in  a  company  where  our  Debt  Management  business  is  holding  debt.
The  investment  process  is  rigorous  and  consistently  applied  within  each  business  line.  The  decision  making  process  is  structured  through  a  series  of  carefully  planned  steps,  from  sourcing  opportunities  and  early  team  reviews,  through  to    a  final  Investment  Committee.  The  performance  of  each  investment  is  then  subject  to  a  formal  review  process  involving    monthly  and  quarterly  reporting.  In  addition,  we  are  typically  represented  on  the  boards  of  our  Private  Equity  and    Infrastructure  investments.
Secure access to capital 
from multiple sources
As  a  listed  company  with  its  own  capital  and  as  a  manager  of  or  adviser  to  external  funds,  3i  has  access  to  multiple  sources  of  funds.  This  provides  resilience  and  sustainability  and  depends  upon  performance,  transparency  and  a  long-term  approach  to  managing  relationships.
Invest in our network, 
people and knowledge
Our  strong  culture  of  working  across  borders  and  harnessing  the  skills  and  knowledge  from  local,  sector  and  business  line  teams  delivers  the  “best  team  for  the  job”  for  each  phase  of  the  investment  lifecycle.  Sustaining  this  requires  investment  in  our  people,  systems  and  communications.
See the best investment opportunities
Access  to  high  quality  investment  opportunities  is  critical  to  future  value  growth.  Investment  over  many  decades  in  our  network,  people,  knowledge  and relationships  provides  us  with  the right  relationships  and  insights  to deliver  this.
Build great companies and 
deliver outstanding returns
Three  significant  Private  Equity  investments,  Hyva,  MWM  and  Ålö,    are  examples  of  this.  Each  of  these  businesses  delivered  strong  and  sustained  growth  in  earnings  in  competitive  markets.  In  Infrastructure,  examples  include  Anglian  Water  and Eversholt.
Achieve full potential 
through active partnership
Our  rigorous  methodology  for  effecting  business  change  is  focused  on  operational  and  functional  expertise,  sector  and  strategic  insight  and  high  standards  of  governance.
Create innovative financial solutions 
and ensure excellent execution
3i  has  a  strong  heritage  of  successfully  aligning  interests  and  delivering  innovative  financial  solutions.    Our  scale, culture,  experience  and  training  are  central  to  sustaining  this.  The  development  of  our  infrastructure  and debt  management  capabilities  are good  examples  of  this.

14 3i Group plc  Annual   report  and  accounts  2012 The  Returns  model,  provided  in  the  table  below,  details  the  key  elements  of  return  under  the  headings  of  Gross  portfolio  return, Net  portfolio  return  and  Total  return.  As  can  be  seen  in  the  Business  review,  we  have  increased  disclosure  in  this  year’s accounts  to  include  Net  portfolio  return  by  business  line.  The  amount  and  the  nature  of  the  contribution  that  each  business  line  makes  to  the  Group  returns  depends  upon  the  scale  of assets  under  management,  as  well  as  the  proportion  of  own  balance  sheet  and  external  funds  deployed.  Table 1: Proportion of own capital and external funds by business line
at  31  March  2012
Private    Equity Infrastructure
Debt  Management Group
Own  balance  sheet  % 66% 32% 1% 40%
External  funds  % 34% 68% 99% 60%
Total AUM £5,296m £1,734m £3,358m £10,493m
A  higher  proportion  of  balance  sheet  investment  in  the  Private  Equity  business  means  that  gross  portfolio  return  is  the  most  significant  element  of  net  portfolio  return  for  this  business  line.  Debt  Management  and  Infrastructure  have  higher  proportions  of  external  funds  and,  consequently,  fees  and  carried  interest  from  funds  are  more  significant  elements  of  the  return.
With  the  appropriate  balance  of  third  party  and  own  balance  sheet  funding,  all  of  our  business  lines  aim  to  deliver  15%  net  returns  across  the  cycle.  An  efficient  balance  sheet  structure  for  the  Group,  should  ensure  that  there  is  no  further  dilution  of returns.

The  major  risks  to  our  reputation    continue  to be:

Brand review
A  thorough  review  of  3i’s  positioning,  values,  key  messages  and  visual  identity  was  undertaken.
Each  of  these  aspects  of  our  brand  was  refreshed  in  the  year.
Research  highlighted  that  3i’s  values  and  its  approach  to  doing  business  were  key  differentiators.  The  major  risks  to  maintaining  a    “One  3i”  culture  are:

Introduction
All  three  business  lines  invest  using  a  mix  of  the  Group’s  own  balance  sheet  capital  and  external  capital.  Total  assets  under  management  at  31  March  2012,  including  3i’s  commitments  to  funds,  were  £10.5 billion  (201 1:  £12.7 billion),  including  £6.3 billion  (201 1:  £7 .2 billion)  advised  or  managed  on  behalf  of  others.  The  composition  of  our  assets  under  management  is  set  out  on  the  following  pages.  Further  detail  is  also  provided  on  the  composition  of  the  investment  portfolios  within  each  of  the  business  line  reviews  on  pages  30  to  46.  Information  on  our  10  largest  and  50  of  our  largest  investments  is  provided  on  pages  22  and  23,  and  136  to    139  respectively.
A  detailed  review  of  our  performance  at  a  Group  and  business  line  level  for  the  year  to  31  March  2012  is  set  out  in  this  Business  review.  In  summary,  the  Group’s  total  return  is  generated  by  the  realised  and  unrealised  returns  we  achieve  from  our  direct  portfolio  and  the  fees  and  carry  that  we  receive  from  advising  or  managing  external  funds,  less  the  operating  expenses  and  funding  costs  of  the  business.
Risk  management  and  corporate  responsibility,  for    which  there  are  reports  on  pages  53  and  60  respectively,    are  central  to  our  strategy.  During  the  year,  a  revised  set    of  policies  and  procedures  were  implemented  to  further  develop  our  approach  to  responsible  investing.  An  exercise  was  also  conducted  to  refresh  the  key  elements  of  our  brand in  terms  of  values,  positioning  key  messages  and  visual  identity.  Employee  engagement  is  our  key  non-financial  performance  measure.  As  an  international  investor  employing  a  relatively  small  number  of  people  in  a  highly  competitive  market,  employee  engagement  is  important  to  3i  and  we  undertake  a detailed  survey  of  our  staff  each  year.  Achieving  the  right  balance  between  transparency  and  accessibility  of  information  is  an  important  factor  in  the  continued  development  of  our  online  Reporting  centre.
Increased  disclosure  this  year  includes  information  relating  to  net  portfolio  return  by  business  line  and  further  disclosure  with  respect  to  the  investment  portfolio.  3i  is  an  international  investor  focused  on  private  equity,  infrastructure    and  debt  management,  investing  in  Europe,  Asia  and  the  Americas.    Our  strategy  is  set  out  on  pages  16  and  1 7 .

Assets under management
The  Group  defines  its  assets  under  management  (“AUM”)    as  the  total  commitments,  including  the  Group’s,  to  its  active  managed  and  advised  funds,  as  well  as  the  residual  cost  of  investments  in  funds  that  are  already  invested  and  the  cost  of  any  other  investments  owned  directly  by  3i.
Total  AUM  of  £10,493 million  at  31  March  2012  (201 1:  £12,686 million)  reflected  the  reduction  in  Eurofund  V  AUM  as we  came  to  the  end  of  the  investment  period  in  November  201 1  and  switched  to  a  residual  cost  basis.  The  reduction  also  reflects  net  divestment  activity  from  both  the  Group’s  balance  sheet  and  invested  funds  and  a  £249 million  reduction  due  to  the  weakening  of  sterling  against  euro  denominated  managed  and  advised  funds.
These  factors  were  partly  offset  by  growth  in  the  AUM in Infrastructure  and  the  launch  in  the  year  of  both  Vintage II ($400 million)  and  Palace  Street  I  (€50 million)  by Debt  Management.

Introduction
This  section  provides  commentary  on  the  broader  environment  in  which  the  Group  and  its  business  lines  operate.  It  includes  a  review  of  macroeconomic  conditions,  mergers  and  acquisitions  (“M&A”)  activity  as  well  as  the  levels  of  investment  and  fundraising.  The  regulatory  environment  is  covered  in  the  Risk  section  on  page  53.
Conditions  varied  considerably  during  the  year  to  31  March  2012.  Increased  optimism  and  a  marked  increase  in  activity,  supported  by  wider  debt  availability  early  in  the  year,    were  followed  by  a  sharp  slowdown  in  the  summer  as    the  euro  crisis  dominated  headlines.  Sentiment  improved    in  the  first  quarter  of  calendar  2012,  as  the  US  economy  showed  some  signs  of  recovery  although  it  remains  to    be  seen  if  this  will  be  sustained  into  a  fundamental  improvement  in  macroeconomic  conditions.
Macroeconomic conditions
3i’s  direct  operations  are  in  Europe,  Asia  and  the  Americas.  Our  investment  portfolio  comprises  companies  which  also  have  a  wide  breadth  of  international  diversity.  Consequently,  it  is  not  just  the  economies  of  those  countries  where  we  have  operations  that  are  relevant  to  3i.  An  analysis  of  our  portfolio  composition  at  a  Group  and  business  line  level  is  provided  on  pages  133  to  135.
World  economic  growth  slowed  in  201 1  with  real  GDP  growth  of  3.8%  (2010:  5.2%)  (source:  IMF)  despite  strong  growth    in  Asia,  Latin  America  and  emerging  markets  of  6.2%  (2010:  7 .3%).  China  (9.2%)  and  India  (7 .4%)  remained  strong  drivers  of  world  growth  rates  although  Brazilian  growth  of  2.9%  (2010:  7 .5%)  slowed  as  a  result  of  higher  interest  and  exchange  rates.  However,  growth  in  Europe,  the  US  and  Japanese  economies  was  weak  at  1.6%  in  201 1  (2010:  3.2%).  Within Europe,  some  countries  and,  in  particular,  Germany  (3.0%)  saw  good  growth.  Against  this  backdrop,  currency  volatility  continued  to  be  a  feature  with  the  euro  and  US  dollar  both  fluctuating  by  up    to  10%  within  the  year.  The  euro  weakened  against  sterling    in  the  year  by  4.6%.
The  condition  of  equity  markets  is  important  to  3i  as  they  influence  M&A  activity  and  company  valuations.  The  major  global  stock  markets  of  relevance  to  3i  ended  the  year  broadly  flat.  However,  there  was  a  considerable  degree    of  volatility  within  the  year.  For  example,  the  FTSE  began    and  closed  the  year  to  31  March  2012  at  5,909  and  5,768  respectively.  However,  it  reached  a  high  of  6,083  in  May  201 1  and  a  low  of  4,944  in  October  201 1.
Mergers and acquisition activity
Conditions  in  M&A  markets  influence  the  environment    for  both  investment  and  realisations.  The  level  of  global    M&A  activity  followed  wider  sentiment  with  a  strong  start to calendar  201 1,  followed  by  a  sharp  slowdown  in  the summer  as  wider  macro  concerns  came  to  the  fore.  Global  M&A  activity  in  calendar  year  201 1,  at  42,422  transactions,  was  up  1%  from  2010  (source:  Dealogic).    The  year’s  total  was  driven  by  volume  in  the  first  half  of  22,674  transactions  with  quarterly  volume  dropping  c.25%  by the  fourth  quarter  to  8,563  transactions.  Europe  was  particularly  impacted  by  this  slow  down,  with  fourth  quarter  201 1  M&A  activity  down  47%  on  the  same  period  in  2010,  the lowest  quarterly  total  since  mid  2004.

Infrastructure
Despite  market  and  macro  uncertainty,  a  few  sizeable  infrastructure  transactions  were  completed  during  the  year  in  Europe.  These  included  the  sale  of  electricity  networks  in the  UK  and  in  Germany,  the  public-to-private  acquisition  of Northumbrian  Water  in  the  UK,  as  well  as  the  €1.5 billion  acquisition  of  LNI  in  Finland.  This  activity  was  underpinned    by  the  continued  availability  of  debt  for  strong  infrastructure  businesses  at  relatively  attractive  terms.  Investment  opportunities  in  Europe  are  likely  to  continue    to  emerge  from  a  number  of  sources:  non-core  disposals  from  both  corporates  and  financial  institutions;  policy  drivers,  such  as  the  drive  to  increase  private  investment  in  infrastructure  development;  and  secondary  market  sales.
In  India,  macro  conditions  were  challenging  during  the  year  with  high  inflation,  political  uncertainty  and  a  growing  fiscal  deficit  impacting  the  outlook  for  growth.  Investment  activity,  as  a  result,  was  lower.  However,  economic  growth  and  an  increasingly  urbanised  population  continue  to  drive  demand  for  infrastructure  development.  Debt  Management  Today,  there  are  c.50  European  Collateralised  Loan  Obligation (“CLO”)  managers  with  approximately  €107 billion  of  assets  under  management  (source:  Creditflux).  The  top    ten  managers  by  AUM,  including  3i,  together  manage  c.€63 billion  or  59%  of  CLO  assets.  The  European  CLO  market  continues  to  be  impacted  by  macro  environment  concerns  and  no  new  CLOs  have  been  launched  since  the  market  closed  in  2009.  Although  primary  activity  has  improved  in  Europe,  however,  most  deals  continue  to  be  re-financings  or  secondary/tertiary  buyouts  with  the  net  amount  of  leveraged  loans  in  the  market    still  contracting.
A  stronger  primary  market  will  be  necessary  in  order    to  support  new  CLO  issuance  in  Europe.  In  contrast,  the  securitisation  market  for  new  CLO  issuance  has  re-opened    in  the  US,  with  some  28  deals  launched  in  201 1  with  a  value  of  €12.2 billion  and  a  further  $10.6 billion  launched  in  the    first  four  months  of  2012,  across  24  deals.
Pricing  in  the  European  secondary  loan  market  peaked  in  May  201 1  before  falling  in  the  second  half  of  the  year  and  then  rising  in  the  first  quarter  of  2012.  This  trend  continued  into  the  first  quarter  of  2012,  with  M&A  activity  down  by  26%  on  the  same  period  in  201 1  (source:  Dealogic).  Activity  is  set  to  remain  low,  with  Ernst  &  Young’s  Capital  Confidence  Barometer  in  April  2012  showing  that  only  31%  of  the  1,500  senior  executives  interviewed  would  pursue  an  acquisition  in  the  next  12  months,  down  from  41%  in  October  201 1.
Investment and  
fundraising conditions
Private  Equity
After  a  strong  start  to  the  year,  private  equity  investment    in  calendar  201 1  was  flat  at  $184 billion  (2010:  $184 billion),  with  activity  peaking  in  the  second  quarter  and  then  falling    as  macro  concerns  grew  (source:  Bain  and  Company).    The  final  quarter  of  calendar  201 1  was  the  quietest  quarter  for  new  investments  since  the  first  quarter  of  2010.  Unsurprisingly,  this  was  largely  driven  by  a  slowdown  in  Europe.  In  contrast,  the  Americas  experienced  broadly  stable  activity  levels  through  201 1  and  Asia  saw  modest  growth  in  the  final  quarter  of  201 1.  The  mid-market,  which  3i  targets,  did  not  decline  as  rapidly  as  that  for  larger  deals.
Notwithstanding  the  trend  in  activity  levels,  valuations    for  new  investments  increased  in  201 1  as  the  operating  environment  and  earnings  outlook  began  to  stabilise.    The  average  headline  purchase  price  multiple  in  calendar  201 1  was  8.4x  EBITDA  (earnings  before  interest,  tax,  depreciation  and  amortisation),  (2010:  8.1x)  higher  than  in any year  since  2008  (source:  Ernst  &  Young).  Increased  availability  of  leverage  may  have  been  a  factor  in  this  rise, with  average  debt  multiples  of  5.2x  EBITDA  reported    on  new  deals  in  201 1  (2010:  4.7x).  The  continuing  overhang    of  capital,  as  shown  in  Chart  5  on  page  26,  was  another    possible  influence.
Although  headline  prices  remain  relatively  high,  the  debt  element  continues  to  be  lower  than  seen  in  the  2003–2007  vintages,  with  62%  of  purchase  price  being  funded  by  debt.  Global  data  from  Preqin  indicates  that  the  environment  for  fundraising  remains  challenging.  A  total  of  477  funds  achieved  a  final  close  in  201 1,  raising  $230 billion,  some  6.6%  lower  than  2010  and  well  below  the  peak  of  $625 billion in  2008.
Limited  Partner  investors  continue  to  reduce  the  number    of  managers  they  have  in  their  investment  programmes    and  look  for  new  ways  of  investing  into  the  asset  class.  Accordingly,  a  number  of  managed  account  style  initiatives  were  set  up  in  the  year  for  large  LPs  to  commit  alongside  more  established  fund  structures.  Strategy,  Business  model  and  KPIs

Market environment
Outlook
Although,  in  general,  macroeconomic  sentiment  is  more  positive  at  the  start  of  this  financial  year,  the  IMF  and  others  expect  the  pattern  of  lower  growth  that  we  have  seen  since  the  credit  crisis  in  2008  to  persist  and  for  a  degree  of  fragility  to  remain.  The  recent  political  changes  in  Europe  and  increased  uncertainty  on  economic  policy  has  increased  the likelihood  of  further  market  volatility.  In  this  environment,  activity  in  3i’s  main  markets  is  likely  to  continue  to  be  subdued  but  be  subject  to  short-term  fluctuations.  Realisation conditions
Following  increased  momentum  in  2010,  private  equity  exit  activity  was  stronger  in  calendar  201 1,  especially  in  the  first  half.  Sales  to strategic  buyers  remain  the  key  exit  route,  with  secondary  sales  to  other  financial  sponsors  remaining  low  compared  to the  2003-2007  period.
The  IPO  market  provided  a  good  exit  window  for  private  equity  in  the  first  half  of  201 1,  with  70  companies  raising  $31.4 billion  through  IPO.  The  second  half  activity  was  much  lower,  some  77%  below  the  first  half  and  at  the  lowest  value  since  2009.  In  the  growing  markets  of  China,  India  and  South  America,  exit  activity  was  slow.  In  China,  the  depth  of  capital  markets  meant  that  IPO  remained  the  primary  exit  route  while,  outside  China,  strategic  sales  remain  more  important.

The  Group  maintained  its  selective  approach  to  investment,  with  a  total  of  £374 million  invested  in  nine  (201 1:  nine)  new portfolio  companies  in  the  year  to  31  March  2012  (201 1: £308 million),  which  are  detailed  in  Table  7 .  There  was  a  marked  slow  down  in  investment  activity  in  the  second  half of  the  year,  primarily  as  a  result  of  economic  uncertainty  surrounding  the  euro  crisis  and  a  general  slow  down  in  M&A activity.  The  Private  Equity  business  line  completed  seven  new  investments  in  the  year  to  31  March  2012  (201 1:  six),    investing  £345 million  (201 1:  £270 million).
The  Infrastructure  business  line  invested  £70 million  in  the  year,  with  £33 million  resulting  from  the  Group  exercising  3i Infrastructure  plc  warrants,  which  were  issued  at  IPO    in  2007 .  The new  investment  in  LNI  of  £28 million  was  made  alongside  a  £195 million  investment  by  3i  Infrastructure  plc.  The  Group  also  invested  a  further  £8 million  into  GVK,  through  its  commitment  to  the  3i  India  Infrastructure  Fund.
The  Debt  Management  business  line  launched  a  Credit  Opportunities  Fund,  Palace  Street  I,  in  August  201 1  and  at    31  March  2012  had  invested  €43 million  of  the  €50 million  Group  commitment  to  the  Fund.
The  non-cash  element  of  investment  relates  to  capitalised  interest  earned  mainly  on  shareholder  loans  and  PIK  notes  in the  Private  Equity  business  line.  This  amounted  to  £163 million  in  the  year  to  31  March  2012  (201 1:  £158 million).  Total  investment  was  £646 million  in  the  year  to  31 March  2012  (201 1:  £719 million).

Realisations 
Proceeds  from  the  sale  of  investments  in  the  year  to  31 March  2012  totalled  £771 million  (201 1:  £609 million)  were  achieved  at  a  lower  uplift  over  opening  value  of  3%  than  previous  years  (201 1:  26%).  This  was  driven  by  the  majority  of  these  assets  being  valued  on  an  imminent  sales  basis  at  the  beginning  of  the  year,  with  proceeds  therefore  being  received  at  close  to  opening  value.  The  aggregate  money  multiple  for  the  ten  largest  realisations  in  the  year  was  2.9x.
The  Developed  Markets  Private  Equity  business  accounted  for  the  majority  of  exits  in  the  year  to  31  March  2012.    Key  realisations  included  £197 million  for  MWM,  £180 million  for  Hyva,  £139 million  for  Ålö  Intressenter  and  £77 million    for  the  partial  realisation  of  NORMA.  A  consistent  theme  in  these  industrial  businesses  was  the  international  element    in  their  value  growth  through  both  sales  generation    and  sourcing.
Developing  Markets  Private  Equity  received  a  loan  repayment  from  Joyon  (£8 million)  and  a  partial  realisation  from  UFO  Moviez  (£7 million).  The  Non-core  portfolio  continues  to  be  reduced,  with  proceeds  of  £14 million  received  in  the  year  to  31  March  2012  (201 1:  £91 million),  leaving  a  remaining  portfolio  of  £103 million  at  31  March  2012.  Realisations  from  sales  to  trade  buyers  at  £291 million    (201 1:  £156 million)  and  secondary  investors  at  £349 million  (201 1:  £104 million)  reflected  the  increase  in  M&A  market  activity  in  the  first  half  of  the  year.

Overview Business  review Business lines: Private  Equity
3i’s  Private  Equity  business  operates  on  an  international  basis  across  Europe,  Asia  and  the  Americas.  It  is  managed  operationally  on  a  regional  basis  with  Developed  Markets  Private  Equity,  covering  Europe  and  North  America,  and Developing  Markets  Private  Equity  covering  Asia  and South  America.  At  31  March  2012,  the  Private  Equity    portfolio  consisted  of  90  companies,  with  operations  in    over  70  different  countries.  The  direct  value  of  this  portfolio  at  31  March  2012  was  £2.5 billion  and  it  accounted  for    £5.3 billion  of  assets  under  management.
In  recent  years,  the  business  has  invested  through  funds  containing  third-party  capital,  alongside  which  3i  co-invests  its  own  balance  sheet  capital.  Eurofund  V  for  buyouts  has  largely  invested  in  the  European  market.  The  Growth  Capital  Fund,  for  minority  situations,  has  invested  in  Europe,  Asia  and  North  America.  In  2010,  the  decision  was  taken  to  merge  the  Buyouts  and  Growth  Capital  businesses  to  form  a  single  Private  Equity  business  line,  managed  on  a  regional  basis.  This  new  organisational  structure  facilitates  greater  collaboration  across  3i’s  international  office  network.  It  also  delivers  an  enhanced  origination  capability  and  encourages  greater  emphasis  on  Active  Partnership,  sector  and  Business  Leaders  Network  activities.  Significant  progress  has  been  made  on  merging  the  businesses  operationally,  at  the  same  time  as  ensuring  that  investment  and  portfolio  decision  making  continued  to  be  managed  in  line  with  the  existing  fund  mandates.
During  the  financial  year,  3i  extended  the  reach  of  the    Private  Equity  business  to  Brazil.  Initially,  investments  in Brazil  will  be  made  fully  from  the  3i  balance  sheet,  with the medium-term  aim  of  raising  a  separate  fund  for investment  in  this  region.
Business model
3i’s  Private  Equity  business  is  focused  on  investing  in  mid-market  buyout  and  growth  capital  transactions.
The  investment  strategy  for  the  business  is  built  around  the  following  core  components:
 n identifying  and  investing  in  leading  mid-market  businesses  where  significant  value  can  be  created;
 n utilising  3i’s  local  knowledge,  range  of  Business  Leaders  Network  contacts,  sector  expertise  and  investment  disciplines  to  select  attractive  assets,  purchase  them  at the  right  price  and  then  finance  them  appropriately;
 n building  these  businesses  through  organic  growth,  international  expansion  and  acquisitions,  as  well  as  optimising  their  operations  in  partnership  with  top  class  management  teams;   n maximising  value  through  timely  and  well-executed  exit  strategies;  and   n generating  management  fees  and  carried  interest  from  external  funds,  which  are  managed  alongside  3i’s  own  balance  sheet  commitments.  Case  study  Hilite
Eurofund  V  invested  €190 million  (3i  balance  sheet  proportion:  £94 million)  in  May  2011  to  support  the  buyout  of  Hilite  and  to  accelerate  the  international  growth  of  the  business.  We  gained  access  to  this  investment  through  our  local  presence  in  Germany  and  the  US  and  our  strong  reputation  and  network    in  the  sector  through  investments  such  as  NORMA  and  Hyva.  The  investment  case  was  predicated  upon    the  opportunity  for  market  growth  and  the    potential  for  performance  improvement.  Hilite  operates  in  a  high  growth  segment  of  the  global  automotive  market  –  the  manufacturing  of  hydraulic    actuators  and  timing  systems,  which  improve  fuel  consumption  and  reduce  emissions.  The  company’s  products  are  used  by  the  world’s  major  automotive  manufacturers  in  the  engines,  transmissions  and  exhaust  systems  of  passenger  and  commercial  vehicles.  Hilite’s  technological  expertise  and  differentiated  product  offering  are  enabling  it  to  benefit  from  the  global  demand  for  increased  fuel  efficiency  and  emissions  reduction.  Revenues  for  calendar  year  2011  were  up  21%  to  approximately  €370 million.
Based  in  Marktheidenfeld,  Germany,  Hilite  also  has  production  facilities  in  the  US  and,  in  November  2011,  opened  a  new  plant  in  China.  Since  investment,  a  new  Chief  Executive  Officer,  Chief  Financial  Officer  and  Chief  Operating  Officer  have  been  appointed.  In  addition,  a  number  of    Active  Partnership  initiatives  have  also  helped    to  identify  potential  operational  improvements.    In  April  2012,  the  company  reached  agreement    with  Cummins  to  sell  its  emissions  control  business, delivering  an  effective  multiple  of  2.1x  the proportionate  entry  price  for  this  part  of  the business.  30 3i Group plc  Annual   report  and  accounts  2012 The  investment  process  is  structured  as  a  series  of    carefully  planned  stages.  The  early  stages  consist  of    filtering  investment  opportunities  to  create  a  pool  of  high  potential  opportunities,  which  capitalise  on  3i’s  strengths  both  to  win  the  investment  and  to  add  value  once  invested.    During  the  year,  93  new  opportunities  passed  these    early  filter  stages  and  were  formally  considered  as    work  in  progress.  During  the  work  in  progress  stage,    the  investment  case  is  then  built  and  validated  rigorously,    the  deal  structure  is  optimised,  negotiations  over  detailed  terms  take  place  and  3i’s  competitive  position  and  tactics    are  determined.  Investment  teams  working  on  each  opportunity  are  typically  drawn  from  across  our  business,  based  on  experience    and  sector  knowledge.  All  investments  are  subject  to  both  partner  review  and  final  Investment  Committee  processes.  Of  the  27  investment  opportunities  considered  for  partner  review  during  the  year,  five  were  completed  as  investments  and  an  additional  two  were  signed  and  are  due  for  completion  in  the  next  financial  year.  Two  investments  completed  in  the  year,  GO  Outdoors  and  World  Freight,    were  considered  in  the  prior  year.
Case  study  Mold-Masters
Mold-Masters  is  a  leading  manufacturer  of  melt  delivery  and  control  systems  for  the  plastics  industry. From  its  manufacturing  facilities  in  Canada, China,  Germany,  India  and  Brazil,  it  serves    a  diverse  and  global  customer  base  across  high  growth  end  markets. These  include  consumer  electronics,  medical  devices,  personal  care  consumer  products,  telecommunications,  packaging  and  automotive.
3i  invested  in  Mold-Masters  in  August  2007  to  accelerate  organic  growth  in  Asia,  Eastern  Europe  and  Latin  America,  and  to  support  acquisitions.
Since  investing,  we  have  leveraged  our  global  Business  Leaders  Network  to  build  the  board    and  executive  team.  We  have  also  supported    the  company  through  a  range  of  performance  improvements,  including  sales  force  effectiveness,  global  manufacturing  footprint  optimisation,    new  product  introductions,  upgraded  financial  management  and  controls  and  a  de-leveraging    in  2009.
Mold-Masters’  revenue  and  earnings  for  the  year    to  31  December  2011  were  up  23%  and  21%,  respectively,  repeating  the  20%+  growth  for  the  previous  year. Much  of  this  was  achieved  through  expanding  international  sales,  with  core  revenue  up 20%  in  Europe  and  34%  in  Asia  in  2011.
Long-term performance
From  the  Buyouts  and  Growth  Capital  investments  completed  since  2001,  there  have  been  1 13  realisations  to date.  These  have  generated  a  realised  money  multiple  of  2.1x  (£5.6 billion  of  cash  returned)  and  a  realised  IRR  of  46%.  These  numbers  include  realised  losses  in  the  period,  as  well  as  successful  realisations.  As  can  be  seen  from  Chart  6,  earnings  growth  was  the  largest  contributor  to  value  creation  for  these  realised  investments  (60%).  Enhanced  multiples  on  exit  from  an  improved  strategic  position  and  growth  prospects,  as  well    as  market  movements  (30%),  was  the  next  most  significant  factor.  Optimising  the  financial  structure  provided  a  further  enhancement  (10%).

Business lines: Private  Equity
The  10-year  track  record  of  the  Private  Equity  business  remains  positive,  with  strong  performance  in  the  2003–2006  vintages,  and  encouraging  early  performance  from  the  201 1–2012  vintages.  The  2007–2010  vintages  have  performed  poorly  to  date,  reflecting  the  higher  multiples  that  were  originally  paid  for  these  vintages  and  a  higher  level  of  realised  losses  than  seen  in  other  vintage  years.  We  have  continued  to  present  the  long-term  performance  as  Buyouts  and  Growth  Capital,  reflecting  the  basis  on  which  the  vintages  were  managed  in  recent  periods.
32 3i Group plc  Annual   report  and  accounts  2012 The  repayment  profile  of  the  debt  in  the  portfolio  is  shown    in  Chart  9.  A  number  of  refinancings  were  successfully  closed  in  the  year,  as  a  number  of  portfolio  companies  extended  their  existing  facilities  or  took  advantage  of  a    period  of  relatively  positive  credit  markets  over  the  first    half  of  the  year  to  issue  high  yield  bonds.  These  refinancings,  combined  with  the  leverage  profile  included  on  new  investments,  extended  the  overall  repayment  profile  of  the  portfolio.  Over  65%  is  due  for  repayment  in  2015  or  later  (201 1:  59%).  A  relatively  small  number  of  companies  drive  the  2014  repayment  level    shown  in  Chart  9,  and  plans  are  underway  to  either  refinance or  exit  these  investments.

Performance for the year 
The  Private  Equity  business  invested  in  seven  new  investments  in  the  year,  and  delivered  a  number  of  good  realisations  with  the  largest  10  realising  an  average  of 2.9x return  over  invested  cost  (Table  1 1  on  page  29).  Overall,  gross  portfolio  return  at  £(339) million  represented  a 10%  loss  on  the  opening  portfolio  value.  Within  the  total  portfolio  return  for  the  year,  the  two  most  recent  vintages  (March  201 1  and  2012)  performed  well,  delivering  a  14%  gross  portfolio  return.
The  following  section  provides  further  details  on  the  overall  Private  Equity  portfolio,  including  details  on  earnings  and  leverage.  The  performance  of  the  Private  Equity  business    is  then  broken  down  into  Developed  Markets  Private  Equity  and  Developing  Markets  Private  Equity,  the  basis  on  which    it  is  currently  managed.
Despite  challenging  conditions  in  many  sectors,  overall  the  portfolio  grew  its  earnings  on  a  value  weighted  basis  by  9%  in  calendar  year  201 1.  Chart  7  below  shows  the  growth  rates  for  earnings  across  the  portfolio  for  the  year  to  31  December  201 1,  weighted  by  carrying  values  at  31  March  2012.
In  the  year  to  31  March  2012,  80%  of  the  portfolio  by  value  grew  its  earnings,  with  42%  growing  at  more  than  10%  year-on-year.  Investments  in  the  two  most  recent  vintages  saw  strong  earnings  growth  at  20%  on  a  value  weighted  basis.  Of  the  20%  of  the  portfolio  by  value  where  earnings  were  lower,  a  large  proportion  were  in  Spain,  reflecting  market  conditions.
Leverage  levels  in  the  portfolio  at  31  March  2012  remained  similar  to  the  previous  year,  with  net  debt/EBITDA  of  3.4x  (201 1:  3.3x).  Chart  8  shows  leverage  levels  across  the  Private  Equity  portfolio  on  a  value  weighted  basis.  Leverage  levels  in the  majority  of  the  portfolio  on  this  basis  are  below  4x  EBITDA,  with  36%  below  2x.

Returns  from  investments  are  achieved  through  a  mix    of  capital  realisations  upon  exit  and  returns  of  capital    and  portfolio  income  during  the  life  of  the  investment.  Returns  to  3i  Group  are  enhanced  through  management    fees  and  carried  interest  from  external  funds,  which  we  manage  alongside  3i’s  own  balance  sheet  commitments.
Gross  portfolio  return
The  gross  portfolio  return  in  the  year  to  31  March  2012    for  Developed  Markets  Private  Equity  was  £(263) million  (201 1:  £41 1 million),  representing  a  loss  on  opening  portfolio  value  of  (8.9)%  (201 1:  16.7%).  Net  realised  profits  over  opening  book  value  of  £16 million  (201 1:  £61 million)  were  lower  due    to  the  higher  proportion  of  investments  held  on  an  imminent  sale  basis  at  the  beginning  of  the  year.  Net  realised  profits  comprised  profits  of  £50 million,  offset  by  losses  of    £34 million.  The  losses  related  primarily  to  Radius,    which  accounted  for  £32 million  of  the  total.
Portfolio  income  of  £126 million  (201 1:  £121 million)  includes  dividends  received  of  £26 million.  There  was  an  unrealised  loss  of  £(405) million  for  the  year  to  31  March  2012  (201 1:  £229 million).  Further  details  are  included  in  the  Portfolio  valuations  section.
While  UK  and  US  stock  markets  had  largely  recovered  to their  March  201 1  levels  by  the  year  end,  European  benchmarks  remained  down  in  the  year  to 31 March  2012.  A proxy  market  constructed  to  be  representative  of  the    3i  portfolio  was  down  4%  in  the  year.  Portfolio  earnings
Earnings,  weighted  by  3i  carrying  value  as  at  31  March  2012,  increased  in  the  year  by  8%.  This  performance  was  driven  primarily  by  the  investments  made  since  the  3i  Group  rights  issue  in  June  2009,  which  accounts  for  32%  of  the  portfolio.  These  companies  demonstrated  earnings  growth  in  the  year  of  17%  on  a  value  weighted  basis  in  calendar  201 1.  Investments  made  in  the  2006  to  2008  vintages  (52%  of    the  portfolio)  delivered  a  lower  value  weighted  earnings  performance  at  6%,  albeit  there  were  some  strong  performers  within  this  group,  for  example,  Mold-Masters,  AES  and  Lekolar.  Underperformance  was  driven  by  continued  pressure  on  top  line  revenues  and  margins,  particularly  for  those  companies  operating  in  the  most  challenged  economic  environments  in  Europe.  Strategy,  Business  model  and  KPIs

Priorities for the year ahead
Given  the  uncertain  market  environment,  particularly    in  Europe,  the  priority  remains  to  ensure  that  portfolio  earnings  are  robust  and  grow,  and  that  we  continue    to  improve  the  strategic  positions  of  these  businesses.    In  some  cases,  this  will  include  making  further  acquisitions.  The  team’s  core  focus  is  to  deliver  strong  returns,  in  the  medium  to  longer  term,  over  current  book  value.  Where  appropriate,  portfolio  companies  will  be  realised  where  our value  creation  plan  has  been  delivered  to  drive  returns  for  shareholders  and  investors.  We  will  look  to  invest  selectively  in  attractive  new  opportunities,  in  line  with  our  investment  strategy  and  fund  mandates,  building  an  attractive  and  increasingly  diversified  portfolio  that  is  well  positioned  to  deliver  value  growth.
Portfolio  leverage
Average  debt  levels  in  the  Developed  Markets  Private  Equity  portfolio  have  remained  stable  in  the  year  at  3.5x  (201 1:  3.5x).  Three  assets,  with  a  total  value  of  £nil  at  the  beginning  of    the  year,  were  in  breach  of  their  covenants  at  31  March  2012  (201 1:  6,  2010:  7 ,  2009:  16).  Where  covenants  are  in  breach,    3i  works  hard  with  the  companies’  lenders  to  reach  an  adequate  solution  for  all  parties  involved.  Covenant  positions  are  monitored  actively  by  our  in-house  banking  advisory  team,  who  work  closely  with  the  wider  investment  team  and  portfolio  companies  to  mitigate  and  manage  potentially  challenging  situations.  This  involves  working  with  the  small  remaining  number  of  companies    in  our  portfolio  that  are  highly  leveraged,  helping  them  to  de-gear,  not  only  by  strengthening  the  balance  sheet  but    also  by  driving  operational  improvements.
Portfolio  valuations
The  unrealised  value  reduction  of  £(405) million  (201 1:    £229 million  increase)  in  the  year  comprised  £181 million  (201 1:  £619 million)  of  positive  value  movements,  net  of    value  reductions  of  £(586) million  (201 1:  £(390) million).    The  largest  value  reductions  were  primarily  in  southern  Europe,  due  to  the  continued  economic  challenges  facing  companies  in  those  regions.
At  31  March  2012,  88%  (201 1:  72%)  of  the  Developed  Markets  portfolio  was  valued  on  an  earnings  basis.  The  average  multiple  used  in  the  valuation  of  companies  valued  on  an  earnings  basis  was  8%  lower  than  in  the  previous  year.    The  weighted  average  EBITDA  multiple  pre-marketability  discount  was  8.1x  (201 1:  8.8x)  and  post  discount  7 .5x    (201 1:  8.1x).
Three  of  the  largest  positive  valuations  movements,    Action  (£35 million);  Element  (£28 million);  and  Hilite    (£22 million),  were  from  the  201 1  and  2012  vintages.    The  largest  reductions  in  value  were  in  the  Spanish  portfolio  (GES  £(83) million  and  Memora  £(45) million).  The  valuation    in  GES  was  reduced  to  nil  at  31  March  2012  due  to  its  performance  outlook.  This  value  movement  is  included  within  provisions  for  the  year.  The  Memora  reduction  in    value  relates  to  the  selection  of  a  lower  valuation  multiple,  reflecting  the  challenging  market  outlook  in  Spain.
Net  portfolio  return
Net  portfolio  return  includes  the  impact  of  operating  expenses,  which  fell  by  18%  in  the  year  to  31  March  2012.  These  expenses  are  expected  to  fall  further  as  a  number    of  operational  efficiencies,  introduced  in  the  year,  begin    to  deliver  significant  cost  savings  and  the  full  effect  of  redundancies  is  recognised.  The  net  portfolio  return  for  the  year  to  31  March  2012  was  £(339) million  (201 1:  £293 million).

Developing Markets 
Portfolio
As  can  be  seen  from  the  charts  below,  the  Developing  Markets  Private  Equity  portfolio  at  31  March  2012,  is  spread  across  our  three  regions  in  Asia.  The  launch  in  Brazil  during  the  year  resulted  in  our  first  investment  in  the  region  being  signed  in  December.  This  $55 million  investment,  in  Blue  Interactive  Group,  is  due  to  be  completed  shortly.  The  portfolio  is  well  diversified  by  sector,  with  a  weighting  towards  Business  and  Financial  Services.  Portfolio  value  is weighted  towards  the  post-2006  vintages.  The  value  of  the  17  investments  in  the  portfolio  at  31  March  2012  was  £354 million  (201 1:  17 ,  £442 million).

Gross  portfolio  return
The  Developing  Markets  Private  Equity  gross  portfolio    return,  a  loss  of  £76 million  (201 1:  £51 million  profit),  was  substantially  driven  by  an  unrealised  value  reduction  of  £76 million  (201 1:  £48 million  increase).
A  number  of  the  portfolio  companies  performed  well  in the year.  However,  the  South  East  Asia  region  had  a challenging  year  with  the  value  reduction  in  ACR,  an  Asian reinsurance  business,  accounting  for  a  significant  proportion  of  the  unrealised  loss  for  the  Developing  Markets Private  Equity  business.  Realised  profits,  and  portfolio  income  from  the  Developing Markets  Private  Equity  portfolio  were  £1 million (201 1:  £1 million)  and  a  £1 million  charge  (201 1: £2 million)  respectively.
Portfolio  earnings
Excluding  ACR,  which  is  not  valued  on  an  earnings  basis,  earnings  weighted  by  3i  carrying  value  as  at  31  March  2012  increased  in  the  year  by  28%.
We  have  seen  good  earnings  growth  in  our  Chinese  and  Indian  portfolios,  with  earnings  growth  of  30%  and  36%  respectively  on  a  value  weighted  basis.  Within  these  portfolios,  we  have  seen  strong  growth  in  companies  in  the  Business  Services  and  Industrials  sectors.  We  believe  that,  as  well  as  delivering  earnings  performance,  these  assets  are  also  building  strategic  value  which  will  benefit  their  ultimate  exit  multiples.  The  South  East  Asian  portfolio  had  a  difficult  year,  with  challenging  market  conditions.  ACR  faced  an  unprecedented  year  in  terms  of  natural  catastrophes  in  Asia.  Three  of  the  10 largest  insured  losses  of  all  time  were  recorded  in  Asia  in  201 1  and  the  Thai  floods  were  particularly  costly.  However,  because  of  the  strength  of  the  business  and  its  differentiated  position  within  its  market,  it  was  able  to  secure  an  attractive  quota  sharing  arrangement  with  Berkshire  Hathaway  and,  post  year  end,  the  Japanese  trading  group,  Marubeni,  agreed  to  make  a  substantial  investment  in  the  business.  AM  Best  and  S&P  have  confirmed  ACR’s  A-  rating  and  initial  trading  in the  first  months  of  2012  has  been  in  line  with  budget,  with  both  investment  and  underwriting  profits  being  delivered.  The  net  effect  of  these  events  was  a  reduction  of  £29 million  in  the  value  of  ACR  in  the  period.
Portfolio  leverage
In  line  with  our  strategy  for  investing  in  developing  markets,  leverage  within  the  portfolio  is  low.  There  were  two  covenant  breaches  in  portfolio  companies  valued  at  nil  at  31  March  201 1  and  31 March  2012.
38 3i Group plc  Annual   report  and  accounts  2012 Portfolio  valuations
The  value  reduction  of  £(76) million  in  the  year  (201 1:  £48 million  increase),  comprised  £20 million  (201 1:  £85 million)  of  positive  value  movements,  net  of  value  reductions  of  £96 million  (201 1:  £37 million),  including  ACR at £29 million.
At  31  March  2012,  37%  (201 1:  29%)  of  the  Developing  Markets  portfolio  was  valued  on  an  earnings  basis;  6%  (201 1:  9%)    on  a  DCF  basis;  and  the  remainder,  57%  (201 1:  62%),  on    other  valuation  bases  such  as  industry  metrics  or  sum  of constituent  parts  (where  different  divisions  are  valued  on a different  basis).  The  average  EBITDA  multiple  used,  before  applying  a  marketability  discount,  on  those  companies  valued  on  an  earnings  basis  using  EBITDA  at  the  start  and  end  of  the  year,  fell  4%  from  9.9x  to  9.5x.  The  largest  value  movements  in  the  year  related  to  assets  valued  on  industry  metrics,  or  sum  of  the  parts  methodologies,  notably,  ACR.
Net  portfolio  return
A  net  portfolio  return  of  (22)%  (201 1:  7%)  reflects  the  unrealised  losses  mentioned  above.  Costs  increased  in    the  year  due  to  the  expansion  of  the  business  into  Brazil.    Net  carried  interest  income  reflects  the  reversal  of  carried  interest  liabilities  from  prior  years,  following  the  reduction  in value  of  a  number  of  assets.
Priorities for the year ahead
We  have  strengthened  our  teams  in  Asia  and  will  maintain  our  focus  on  actively  managing  the  current  portfolio.
In  Brazil,  a  team  was  established  in  São  Paulo  and  an  Advisory  Board  was  formed.  Having  developed  its  market  approach,  the  team  will  help  to  develop  3i’s  presence  in  the  growing  Brazilian  private  equity  market.  It  will  do  this  by  making  investments  and  by  supporting  portfolio  companies  elsewhere  in  the  world  with  the  development  of  their  business  in  the  region.  They  have  signed  their  first  deal  for    $55 million,  in  Blue  Interactive,  a  cable  television  provider,      which  is  expected  to  complete  shortly.
Case  study  BVG
Established  in  1997,  BVG  is  now  one  of  India’s    largest  facilities  management  services  companies.  The  company  provides  a  wide  range  of  services,  including  mechanised  housekeeping,  landscaping  and  gardening,  logistics  and  transportation  and  electrical  and  mechanical  services.  Leveraging  our  credentials  in  the  Business  Services  sector  and  local  market  access,  3i  invested    £21 million  in  BVG  in  January  2011  in  a  proprietary  transaction  originated  by  its  Indian  team.
BVG  has  over  300  clients  in  India,  across  a  range  of  industrial  and  service  sectors.  These  include  some  of  the  world’s  largest  international  companies,  as  well  as  leading  public  sector  entities  such  as  the  Indian  Parliament  and  the  Indian  Railways.
The  investment  case  was  predicated  upon  backing  a market  leader  in  a  high  growth  market  with  the  opportunity  to  leverage  3i’s  experience  in  similar  businesses  in  other  parts  of  the  world  to  create  value.  The  low  level  of  outsourcing  in  India  has  enabled  BVG  to  grow  EBITDA  and  profit  after  tax    at  a  compound  annual  growth  rate  of  over  40%  in    the  three  years  prior  to  3i’s  investment.  This  trend  has  continued  since  3i  invested.  3i  has  worked  closely  with  the  company  to  strengthen  its  financial  reporting  and  controls.    We  are  also  supporting  the  management  on  a  series  of  initiatives,  including  strengthening  systems  and  processes,  improving  working  capital  management  and  strengthening  the  sales  team.

39 3i Group plc  Annual   report  and  accounts  2012
Overview Business  review The  Infrastructure  business  line  currently  invests  principally  in  Europe  and  in  India  through  two  investment  vehicles.
 n 3i  Infrastructure  plc  (“3iN”),  an  infrastructure  investment  company  listed  in  London  (in  which  3i  owns  a  34%  stake);
 n the  3i  India  Infrastructure  Fund  (the  “India  Fund”),  a limited partnership  fund  focused  on  investing  in  Indian infrastructure  (to  which  3i  and  3iN  committed  $250 million  each).
Returns  for  3i  from  the  Infrastructure  business  line  are  generated  from:
 n dividend  income  and  capital  growth  from  its  34%  holding in 3iN;
 n capital  returns  from  its  investment  in  the  3i  India  Infrastructure  Fund;  and
 n advisory  and  management  fees  from  the  two  vehicles.
Business model
The  Infrastructure  investment  team  seeks  to  create  value  for 3iN  and  the  India  Fund  through  a  three-step  process:
1. Rigorous approach to investment
It  originates  new  investment  opportunities  by  building  proprietary  knowledge  and  networks  in target  sectors  and  geographies  and  applies  rigorous  selection  criteria  to  choose  the  best  investments.
2. Best-in-class portfolio management
Following  investment,  it  engages  with  the  management  teams  of  portfolio  companies  to  deliver  improvements  in operational  and  financial  performance  and  to  monitor  performance  to  ensure  that  any  issues  are  identified  quickly.  3iN  and  the  India  Fund  are  represented  on  the  boards  of  their  equity  investments.
3. Focus on long-term value creation
The  team  focuses  on  creating  and  maintaining  value  over the long  term  by  supporting  and  encouraging  the  management  teams  of  portfolio  companies  to  devise  and  implement  business  strategies  that  deliver  value  accretion  over  the  longer  term.  This  requires  an  in-depth  knowledge  of market  and  sector  dynamics,  as  well  as  an  understanding  of  the  long-term  value  drivers  for  each  of  the  businesses.
The  investments  made  by  the  team  are  categorised  as  shown in  the  diagram  below.  As  shown  in  the  diagram,  returns  available  from  investments  targeted  by  the  infrastructure  team  typically  range  from  8%  to  15%  or  greater,  depending  on  the  risks  associated  with  the  investment.  Yields generated  from  the  investments  also  vary,  depending,  among other  factors,  on  the  stage  of  development  of  the  businesses  (eg in construction  versus  mature).
3iN  aims  to  deliver  a  12%  net  return  per  annum  when    fully  invested,  of  which  5%  is  delivered  to  shareholders  through  dividends.  It  has  exposure  across  the  spectrum    but,  in  line  with  its  objectives,  has  a  strong  focus  on    core  infrastructure  (which  would  include  businesses  in the regulated  utilities  and transportation  sectors  in  the developed  world),  with  some  investments  in  social  infrastructure  (eg  hospitals  and  schools  procured  through  PFI/PPP-type  schemes)  and  in hybrid  infrastructure    through  its  commitment  to  the  India Fund  (described  in more detail  below).
The  investments  made  by  the  India  Fund  can  be  categorised  as  hybrid  infrastructure:  these  tend  to  have  higher  market  or geopolitical  risk.  Accordingly,  the  India  Fund’s  return  objectives  are  higher.

Transaction structure
Lakeside  Network  Investments  (“LNI”)  was  purchased  from  Vattenfall  AB  in  January  2012,    for  an  enterprise  value  of  approximately  €1.54 billion.    It  holds  100%  of  two  companies:  LNI  Verkko  Oy    (“LNI  Verkko”),  and  LNI  Lämpö  Oy  (“LNI  Lämpö”).  LNI  was  acquired  by  a  consortium  comprising:
–   3i  Infrastructure  plc  (39%  share)  and  3i  (6%  share)
–   GS  Infrastructure  Partners  (45%  share)
–   Ilmarinen  Mutual  Pension  Insurance  Company  (10%  share)
The businesses
LNI  Verkko  (~85%  of  value)  is  the  second-largest  electricity  distribution  business  in  Finland,  with  a  12%  market  share,  and  serves  400,000  customers  in South  West  Finland.  The  business  is  regulated  on a  four-year  cycle,  delivering  a  set  return  on  its  Regulated  Asset  Base.
LNI  Lämpö  (~15%  of  value)  operates  17  local  district  heating  networks,  with  strong  market  positions    in  their  areas.  District  heating,  which  involves  the  pumping  of  hot  water  for  heating  and  general  purposes  directly  into  homes  from  central  hubs,    is  not  regulated  in  Finland.
Investment case
1.  Stable and transparent regulatory 
environment for LNI Verkko
The  new  regulatory  period  began  in  January    2012,  providing  clarity  over  the  medium  term.    The  framework  encourages  investment,  providing  opportunities  for  value-accretive  growth,  as  well    as  network  development  and  innovation.  2.  Profitable, with inflation linkage and 
attractive yield
LNI  generates  high  EBITDA  margins,  supporting  a  strong  yield  over  the  long  term.  Returns  from  LNI  Verkko  are  linked  to  inflation,  and  LNI  Lämpö  has  generally  been  able  to  increase  its  charges  at  least  in  line  with  inflation.  3.  Attractive market, with opportunities for growth
Finland  is  among  the  largest  per  capita  electricity  consumers  in  Europe,  with  demand  expected  to  grow  steadily.  LNI  Verkko  may  be  able  to  leverage  its operational  efficiencies  and  technical  superiority  to  create  consolidation  opportunities  in  its  market.

The  infrastructure  business  line  generated  a  gross  portfolio return  of  £1 1 million  in  the  year  to  31  March  2012  (201 1: £45 million).  This  was  driven  by  portfolio  income  of £18 million  (201 1:  £16 million)  and  an  unrealised  value  loss of £7 million  (201 1:  £29 million  gain),  as  the  unrealised  value  gain  of  £22 million  from  the  Group’s  holding  in  3iN  (201 1:  £21 million)  was  more  than  offset  by  an  unrealised  value  loss of  £30 million  from  the  holding  in  the  3i  India  Infrastructure  Fund  (201 1:  £8 million  gain).  During  the  year  to  31  March  2012,  3iN  shares  appreciated  by 6.2%  (against  a  decline  of  2.1%  for  the  FTSE  All-Share),  supported  by  the  continued  robust  operational  performance  and  income  generation  from  the  underlying  European  portfolio.
The  valuation  of  the  Group’s  holding  in  the  India  Fund  was  impacted  by  a  mark-to-market  reduction  in  the  valuation  of  Adani  Power,  the  India  Fund’s  largest  investment,  as  well  as  by  foreign  exchange  losses.  Shares  in  Adani  Power  declined  by  39%  in  the  year  to  31  March  2012  (201 1: (2.8)%).  In addition,  the  US  dollar  appreciated  by  14%  against  the  Indian  rupee  in the  year,  resulting  in  foreign  exchange  losses  for  the  US  dollar  denominated  India  Fund,  whose  exposure  to  the  Indian  rupee  is  unhedged.  The  investments  in  the  India  Fund  continue  to  make  good  operational  progress,  with  steady  advances  in  the  build-out  of  their  facilities.
Portfolio  income  grew  year-on-year,  principally  as  a  result  of the  increase  in  the  3iN  dividend.  In  addition,  the  Group’s  exercise  of  3iN  warrants  in  June  201 1  resulted  in  a    £32.5 million  increase  in  its  holding  of  3iN  shares,  all  of    which  received  3iN’s  dividend  payments.
Fees  receivable  from  3iN  and  the  3i  India  Infrastructure  Fund  amounted  to  £25 million  (201 1:  £25 million).  Fees  remained  flat  in  the  year,  as  the  increase  in  the  advisory  fee  from  3iN,  following  the  growth  in  its  portfolio,  was  offset  by  the  fact  that  no  performance  fees  were  receivable  from  3iN  for  the  year  (201 1:  £3 million).
Priorities for the year ahead
We  will  continue  to  strengthen  our  position  as  a  leading  participant  in  the  infrastructure  market  through  the  ongoing  investment  of  our  advised  and  managed  vehicles  in  a  portfolio  of  strong  businesses,  which  can  continue  to  generate  attractive  returns  for  shareholders  and    limited  partners.
We  will  maintain  a  rigorous  investment  approach,  using  our  proprietary  sector  knowledge  and  our  broad  network  of  contacts  in  our  chosen  sectors  and  geographies  to  originate  transactions  that  contribute  to  the  delivery  of  the  target  return  objectives.  This  will  be  key  to  positioning  the  business  line  and  3iN  for  future  fundraisings.
Seeking  to  generate  attractive  returns  from  the  existing  portfolio  will  also  remain  a  priority  for  the  Infrastructure  team.  The  businesses  in  the  two  vehicles  are  performing  well.  The  team’s  portfolio  management  expertise,  as  well  as  the  Group’s  resources,  will  be  leveraged  to  continue  to  drive  value  from  those  investments.

Overview Business  review 3i  Group  first  established  a  debt  management  capability  in October  2007  to  capitalise  on  the  opportunity  to  invest    in  non-investment  grade  debt  of  European  businesses.  Investments  were  initially  made  through  a  debt  warehouse  facility.  In  201 1,  and  in  line  with  our  strategy  of  growing  in areas  consistent  with  our  investment  expertise,  a  new  distinct  business  line,  Debt  Management,  was  formed  following  the  acquisition  of  Mizuho  Investment  Management  (UK)  Ltd  (“MIM”)  in  February  201 1.  During  201 1,  the  original    3i  Debt  Warehouse  was  realised,  generating  an  annualised  return  of  c.13.5%.
Business model
Debt  Management  currently  manages  and/or  advises  10 funds  with  total  assets  under  management  of  £3.4 billion  as  at  31  March  2012.
 n Harvest  I  –  V  (five  senior  debt  focused  Collateralised  Loan  Obligations  “CLOs”);
 n Windmill  I  (managed  account);
 n Vintage  I  &  II  (private  equity  funds  of  funds);
 n Friday  Street  (dedicated  mezzanine  fund);  and
 n Palace  Street  I  (Credit  Opportunities  Fund)
The  main  driver  of  returns  for  the  Debt  Management  business line  is  fees  earned  from  managing  the  underlying  Collateralised  Loan  Obligation  (“CLO”)  and  debt  funds.
The  fees  that  3i  Debt  Management  receives  are  structured    to  align  the  interests  of  the  portfolio  manager  with  those  of  the  underlying  debt  and  equity  investors.  The  fee  structure  provides  the  portfolio  manager  with  a  modest  senior  management  fee,  with  the  remainder  of  the  management  fee  performance  related.  In  addition  to  the  above  fee  structure,  some  of  the  funds  have  incentive  fees  which  are  typically  paid  only  after  the  investors  have  received  a  stated  return,  after  which  the  portfolio  manager  receives  a  percentage  of the  investment  returns.
The  Debt  Management  team,  comprising  30  professionals,  have  strong  primary  market  syndication  relationships    and  well  established  private  equity  sponsor  relationships.  This  ensures  that  a  high  proportion  of  opportunities  in  the  market  are  seen.  An  in-depth  credit  analysis  is  undertaken  for  each  opportunity.  Ongoing  portfolio  management  is  a  critical  area  of  focus  for  the  team  and  is  central  to  driving  fund  returns.  Analysts  are  arranged  by  sector  and  each  investment  has  a  dedicated  analyst  who  monitors  performance  to  ensure  that  any  issues  are  identified  early.
The  objective  is  that  as  new  funds  are  launched  in  Debt  Management,  the  Group  aims  to  have  up  to  10%  of  assets  under  management  funded  by  3i.  As  at  31  March  2012,  this  percentage  was  1%.

The  Debt  Management  business  line  generated  a  gross  portfolio  return  of  £1 million  in  the  year  to  31  March  2012  (201 1:  £39 million).  The  prior  year  gross  portfolio  return  figure  was  driven  by  the  realisation  of  the  2007  3i Debt  Warehouse.  Debt  Management’s  gross  portfolio  return  reflects  the  performance  of  Palace  Street  I  and the  value  movement  and  associated  income  resulting  from  the  equity  holdings  owned  by  the  Group  in  the  underlying  CLOs,  managed  by  the  Debt  Management  team.  The  broker  quotes  used  to  value  these  holdings  fell  in  value  during  the  period,  creating  a  value  decrease  of  £3 million  in the  year  to  31  March  2012  (201 1:  £8 million  increase).    This  value  loss  was  offset  by  £1 million  of interest  income  from  the  portfolio  within  Palace  Street  I  and  £2 million  in  equity  distribution  on our holdings  in  the  CLO  funds.
The  main  driver  of  net  portfolio  returns  for  the  Debt  Management  business  line  is  fees  earned  from  managing  the underlying  Collateralised  Loan  Obligation  (“CLO”)    and  debt funds.  Fees  receivable  amounted  to  £32 million  (201 1:  £2 million).  Fee  income  was  strong  as  a  result  of  a  robust  performance  in the  underlying  funds  since  acquisition  –  all  six  CLOs  are  currently  paying  subordinated  fees  versus  one  at  the  time  of the  acquisition  of  MIM.
Operating  expenses  increased  significantly  in  the  year  to  £31 million  (201 1:  £5 million),  following  the  acquisition  of  MIM  and  also  reflects  the  inclusion  of  £4 million  of  amortisation  costs  relating  to  the  acquisition.
The  underlying  profitability  of  the  Debt  Management  business  was  £9 million,  excluding  amortisation  and  other  acquisition  accounting  adjustments.
New  strategic  initiatives  include  Palace  Street  I,  which    was  launched  in  August  201 1.  Rob  Reynolds  (ex  CIO    Resource  Europe)  joined  the  Debt  Management  team  in  September  201 1  as  the  CIO  of  Palace  Street  I.  The  Fund  was  launched  with  a  3i  Group  (€50 million  commitment),  with  an  investment  mandate  to  target  European  bonds,  loans  and  floating  rate  notes.  Since  its  launch,  Palace  Street  I  has  generated  an  annualised  return  of  9%,  including  paying  a  5.7%  (8.8%  annualised)  interim  dividend  to  3i  on  its  equity  investment.
In  addition,  following  on  from  the  success  of  Vintage  I  (a  private  equity  fund  of  funds  vehicle  launched  in  March  2007  with  a  fund  multiple  of  4.3x  as  at  31  March  2012),  a  successor  fund,  Vintage  II,  was  launched  in  November  201 1  and  had  its  final  close  in  March  2012.  Vintage  II,  is  a  $400 million  fund  primarily  investing  in  US  LP  funds.  Priorities for the year ahead
We  intend  to  strengthen  our  position  as  a  leading  participant  in  the  debt  management  market,  through  active  portfolio  management,  the  raising  of  new  funds  and  growth  opportunities  through  selective  acquisitions.  By  maintaining  a  rigorous  investment  approach,  through  the ongoing  investment  of  our  funds  in  a  diversified  portfolio  of  assets,  we  aim  to  generate  attractive  returns  for  our  shareholders  and  limited  partners.  In  addition,  our  strong  brand  and  robust  track  record  provides  3i  the  opportunity  to  raise  new  funds  through  product  diversification,  generating  increased  fee  income.  The launch  of Palace  Street  I  and  Vintage  II  demonstrates    this  capacity.  We  will  also  continue  to  actively  consider  acquisition  opportunities  and  making  strategic  acquisitions  both  in  Europe  and  the  US  as  we  look  to  develop  a  global  debt  management  platform.

Returns 
In summary, gross portfolio return represents the performance of the investment portfolio. Net portfolio return includes 
additional income generated from managing external funds, through management fees and carried interest receivable, less 
the costs of running our business and carried interest paid to our investment teams. Finally, total return is the net portfolio 
return, less our funding costs and the impact of foreign exchange and other factors. 
Each of these aspects of our returns is considered in greater detail in this review.

Overview Business review Financial review
The average EBITDA multiple used to value the portfolio 
on an earnings basis was 8.2x pre-marketability discount, 
(201 1: 8.8x) and 7 .5x post discount (201 1: 7 .8x). This remains 
substantially below the FTSE 250 reference of 9.6x at 
31 March 2012.
Earnings movements
When valuing a portfolio investment on an earnings basis, 
the earnings applied are based on the management 
accounts earnings for the 12 months to the quarter end 
preceding the reporting period, adjusted on a pro forma 
basis for acquisitions, disposals and non-recurring items.  
If the portfolio company’s current year forecast is lower,  
or more recent data provides a more reliable picture of 
maintainable earnings performance, then these will be 
used instead. 
The earnings used to value the portfolio at 31 March 2012 
were 90% management accounts (201 1: 84%), 8% current 
year forecast accounts (201 1: 12%) and 2% audited accounts 
(201 1: 4%). 
There was a 2% increase in aggregate earnings used for 
valuations in the portfolio valued on an earnings basis in 
the year to 31 March 2012, which led to an increase in equity 
value of £23 million (201 1: £295 million).
The earnings of the portfolio as a whole, increased by 9% 
on a value weighted basis.

Loan impairments
Where the net attributable enterprise value of a portfolio 
company is less than the carrying value of 3i’s shareholder 
loans, the shortfall recognised is classified as an impairment. 
The total impairments for the year to 31 March 2012 were 
£(178) million (201 1: £(196) million), of which £(157) million 
(201 1: £(201) million) related to assets valued on an 
earnings basis. These shortfalls were driven by the multiple 
and earnings movements noted above.
Gross portfolio return
Given the proportion of balance sheet capital allocated to 
Private Equity, this business line is the main driver of gross 
portfolio return for the Group.
Realised profits
Realised profits at £23 million (201 1: £124 million) in the year 
to 31 March 2012 were lower than the prior year. A lower 
uplift over opening value of 3% (201 1: 26%) reflects the fact 
that key realisations in the year were valued on an imminent 
sale basis at 31 March 201 1. Exits for the largest realisations 
were achieved at 2.9x original cost.

Earnings multiple movements 
The continued uncertainty in the year to 31 March 2012 
regarding the euro debt crisis and global growth 
expectations impacted the valuation of the portfolio.  
Earnings multiples used to value the portfolio decreased  
by 7% in the year to 31 March 2012 (201 1: 7% decrease).  
This led to a value reduction of £130 million in the equity 
value of the portfolio (201 1: £76 million reduction).

as the Credit Opportunities Fund, Palace Street I, which 
commenced investment in the year. These assets are valued 
using broker quotes, which resulted in a £(3) million reduction 
in value in the year (201 1: £8 million).

Income from the portfolio was £146 million in the year to

were received (201 1: £41 million), including £18 million  
from 3i Infrastructure plc and £19 million from Quintiles,  
a US Private Equity investment. Interest income from loans  
was £95 million (201 1: £1 10 million), including £1 million  
from Palace Street I. A further £4 million in net fees was 
received in the year (201 1: £1 million).
Portfolio income received as cash in the year was £60 million 
(201 1: £57 million), reflecting the relatively high proportion  
of capitalised interest generated by the Private Equity portfolio. 
Provisions
A provision is recognised where we anticipate that there 
is a 50% or greater chance that the Group’s investment in 
the portfolio company will fail within the next 12 months. 
The £(138) million provisions for the year to 31 March 2012 
(201 1: £(71) million) relate to six portfolio companies, 
representing a range of sectors and geographies. 
The provisions for the year to 31 March 2012 account 
for 3% of the opening portfolio (201 1: 2%).
Uplift to imminent sale
Portfolio companies which are currently in a negotiated 
sales process are valued on an uplift to imminent sale basis. 
At 31 March 2012, there were no material portfolio 
companies in an advanced sales process (201 1: £240 million).
Discounted Cash Flow
The Discounted Cash Flow (DCF) valuation basis is used to 
value portfolio companies with predictable and stable cash 
flows, typically infrastructure investments. As at 31 March 
2012, there were 1 1 portfolio companies valued using 
the DCF valuations basis, the majority of which relate to 
the Group’s investment in the 3i India Infrastructure Fund. 
These assets contributed to a reduction in value of 
£(1) million in the year to 31 March 2012 (201 1: £54 million).
Other
Where a different valuation basis is more appropriate for a 
portfolio company, the “other” category is used to determine 
fair value, for example, the sum of the parts of the business 
or industry specific methods. The “other” valuation basis 
category includes Asia re-insurance business, ACR,  
which contributed to the total “other” reduction in value of 
£(51) million in the year to 31 March 2012 (201 1: £48 million). 
Quoted portfolio
The quoted portfolio at £535 million now represents 17% 
(201 1: 10%) of the Group’s total portfolio, which has increased 
from £405 million at 31 March 201 1. The Group’s 34% 
investment in 3i Infrastructure plc represents the majority 
of the quoted portfolio. 3i Infrastructure plc has had a 6% 
increase in share price in the year, increasing in value by 
£22 million. However, this was offset by the remaining quoted 
portfolio reducing in value by £(42) million, resulting in a net 
reduction in the quoted portfolio value of £(20) million in the 
year to 31 March 2012 (201 1: £23 million).

The Group continued its focus on reducing operating costs. 
The restructuring of the European Private Equity team 
during the year included significant rationalisation of the 
teams in the UK and Spain and the closure of the Italian 
office. Furthermore, a number of initiatives have been 
implemented in order to ensure the Group’s professional 
services functions are appropriately sized for the business. 
Operating expenses were marginally lower at £180 million 
(201 1: £181 million). Excluding the costs of the Debt 
Management business, the newly established Private 
Equity business in Brazil, and the restructuring and 
one-off costs involved in organisational change, underlying 
operating expenses in the year have fallen by 16% to 
£148 million (201 1: £177 million). Headcount at the end 
of the year was 435 (201 1: 491) and reflects the changes 
in both the Private Equity business and the professional 
services functions.
Net operating expenses continued to improve at £91 million 
(201 1: £1 14 million), helped by the performance of the Debt 
Management business line increasing fees in the year to 
31 March 2012. This is also reflected in the improvement 
in both the cost efficiency metric (net operating expenses/
opening portfolio) at 2.3% (201 1: 3.2%) and operating 
expenses per AUM of 1.5% (201 1: 1.8%).

Fees receivable from external funds
Fees earned from external funds in the year to 31 March 
2012 of £89 million have increased (201 1 : £67 million). The effect 
of the acquisition of MIM by the Debt Management business 
line has accounted for the majority of the increase with  
an improved performance in the underlying CLO funds 
generating £32 million of fees (201 1: £2 million, while under  
3i Group ownership).
The remaining fees in the year comprised £32 million  
(201 1: £40 million) from our managed private equity funds 
and £25 million (201 1: £25 million) receivable from advisory 
and management services to 3i Infrastructure plc and the 
3i India Infrastructure Fund.
The fees received from our managed private equity funds 
reduced in the second half of the year as Eurofund V came 
to the end of its investing period.
Net carried interest and  
performance fees payable
Carried interest and performance fees are accrued on the 
realised and unrealised profits generated, taking relevant 
performance hurdles into consideration. 
Net carried interest and performance fees payable in the 
year were broadly neutral with a net payable amount of 
£5 million (201 1: £38 million payable). The portfolio value 
movement in the period has been mostly recognised in  
those carried interest funds where the performance hurdle 
has not been achieved. As a result, there was a £5 million 
charge in the year to 31 March 2012.
50 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Total return
Net interest payable
Net interest payable decreased in the year to £91 million 
(201 1: £127 million). This improvement was driven by  
the reduction in gross debt, following the maturing of  
the remainder of the convertible bond in May 201 1  
and repurchases and repayments of other debt balances  
in the year. 
Interest payable reduced to £103 million (201 1: £139 million) 
in the year to 31 March 2012. Interest receivable was in 
line with the prior year at £12 million (201 1: £12 million), 
with interest rates continuing to be at record lows.
Derivative movements
The Group uses foreign exchange contracts and interest rate 
swaps as part of its general hedging programme. There was 
a £19 million loss recognised from the fair value movement 
of the derivatives during the year (201 1: £1 million loss), 
principally relating to long-term legacy interest rate swaps.
Net foreign exchange movements
The Group maintained its partial hedging policy in the  
year, using core currency borrowings and derivatives as 
appropriate. This resulted in 44% of the foreign currency 
portfolio being hedged by borrowings at 31 March 2012, 
with a further 25% hedged using derivatives. The overall 
impact of foreign exchange on total return was a charge of 
£49 million in the year to 31 March 2012 (201 1: £17 million). 
This was primarily driven by the weakening of both the 
euro (5%) and Indian rupee (8%) in the year.
Pensions
The Group’s UK-defined benefit pension scheme was 
closed to new members in April 2006 and to future accrual 
in April 201 1. In the year to 31 March 2012 there was an 
IAS 19 pension actuarial loss of £66 million (201 1: £20 million 
profit) arising from the UK pension scheme and £1 million 
on non-UK defined benefit pension schemes. This loss 
reflected the negative impact of the financial markets, 
predominantly due to a decrease in the discount rate 
increasing the scheme liabilities. 
The latest triennial funding valuation was agreed in 
September 201 1, and resulted in the Group committing 
to fund £72 million in the year to 31 March 2012 and a 
further £36 million in April 2012. This second payment 
has been factored into the calculation of the IAS 19 pension 
actuarial loss at 31 March 2012. The Group also entered 
into a contingent asset arrangement with the Trustees at 
no cash or strategic cost to the Group, allowing flexibility to 
implement a longer term de-risking strategy. Further details 
of these arrangements are included in note 32 to the accounts.

Overview Business review Balance sheet
Table 26: Group balance sheet
as at 31 March 2012 2011
Shareholders’ funds £2,627m £3,357m
Gross debt £1,623m £2,043m
Net debt £464m £522m
Gearing 18% 16%
Diluted net asset value per share £2.79 £3.51
Gearing and borrowings
The Group has maintained its conservative balance 
sheet approach with gross debt reducing by 21% in the 
year to £1,623 million (201 1: £2,043 million). Gross debt 
has reduced primarily due to the repayment of £139 million 
of the convertible bond, which matured in May 201 1, and 
repurchases of €154 million of the €500 million floating  
rate note in the year. £278 million remained outstanding  
as at 31 March 2012. Repayment of a $50 million bond and  
a £67 million banking facility also took place in the year.
Net debt at £464 million remained within our self-imposed 
£1 billion limit (201 1: £522 million). Gearing marginally 
increased to 18% in the year (201 1: 16%) as a result of the 
reduction in shareholders’ funds to £2,627 million (201 1: 
£3,357 million) following the negative total return noted 
in the year to 31 March 2012.
Liquidity
Liquidity reduced in the year to £1,653 million (201 1: 
£1,846 million). This comprised cash and deposits of 
£1,159 million (201 1: £1,521 million) and undrawn facilities of 
£494 million (201 1: £325 million). The cash balance reduced 
primarily as a result of the repayment of debt in the year,  
with cash inflows from divestment activity being offset 
by investment and other operating cash flows.
Undrawn facilities available to the Group have increased 
following the successful and early refinancing of the  
£300 million multi-currency facility to £450 million, extending 
maturity from October 2012 to June 2016, partially offset 
by the refinancing of the £100 million multi-currency facility 
to £50 million with maturity extended from October 2012 
to April 2016.
Diluted NAV
The diluted NAV per share at 31 March 2012 was £2.79 
(201 1: £3.51). This was driven by the negative total return  
in the year of £(656) million (201 1: £324 million), as well 
as dividend payments in the year of £49 million 
(201 1: £30 million).

Risk Overview Review of risks
External
The key external risks affecting 3i over the course of the 
financial year remain centred on the impact of the continuing 
difficult macroeconomic and market conditions, especially  
in Europe.
These uncertain conditions impact 3i’s operating 
environment in a number of ways. For example, fundraising 
conditions are challenging for the private equity industry 
as a whole, as recent fund vintages have underperformed  
and investors have become more selective. General M&A 
activity remains relatively subdued, partly reflecting 
companies’ preference for high levels of liquidity over 
investment. Finally, there is still a significant private 
equity funding overhang which continues to underpin 
high prices for transactions.
Economic conditions also present varying degrees of risk for 
the operations and growth of 3i’s portfolio companies and 
therefore overall performance and valuations, as described 
under Investment risk on the following page. 
Key factors include the risk of below trend economic growth, 
in the context of government deficit reduction programmes, 
and the impact and uncertainties of sovereign debt 
refinancing on the wider credit markets. The majority  
of European financing transactions were structured at  
the peak of the market in 2006 and 2007 , with tenors of 
between seven and nine years. This means that refinancing 
requirements will increase substantially, peaking in 2013 and 
2014. The market, therefore, is likely to become increasingly 
focused on this risk in the run up to 2013. 
At this stage, it is difficult to predict how this will unfold, 
particularly given the wider fundamental economic 
uncertainties, fragile confidence, and refinancing 
requirements for both corporate and sovereign debt.  
3i has been managing this risk actively and, as can be seen 
from the chart on page 33, the debt repayment profile of  
3i’s Private Equity portfolio, weighted by 3i carrying values, 
means that only 34% of the debt in these companies falls 
due before the end of 2014 and 43% falls due during or 
after 2018. 
There is a trend towards closer scrutiny of the integrity and 
transparency of financial service firms by investors and a 
greater emphasis on Responsible Investing. Firms that are 
able to differentiate themselves in these areas are likely  
to be at an advantage in the future. In recognition of this,  
3i completed a wide-ranging strategic review of Responsible 
Investing and launched a new set of enhanced policies  
and processes. In addition, the Group refreshed and 
relaunched its values supported by training for all staff. 
Further information is set out in the sections on Corporate 
responsibility and Business model and values.
Regulatory developments continue to be monitored closely. 
The key developments affecting 3i include: the European 
AIFM Directive, which will deliver higher levels of disclosure 
for applicable firms; the implementation of the UK Bribery 
Act; FATCA, which requires additional monitoring and 
reporting on transactions between 3i and US companies  
and citizens; and US financial reform, which requires certain 
3i entities to be registered with the Securities and Exchange 
Commission. Changes which have been finalised or 
implemented so far have required some modifications to 
related policies and processes. The effect on 3i’s overall 
business to date has not been disproportionate in the context 
of the wider Financial Services industry.
Finally, changes to the investment trust rules by HM Revenue 
& Customs in April 2012, will help 3i simplify its business, 
facilitate growth in developing markets and make it easier 
for the Group to invest without third-party funds.
Risk
This section provides a review of the evolution and management of 3i’s key 
risks during the year , together with an overview of the main elements of 3i’s risk 
governance framework. This is followed by a description of the main inherent 
risk factors. Further details on the management of key risks, and related 
results and outcomes, can be found in the relevant section on risk factors.
54 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Compliance with covenant tests – and for some portfolio 
companies, refinancing of debt – has become more 
challenging over the past year for some of the more highly 
leveraged portfolio investments. This is mainly as a result 
of slower growth in earnings together with some tightening 
of credit markets, reflecting the generally weak and 
uncertain macroeconomic environment. These risks are 
being closely monitored with input from 3i’s banking team.
A further area of focus has been the trend in 3i’s private 
equity investment and realisation levels. A cautious and 
highly selective approach has continued to be applied to 
new investment over the year. The run rate of realisations 
slowed in the second half of the year, reflecting caution on 
the part of buyers. 
T reasury and funding
The Group maintains a conservative financial structure 
which is supported by a strong control framework and 
balance sheet targets. For example, a net debt limit is in 
place and a target maximum quantum for future refinancing 
in any single financial year.
The Group’s bond refinancing strategy continues to focus 
on extending the overall maturity profile with a reduction of 
the overall gross debt level over time. Funding requirements  
are evaluated on a rolling 12 month outlook to ensure 
appropriate levels of liquidity are maintained. 3i’s rating is 
BBB stable/Baa1 negative. In the context of uncertain market 
conditions, it is appropriate to continue to monitor the full 
range of refinancing options in advance of bond maturities.  
It remains important to balance liquidity benefits against the 
cost of funding and management of interest costs.
Liquidity continues to be monitored on a weekly basis and 
there is close review of counterparty exposures. The majority 
of funds continue to be placed with AAA liquidity funds and 
selected banking counterparties. The AAA liquidity funds  
are regularly evaluated to understand the nature of the 
underlying counterparty exposures and geographic mix.
The unprecedented current levels of uncertainty around the 
euro are expected to continue well into 2012. This could give 
rise to a number of possible scenarios, including a break-up 
of the Eurozone. Based on a review of these scenarios, 
the key issues potentially impacting 3i are around the euro 
hedging strategy and euro liabilities. A break-up would give 
rise to inevitably complex legal questions. In this context, 
a review has been undertaken of the Company’s key loan 
documentation.
Strategic
3i continues to anticipate and to respond to market 
conditions, risks and opportunities. The strategic focus 
has been on performance improvement and growth, taking 
full account of the challenges of the current environment.
The key strategic risks are similar to last year, and are 
focused around performance at this point of the economic 
cycle and the Group’s funding strategy factoring in the 
current external fund raising environment, expected 
investment and realisation levels, and balance sheet 
management. The growth of 3i’s debt management 
business and investment in developing markets have 
also been areas of focus.
Investment
The Group’s key investment risks remain closely linked to 
the adverse economic and market conditions, described 
earlier. These conditions affect each of 3i’s business lines 
in different ways and to varying degrees. 3i’s Private Equity 
business line remains the largest in terms of both direct 
balance sheet investment and assets under management 
and has, therefore, been the main area of focus. Risks 
include the pricing of investment opportunities and potential 
underperformance of portfolio companies, impacting 
valuations and, for some investments, debt covenant tests. 
As part of the investment assessment and asset review 
process, ESG risks are also considered.
The overall health of 3i’s investment portfolio has been 
mixed over the year, with some geographies and types 
of investment more exposed than others and, accordingly, 
some valuation reductions were required. Although it 
remains well diversified, the Group’s investment portfolio has 
become relatively more concentrated over time, which may 
increase exposure to the performance of a smaller number 
of large investments and, therefore, the potential for material 
individual valuation movements. The level of concentration 
risk will vary over time as the composition of the Group’s 
largest investments changes.
3i’s Private Equity portfolio management processes and 
capabilities have been a subject of focus during the year. 
The portfolio company review process includes both the 
identification of risks that might affect a substantial 
proportion of the portfolio and the assessment of significant 
exposures to specific known risks. Examples of the latter 
include exposure to weaker Eurozone countries, where  
the direct impact is limited to a small number of portfolio 
companies. The indirect impact of a significant shock in 
the region, however, is more complex to assess.

Risk Overview The Group uses core currency borrowing to hedge foreign 
exchange exposures in the portfolio, which are primarily  
in euro and US dollars. This is supplemented where 
necessary by the use of derivatives, subject to a maximum 
overall derivative limit agreed by the Board. In the current 
volatile market conditions, 3i’s ability to re-finance currency 
debt at a time of its own choosing may be constrained.  
This could impact the Group’s ability to sufficiently hedge  
the non-sterling portfolio in line with agreed targets.  
The effectiveness of the hedging strategy is closely monitored 
in the context of the Group’s portfolio strategy, as well as 
market conditions and possible funding constraints.
Operational
The key operational risks facing the Group during the  
year relate mainly to people. In common with many  
other businesses, the difficult economic environment has 
contributed to a degree of uncertainty for staff. A number 
of teams have downsized to align with business needs and 
manage costs. This has involved some process changes 
and reallocation of responsibilities, which have required 
close management to ensure the internal control 
environment remains robust.
During the year, the Company refreshed and relaunched  
its core values, which involved workshops for all staff,  
and completed its annual employee engagement survey,  
the results of which are reported on page 64.
The process of integrating the 3i Debt Management team 
and bedding down related oversight, compliance and control 
processes has been completed during the year. In the Private 
Equity business, operational responsibilities have been 
realigned between Developed and Developing Markets.
A number of policies and procedures have been upgraded 
during the year. This has included a complete update of 
the Group’s incident response plan; a review and update 
of human resources policies; the launch of an updated 
anti-bribery policy, supported by all staff e-learning; and 
some process changes in response to the Financial Service 
Authority’s remuneration code.
Risk governance framework
3i’s risk governance framework provides a structured 
process to oversee the identification, assessment and 
approach to mitigation in respect of those risks which  
could materially impact the Group’s strategic objectives  
or execution.
Risk management operates at all levels throughout the 
Group, across business lines, geographies and professional 
functions. The Board is ultimately responsible for risk 
management, which includes the Group’s risk governance 
or oversight structure and maintaining an appropriate 
internal control framework. Management’s responsibility 
is to manage risk on behalf of the Board.
By reporting regularly to Audit and Compliance Committee, 
the Group’s Risk Committee provides support to the Board  
in maintaining oversight of the effectiveness of risk 
management across the Group.
The risk governance framework and the responsibilities  
of the main committees involved are shown opposite.  
Details can also be found in the Governance section  
(Pillar 3 disclosures) at www.3igroup.com.
There have been no changes to 3i’s risk management 
framework over the course of the year. Risk reviews are 
generally carried out on a quarterly basis and aligned 
with the Group Risk Committee meetings, which are held 
as part of the Leadership Team meetings.
Related committees
The Brand and Values Committee oversees a range 
of matters which could create reputational risks for the 
Company, complementing the work of the Group Risk 
Committee. This includes identifying and assessing the 
significant risks and opportunities for 3i arising from 
corporate responsibility issues.

During the year, we further developed our brand, our  
values and our approach to Responsible Investment  
(“RI”). I am particularly pleased with the work that 
we have done to refresh and embed our RI policy 
and procedures.
We believe that companies with high environmental, 
social and governance (“ESG”) standards are typically 
better run, have fewer business risks and are easier 
to realise value from.
I am pleased that we have become signatories to 
the UN Principles for Responsible Investing. At a time 
when the investment community is being challenged 
by stakeholders, it is important that we come together 
as an industry and demonstrate our commitment to 
behaving responsibly in our investment activities.
I hope that you find the following report of interest.

For 3i, corporate responsibility is about being both a responsible investor and 
a responsible company. It means taking responsibility for our actions, carefully 
considering how others will be affected by our choices and ensuring that 
our values are integrated into our formal business policies, practices and 
plans. Most of all, it is about behaving in a responsible way.

Our approach to corporate responsibility and our business model is underpinned by our values, which together commit

The values of ambition, courage, responsibility, collaboration and integrity collectively drive our objective to be a successful

We have invested time and resources 
in seeking earlier and greater 
visibility of material ESG matters 
in our investment processes. 
Create innovative financial 
solutions and ensure 
excellent execution
As part of our increased awareness  
on ESG issues, there is a focus on 
transparency and on good governance.
Secure access to capital 
from multiple sources
Our annual Corporate Governance  
event with shareholders, individual 
engagements with the investors in our 
funds, and our round-table discussions 
with the wider investment community 
have provided useful input to developing 
our approach.
Build great companies and 
deliver outstanding returns
We have developed a more explicit 
Responsible Investment policy and 
integrated a deeper analysis of the 
materiality and management of ESG 
matters in our investment process and 
in our portfolio company review process.
Invest in our network, 
people and knowledge
Further investment in our “One 3i” 
initiative through, for example, Values 
workshops for all staff, reinforced our 
focus on the retention and engagement 
of our staff. 
Achieve full potential through 
active partnership 
Increased training and improved tools 
for our investment professionals on a 
range of ESG topics has been developed 
in order to create greater awareness and 
capability, as well as helping to identify 
opportunities for enhanced returns.

62 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012   a referral list of activities that we may invest in but which 
may be sensitive and require additional scrutiny; and
  a set of minimum ESG standards that we will seek to 
implement during the period of our investment.
The policy is underpinned by:
  a set of updated RI procedures that complement our 
investment processes and ensure that they are 
consistently applied across all of our investment activities;
  an online toolkit that provides screening and risk 
assessment tools for ESG risks, including anti-bribery 
and corruption risks;
  a series of guidance notes for investment teams, 
covering key issues and sectors, with links to case studies, 
international norms and standards and information about 
specific emerging markets;
  a list of preferred ESG due diligence suppliers;
  a “one-stop shop” RI portal that provides access for staff 
to all these resources; and
  a full-time internal Responsible Investing Manager who 
supports the deal teams in the application of the RI policy.
Working with advisers, as part of this project, we reviewed 
our Private Equity and Infrastructure portfolios, identifying 
over 25 companies for more rigorous analysis in 
environmental, social and governance (“ESG”) matters.  
This review focused not only on ESG risks, but also on 
the opportunities for creating value. Going forward, our 
investment teams will work with our Active Partnership 
programme to drive the themes more consistently through 
our investments to create value.
Responsible Investing
Our vision is to be recognised as a leading international 
investor based on the value we add to our portfolio, the 
returns we deliver to our investors and our responsible 
approach to investing.
We believe that:
  the effective assessment and management of ESG 
matters has a positive effect on the value of our investee 
companies and of 3i Group itself;
  compliance with local laws and regulations may not be 
enough to meet global expectations, deliver value and 
enhance our reputation and licence to operate; and
  it is vital that we seek to identify all material ESG risks and 
opportunities through our due diligence and effectively 
manage them during the period of 3i’s investment.
During the year, we initiated a project to review and improve 
our RI approach. The result was a refreshed policy supported 
by “on the ground” tools, resources and procedures to 
embed the policy into our investment processes and apply 
them consistently across the business.
Our policy makes it clear that we aim to use our influence 
as an investor to promote a commitment in our investee 
companies to:
  comply, as a minimum, with applicable local and 
international laws;
  mitigate adverse environmental and social impacts and 
enhance positive effects on the environment, workers 
and relevant stakeholders; and
  uphold high standards of business integrity and good 
corporate governance.
Main features of the policy include:
  clear statements of our commitment to mitigate 
adverse environmental and social impacts and 
uphold high standards of business integrity and good 
corporate governance;
  an exclusion list of businesses and activities in which 
we will not invest;

However, the challenging operating environment has been 
reflected in an overall employee engagement score of 69%, 
which is lower than in previous periods, although broadly 
in line with other UK companies surveyed.
Employee engagement is a composite measure of 
employees’ views of how well their abilities are used, 
recognised and valued by the company, their commitment 
and pride in working for us and their understanding of their 
contribution, commitment and pride in working for us.
Our priorities for the year ahead
We recognise that we have more to do in this area, and 
have identified the following priorities for the year ahead:
  ensuring that our revised Responsible Investing 
procedures are fully implemented and supported 
by appropriate training and resources;
  further work on enhancing our monitoring and reporting 
to include meaningful KPIs with respect to ESG matters 
in our portfolio; and
  building on the results of our portfolio review on ESG 
matters to engage with portfolio management teams 
and assist them in achieving improvements.

Governance Overview This section of the Directors’ report contains statutory 
and corporate governance information for the year 
to 31 March 2012 (“the year”) concerning the Company 
and its subsidiaries (“the Group”).
Principal activity
3i is an international investor focused on private equity, 
infrastructure and debt management, investing in Europe, 
Asia and the Americas. 
Group investment policy
3i’s investment policy, which as a closed-ended investment 
fund it is required to publish, is as follows:
  3i is an investment company which aims to provide its 
shareholders with quoted access to private equity returns. 
Currently, its main focus is on making quoted and 
unquoted equity and/or debt investments in businesses 
and funds across Europe, Asia and the Americas. 
The geographies, economic sectors, funds and asset 
classes in which 3i invests continue to evolve as 
opportunities are identified. Proposed investments are 
assessed individually and all significant investments 
require approval from the Group’s Investment Committee. 
Overall investment targets are subject to periodic reviews 
and the investment portfolio is also reviewed to monitor 
exposure to specific geographies, economic sectors and 
asset classes.
  3i seeks to diversify risk through significant dispersion 
of investments by geography, economic sector, asset 
class and size as well as through the maturity profile 
of its investment portfolio. In addition, although 3i does 
not set maximum exposure limits for asset allocations, 
no more than 15% by value of 3i’s portfolio can be held 
in a single investment.
  Investments are generally funded with a mixture of debt 
and shareholders’ funds with a view to maximising returns 
to shareholders, whilst maintaining a strong capital base. 
3i’s gearing depends not only on its level of debt, but also 
on the impact of market movements and other factors  
on the value of its investments. The Board takes this into 
account when, as required, it sets a precise maximum 
level of gearing. The Board has therefore set the maximum 
level of gearing at 150% and has set no minimum level  
of gearing. If the gearing ratio should exceed the 150% 
maximum limit, the Board will take steps to reduce the 
gearing ratio to below that limit as soon as practicable 
thereafter. 3i is committed to achieving balance 
sheet efficiency.
During the year, the Company has continued its approach 
of conservative balance sheet management. The Board 
recognises the current need to manage liquidity and gross 
and net debt levels on a conservative basis such that the 
Company should be well-placed to deal with external events, 
take advantage of opportunities and manage its investment 
and divestment activities in a flexible manner. The Board has 
decided that net debt should not currently exceed £1 billion 
and may at times be significantly below this limit. As a 
consequence, gearing, which is a function of both net debt 
and asset values, is expected to be in the range of 0%–30% 
for the immediate future. It should be noted that (subject 
always to the formal gearing limit in the Company’s 
investment policy statement set out above) the actual 
gearing level at any point in time will fluctuate, since it is a 
function of, among other things, asset valuations and the 
timing of investment and realisation cash flows. The Board 
anticipates that the Company may be in a net cash position 
during certain periods (for example during periods of high 
valuations where realisations might be expected to exceed 
investment) but may have net debt in other periods (for 
example where valuations are relatively low or after periods 
of low return flows).
T ax and investment company status
The Company is an investment company as defined by 
section 833 of the Companies Act 2006. HM Revenue & 
Customs has approved the Company as an investment trust 
under section 1 158 of the Corporation Tax Act 2010 for the 
year to 31 March 201 1. Since that date the Company has 
directed its affairs to enable it to continue to be so approved.
Regulation
3i Investments plc, 3i Debt Management Investments 
Limited, 3i Europe plc and 3i Nordic plc, subsidiaries of the 
Company, are authorised and regulated by the FSA under the 
Financial Services and Markets Act 2000. Where applicable, 
certain Group subsidiaries’ businesses outside the United 
Kingdom are regulated locally by relevant authorities.
Management arrangements
3i Investments plc acts as investment manager to the 
Company and certain of its subsidiaries. Contracts for these 
investment management and other services, for which 
regulatory authorisation is required, provide for fees based 
on the work done and costs incurred in providing such 
services. These contracts may be terminated by either party 
on reasonable notice.
3i plc provides the Group with certain corporate and 
administrative services, for which no regulatory 
authorisation is required, under contracts which provide for 
fees based on the work done and costs incurred in providing 
such services together with a performance fee based on 
realised profits on the sale of assets.

There are no restrictions on the transfer of fully paid shares 
in the Company, save as follows. The Board may decline 
to register a transfer of uncertificated shares in the 
circumstances set out in the Uncertificated Securities 
Regulations 2001 or where a transfer is to more than four 
joint holders. The Board may decline to register any transfer

with section 794 of the Companies Act 2006 a notice (under 
section 793 of that Act) has been served by the Company on 
a shareholder who has then failed to give the information 
required within the specified time. In the latter circumstances 
the Company may make the relevant shares subject to 
certain restrictions (including in respect of the ability to 
exercise voting rights, to transfer the shares validly and, 
except in the case of a liquidation, to receive the payment 
of sums due from the Company). Since 14 July 2009 the 
Company has been entitled to appoint a person to execute

control of the Company. There are no restrictions placed on 
voting rights of fully paid shares, save where in accordance 
with Article 12 of the Company’s Articles of Association a

The amendment of the Company’s Articles of Association is

by special resolution of the shareholders in general meeting.
Holders of ordinary shares and B shares enjoy the rights 
accorded to them under the Articles of Association of the 
Company and under the laws of England and Wales. 
Any share may be issued with or have attached to it 
such rights and restrictions as the Company by ordinary 
resolution or failing such resolution the Board may decide.
Holders of ordinary shares are entitled to attend, speak and 
vote at general meetings of the Company and to appoint 
proxies and, in the case of corporations, corporate 
representatives to attend, speak and vote at such meetings 
on their behalf. On a poll, holders of ordinary shares are

shares are entitled to receive the Company’s Annual Report

distributions as may lawfully be paid or declared on such

the surplus assets of the Company after satisfaction of the 
entitlements of the holders of the B shares or such other 
shares with preferred rights as may then be in issue.
Holders of B shares are entitled, out of the profits available 
for distribution in any year and in priority to any payment 
of dividend or other distribution to holders of ordinary shares, 
to a cumulative preferential dividend of 3.75% per annum

group reorganisation) holders of B shares are entitled to 
receive in priority to any payment to holders of ordinary shares 
payment of the Return Amount together with any accrued 
but unpaid dividends but are not entitled to any further right 
of participation in the profits or assets of the Company.

at the AGM to be held on 29 June 2012 all the Directors will 
retire from office. All these Directors are eligible for and, 
save for Mr M J Queen who is stepping down from the Board, 
seek reappointment.
The Board’s recommendation for the reappointment 
of Directors is set out in the 2012 Notice of AGM.
Directors’ conflicts of interests
Directors have a statutory duty to avoid conflicts of 
interest with the Company. The Company’s Articles 
of Association enable Directors to approve conflicts of 
interest and include other conflict of interest provisions. 
The Company has implemented processes to identify 
potential and actual conflicts of interest. Such conflicts 
are then considered for approval by the Board, subject, 
if necessary, to appropriate conditions.
Directors’ indemnities
As permitted by the Company’s Articles of Association, the 
Company has maintained Qualifying Third-Party Indemnity 
Provisions (as defined under relevant legislation) for the 
benefit of the Company’s Directors throughout the year.
Employment
The policy of the Group is one of equal opportunity in the 
selection, training, career development and promotion of 
employees, regardless of age, gender, sexual orientation, 
ethnic origin, religion and whether disabled or otherwise.
3i treats applicants and employees with disabilities equally 
and fairly and provides facilities, equipment and training to 
assist disabled employees to do their jobs. Arrangements  
are made as necessary to ensure access and support to 
job applicants who happen to be disabled and who respond 
to our request to inform the Company of any requirements. 
Should an employee become disabled during their 
employment, efforts would be made to retain them in their 
current employment or to explore the opportunities for their 
retraining or redeployment within 3i. Financial support is  
also provided by 3i to support disabled employees who are 
unable to work, as appropriate to local market conditions.
3i’s principal means of keeping in touch with the views of  
its employees are through employee appraisals, informal 
consultations, team briefings, and staff conferences

Corporate governance statement
Corporate governance
Throughout the year, the Company complied with the 
provisions of the UK Corporate Governance Code (the “Code”) 
published by the Financial Reporting Council in May 2010.
The Company’s approach to  
corporate governance
The Company has a policy of seeking to comply with 
established best practice in the field of corporate governance. 
The Board has adopted core values and global policies which 
set out the behaviour expected of staff in their dealings with 
shareholders, customers, colleagues, suppliers and others 
who engage with the Company. The values which employees 
are expected to display were refreshed during the year.
The Board’s responsibilities and processes
The Board is responsible to shareholders for the overall 
management of the Group and may exercise all the powers 
of the Company subject to the provisions of relevant statutes, 
the Company’s Articles of Association and any directions 
given by special resolution of the shareholders. The Articles 
of Association empower the Board to offer, allot, grant 
options over or otherwise deal with or dispose of the 
Company’s shares as the Board may decide. The Companies 
Act 2006 authorises the Company to make market 
purchases of its own shares if the purchase has first been 
authorised by a resolution of the Company.
At the AGM in July 201 1, shareholders renewed the Board’s 
authority to allot ordinary shares and to repurchase ordinary 
shares on behalf of the Company subject to certain limits. 
At the AGM in July 201 1, shareholders authorised the Board 
to repurchase B shares on behalf of the Company subject to 
certain limits. Details of the authorities which the Board will 
be seeking at the 2012 AGM are set out in the 2012 Notice 
of AGM.
The Articles of Association also specifically empower the 
Board to exercise the Company’s powers to borrow money 
and to mortgage or charge the Company’s assets and any 
uncalled capital and to issue debentures and other securities.
The Board determines matters including financial strategy 
and planning and takes major business decisions. The Board 
has put in place an organisational structure. This is further 
described under the heading “internal control”.
Attendance at Board and  
Committee Meetings
The table below shows the number of scheduled meetings 
attended by Directors during the year to 31 March 2012 and, 
in brackets, the number of such meetings they were eligible 
to attend. In addition to these meetings a number of ad hoc 
meetings were held to deal with specific items as they arose.
74 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Information
Reports and papers are circulated to the Directors in a timely 
manner in preparation for Board and committee meetings. 
These papers are supplemented by information specifically 
requested by the Directors from time to time.
Performance evaluation
During the year, the Board conducted its annual evaluation 
of its own performance and that of its committees and 
individual Directors. The evaluation process in the year to 
31 March 2012 was conducted internally by the Chairman 
with the assistance of the Company Secretary. The results 
of this year’s evaluation process were reported to and 
discussed by the Board.
The Board performance evaluation included consideration 
of the overall functioning of the Board. Particular topics 
considered included: the optimum balance of attendance at 
Board meetings by managers below Board level, the balance 
of Board agendas, the adoption of a regular calendar of Board 
presentations and briefings, enhancements to the structure 
and content of Board packs, monitoring by non-executive 
Directors of investment approvals at Investment Committee, 
and increased portfolio company and investment team visits. 
The Board evaluation process also included consideration of 
the size, balance and composition of the Board including its 
diversity, including as to gender. The evaluation process was 
valuable in enabling Directors to identify a number of areas 
where its working practices could usefully be developed.
In his role as Senior Independent Director, Mr R H Meddings 
led a review by the Directors of the performance of the 
Chairman and subsequently reported back to the Board.

business of the Group. The Chairman facilitates the effective 
contribution of non-executive Directors and constructive 
relations between executive and non-executive Directors. 
The Chairman ensures that regular reports from the 
Company’s brokers are circulated to the non-executive 
Directors to enable non-executive Directors to remain aware

Governance Overview Statutory and corporate governance information
The Board’s discussions, and its approval of the Group’s 
strategic plan and annual budget, provide the non-executive 
Directors with the opportunity to contribute to and validate 
management’s plans and assist in the development of 
strategy. The non-executive Directors receive regular 
management accounts, reports and information which 
enable them to scrutinise the Company’s and management’s 
performance against agreed objectives.
Directors’ independence
All the non-executive Directors (other than the Chairman, 
who was independent on appointment) were considered 
by the Board to be independent for the purposes of the Code 
in the year to 31 March 2012.
The Board assesses and reviews the independence of 
each of the non-executive Directors at least annually, 
having regard to the potential relevance and materiality 
of a Director’s interests and relationships rather than 
applying rigid criteria in a mechanistic manner. No Director 
was materially interested in any contract or arrangement 
subsisting during or at the end of the financial period that 
was significant in relation to the business of the Company.
Directors’ employment contracts
Details of executive Directors’ employment contracts are set 
out in the Directors’ remuneration report.
Training and development
The Company has developed a training policy which provides 
a framework within which training for Directors is planned 
with the objective of ensuring Directors understand the duties  
and responsibilities of being a director of a listed company.  
All Directors are required to update their skills and maintain 
their familiarity with the Company and its business continually. 
Presentations on different aspects of the Company’s business 
are made regularly to the Board. On appointment, all non-
executive Directors have discussions with the Chairman and 
the Chief Executive following which appropriate briefings on the 
responsibilities of Directors, the Company’s business and the 
Company’s procedures are arranged. The Company provides 
opportunities for non-executive Directors to obtain a thorough 
understanding of the Company’s business by meeting 
members of the senior management team who in turn 
arrange, as required, visits to investment or support teams.
The Company has procedures for Directors to take 
independent legal or other professional advice about the 
performance of their duties.
The Chief Executive
The Chief Executive has direct charge of the Group on a 
day-to-day basis and is accountable to the Board for the 
financial and operational performance of the Group. The 
Chief Executive has formed a committee called Leadership 
Team to enable him to carry out the responsibilities 
delegated to him by the Board. The Committee comprises 
Mr M J Queen, Mr S A Borrows, Mrs J S Wilson, Mr M A Antal, 
Mr K J Dunn, Mr A C B Giddins, Mr J R Ghose, Ms C M Hogg, 
Mr P Waller and Mr G A R Zarzavatdjian. The Committee 
meets on a regular basis to consider operational matters

since October 2010, to whom, in accordance with the Code, 
concerns can be conveyed.

performance, resources and standards of conduct, and

of financial probity on the part of the Company and to monitor 
the effectiveness of the executive Directors. Directors

The terms of reference of the Audit and Compliance 
Committee, the Remuneration Committee and the

Relations with shareholders
The Board recognises the importance of maintaining a 
purposeful relationship with the Company’s shareholders. 
The Chief Executive and the Finance Director, together 
with the Group Communications Director, meet with the 
Company’s principal institutional shareholders to discuss 
relevant issues as they arise. The Chairman maintains  
a dialogue with shareholders on strategy, corporate 
governance and Directors’ remuneration as required.
The Board receives reports from the Company’s brokers 
on shareholder issues and non-executive Directors are 
invited to attend the Company’s presentations to analysts 
and are offered the opportunity to meet shareholders.
The Company’s major shareholders are offered the 
opportunity to meet newly-appointed non-executive Directors.
The Company also uses its AGM as an opportunity to 
communicate with its shareholders. At the Meeting, business 
presentations are generally made by the Chairman and the 
Chief Executive. The Chairmen of the Remuneration, Audit 
and Compliance, and Nominations Committees are generally 
available to answer shareholders’ questions.
During the year, at the invitation of the Chairman, the 
Company’s major shareholders met with the Chairman 
and the Company Secretary to discuss matters of corporate 
governance and corporate responsibility relevant to the 
Company and its shareholders.
The 201 1 Notice of AGM was dispatched to shareholders not 
less than 20 working days before the Meeting. At that Meeting, 
voting on each resolution was taken on a poll and the poll 
results were made available on the Company’s website.
Portfolio management and voting policy
In relation to unquoted investments, the Group’s approach 
is to seek to add value to the businesses in which the 
Group invests through the Group’s extensive experience, 
resources and contacts. In relation to quoted investments, 
the Group’s policy is to exercise voting rights on matters 
affecting its interests.
The Nominations Committee agreed during the year that 
standing instructions for search agents engaged by the 
Company should be to put forward for all Board positions 
a diversity of candidates including women candidates.
Valuations Committee
The Valuations Committee comprises Mr W Mesdag 
(Chairman), Sir Adrian Montague, Mr M J Queen and 
Mrs J S Wilson, all of whom served throughout the year.
During the year, the Valuations Committee considered 
and made recommendations to the Audit and Compliance 
Committee and the Board on valuations of the Group’s 
investments to be included in the half-yearly and annual 
financial statements of the Group and reviewed valuations 
policy and methodology.
Brand and Values Committee
The Brand and Values Committee comprises Sir Adrian 
Montague (Chairman), Mr M J Queen and Mr K J Dunn, 
all of whom served throughout the year, together with 
two or more non-executive Directors determined by the 
Board from time to time.
During the year, the Brand and Values Committee 
considered and made recommendations on a range 
of matters pertaining to the Group’s reputation, brand 
and values, and its approach as a responsible investor 
and a responsible business. The Committee reviewed the 
Responsible Investment policy, the approach to membership 
of ethical indices, the brand and trends affecting reputation, 
the 3i Values workshops, reputational risks in emerging 
markets, training on responsible investment, the staff survey, 
whistle-blowing reports and the reputational risk log.
The Company Secretary
All Directors have access to the advice and services of the 
General Counsel and Company Secretary, who is responsible  
for advising the Board, through the Chairman, on governance 
matters. The Company’s Articles of Association and the 
schedule of matters reserved to the Board or its duly authorised 
committees for decision provide that the appointment and 
removal of the Company Secretary is a matter for the full Board.
78 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 The overall internal control process is regularly reviewed  
by the Board and the Audit and Compliance Committee and 
complies with the internal control guidance for Directors 
on the Code issued by the Turnbull Committee. The process 
established for the Group includes:
Policies
  core values and global policies together comprising the 
Group’s high level principles and controls, with which all 
staff are expected to comply;
  manuals of policies and procedures, applicable to all 
business units, with procedures for reporting weaknesses 
and for monitoring corrective action; and
  a code of business conduct, with procedures for reporting 
compliance therewith.
Processes
  appointment of experienced and professional staff, both 
by recruitment and promotion, of the necessary calibre to 
fulfil their allotted responsibilities;
  a planning framework which incorporates a Board approved 
strategic plan, with objectives for each business unit;
  formal business risk reviews performed by management 
which evaluate the potential financial impact and likelihood 
of identified risks and possible new risk areas;
  the setting of control, mitigation and monitoring 
procedures and the review of actual occurrences, 
identifying lessons to be learnt;
  a comprehensive system of financial reporting to the 
Board, based on an annual budget with monthly reporting 
of actual results, analysis of variances, scrutiny of key 
performance indicators and regular re-forecasting;
  regular treasury reports to the Board, which analyse the 
funding requirements of each class of assets, track the 
generation and use of capital and the volume of liquidity, 
measure the Group’s exposure to interest and exchange 
rate movements and record the level of compliance with 
the Group’s funding objectives;
  a Group Compliance function whose role is to integrate 
regulatory compliance procedures and best practices 
into the Group’s systems; and
  well defined procedures governing the appraisal and 
approval of investments, including detailed investment 
and divestment approval procedures, incorporating 
appropriate levels of authority and regular post-
investment reviews.
Internal control
The Board is responsible for the Group’s system of internal 
control and reviews its effectiveness at least annually. Such a 
system is designed to manage rather than eliminate the risk 
of failure to achieve business objectives and can provide only 
reasonable and not absolute assurance against material 
misstatement or loss.
Through the regular meetings of the Board and the schedule 
of matters reserved to the Board or its duly authorised 
committees for decision, the Board aims to maintain full 
and effective control over appropriate strategic, financial, 
operational and compliance issues.
The Board has put in place an organisational structure 
with clearly defined lines of responsibility and delegation 
of authority. The Board considers and approves a strategic 
plan regularly and approves a budget on an annual basis. 
In addition, there are established procedures and processes 
for planning and controlling expenditure and the making 
of investments. There are also information and reporting 
systems for monitoring the Group’s businesses and 
their performance.
The Group Risk Committee is a management committee 
formed by the Chief Executive and its purpose is to review 
the business of the Group in order to ensure that business 
risk is considered, assessed and managed as an integral 
part of the business. There is an ongoing process for 
identifying, evaluating and managing the Group’s significant 
risks. This process was in place for the year to 31 March 
2012 and up to the date of this report.
The Group Risk Committee’s activities are supported by the 
activities of Treasury Management Committee as well as  
the Portfolio Committee and Operating Committee. Details  
of the risk management framework can be found in the  
Risk section.

Governance Overview Verification
  an Internal Audit function which undertakes periodic 
examination of business units and processes and 
recommends improvements in controls to management;
  the external auditors who are engaged to express an 
opinion on the annual financial statements; and
  an Audit and Compliance Committee which considers 
significant control matters and receives reports from 
Internal Audit, the external auditors and Group Compliance 
on a regular basis.
The internal control system is monitored and supported 
by Internal Audit and Compliance, which operate on an 
international basis and report to management and the 
Audit and Compliance Committee on the Group’s operations. 
The work of Internal Audit is focused on the areas of greatest 
risk to the Group determined on the basis of the Group’s risk 
management process.
The external auditors independently and objectively review 
the approach of management to reporting operating results 
and financial condition. In co-ordination with Internal Audit, 
they also review and test the system of internal financial 
control and the information contained in the annual financial 
statements to the extent necessary for expressing  
their opinion.
Financial reporting
In the context of the above internal control framework, there 
are specific processes in place in relation to Financial 
Reporting, including:
  comprehensive system of key control and oversight 
processes, including regular reconciliations, line manager 
reviews and systems’ access controls;
  updates for consideration by the Audit and Compliance 
Committee of accounting developments, including draft 
and new accounting standards and legislation;
  a separate Valuations Committee which considers the 
Group’s investment valuation policies, application and 
outcome;
  approval of the Group’s budget by the Board and regular 
updates on actual and forecast financial performance 
against budget;
  reports from Internal Audit on matters relevant to 
the financial reporting process, including periodic 
assessments of internal controls, processes and 
fraud risk;
  independent updates and reports from the external 
auditors on accounting developments, application 
of accounting standards, key accounting judgements 
and observations on systems and controls; and
  regular risk reviews, including an assessment of 
risks to reliable financial reporting covering people, 
processes and systems, and updates on the management 
of identified risks or actual incidents.
Auditors’ independence and objectivity
Subject to annual appointment by shareholders, auditor 
performance is monitored on an ongoing basis and formally 
reviewed every five years, the last review being held during 
the year to 31 March 2009. Following this review the Audit 
and Compliance Committee concluded that Ernst & Young 
LLP’s appointment as the Company’s auditors should  
be continued.
The Audit and Compliance Committee recognises the 
importance of ensuring the independence and objectivity 
of the Company’s auditors. It reviews the nature and extent 
of the services provided by them, the level of their fees and 
the element comprising non-audit fees.
The Audit and Compliance Committee Chairman is notified 
of all assignments allocated to Ernst & Young over a set 
threshold, other than those related to due diligence within the 
Group’s investment process where the team engaged would 
be independent of the audit team. Safeguards have been put 
in place to reduce the likelihood of compromising auditor 
independence, including the following principles which are 
applied in respect of services provided by the auditors and 
other accounting firms and monitored by the Audit and 
Compliance Committee:
  services required to be undertaken by the auditors, 
which include regulatory returns, formalities relating to 
borrowings, shareholder and other circulars. This work 
is normally allocated directly to the auditors;
  services which it is most efficient for the auditors to 
provide. In this case, information relating to the service  
is largely derived from the Company’s audited financial 
records; for example, corporate tax services. This work is 
normally allocated to the auditors subject to consideration 
of any impact on their independence; and
  services that could be provided by a number of firms 
including general consultancy work. All significant 
consultancy projects are normally put out to tender and 
work would be allocated to the auditors only if it did not 
present a potential threat to the independence of the audit 
team. Included in this category is due diligence work 
relating to the investment process. If this service were 
to be provided by the auditors, the specific team engaged 
would be independent of the audit team.
Details of the fees paid to the auditors are disclosed in note 6 
to the financial statements.
Statutory and corporate governance information
80 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Directors’ remuneration report
Remuneration Policy for the current 
and future years
Background 
The Company’s primary reward objective is to ensure that 
the Group’s performance is sustainable over the long term, 
and that the Company’s shareholders and fund investors 
are well rewarded for their investment. The key principles 
underpinning this are that:
  Reward should be structured to support Group strategy 
and sound risk management; 
  Employees’ interests should be aligned with the long-term 
interests and returns of shareholders and, where 
applicable, fund investors;
  The Company should attract, retain and incentivise the 
required quality of staff by offering a market competitive 
total package which:
 – Reflects the individual’s current and potential value to 
the Group; and
 – Recognises business and individual financial and 
non-financial performance; and
  Particular consideration should be given to the use  
(where appropriate) of:
 – Investment staff performance metrics based on  
cash-to-cash returns or cash/fee receipts;
 – The deferral of some elements of variable pay; and
 – The requirement for staff in some situations to “co-invest” 
in shares or in one of 3i’s funds (which is in effect an 
additional form of long-term deferral).
Chairman and non-executive Directors
Fees are intended to be competitive with fees paid by 
companies of comparable size and by listed financial 
services companies. The Chairman and non-executive 
Directors are not eligible for bonuses, long-term incentives, 
pensions or performance-related remuneration. Fees 
are reviewed regularly by the Board (or, in the case of 
the Chairman’s fee, by the Committee.) No changes to 
remuneration policy for the Chairman and non-executive 
Directors are expected for the current or subsequent years.
Executive Directors
During the early part of the year the Committee reviewed 
the overall reward framework for executive Directors in the 
context of:
  The Board’s belief that management’s priorities should be 
to drive performance in the core Private Equity business 
by striking the right balance between investment and 
realisation and by optimising the performance of portfolio 
companies, whilst seeking to alleviate the volatility in the 
Group’s results, inter alia, by building on the success of the 
Infrastructure and Debt Management businesses; and
  Regulatory developments, including the FSA 
Remuneration Code.

1 April 201 1 to 31 March 2012 (“the year”). References to 
“the current year” relate to the financial year 1 April 2012 
to 31 March 2013.
Key considerations
Decisions in relation to executive Director remuneration 
taken by the Committee have been made in the context of:
  The review of the reward framework referred to below 
which took place in the early part of the year;
  The performance of the Company over the year;
  The decision of the Chief Executive to stand down once 
a successor had been appointed, which was announced 
on 29 March 2012, and his subsequent request not to be 
considered for a bonus in respect of the year; and
  The appointment to the Board earlier in the year of a new 
executive Director as Chief Investment Officer.

Governance Overview Mr M J Queen, October 201 1 for Mr S A Borrows and 
October 2008 for Mrs J S Wilson and are to remain 
unchanged for the current year. 
Annual bonuses
Executive Directors are eligible for non-pensionable 
discretionary annual bonuses. Maximum bonus opportunities 
are determined by the Committee, expressed as a multiple  
of salary. Executive Directors’ maximum bonus opportunities 
for the year were 400% of base salary for Mr M J Queen, 
300% of base salary for Mr S A Borrows and 250% of base 
salary for Mrs J S Wilson. Any bonus in excess of 100% 
of base salary is payable in shares deferred for three 
years, subject to the clawback policy. Exceptional 
performance would be required to justify an award above 
75% of the maximum.
The Committee retains discretion to make adjustments 
to bonus arrangements in appropriate circumstances.
Although the Chief Executive, Mr M J Queen, was a Director 
for the whole of the year, he asked not be considered for 
a bonus in respect of the year, given his decision to leave 
the Board following the appointment of his successor as 
Chief Executive.
The final bonus for the year was awarded against a balanced 
scorecard, with 70% of the bonus opportunity attributable 
to budgeted financial indicators (including Total Return on 
Equity, comparative gross returns, net debt and operating 
efficiency), 15% on strategic deliverables and 15% on 
personal and other internal objectives. The Committee  
uses the scorecard as a prompt and guide to judgement  
and considers it in the wider context of risk, market and  
other factors.
In determining bonus levels for the year the Committee 
considered first and foremost the overall performance of the 
Company and shareholder returns. It also took into account:
  Progress made towards reshaping the business; 
  A number of strong team performances;
  Work to strengthen the portfolio;
  The quality of recent investments; and
  The need to reward and retain key staff.
Mr S A Borrows (who was employed for approximately 
half the year) was awarded a bonus of 45% of base salary 
being 30% of his pro-rated maximum bonus opportunity. 
Mrs J S Wilson was awarded a bonus of 82.5% of base 
salary being 33% of her maximum bonus opportunity.
For the current year, executive Directors’ annual bonuses 
are expected to again be determined based on a balanced 
scorecard. It is likely the majority of the award will continue 
to be based on performance against budgeted financial 
indicators; the balance will be based on strategic deliverables 
and personal objectives. The Committee intends to finalise 
the performance indicators as soon as practicable following 
the appointment of a new Chief Executive. 
The review took account of the competitiveness of each 
executive Director’s total remuneration against comparable 
positions at FTSE 100 Financial Services companies, 
alternative investment managers and private equity firms. 
When considering the executive Directors’ remuneration, 
the Committee is also sensitive to wider issues, including 
pay and employment issues elsewhere in the Group.
As a result of the review the Committee decided to:
  Keep the fair value of the total package (including salary 
levels) unchanged;
  Increase the annual bonus opportunity, with the maximum 
cash bonus opportunity being maintained at 100% of 
salary, and with the additional opportunity being delivered 
in shares deferred for three years (rather than two years, 
as previously), subject to clawback, and to provide that 
more than 75% of the total bonus opportunity could only 
be awarded for exceptional performance;
  Use a scorecard of annual bonus metrics to drive in-year 
performance and a culture of greater accountability 
throughout the organisation; and
  Introduce new performance share arrangements to focus 
management on medium-term objectives. 
The performance shares awarded to the executive  
Directors under these new arrangements in 201 1 are  
subject to a Total Return on Equity performance condition 
measured over a three year period as set out on page 86. 
The vesting schedule reflects the Board’s desire to motivate 
management to secure consistent returns without assuming 
the incremental risk that aiming for higher returns might 
involve. To the extent the performance condition is satisfied 
shares are released on a phased basis in three annual 
instalments subject to leaver terms and to the clawback 
provision. The Committee can also reduce the percentage 
of an award which vests if it is not satisfied that the Total 
Return on Equity fairly reflects the Company’s financial 
performance or where the Group’s liabilities are not in line 
with Board policy.
Total Return on Equity is considered by the Board to be the 
key internal measure of the Group’s financial performance;  
it is highly visible and is regularly monitored and reported. 
The Committee believes that:
  Linking vesting of such awards to Total Return on Equity 
will improve participant line-of-sight, making the long-
term incentive more motivational for participants; and 
  Delivering a significant element of the remuneration 
package in shares will help align the interests of executives 
with those of shareholders. 
Further details are provided in the following sections.
Executive Director salaries
As at 31 March 2012, executive Directors’ salaries were:  
Mr M J Queen, £550,000 per annum, Mr S A Borrows, 
£475,000 per annum and Mrs J S Wilson, £400,000 per 
annum. These salaries have not increased since the 
Directors’ appointments, being January 2009 for

Long-term incentives
Executive Directors are eligible for long-term share-based 
incentives. Awards are determined each year by the 
Committee and are subject to performance conditions.
Following the review of the reward framework referred to 
above, the previous long-term incentive arrangements for 
executive Directors were changed for the grants made in the 
year. The changes were intended to focus executive Directors 
on the realisation of two core objectives, namely enhancing 
financial performance and reducing volatility. 
Long-term incentives had previously comprised grants of 
share options with performance conditions linked to NAV 
growth and Performance Share awards with performance 
conditions linked to total shareholder return compared to the 
FTSE 100 index. During the year, the Committee decided to: 
  Cease making annual share option awards to executive 
Directors, recognising the evolution of market practice. 
(The option plan remains available for use in appropriate 
changed or exceptional circumstances.) 
  Grant Performance Share awards with a face value of 
400% of base salary for the Chief Executive, 350% of salary 
for the Chief Investment Officer and 250% of salary for the 
Finance Director. 
  Apply a performance condition to the Performance Share 
awards based on three year annualised Total Return on 
Equity, with any shares which satisfy the performance 
condition being released in instalments of 50% on the third, 
25% on the fourth and 25% on the fifth anniversaries of 
grant, subject to the clawback policy.
In appropriate circumstances the Committee can also  
grant restricted shares, with no performance condition  
but subject only to leaver conditions. A one-off award was 
made to Mr S A Borrows on his appointment as a Director  
in recognition of awards forfeited on leaving previous 
employment. This award is detailed on page 85. 
Clawback policy
The Remuneration Committee has agreed a “clawback” 
policy, which applies to long-term incentive awards and 
share bonus awards made during the year to executive 
Directors (and certain other senior executives). Under this 
policy awards are subject to forfeiture or reduction (prior to 
vesting) in such exceptional circumstances as the Committee 
considers fair, reasonable and proportionate. This would 
include material misstatement of Group financial statements, 
dismissal for cause, or cases where an individual is deemed 
to have caused a material loss for the Group as a result of 
reckless, negligent or wilful actions or inappropriate values 
or behaviour.
Share ownership
The Company’s share ownership and retention policy 
requires executive Directors to build up over time, 
and thereafter maintain, a shareholding equivalent 
to at least 1.5 times salary in the Company’s shares.

Pension arrangements
Mr M J Queen and Mrs J S Wilson were members of the 3i Group Pension Plan, a defined benefit contributory scheme, in the 
year to 31 March 2012. Pension accrual ceased for all members with effect from 5 April 201 1 although a link to final salary is 
maintained for existing accrual up to the date of leaving the Company. Further details of the Plan are set out in note 9 to the 
financial statements on pages 108 and 109.
Details of Directors’ entitlements under the Plan are set out below. Each of the Directors’ total accrued pensions increased over 
the year by less than £1,000 per annum. These small increases in accrued pensions contrast with the large increases in the 
transfer values of the Directors’ pension entitlements over the year shown in the last but one column of the table. These 
transfer value increases are almost entirely the result of changes in the value placed on each £1 per annum of pension by the 
Trustees of the Plan for transfer value purposes. This value reflects financial conditions at the time of calculation as well as 
actuarial assumptions and increased over the year as a result of: changes made by the Trustees of the Plan during the year to 
the actuarial assumptions used to calculate transfer values (principally reflecting changes in the Plan’s investment strategy); 
changes to market conditions between the beginning and end of the year (principally a significant fall in gilt yields); and the 
Directors being one year older than before.

96 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Significant accounting policies
3i Group plc (the “Company”) is a company incorporated in Great Britain and registered in England and Wales. The consolidated financial statements for 
the year to 31 March 2012 comprise the financial statements of the Company and its subsidiaries (together referred to as the “Group”). Separate financial 
statements of the Company are also presented.
The accounting policies of the Company are the same as for the Group except where separately disclosed.
The financial statements were authorised for issue by the Directors on 16 May 2012.
A Statement of compliance
These consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards, International 
Accounting Standards and their interpretations issued or adopted by the International Accounting Standards Board as adopted for use in the European 
Union (“IFRS”).
These consolidated and separate financial statements have been prepared in accordance with and in compliance with the Companies Act 2006.
New standards and interpretations not applied
The IASB has issued the following standards and interpretations to be applied to financial statements with periods commencing on or after the 
following dates:
Effective for period beginning on or after
IFRS 7 Amendments enhancing disclosures about transfers of financial assets 1 July 2011
IFRS 7 Amendment to offsetting financial assets and liabilities 1 January 2013
IFRS 9 Financial instruments – classification and measurement 1 January 2013
IFRS 10 Consolidated financial statements 1 January 2013
IFRS 1 1 Joint arrangements 1 January 2013
IFRS 12 Disclosure of interest in other entities 1 January 2013
IFRS 13 Fair value measurement 1 January 2013
IAS 12 Limited scope amendment (recovery of underlying assets) 1 January 2012
IAS 19 Amendment to employee benefits 1 January 2013
IAS 27 Amendment to separate financial statements 1 January 2013
IAS 28 Amendment to Investments in associates and joint ventures 1 January 2013
IAS 32 Amendment to offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities 1 January 2014
With the exception of IFRS 10, 1 1, 12 and IAS 27 and 28 the Directors do not anticipate that the adoption of these standards and interpretations will have a 
material impact on the financial statements in the period of initial application and have decided not to adopt early.
The initial application of IFRS 10, 1 1, 12 and IAS 27 and 28 could have a material effect on the financial statements of the Group. The key impact is the 
potential consolidation of portfolio investments and funds managed by 3i in the Group financial statements. The development of these standards and 
industry interpretation is being closely monitored including the recent issue of an Investment Entity exposure draft which potentially exempts qualifying 
entities from consolidation under IFRS 10.
B Basis of preparation
The financial statements are presented in sterling, the functional currency of the Company, rounded to the nearest million pounds (£m) except where 
otherwise indicated.
The preparation of financial statements in conformity with IFRS requires management to make judgements, estimates and assumptions that affect the 
application of policies and reported amounts of assets and liabilities, income and expenses. 
The estimates and associated assumptions are based on historical experience and other factors that are believed to be reasonable under the 
circumstances, the results of which form the basis of making the judgements about carrying values of assets and liabilities that are not readily apparent 
from other sources. The most significant estimates relate to the fair valuation of the investment portfolio, the basis of consolidation and the actuarial 
valuation of the defined benefit pension scheme. These are further disclosed in accounting policies C, E and K and notes 9 and 13. The actual results may 
differ from these estimates.
The estimates and underlying assumptions are reviewed on an ongoing basis. Revisions to accounting estimates are recognised in the period in which 
the estimate is revised if the revision affects only that period, or in the period of the revision and future periods if the revision affects both current and 
future periods.
The accounting policies set out below have been applied consistently to all periods presented in these consolidated financial statements. The statement 
of comprehensive income of the Company has been omitted from these financial statements in accordance with section 408 of the Companies Act 2006.
The accounting policies have been consistently applied across all Group entities for the purposes of producing these consolidated financial statements.

Overview Financial statements Significant accounting policies
C Basis of consolidation
(i) Subsidiaries
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. Control exists when the Company has the power, directly or indirectly, to govern the financial and 
operating policies of an entity so as to obtain benefit from its activities. The financial statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial 
statements from the date that control commences until the date that control ceases.
(ii) Associates
Associates are those entities in which the Group has significant influence, but not control, over the financial and operating policies. Investments that are 
held as part of the Group’s investment portfolio are carried in the statement of financial position at fair value even though the Group may have significant 
influence over those companies. This treatment is permitted by IAS 28 Investment in Associates, which requires investments held by venture capital 
organisations to be excluded from its scope where those investments are designated, upon initial recognition, as at fair value through profit or loss and 
accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period of the change. 
The Group has no interests in associates through which it carries on its business.
(iii) Joint ventures
Interests in joint ventures that are held as part of the Group’s investment portfolio are carried in the balance sheet at fair value. This treatment is 
permitted by IAS 31 Interests in Joint Ventures, which requires venturer’s interests held by venture capital organisations to be excluded from its scope 
where those investments are designated, upon initial recognition, as at fair value through profit or loss are accounted for in accordance with IAS 39, 
with changes in fair value recognised in the statement of comprehensive income in the period of the change.
D Exchange differences
(i) Foreign currency transactions
Transactions in currencies different from the functional currency of the Group entity entering into the transaction are translated at the exchange rate 
ruling at the date of the transaction. Monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies at the balance sheet date are translated to sterling 
at the exchange rate ruling at that date.
Foreign exchange differences arising on translation are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Non-monetary assets and liabilities that 
are measured in terms of historical cost in a foreign currency are translated using the exchange rate at the date of transaction. Non-monetary assets and 
liabilities denominated in foreign currencies that are stated at fair value are translated to sterling using exchange rates ruling at the date the fair value 
was determined.
(ii) Financial statements of non-sterling operations
The assets and liabilities of operations whose functional currency is not sterling, including fair value adjustments arising on consolidation, are translated 
to sterling at exchange rates ruling at the balance sheet date. The revenues and expenses of these operations are translated to sterling at rates 
approximating to the exchange rates ruling at the dates of the transactions. Exchange differences arising on retranslation are recognised in other 
comprehensive income and accumulated within a separate component of equity, the Translation reserve, and are released upon disposal of the 
non-sterling operation.
In respect of non-sterling operations, cumulative translation differences on the consolidation of non-sterling operations are being accumulated from the 
date of transition to IFRS, 1 April 2004, and not from the original acquisition date.
E Investment portfolio
(i) Recognition and measurement
Investments are recognised and de-recognised on a date where the purchase or sale of an investment is under a contract whose terms require the 
delivery or settlement of the investment. The Group manages its investments with a view to profiting from the receipt of investment income and capital 
appreciation from changes in the fair value of equity investments.
Quoted investments are designated at fair value through profit and loss and subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value. Fair value is 
measured using the closing bid price at the reporting date, where the investment is quoted on an active stock market.
Unquoted equity investments are designated at fair value through profit and loss and are subsequently carried in the balance sheet at fair value. 
Fair value is measured using the International Private Equity and Venture Capital valuation guidelines (IPEV), details of which are in the section called 
Portfolio valuation – an explanation.
Other investments including loan investments, bonds, fixed income shares and variable funding notes are included as loans and receivables. Loans, 
bonds and fixed income shares are carried in the balance sheet at amortised cost less impairment. For more detail see the section called Portfolio 
valuation – an explanation. Variable funding notes are used to invest in debt instruments and are carried in the balance sheet at the value derived from 
the bid prices of the underlying debt instruments taking into account the Group’s obligations under the funding contract. The fair value of loans and 
receivables is not anticipated to be substantially different to the holding value.
The traded portfolio includes investments in loans and associated investments which are traded on a regular basis within Palace Street I, the Credit 
Opportunities Fund. These loans are measured at fair value through profit or loss upon initial recognition and classified as held for trading in accordance 
with IAS 39.
All investments are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration given and held at this value until it is appropriate to measure fair value on a 
different basis, applying 3i Group’s valuation policies.
98 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 (ii) Income
Gross portfolio return is equivalent to “revenue” for the purposes of IAS 1. It represents the overall increase in net assets from the investment portfolio 
net of deal-related costs but excluding exchange movements. Investment income is analysed into the following components:
(a) Realised profits or losses over value on the disposal of investments are the difference between the fair value of the consideration received less any 
directly attributable costs, on the sale of equity, traded loans and the repayment of loans and receivables, and its carrying value at the start of the 
accounting period, converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of disposal.
(b) Unrealised profits or losses on the revaluation of investments are the movement in the carrying value of investments between the start and end 
of the accounting period converted into sterling using the exchange rates in force at the date of the movement.
(c) Portfolio income is that portion of income that is directly related to the return from individual investments. It is recognised to the extent that it is 
probable that there will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably measured. The following specific recognition criteria must be met before 
the income is recognised:
  Dividends from equity investments are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income when the shareholders’ rights to receive payment 
have been established.
  Income from loans and receivables and the traded portfolio is recognised as it accrues by reference to the principal outstanding and the effective 
interest rate applicable, which is the rate that exactly discounts the estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the financial asset to the 
asset’s carrying value.
  Fee income is earned directly from investee companies when an investment is first made and through the life of the investment. Fees that are 
earned on a financing arrangement are considered to relate to a financial asset measured at fair value through profit or loss and are recognised 
when that investment is made. Fees that are earned on the basis of providing an ongoing service to the investee company are recognised as that 
service is provided.
F Fees receivable from external funds
(i) Fund management fees
The Group manages private equity, infrastructure and debt management funds. Fees earned from the ongoing management of these funds are 
recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably measured.
(ii) Advisory fees
The Group acts as investment adviser to private equity funds. Fees earned from the provision of investment advisory services are recognised on an 
accruals basis in accordance with the substance of the relevant investment advisory agreement.
(iii) Performance fees
The Group earns a performance fee from funds to which it provides investment advisory services where specified performance targets are achieved. 
Performance fees are recognised to the extent that it is probable that there will be economic benefit and the income can be reliably measured.
(iv) Support services fees
The Group provides support services to external funds, including accounting, treasury management, corporate secretariat and investor relations. Fees 
earned from the provision of these support services are recognised on an accruals basis in accordance with the relevant support services agreement.
G Carried interest
(i) Carried interest receivable
The Group earns a share of profits (“carried interest receivable”) from funds which it manages on behalf of third parties. These profits are earned once 
the funds meet certain performance conditions.
Carried interest receivable is only accrued on those managed funds in which the fund’s performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, 
would be achieved if the remaining assets in the fund were realised at fair value. Fair value is determined using the Group’s valuation methodology and is 
measured at the balance sheet date. An accrual is made equal to the Group’s share of profits in excess of the performance conditions, taking into account 
the cash already returned to fund investors and the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
(ii) Carried interest payable
The Group offers investment executives the opportunity to participate in the returns from successful investments. “Carried interest payable” is the term 
used for amounts payable to executives on investment-related transactions.
A variety of asset pooling arrangements are in place so that executives may have an interest in one or more carried interest scheme. Carried interest 
payable is only accrued on those schemes in which the scheme’s performance conditions, measured at the balance sheet date, would be achieved if the 
remaining assets in the scheme were realised at fair value. An accrual is made equal to the executive’s share of profits in excess of the performance 
conditions in place in the carried interest scheme.
H Intangible assets
Fund management contracts, acquired by the Group in connection with the acquisition of a subsidiary, are stated at their fair value at the date of 
acquisition less accumulated amortisation and impairment losses. Amortisation is charged to the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line 
basis over the estimated useful life of the fund management contract, typically five to 10 years.

Portfolio and other 
information
Overview Financial statements Significant accounting policies
I Property, plant and equipment
(i) Land and buildings
Land and buildings are carried in the balance sheet at fair value less depreciation and impairment. Fair value is determined at each balance sheet date 
from valuations undertaken by professional valuers using market-based evidence. Any revaluation surplus is recognised in other comprehensive income 
and credited to the Capital reserve except to the extent that it reverses a previous valuation deficit on the same asset recognised in profit or loss in which 
case the surplus is recognised in profit or loss to the extent of the previous deficit.
Any revaluation deficit that offsets a previously recognised surplus in the same asset is directly offset against the surplus in the Capital reserve. 
Any excess valuation deficit over and above that previously recognised in surplus is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income.
Depreciation on revalued buildings is charged in the statement of comprehensive income over their estimated useful life, generally over 50 years.
(ii) Vehicles and office equipment
Vehicles and office equipment are depreciated by equal annual instalments over their estimated useful lives as follows: office equipment five years; 
computer equipment three years; computer software three years; motor vehicles four years.
(iii) Assets held under finance leases
Assets held under finance leases are depreciated over their expected useful life on the same basis as owned assets or, where shorter, the lease term. 
Assets are reviewed for impairment when events or changes in circumstances indicate that the carrying amount may not be recoverable. The interest 
element of the rental obligations is charged in the statement of comprehensive income over the period of the agreement and represents a constant 
proportion of the balance of capital repayments outstanding.
J T reasury assets and liabilities
Short-term treasury assets and short and long-term treasury liabilities are used in order to manage cash flows and overall costs of borrowing. Financial 
assets and liabilities are recognised in the balance sheet when the relevant Group entity becomes a party to the contractual provisions of the instrument. 
De-recognition occurs when rights to cash flows from a financial asset expire, or when a liability is extinguished.
(i) Cash and cash equivalents
Cash and cash equivalents in the balance sheet comprise cash at bank and in hand and short-term deposits with an original maturity of three months 
or less. For the purposes of the cash flow statement, cash and cash equivalents comprise cash and short-term deposits as defined above and other 
short-term highly liquid investments that are readily convertible into cash and are subject to insignificant risk of changes in value, net of bank overdrafts.
(ii) Deposits
Deposits in the balance sheet comprise longer term deposits with an original maturity of greater than three months.
(iii) Bank loans, loan notes and borrowings
All loans and borrowings are initially recognised at the fair value of the consideration received net of issue costs associated with the borrowings. After 
initial recognition, these are subsequently measured at amortised cost using the effective interest method, which is the rate that exactly discounts the 
estimated future cash flows through the expected life of the liabilities. Amortised cost is calculated by taking into account any issue costs and any 
discount or premium on settlement.
(iv) Convertible bonds
The convertible bonds are cash settled and are regarded as compound instruments consisting of a liability and a derivative instrument (see policy below 
for derivatives). Subsequent to initial recognition the conversion option is measured as a derivative financial instrument with the market value of the 
instrument at period end used as its fair value. The remainder of the proceeds are allocated to the liability component and this amount is carried as a 
liability on the amortised cost basis until extinguished on conversion, redemption or repurchase.
(v) Derivative financial instruments
Derivative financial instruments are used to manage the risk associated with foreign currency fluctuations of the investment portfolio and changes 
in interest rates on its borrowings. This is achieved by the use of foreign exchange contracts, currency swaps and interest rate swaps. All derivative 
financial instruments are held at fair value.
Derivative financial instruments are recognised initially at fair value on the contract date and subsequently re-measured to the fair value at each 
reporting date. The fair value of forward exchange contracts is calculated by reference to current forward exchange contracts for contracts with similar 
maturity profiles. The fair value of currency swaps and interest rate swaps is determined with reference to future cash flows and current interest and 
exchange rates. All changes in the fair value of financial instruments are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
100 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 K Employee benefits
(i) Retirement benefit costs
Payments to defined contribution retirement benefit plans are charged to the statement of comprehensive income as they fall due.
For defined benefit retirement plans, the cost of providing benefits is determined using the projected unit method with actuarial valuations being carried 
out at each balance sheet date. Current service costs are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income. Actuarial gains or losses are recognised 
in full as they arise in other comprehensive income.
A retirement benefit deficit is recognised in the balance sheet to the extent that the present value of the defined benefit obligations exceeds the fair value 
of plan assets.
A retirement benefit surplus is recognised in the balance sheet where the fair value of plan assets exceeds the present value of the defined benefit 
obligations limited to the extent that the Group can benefit from that surplus.
(ii) Share-based payments
The costs of share-based payments made by the Company in respect of subsidiaries’ employees are treated as additional investments in those 
subsidiaries.
The Group enters into arrangements that are equity-settled share-based payments with certain employees. These are measured at fair value at the 
date of grant, which is then recognised in the statement of comprehensive income on a straight-line basis over the vesting period, based on the Group’s 
estimate of shares that will eventually vest. Fair value is measured by use of an appropriate model. In valuing equity-settled transactions, no account is 
taken of any vesting conditions, other than conditions linked to the price of the shares of 3i Group plc. The charge is adjusted at each balance sheet date 
to reflect the actual number of forfeitures, cancellations and leavers during the period. The movement in cumulative charges since the previous balance 
sheet is recognised in the statement of comprehensive income, with a corresponding entry in equity.
L Other assets
Assets, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated at their cost less impairment losses. They are reviewed at each 
balance sheet date to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated 
based on expected discounted future cash flows. Any change in the level of impairment is recognised directly in the statement of comprehensive income. 
An impairment loss is reversed at subsequent balance sheet dates to the extent that the asset’s carrying amount does not exceed its carrying value had 
no impairment been recognised.
M Other liabilities
Liabilities, other than those specifically accounted for under a separate policy, are stated based on the amounts which are considered to be payable in 
respect of goods or services received up to the balance sheet date.
N Share capital
Ordinary shares issued by the Group are recognised at the proceeds or fair value received with the excess of the amount received over nominal value 
being credited to the share premium account. Direct issue costs net of tax are deducted from equity.
O Provisions
Provisions are recognised when the Group has a present obligation of uncertain timing or amount as a result of past events, and it is probable that the 
Group will be required to settle that obligation and a reliable estimate of that obligation can be made. The provisions are measured at the Directors’ best 
estimate of the amount to settle the obligation at the balance sheet date, and are discounted to present value if the effect is material. Changes in 
provisions are recognised in the statement of comprehensive income for the period.
P Income taxes
Income taxes represent the sum of the tax currently payable, withholding taxes suffered and deferred tax. T ax is charged or credited in the statement of 
comprehensive income, except where it relates to items charged or credited directly to equity, in which case the tax is also dealt with in equity.
The tax currently payable is based on the taxable profit for the year. This may differ from the profit included in the statement of comprehensive income 
because it excludes items of income or expense that are taxable or deductible in other years and it further excludes items that are never taxable or 
deductible. 
Deferred tax is the tax expected to be payable or recoverable on differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities in the financial 
statements and the corresponding tax bases used in the computation of taxable profit (“temporary differences”), and is accounted for using the balance 
sheet liability method.
Deferred tax liabilities are generally recognised for all taxable temporary differences. Where there are taxable differences arising on investments in 
subsidiaries and associates, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax liabilities are recognised except where the Group is able to control reversal of the 
temporary difference and it is probable that the temporary differences will reverse in the foreseeable future.
Deferred tax assets are generally recognised to the extent that it is probable that taxable profits will be available against which deductible temporary 
differences can be utilised. However, where there are deductible temporary differences arising from investments in subsidiaries, branches and 
associates, and interests in joint ventures, deferred tax assets are recognised only to the extent that it is probable that both the temporary differences will 
reverse in the foreseeable future and taxable profits will be available against which the temporary differences can be utilised.
Deferred tax is calculated at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the period when the liability is settled or the asset is realised using tax rates and 
laws that have been enacted or substantively enacted by the balance sheet date.

1 Segmental analysis
Operating segments are components of the entity whose results are regularly reviewed by the entity’s chief operating decision-maker to make decisions 
about resources to be allocated to the segment and to assess its performance. The chief operating decision-maker for the Group is considered to be 
the Chief Executive Officer. The Group’s operating segments have been defined as the Group’s business lines, namely Private Equity, Infrastructure, 
Debt Management and Non-core Investments. The business lines are determined with reference to market focus, geographic focus, and investment 
funding model. 
The Private Equity business was restructured in the second half of the year to align with the Group’s Leadership Team focus on the developed (US and 
European) markets and the developing (India, China, Latin American) markets. The Private Equity business line has been segregated accordingly.
The performance of operating segments is assessed based on the net portfolio return, principally comprising gains and losses on investments and 
investment income, fees received from management of external funds and the associated costs of the business line. Segmental assets are represented 
by the investment portfolio value for each business line.

Carried interest receivable represents the Group’s share of profits from external funds. Each fund is reviewed at the balance sheet date and income is 
accrued based on fund profits in excess of the performance conditions within the fund, taking into account cash already returned to fund investors and 
the fair value of assets remaining in the fund.
Carried interest and performance fees payable represents the amount payable to executives from the Group’s carried interest schemes and also 
includes the fees payable to Infrastructure and Debt Management executives that are based on fund performance. As with carried interest receivable, 
each scheme is separately reviewed at the balance sheet date, and an accrual made equal to the executives’ share of profits once the performance 
conditions in the scheme have been met.

In addition to the above, Ernst & Young LLP has received fees from investee companies. It is estimated that Ernst & Young LLP receive less than 20% of 
the total investment-related fees paid to the four largest accounting firms.
Ernst & Young LLP also acts as auditor to the 3i Group Pension Plan. The appointment of the auditors to this Plan and the fees paid in respect of the audit 
are agreed by the trustees who act independently from the management of the Group. The aggregate fees paid to the Group’s auditors for audit services 
to the pension scheme during the year were less than £0.1 million (201 1: less than £0.1 million).

The features of the Group’s share schemes are set out on the following page. For legal, regulatory or practical reasons certain participants may be 
granted “phantom awards” under these schemes, which are intended to replicate the financial effects of a share award without entitling the participant 
to acquire shares. The carrying amount of liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions at 31 March 2012 is £1 million (201 1: £2 million). 
The intrinsic value of liabilities arising from share-based payment transactions which have vested by 31 March 2012 is £nil (201 1: £nil).

The awards outstanding at the end of the year have a weighted average contractual life of 8.84 years (201 1: 6.21 years). The cost of share awards is 
spread over the vesting period of two to three years. 
A summary of the vesting conditions of share awards is as follows:
Performance share awards (market condition)
The performance condition for Performance shares issued before July 201 1 is based on the outperformance of the theoretical growth in value of a 
shareholding in the Company (with dividends reinvested) for the three year performance period from grant (averaged over a 60-day period) compared 
to the growth in value of the FTSE 100 Index (with dividends reinvested) adjusted for mergers, demergers and de-listings over that period.
Performance share awards (non market condition)
Performance shares issued after June 201 1 will vest, subject to a vesting scale, if the annualised growth of the Group’s return on opening equity during 
the three year performance period equals or exceeds 10% per annum.
Performance-based awards
During the year share awards were made to certain investment executives. This plan operates in a similar format to a carry scheme where a percentage 
of shares will vest once a realised profit hurdle has been achieved on a defined group of assets.
Deferred share bonus
Certain employees receive an element of their bonus as a conditional award of shares which vest after two or three years. The awards are not subject 
to a performance condition. The fair value of the deferred shares is the share price at the date of the award.
Deferred share awards
Certain employees receive awards of Deferred Shares which vest after two or three years subject to continued service for that period. These awards 
are not subject to a performance condition. The fair value of the deferred shares is the share price at the date of the award.
Share incentive plan
Eligible UK employees may participate in a HM Revenue and Customs approved Share Incentive Plan intended to encourage employees to invest in 
the Company’s shares. Accordingly it is not subject to a performance condition. During the year participants invested up to £125 per month from their 
pre-tax salaries in the Company’s shares (referred to as partnership shares). For each share so acquired the Company grants two free additional 
shares (referred to as matching shares) which are normally subject to forfeiture if the employee ceases to be employed (other than for certain permitted 
reasons) within three years of grant. 
Employee Share Investment Plan
In conjunction with the June 2009 rights issue, eligible employees could subscribe for between £5,000 and £1.5 million of ordinary shares at market price. 
Employees were then granted one matching share for every two ordinary shares purchased, which are normally subject to forfeiture if the employee 
ceases to be employed (other than for certain permitted reasons) within three years of grant. The matching shares are also subject to the condition that 
fully diluted NAV per share grows by 35% or more between 31 March 2009 and 31 March 2012. This condition has not been met.
Employee Trust
The Group has established the 3i Group Employee Trust which holds shares in 3i Group plc which can be used to meet its obligations under certain share 
schemes. The Trustee has full discretion as to the application of trust assets. However, in accordance with IAS 27 Consolidated and Separate Financial 
Statements, 3i Group plc is considered the ultimate controlling party for accounting purposes and the operations of the 3i Group Employee Trust are fully 
consolidated by the Group.

Retirement benefit plans
(i) Defined contribution plans
The Group operates a number of defined contribution retirement benefit plans for qualifying employees throughout the Group. The assets of these plans 
are held separately from those of the Group. The employees of the Group’s subsidiaries in France are members of a state-managed retirement benefit 
plan operated by the country’s government. 3i Europe plc’s french branch is required to contribute a specific percentage of payroll costs to the retirement 
benefit scheme to fund the benefits.
The total expense recognised in the statement of comprehensive income is £4 million (201 1: £3 million), which represents the contributions payable to 
these plans. There were no outstanding payments due to these plans at the balance sheet date.
(ii) Defined benefit schemes
The Group operates a final salary defined benefit plan for qualifying employees of its subsidiaries in the UK (“the Plan”). The Plan has not been offered 
to new employees joining 3i since 1 April 2006. The Plan was closed to the future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5 April 201 1, although 
the final salary link will be maintained on existing accruals. Members of the Plan have been invited to join the Group’s defined contribution plan with effect 
from 6 April 201 1. The defined benefit plan is a funded scheme, the assets of which are independent of the Company’s finances and are administered by 
the Trustees.
The last full actuarial valuation as at 30 June 2010 was updated on an IAS 19 basis by an independent qualified actuary as at 31 March 2012. As the fund 
is now closed to future accrual measures have been taken to de-risk the fund through changes to its investment policy.
The principal assumptions made by the actuaries and used for the purpose of the year end valuation of the Plan were as follows:
2012 201 1
Discount rate 4.6% 5.5%
Expected rate of salary increases 5.7% 5.9%
Expected rate of pension increases 3.4% 3.5%
Retail Price Index (RPI) inflation 3.2% 3.4%
Consumer Price Index (CPI) inflation 2.5% 2.7%
Expected return on the Plan assets 4.6% 6.0%
The post-retirement mortality assumption used to value the benefit obligation at 31 March 2012 is 80% of the PNA00 tables allowing for improvements 
from 2000 in line with the CMI 2009 core projections with a long-term annual rate of improvement of 1.5% (31 March 201 1: 80% of the PNA00 tables 
allowing for improvements from 2000 in line with the medium cohort projections subject to a minimum annual rate of future improvement of 1.5%). 
The life expectancy of a male member reaching age 60 in 2032 (201 1: 2031) is projected to be 33.1 (201 1: 34.1) years compared to 30.6 (201 1: 30.7) years 
for someone reaching 60 in 2012.

The cumulative actuarial losses recognised in other comprehensive income are £168 million (201 1: £102 million). This includes £49 million 
(201 1: £39 million) in respect of the asset restriction.
As the Plan was closed to future accrual of benefits by members with effect from 5 April 201 1 the Group ceased to make regular contributions to the Plan 
in the year to 31 March 2012. The triennial actuarial funding valuation as at 30 June 2010 was completed in September 201 1. This resulted in an actuarial 
deficit of £130 million. The Group has paid contributions to the Plan to fund this deficit. Under an agreed schedule of contributions, the Group paid 
contributions of £72 million during the year, included within operating expenses in the Group cash flow statement, and the final payment of £36 million  
on 30 April 2012. No more additional contributions are due in relation to the funding of the deficit.
Other retirement schemes
Employees in Germany and Spain are entitled to a pension based on their length of service. 3i Deutschland GmbH and the German and Spanish branches 
of 3i Europe plc contribute to individual investment policies for its employees and have agreed to indemnify any shortfall on an employee’s investment 
policy should it arise. The total value of these investment policies intended to cover pension liabilities is £4 million (201 1: £10 million) and the future liability 
calculated by German and Spanish actuaries is £14 million (201 1: £14 million). The Group has recognised cumulative actuarial losses of £1 million  
(201 1: £nil) and £1 million (201 1: £1 million) in the statement of comprehensive income in respect of these schemes.

The Group’s realised profits, fair value adjustments and impairment losses are primarily included in the Company, the affairs of which are directed so as 
to allow it to be approved as an investment trust. An investment trust is exempt from tax on capital gains, therefore the Group’s capital return will be 
largely non-taxable.

At 31 March 2012 the Company had tax losses carried forward of £977 million (201 1: £885 million). It is unlikely that the Group will generate sufficient 
taxable profits in the future to utilise these amounts and therefore no deferred tax asset has been recognised in respect of these losses. Deferred income 
taxes are calculated using an expected rate of corporation tax in the UK of 24% (201 1: 26%).

The holding period of 3i’s investment portfolio is on average greater than one year. For this reason the portfolio is classified as non-current. It is not 
possible to identify with certainty investments that will be sold within one year.
Additions to loans and receivables includes £163 million (201 1: £158 million) of interest received by way of loan notes. A corresponding amount has been 
included in income from loans and receivables.
Other movements include foreign exchange and conversions from one instrument into another. 
Included within the statement of comprehensive income are foreign exchange losses of £243 million (201 1: £135 million loss). This includes exchange 
movements on non-monetary items (eg equity investment portfolio) and on monetary items (eg non-sterling loans and borrowings). Of this, foreign 
exchange losses on monetary items not measured at fair value total £83 million (201 1: £4 1 million).

Fair value hierarchy
The Group classifies financial instruments measured at fair value in the investment portfolio according to the following hierarchy:
Level Fair value input description Financial instruments
Level 1 Quoted prices (unadjusted) from active markets Quoted equity instruments
Level 2 Inputs other than quoted prices included in Level 1 that  
are observable either directly (ie as prices) or indirectly  
(ie derived from prices)
Level 3 Inputs that are not based on observable market data Unquoted equity instruments, variable funding note  
and loan instruments included in the traded portfolio  
(Palace Street I)
Unquoted equity instruments and debt instruments included in the traded portfolio are measured in accordance with the International Private Equity 
and Venture Capital valuation guidelines with reference to the most appropriate information available at the time of measurement. Further information 
regarding the valuation of unquoted equity instruments can be found in the section Portfolio valuation – an explanation.
The variable funding note relating to the Debt Warehouse was sold during the year to 31 March 2012. It is included within the loans and receivables 
balance at a carrying value of £5 million at 31 March 201 1. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy the variable funding note is classified as Level 3. 
The variable funding note had investment of £47 million, revaluation of £1 million and generated interest income and fees of £7 million in the prior year. 
The variable funding note also had foreign exchange movements of £3 million in the prior year.
The Group’s investment portfolio for equity instruments, variable funding note and traded portfolio through Palace Street I are classified by the fair value

Unquoted equity investments valued using Level 3 inputs also had the following impact on the statement of comprehensive income; realised profits over 
value on disposal of investment of £40 million (201 1: £104 million), dividend income of £29 million (201 1: £25 million) and foreign exchange losses of 
£48 million (201 1: £28 million).
Level 3 inputs are sensitive to assumptions made when ascertaining fair value as described in the Portfolio valuation – an explanation section. 
A reasonable alternative assumption would be to apply a standard marketability discount of 5% for all assets rather than the specific approach adopted. 
This would have a positive impact on the portfolio of £100 million (201 1: £146 million) or 7% (201 1: 7%) of total unquoted equity value.

15 Acquisition of a subsidiary
No acquisitions were made in the year ending 31 March 2012. However in the prior year, on 15 February 201 1, Mizuho Investment Management (UK) 
Limited (“MIM”), one of the leading debt management businesses in Europe, became a subsidiary of the Group. MIM has since changed its name to  
3i Debt Management Investments Limited. The acquisition formed part of the Group’s strategy to build its Debt Management business line.
The acquisition of MIM was effected by 3i Debt Management Limited (“3iDM”) on 15 February 201 1. 3iDM paid cash consideration of £18 million for 100% 
of the issued share capital of MIM. The equity shares of 3iDM are owned 55% by the Group and 45% by the management team of MIM.
The Group entered into agreements to purchase this remaining 45% of the equity of 3iDM from the management team over the next five years, with the 
price subject to the performance of 3iDM and its subsidiaries. After the year end the Group entered into agreements to purchase 2.7% of the remaining 
45% equity from a member of the management team who is no longer employed by 3iDM.
In accordance with IFRS 3, the purchase of the management team’s equity holding or “earn-out” was reflected in two parts:
£13 million deferred consideration, for the transfer of the remaining 45% of the shares held by MIM management over five years. This was recognised on 
acquisition and is carried as a liability on the Group balance sheet. 
The remaining amount is contingent on the individuals remaining in employment with 3i and 3iDM. The amount will be determined by the performance 
of 3iDM during the five-year period and will be recognised in the statement of comprehensive income as carried interest and performance fees payable.

The measurement of fair value of the net assets obtained resulted in a gain on bargain purchase of £3 million which was recognised in other income 
in the statement of comprehensive income in the year to 31 March 201 1.
From the date of acquisition to 31 March 201 1, MIM contributed £2 million to management fees, and incurred operating expenses and amortisation 
of the fund management contracts of £2 million, which resulted in an overall charge of £nil to the net profit before tax of the Group. 
If the combination had taken place at the beginning of the year to 31 March 201 1, the contribution to the Group’s revenue from continuing operations 
would have been £16 million and the profit from continuing operations for the Group would have been £5 million.
Transaction costs of £4 million were charged to operating expenses in the prior year. 
The Group also acquired equity investments in the funds managed by MIM, on which the unrealised profit on revaluation in the period to 31 March 201 1 
was £7 million.

19 Financial risk management
Introduction
A review of the Group’s objectives, policies and processes for managing and monitoring risk is set out in the Risk section. This note provides further 
detail on financial risk management, cross-referring to the Risk section where applicable, and includes quantitative data on specific financial risks.
The Group is a highly selective investor and each investment is subject to a risk assessment through an investment approval process. The Group’s 
Investment Committee is part of the overall risk management framework set out in the Risk section.
Capital structure
The capital structure of the Group consists of net debt, including cash held on deposit, and shareholders’ equity. The type and maturity of the Group’s 
borrowings are analysed further in note 21 and the Group’s equity is analysed into its various components in the statement of changes in equity. 
Capital is managed so as to maximise long-term return to shareholders, whilst maintaining a capital base to allow the Group to operate effectively 
in the marketplace and sustain future development of the business.

Capital constraints
The Group is generally free to transfer capital from subsidiary undertakings to the parent company subject to maintaining each subsidiary with sufficient 
reserves to meet local statutory obligations. No significant constraints have been identified in the past and the Group has been able to distribute profits in 
a tax-efficient manner. 
The Group’s regulated capital requirement is reviewed regularly by the Board of 3i Investments plc, an investment firm that is regulated by the FSA. 
The last submission to the FSA demonstrated a significant consolidated capital surplus in excess of the FSA’s prudential rules. The Group’s capital 
requirement is updated annually following approval of the Group’s Internal Capital Adequacy Assessment Process (ICAAP) report by the Board of  
3i Investments plc. The Group complies with the Individual Capital Guidance as agreed with the FSA and remains at a significant regulatory capital 
surplus. The Group’s Pillar 3 disclosure document can be found on www.3igroup.com.
Financial risks
Concentration risk
The Group’s exposure to and mitigation of concentration risk is explained within the “investment” and “treasury and funding” sections in the Risk section. 
Quantitative data regarding the concentration risk of the portfolio across geographies can be found in note 1, segmental analysis.
Credit risk
The Group is subject to credit risk on its loans, traded portfolio, receivables, cash and deposits. The Group’s cash and deposits are held with a variety 
of counterparties with circa 4 1 % of the Group’s surplus cash held on demand in AAA Liquidity funds. The balance is held on short-term deposit with 
3i’s relationship banks. The credit quality of loans and receivables within the investment portfolio is based on the financial performance of the individual 
portfolio companies. For those assets that are not past due it is believed that the risk of default is small and that capital repayments and interest 
payments will be made in accordance with the agreed terms and conditions of the Group’s investment. Where the portfolio company has failed or is 
expected to fail in the next 12 months, the Group’s policy is to record a provision for the full amount of the loan. Loan impairments are made when the 
valuation of the portfolio company implies non-recovery of all or part of the Group’s loan investment. In these cases an appropriate loan impairment 
is recorded to reflect the valuation shortfall. Further information on how credit risk is managed is given in the Risk section. In accordance with IFRS 7 , 
the amounts shown as past due represent the total credit exposure, not the amount actually past due.

Market risk
The valuation of the Group’s investment portfolio is largely dependent on the underlying trading performance of the companies within the portfolio but 
the valuation and other items in the financial statements can also be affected by interest rate, currency and quoted market fluctuations. The Group’s 
sensitivity to these items is set out below.
(i) Interest rate risk
Further information on how interest rate risk is managed is provided in the Risk section. The direct impact of a movement in interest rates is relatively 
small. An increase of 100 basis points would lead to an approximate increase in net assets of £6 million (201 1: £5 million increase) for the Group and 
£7 million (201 1: £6 million increase) for the Company. This increase arises principally from changes in interest receivable and payable on floating rate, 
short-term instruments, including cash and deposits in the current year. In addition the Group and Company have indirect exposure to interest rates 
through changes to the financial performance of portfolio companies caused by interest rate fluctuations.
118 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 19 Financial risk management (continued)
(ii) Currency risk
The Group’s net assets in euro, US dollar, Swedish krona, Indian rupee, Chinese renminbi and all other currencies combined is shown in the table below. 
This sensitivity analysis is performed based on the sensitivity of the Group and Company’s net assets to movements in foreign currency exchange rates 
assuming a 5% movement in exchange rates against sterling. The Group manages currency risk on a consolidated basis. Further information on how 
currency risk is managed is provided in the Risk section.

Forward foreign exchange contracts
The Group continued in its use of derivatives to hedge exchange movements on its US dollar and euro portfolio.
The contracts entered into by the Group are principally denominated in the currencies of the geographic areas in which the Group operates. The fair value 
of these contracts is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet 
date. No contracts are designated as hedging instruments, as defined in IAS 39, and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to profit and loss.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount of outstanding forward foreign exchange contracts was £549 million (201 1: £603 million).
Interest rate swaps
The Group has one interest rate derivative. The fair value of this contract is recorded in the balance sheet and is determined by discounting future 
cash flows at the prevailing market rates at the balance sheet date. This contract is not designated as a hedging instrument, as defined in IAS 39, 
and consequently all changes in fair value are taken to the statement of comprehensive income.
At the balance sheet date, the notional amount outstanding of the variable rate to variable rate swap was £150 million.
The Group does not trade in derivatives. In general, derivatives held hedge specific exposures and have maturities designed to match the exposures 
they are hedging. It is the intention to hold both the financial instruments giving rise to the exposure and the derivative hedging them until maturity and 
therefore no net gain or loss is expected to be realised.
The derivatives are held at fair value which represents the replacement cost of the instruments at the balance sheet date. Movements in the fair value of 
derivatives are included in the statement of comprehensive income. In accordance with the fair value hierarchy described in note 13, derivative financial 
instruments are measured using Level 2 inputs.
Derivative assets and liabilities have been reclassified for prior periods between current and non-current positions to reflect the maturity of long-dated 
interest rate swaps.

The £300 million multi-currency facility was refinanced to £450 million with maturity extended from October 2012 to June 2016.
The Group is subject to a financial covenant on its committed multi-currency facilities, the Asset Cover Ratio, defined as total assets (including cash) 
divided by loans and borrowings plus derivative financial liabilities. The Asset Cover Ratio limit is 1.45 at 31 March 2012 (201 1: 1.40), the Asset Cover Ratio 
at 31 March 2012 is 2.82 (201 1: 2.82).
All of the Group’s borrowings are repayable in one instalment on the respective maturity dates. None of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and 
borrowings are secured on the assets of the Group. The fair value of the loans and borrowings is £1,581 million (201 1: £1,875 million), determined where 
applicable with reference to their published market price.

Overview Portfolio and other 
information Portfolio valuation – an explanation
Policy
Our policy is to value 3i’s investment portfolio at fair value 
and achieve this by valuing individual investments on an 
appropriate basis using a consistent approach across the 
portfolio. The Group’s valuation policy is the responsibility 
of the Board and is reviewed by the Board’s Valuations 
Committee at least annually. The policy ensures that the 
portfolio valuation is compliant with the fair value guidelines 
under IFRS and, in so doing, is also compliant with the 
guidelines issued by the International Private Equity and 
Venture Capital valuation board (the “IPEV guidelines”). 
The policy covers the Group’s Private Equity, Infrastructure 
and Debt Management investment valuations.
Fair value is the underlying principle and is defined as 
“the price at which an orderly transaction would take 
place between market participants at the reporting date” 
(IPEV guidelines, September 2009). Fair value is therefore 
an estimate and, as such, determining fair value requires 
the use of judgement.
Private Equity valuation
Determining enterprise value
To arrive at the fair value of the Group’s Private Equity 
investments, we first estimate the entire value of the 
company we have invested in – the enterprise value. 
This enterprise value is determined using one of a 
selection of methodologies depending on the nature, 
facts and circumstances of the investment.
Where possible, we use methodologies which draw 
heavily on observable market prices, whether listed equity 
markets or reported merger and acquisition transactions.
The quoted assets in our portfolio are valued at their 
closing bid price on the balance sheet date.
The majority of the rest of our portfolio, however, is 
represented by unquoted investments. These are valued, 
in the vast majority of cases, with reference to market 
comparables, or to recent reported transactions. 
As unquoted investments are not traded on an active 
market, as quoted investments are, the Group adjusts 
the estimated enterprise value by a marketability or 
liquidity discount. The marketability or liquidity discount is 
applied to the total enterprise value and we apply a higher 
discount rate for investments where there are material 
restrictions on our ability to sell at a time of our choosing.
The table on page 132 outlines in more detail the range 
of valuation methodologies available to us, as well as the 
inputs and adjustments necessary for each.
The Group’s valuation policy is the responsibility of the Board, with additional 
oversight from the Board’s Valuations Committee. This section sets out our 
valuation policy in detail and explains how we value investments in each of 
our business lines.
130 3i Group plc Annual report and accounts 2012 Assets classified as “terminal”
If we believe an investment has more than a 50% probability 
of failing in the 12 months following the valuation date,  
we value the investment on the basis of its expected 
recoverable amount in the event of failure. It is important  
to distinguish between our investment failing and the 
business failing; the failure of our investment does not 
always mean that the business has failed, just that our 
recoverable value has dropped significantly. This would 
generally result in the equity and loan components of our 
investment being valued at nil.
Infrastructure valuation
The primary valuation methodology used for infrastructure 
investments is the discounted cash flow method (“DCF”). 
Fair value is estimated by deriving the present value of 
the investment using reasonable assumptions of expected 
future cash flows and the terminal value and date, and 
the appropriate risk-adjusted discount rate that quantifies 
the risk inherent to the investment. The discount rate is 
estimated with reference to the market risk-free rate, a risk 
adjusted premium and information specific to the investment 
or market sector.
Currently, the Group’s investment in the Infrastructure 
business line predominantly consists of the investment 
in the quoted vehicle, 3i Infrastructure plc, and the 
unquoted portfolio in the 3i India Infrastructure Fund. 
These vehicles use DCF as the primary method of valuing 
their underlying portfolio.
Debt Management valuation
The Group’s Debt Management business line typically 
invests in traded debt instruments and the subordinated 
notes that it is required to hold in the debt funds which it 
manages. The traded debt instruments are valued using 
an average of broker quotes available, reflecting the best 
available market observable data.
The subordinated notes that it is required to hold in the debt 
funds are also valued using average broker quotes in the first 
instance. Where broker quotes are unavailable or deemed 
unreliable, ie in the absence of an orderly market or where 
transactions take place in a market where the motivations of 
buyers and sellers is not fully transparent, then the net asset 
value of the fund can be used to determine the valuation of 
the equity investment.
Apportioning the enterprise value 
between 3i, other shareholders and 
lenders
Once we have estimated the enterprise value using one  
of the methodologies outlined in the table on page 132,  
the following steps are taken:
1. We subtract the value of any claims, net of free cash 
balances, that are more senior to the most senior of 
our investments;
2. The resulting attributable enterprise value is apportioned 
to the Group’s investment, and equal ranking investments 
by other parties, according to contractual terms and 
conditions, to arrive at a fair value of the entirety of 
the investment. The value is then distributed amongst 
the different loan, equity and other financial 
instruments accordingly.
3. If the value attributed to a specific shareholder loan 
investment in a company is less than its par or nominal 
value, a shortfall is implied, which is recognised in our 
valuation. In exceptional cases, we may judge that the 
shortfall is temporary; to recognise the shortfall in such 
a scenario would lead to unrepresentative volatility and 
hence we may choose not to recognise the shortfall.
Other factors
In applying this framework, there are additional 
considerations that are factored into the valuation 
of some assets.
Impacts from structuring
Structural rights are instruments convertible into equity or 
cash at specific points in time or linked to specific events. 
For example, where a majority shareholder chooses to sell, 
and we have a minority interest, we may have the right to a 
minimum return on our investment.
Debt instruments, in particular, may have structural rights. 
In the valuation, it is assumed third parties, such as lenders 
or holders of convertible instruments, fully exercise any 
rights they might have, and that the value to the Group may 
therefore be reduced by such rights held by third parties. 
The Group’s own rights are valued on the basis they are 
exercisable on the reporting date.

Earnings
(Private Equity)
 – Most commonly used Private 
Equity valuation methodology
 – Used for investments which 
are profitable and for which 
we can determine a set 
of listed companies and 
precedent transactions, 
where relevant, with 
similar characteristics
Earnings multiples are applied to the earnings of the company 
to determine the enterprise value
Earnings
 – Reported earnings adjusted for non-recurring items, such 
as restructuring expenses, and for significant corporate 
actions, to arrive at maintainable earnings
 – Most common measure is earnings before interest, tax, 
depreciation and amortisation (“EBITDA”)
 – Earnings used are usually the management accounts for 
the 12 months to the quarter end preceding the reporting 
period, unless data from forecasts or the latest audited 
accounts provides a more reliable picture of maintainable 
earnings
Earnings multiples
 – The earnings multiple is derived from comparable listed 
companies or relevant market transaction multiples
 – We select companies in the same industry, where possible, 
with a similar business model and profile in terms of size, 
products, services and customers, growth rates and, 
where possible, in the same geographic region
 – We track the multiple paid at our initial investment against 
this set of comparable companies, taking into account a 
relative premium or discount where the underlying risk 
and earnings growth rate support that relative ranking
 – We adjust for changes in the relative performance in the 
set of comparables
A marketability or 
liquidity discount is 
applied to the enterprise 
value, typically between 
5% and 15%, using factors 
such as our alignment

2%
For a small proportion of our smaller investments (less than 3% of the portfolio), the valuation is determined by a more mechanical 
approach using information from the latest audited accounts. Equity shares are valued at the higher of an earnings or net assets 
methodology. Fixed income shares and loan investments are measured using amortised cost and any implied impairment, in line with IFRS.
Consistent with IPEV guidelines, all equity investments are held at fair value using the most appropriate methodology and no investments 
are held at historical cost.

Company. These are typically from overseas based “brokers” who target 
UK shareholders offering to sell them what often turn out to be worthless 
or high risk shares in UK or overseas investments. Shareholders are advised 
to be very wary of any unsolicited advice, offers to buy shares at a discount 
or offers of free reports into the Company. These approaches are operated 
out of what is more commonly known as a “boiler room”. You may also 
be approached by brokers offering to purchase your shares for an upfront 
payment in the form of a broker fee, tax payment or de-restriction fee. 
This is a common secondary scam operated by the boiler rooms.
If you receive any unsolicited investment advice:
  always ensure the firm is on the Financial Services Authority (“FSA”) 
Register and is allowed to give financial advice before handing over your 
money. You can check at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/register;
  double-check the caller is from the firm they say they are – ask for  
their name and telephone number and say you will call them back. Check 
their identity by calling the firm using the contact number listed on the 
FSA Register. This is important as the FSA has seen instances where an 
authorised firm’s website has been cloned but with a few subtle changes, 
such as a different phone number or false email address;
  check the FSA’s list of known unauthorised overseas firms at  
www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/overseas.shtml. 
However, these firms change their name regularly, so even if a firm is 
not listed it does not mean they are legitimate. Always check that they 
are listed on the FSA Register;
  if you have any doubts, call the FSA Consumer Helpline on 0845 606 1234 
with details, or complete the Unauthorised Firms Reporting Form  
at www.fsa.gov.uk/pages/doing/regulated/law/alerts/form.shtml.  
If you deal with an unauthorised firm, you will not be eligible to receive 
payment under the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.  
More detailed information on this or similar activity can be found  
on the FSA website at www.moneymadeclear.org.uk. You should also report 
any approach to Operation Archway, an initiative by the City of London Police 
in conjunction with the FSA, the Serious Fraud Office, the Serious 
Organised Crime Agency and police forces within the UK, by email to: 
operationarchway@cityoflondon.pnn.police.uk.

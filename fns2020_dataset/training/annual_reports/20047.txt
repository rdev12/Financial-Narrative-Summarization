®
Each of our thr ee Eye observation 
attractions offers the ultimate bird’s 
eye view, unparalleled and different 
every time, giving an Inspiring 
Perspective of the location’s 
landscape and iconic landmarks.
Eleven LEGOLAND Discovery Centres  
are the ultimate LEGO indoor playground, 
with over two million bricks under one roof.  
With Playful Learning at the heart of the 
experience, they create a fun filled and 
interactive environment where children  
and parents are inspired to be creative.
With Playful Learning at the  
heart of the experience, our six 
LEGOLAND resorts across Europe, 
North America and Asia offer a 
unique LEGO themed experience 
for families with children aged two 
to twelve years, often including 
highly themed accommodation  
and based on interactivity, 
imagination and family fun. 
Insane fun is on offer at Thorpe Park, 
the UK’s third biggest theme park 
and acknowledged thrill capital for 
teenagers, young adults and older 
families. The resort now includes 
the unique THORPE SHARK hotel, 
offering bite-sized rooms in a 
stunning waterfront location.
Alton T owers Resort is the 
UK’s number one theme 
park. Set in 500 acres of 
beautiful Staffordshire 
countryside and boasting 
two themed hotels and an 
indoor water park, it invites 
families, teenagers and 
young adults alike into a 
world of Fantastical

falconry, staged scenes by 
Madame Tussauds and the 
Castle Dungeon all make 
Warwick the Ultimate 
Castle experience.
THEME PARKS
Madame Tussauds’ heritage and the 
breathtaking artistry of the figures  
at our 18 sites differentiate it from 
other wax attractions. Famous Fun is 
the heart of the experience, where 
visitors are encouraged to interact 
with all the historical and celebrity 
figures from Napoleon to One 
Direction and everything in between.
The nine Dungeons are a unique 
mix of dark, historical horror 
and irreverent humour delivered 
through set piece shows performed 
by live actors, rides and spine 
chillingly themed sets. Scary Fun is 
the goal, delivered daily to families, 
teenagers and young adults.

Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 4 Main Contents CHAIRMAN’S Statement
IN MERLIN’S FIRST FULL YEAR AS A PUBLICLY QUOTED COMPANY , WE  
HAVE ACHIEVED THE FINANCIAL OBJECTIVES SET AT THE TIME OF THE 
FLOTATION. THESE ACHIEVEMENTS DERIVE FROM THE STRENGTH OF  
OUR BRANDS DEPLOYED ON AN INCREASINGLY GLOBAL BASIS. OUR  
FUTURE GROWTH WILL COME FROM A CONTINUING COMMITMENT  
TO THE SAME STRATEGY . 
CHAIRMAN’S
Statement
T rading ­performance ­ and­strategy
2014 was another successful year for Merlin Entertainments,  
with growth driven by a combination of our existing estate of 
attractions, six new Midway openings and new accommodation  
at five of our theme park resorts.
LEGOLAND Parks in particular had a very strong performance 
in the year of ‘The LEGO Movie’ and good weather benefited 
our European businesses throughout the year. These factors 
more than offset specific challenges in the Midway Attractions 
Operating Group as a result of political unrest in Thailand and 
extreme weather early in the year in North America.
We continued to deliver on our longer term objectives with 
the announcements in February of a strategic alliance with 
DreamWorks Animation to develop ‘Shrek’s Adventure!’ that 
has great potential to become a sixth Midway brand; and in June 
and November of the planned construction of LEGOLAND 
Parks in Japan and South Korea respectively, with both  
planned to open from 2017.
Dividends
Consistent with our proposed dividend policy we paid our 
inaugural interim dividend of 2.0 pence per share in September.   
I am pleased to announce that the Board will be recommending 
to the Annual General Meeting (AGM) in May that we pay our 
first final dividend of 4.2 pence per share in June. This will 
equate to a first full year dividend of 6.2 pence per share.
Governance ­and­the­boar d
We welcomed Fru Hazlitt to the Board as an independent 
Non-executive Director in April 2014. She adds to the breadth 
of skills of the Board and joins a high calibre and experienced 
team. One of the final elements of the transition from private 
to public is the composition of the Board. We are currently in 
an interim period with our pre-IPO private equity shareholder 
representatives remaining on the Board. Given the strength and 
independent approach of our existing Board members, we chose 
not to be compliant in the first year of operation as a listed 
company. We have always intended and will be fully compliant 
by the time of the anniversary of our first AGM in May 2015.
Shar eholder ­engagement
In addition to the comprehensive programme of engagement 
at Executive level with shareholders, Charles Gurassa, the 
Senior Independent Non-executive Director and head of the 
Remuneration Committee, our Company Secretary and I also 
met with many of our leading shareholders during the year  
to ensure a full and mutually constructive dialogue.
Health, ­safety ­and­security
Merlin’s number one priority is delivering safe and memorable 
experiences to visitors and the Company puts the health, safety 
and welfare of both its customers and employees at the forefront 
of its operational focus. The Group’s approach to safety management 
is based upon continuous improvement to mitigate this risk. 
There is a strong culture of risk management across Merlin.  
Our approach has evolved during 2014 and the Risks and 
uncertainties section of this report on pages 42 to 47 sets this 
out under three headings of health, safety and security risks;  
wider commercial and strategic risks; and financial process risks. 
I continue to chair Merlin’s Health, Safety and Security Committee 
which is a full committee of the Board and is the most senior 
health, safety and security governance body within the Group. 
More details on this Committee’s activities can be found in the 
Corporate Governance section of this report on page 67.
Corporate­social­r esponsibility ­(CSR )
The Group’s CSR activities are specifically focused on the four 
areas of: sustainability and the environment; animal welfare; the 
Merlin’s Magic Wand charity; and disability. 
Considerations around sustainability and the environment are 
increasingly important to the way we run our businesses. In this 
regard I am pleased that we are now able to report as planned 
on our greenhouse gas emissions, in this our first full year as a 
listed company. Merlin has always been proud of the approach 
we take to animal welfare and the protection of the marine 
environment. In particular our charity, the SEA LIFE Trust, 
has launched the ‘Wipe out Whaling’ campaign to end the 
transportation of whale meat through European ports, and will, 
among other activities, fund campaigns focused on the protection 
of marine habitats. Our own children’s charity, Merlin’s Magic 
Wand, helps sick, disabled and disadvantaged children visit our 
attractions or enjoy Merlin magic at themed areas installed 
at children’s homes and hospitals. In 2014 every single Merlin 
attraction that had been open for more than four months of the 
year welcomed children via the auspices of Merlin’s Magic Wand.
Finally, we seek to alleviate the challenges faced by guests and 
employees affected by disability and have the long term 
aspiration of becoming industry leaders in this area. 
Our CSR report on pages 54 to 59 provides further detail on 
these areas as well as on our community engagement and other 
associated matters.
Our ­people
I would like to thank our management team and all our 
employees around the world for their contribution to another 
successful year for the Company. Our success is thanks to  
their leadership and dedication. 
Outlook
As we look forward to 2015 and beyond, we remain confident 
that our proven growth strategy and committed management 
team will continue to deliver in the years ahead.

Existing­estate
Against what was a very strong 2013, we are pleased with the 
performance of our existing estate of attractions, with all three 
Operating Groups recording like for like (LFL) revenue and  
profit growth. 
The ‘stand out’ performance was from LEGOLAND Parks where 
strong underlying momentum, and the addition of the LEGO 
CHIMA water park in LEGOLAND California (LLC), were 
further boosted by the phenomenal success of ‘The LEGO 
Movie’. Recognising the potential of this movie launch, our teams 
were able to put in place strong marketing plans including the 
launch of the film itself at LLC and McDonalds Happy Meal 
promotions across North America and Europe.  
Within Resort Theme Parks, good weather across the trading 
season, together with a major new ride, ‘Flight of the Demons’ at 
Heide Park in Germany and ‘CBeebies Land’ at Alton T owers in 
the UK, meant the good performance of 2013 was built upon. 
It was also pleasing to see Gardaland in Italy continuing to 
recover after the sharp decline seen in 2012 as a result of 
the challenging economic conditions in southern Europe.
Midway, whilst still recording LFL revenue growth of 3.0%, had a 
somewhat subdued year in 2014 as a result of a number of 
external factors and the later phasing or delay to some of its 
major capital expenditure projects. Political unrest in Thailand 
had a significant impact on our two businesses in Bangkok 
(Madame Tussauds and SEA LIFE Bangkok Ocean World), 
while early in the year extreme cold weather brought

disruption to our East Coast and Midwest North American 
attractions. Elsewhere our businesses in China continued to 
deliver good growth and the UK businesses also performed well.
New­business ­ development
In the year we continued the international expansion of Midway 
attractions with six new openings across four separate brands in 
both our North America and Asia Pacific regions. Of particular 
note is the San Francisco Dungeon, marking the first of this 
brand to be opened outside of Europe. 
 Particularly pleasing is that we have  
maintained our customer satisfaction levels 
well above our 90% target

Oblivion at Gardaland Resort, Italy
Elsewhere we added further new accommodation to our theme 
parks, driving both the resort positioning we are seeking as well 
as delivering attractive financial returns. The year saw us open a 
further Castle hotel as part of the Holiday Village at LEGOLAND 
Deutschland; a new themed wing to the LEGOLAND Billund 
hotel; the extension of accommodation at Warwick Castle; the 
THORPE SHARK hotel at Thorpe Park; and finally the highly-
themed new Azteca hotel at Chessington World of Adventures.
Market ­ overview
Our market continues to grow, driven by increasing leisure time 
and rising incomes particularly in fast growing countries such as 
China. Globally, leisure spending is forecast to increase by over  
4% per annum over the next decade according to the World 
Travel & T ourism Council (source: 	 WTTC 	T r avel 	&	 T our ism 	 
Economic Impact 2014). We see the key relevant dynamics  
for Merlin within this growth trend as being:
• An increasing demand for strong brands and/or Intellectual  
 Properties brought to life as part of quality, location based  
 entertainment experiences.
• A continuing trend towards short breaks in preference to  
 the traditional longer holiday.
• Strong tourism growth in ‘gateway’ cities, as emerging  
 middle classes travel more internationally.
• The continued rise of the internet (and within this, mobile  
 platforms) as the primary information and booking  
 interface for customers.
The strength and diversification of the global Merlin portfolio 
leaves us well placed to benefit from these trends. This in turn 
will assist us as we continue to focus on building a geographically 
diversified company which will ultimately derive a third of its 
revenues from each of the Americas, Europe and Asia Pacific. 
 
Strategic ­ developments
Merlin has six complementary strategic growth drivers as laid 
out on pages 10 to 11 of this report. The Operational Reviews 
of each of our three Operating Groups and the Merlin Magic 
Making section of this Strategic Report outline our achievements 
during 2014. Furthermore, we have exciting developments 
planned against each for 2015 and beyond.  
Planned capital investment cycles
Adding new rides and features to our existing estate of attractions  
to drive customer satisfaction, increase capacity and provide a 
compelling new proposition to guests. The pre-determined 
investment cycles in place for each of the Operating Groups 
are carefully managed so as to smooth capital expenditure 
across the portfolio of attractions; to ensure the investments 
are funded out of operating free cash flow; and to provide 
attractions with the visibility and autonomy to plan effectively.  
At a Group level the investment over the cycle is broadly in  
line with depreciation and follows a pre-set ratio to revenue  
(typically 8-10%).
In 2015 a major new ride, ‘Oblivion’, will be launched at 
Gardaland in Italy, while in the LEGOLAND Parks Operating 
Group three parks will introduce new LEGO Friends themed 
areas. All LEGOLAND Parks and Discovery Centres will 
benefit from a new short LEGO Movie 4D experience, with a 
completely new storyline that can only be seen at our venues.
Equally exciting are the product innovations planned in Midway, 
in particular major new ‘Star Wars’ features that will be opened at 
Madame T ussauds London and Berlin. As always all attractions in the 
Group will have something new to drive visitation across the year.
Strategic synergies
Leveraging the scale of the Group in key markets to exploit 
enhanced operational, marketing and buying power. 2015 will see  
us expand our dedicated US call centre and continue with third 
party promotions. In addition, we will extend our CRM databases 
in the UK and Germany allowing for more targeted and efficient 
promotions, maximising Group synergies. Our UK database 
currently stands at three million records, whilst the German 
database launched in 2014 has seen good initial results.
Resort positioning
Developing our theme parks into short break destinations: extending 
the catchment area, creating new revenue streams and improving 
guest satisfaction. The key driver of this transformation is the 
presence of on-site themed accommodation. T o date, all 
investments whether themed hotels or Holiday Villages have  
been highly successful, delivering against our investment criteria, 
driving multi-day stays, and significantly increasing the level of 
pre-booked business, hence providing an element of  
protection against the impact of adverse weather.
Following the success of the LEGOLAND Windsor and 
California hotels, 2015 will see the opening of a 152 bedroom 
hotel at LEGOLAND Florida. Within Resort Theme Parks an 
exciting 125 chalet development, ‘The Enchanted Village’, will be 
added to the Alton T owers Resort. Looking further ahead, plans 
are already progressing for a new hotel at the Gardaland Resort  
in Italy to be opened in 2016.
Midway roll out
Opening new Midway attractions under one of our chainable  
global brands. We are able to open new Madame Tussauds,  
SEA LIFE Centres, Dungeons and LEGOLAND Discovery 
Centres, typically for £5-8 million each, always with a target 
of 20% ROIC. Increasingly, our focus is on opening multiple
attractions in the same locations to form clusters from which we 
can derive operational, marketing and cross-selling advantages.
2015 is a significant year for our Midway roll out programme  
with seven new attractions due to open including the launch  
in London of a potential sixth brand, ‘Shrek’s Adventure!’, in 
association with DreamWorks Animation. The other major 
development will be the Orlando cluster featuring the 400  
foot Orlando Eye observation wheel (funded by our partner, 
Circle Entertainment) together with a Madame Tussauds 
and SEA LIFE Centre.  
Completing the line-up are a SEA LIFE Centre in Michigan, USA 
(opened in January 2015) and LEGOLAND Discovery Centres in 
Osaka, Japan and Istanbul, Turkey. We are already well advanced 
with planning for a further seven attractions in 2016.
     We see a continuing 
trend towards short breaks
THORPE SHARK hotel at Thorpe Park
Gr oup­performance­summary
The combined result of the existing estate performance and the 
addition of new attractions and accommodation was a rise in 
Group revenue of 4.8% from £1,192 million to £1,249 million, 
despite adverse foreign exchange headwinds. This in turn led 
to a growth in underlying EBITDA and operating profit of 5.3% 
and 7.1% respectively. On a constant currency basis this would 
equate to growth in underlying EBITDA and operating profit 
of 11.0% and 13.3% respectively.
Visitor numbers also broke through the 60 million mark, rising to 
62.8 million. Particularly pleasing in this respect is that we have 
maintained our customer satisfaction levels well above our 90% 
target and importantly have recorded a further reduction in the 
number of business related incidents per 100,000 guests (our key 
health and safety KPI). As ever, we remain determined to deliver 
safe and memorable experiences to our customers and are 
relentlessly focused on further reducing the small numbers  
of occasions where we get it wrong.

New LEGOLAND Park developments
Opening new full scale LEGOLAND Parks. Our aim is to open  
at least one new park every three years under one of three 
ownership models: operated and owned; operated and leased; 
and management contracts. Having opened LEGOLAND Florida 
(2011) and LEGOLAND Malaysia (2012), we are now engaged 
on three further projects: LEGOLAND Dubai (management 
contract) which will open in 2016; and LEGOLAND Japan and 
LEGOLAND Korea (both operated and leased) for 2017. 
Looking further ahead we are in early discussions for new park 
developments in the USA and China. The Group’s strong free 
cash generation leaves us in a favourable position to consider 
these projects.
Strategic acquisitions
Pursuing acquisition opportunities that complement our  
strategic objectives. In 2011 and 2012 the acquisitions of Sydney 
Attractions Group and Living and Leisure Australia accelerated 
our expansion into Asia Pacific and have facilitated further new 
openings in this region.  
Our primary focus for the future is on North America and Asia, 
where we target assets that can be rebranded to Merlin’s brands 
(or provide new brand opportunities) and that complement our 
expansion strategy.   
Merlin’s future growth is not dependent on acquisitions but 
we are in the favourable position of having the free cash flow 
and borrowing facilities available to make them should suitable 
opportunities arise.
Merlin ­Magic­ Making
Merlin Magic Making (MMM) is the part of Merlin responsible 
for finding new sites; creating new attractions; producing our 
core product of wax figures, marine displays and LEGO models; 
and project managing all major capital expenditure projects to 
bring them in on time and on budget. What it gives Merlin, 
in a growing market, is the ability to cost-effectively and 
imaginatively exploit opportunities on a global scale. 
Major progress was made in 2014 with regard to establishing 
and/or consolidating key partnerships with major Intellectual 
Property (IP) owners. MMM’s engagement with Disney, 
DreamWorks Animation and BBC Worldwide, amongst others, 
has facilitated an exciting new stream of developments ranging 
from a potential new brand, Shrek’s Adventure!, to significant new 
features in our existing attractions. When added to our long 
term close relationship with the LEGO Company, the world’s 
biggest toy brand, and our own in-house IP development, Merlin 
is well placed to continue delivering compelling reasons for 
people to visit our attractions well into the future.
Memorable ­experiences ­ and ­our ­ teams
Merlin’s central mission is to deliver memorable experiences 
to our millions of visitors, something we all do because of 
our love of fun. 
Merlin’s amazing team is at the heart of everything we do 
and consequently we dedicate a lot of energy and resource 
to recruitment, retention, training and development. We are 
privileged to have such an engaged workforce of almost 26,000 
at peak season. Our annual ‘Wizard Wants to Know’ staff survey 
was sent out to nearly 21,000 employees on a phased basis 
during the summer months. A phenomenal 97% of them 
completed the survey and of those 95% said ‘they enjoy 
working here’. Most importantly, since becoming a public 
company, almost 30% of worldwide staff have elected to 
take part in the Company’s share save schemes. We are 
very pleased with this high level of participation.
Looking ­ahead
Merlin Entertainments has adapted well to being a public 
company and our focus now is to deliver on the expectations 
of the many shareholders who have supported us. In this regard 
we believe we are well placed with a unique business model in 
a growing global market to deliver further exciting growth in 
the years ahead. What is more, we plan to have fun doing it!

2014 WAS ANOTHER YEAR OF GROWTH FOR THE MIDWAY ATTRACTIONS

YEAR IN NORTH AMERICA AND SOME DELAYS IN CAPITAL INVESTMENTS LED

THE STRONG MIDWAY ROLL OUT PLAN HAS CONTINUED WITH THE 
ADDITION OF SIX NEW ATTRACTIONS AND THE REBRANDING OF TWO 
ACQUIRED AQUARIUMS TO BECOME SEA LIFE CENTRES.

Underlying operating profit (£m) 167 164 +1.9% +6.2%
Like for like revenue growth  +3.0%
T rading ­performance
Trading performance for the Midway Attractions Operating 
Group overall in 2014 continued to show growth in visitor 
numbers, revenues and profits, although the reported numbers 
were adversely impacted by movements in foreign exchange 
rates, as shown in the table above. Growth in visitors of 2.8% 
resulted in growth in revenues and underlying operating profits 
of 6.2% when translated on a constant currency basis.
Existing ­estate 
Like for like growth in revenues from our existing estate of  
3.0% was lower than our long term trajectory due to three  
main factors. Firstly, political upheaval in Bangkok led to the 
displacement of the Prime Minister and the introduction of 
Military Rule. Consequently, in the spring there was widespread 
rioting which attracted significant global media coverage and 
visitors stayed away from Bangkok. This led to a substantial 
reduction in visitor numbers to our Madame Tussauds and  
SEA LIFE businesses there. 
Secondly, the ‘Polar Vortex’ of snow storms which hit North 
America in January and February led to potential visitors staying 
at home and in addition some schools cancelled school holidays 
around Easter and the spring break to compensate for the 
school time lost to the storms.
Finally, our capital investment plan had a number of significant 
projects which were planned to occur relatively late in the year 
and in addition a number of major projects were delayed due to a 
number of specific reasons particular to each case. A combination 
of these factors meant that revenue growth in the second half of 
the year was stronger than the first half and the benefit of these 
2014 investments will only be fully realised in 2015. 
Elsewhere, our LEGOLAND Discovery Centres (LDCs) were 
boosted by the phenomenal success of ‘The LEGO Movie’; the 
Australian ski fields delivered a strong performance as a result  
of better snow conditions; whilst the London attractions settled 
down to a more normal pattern of growth following an 
exceptional year in 2013 which was boosted by all the 
Olympic coverage during 2012. 
Capital ­investment
Despite the later phasing of our capital investments, our existing 
estate growth was underpinned by our strategy of planned capital 
investment cycles across each brand, with each Midway attraction 
having a ‘high-year’ once every five years.  
During 2014 we delivered a number of successful new  
high-year capital projects including a new ‘splash pad’ water  
play area outside our LDC in Dallas; a new Marvel 4D Cinema  
at Madame Tussauds (MT) Hollywood, following the success of 
similar films at MTs in New Y ork and London; a new Gentoo 
penguin area at SEA LIFE Birmingham, which has scope to add 
King Penguins at a later stage in the attraction’s development;  
and a new ghost show at the Amsterdam Dungeon. 
In the non-high capital investment years, most attractions receive  
‘mobile features’ which we move around the world to several different  
locations over a period of years, thus maximising capital efficiency. 
During 2014, Madame Tussauds had a number of touring figure 
sets of One Direction; Bollywood; Steve Jobs; Abba; three Michael 
Jackson figures at different ages; the British Royal family; and  
The Beatles. One Direction drove a significant number of teenage 
customers at every single attraction where this feature appeared.  
Consequently we now have two One Direction touring sets! 
 The Madame Tussauds ‘One Direction’ 
touring set attracted teenage customers

Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 4 Main Contents OPERATIONAL REVIEW - MIDWAY Attractions
SEA LIFE has four mobile features: ‘Turtle Sanctuary’, ‘Octopus 
Hideout’, ‘Sea Stars’ and ‘Claws’. All of these features are designed 
to give our visitors the opportunity to see amazing creatures, 
including starfish from across the world and giant Japanese 
Spider Crabs.
Our LDCs have three themed versions of major scenes from  
the Star Wars movies recreated in LEGO bricks with interactive 
features which bring the displays to life for our visitors. 
Midway ­r oll ­ out
During 2014 our expansion of Midway attractions continued 
around the world with the launch of a further six new attractions. 
In North America we launched an LDC in Boston which has 
taken the brand to a new level in terms of the quality and 
breadth of what is on offer; a SEA LIFE Centre in Charlotte, 
North Carolina, which received a very high level of local media 
coverage; and a Dungeon and MT in San Francisco. This is the 
first time we have taken the Dungeon brand outside of Europe 
and we are encouraged by the positive customer response. 
In Asia we introduced a Madame Tussauds in Beijing just 
off Tiananmen Square. The strong early performance of this 
attraction gives us confidence that the brand has a growing 
reputation and awareness in the huge Asian market, where  
the hunger for anything related to fame and celebrity seems  
stronger than ever. At the end of the year we opened a  
Madame Tussauds in Singapore which we have combined  
with an existing attraction (Images of Singapore).
Customer ­ satisfaction
The combination of our investments this year, along with our 
relentless focus on customer service, have added significantly to 
the overall experience of our guests, as demonstrated by the 
excellent customer satisfaction scores we continue to enjoy.
Looking­ahead
2015 will see a significant further expansion of the Midway  
estate with a combination of individual and cluster location 
attractions.  ‘Clustering’ is where we have more than one 
attraction in the same location, providing operating cost, 
marketing and cross-selling advantages.
Following an extensive rebranding, we have already relaunched, as  
a SEA LIFE Centre, the Turkuazoo Aquarium in Istanbul that had 
been a standalone acquisition in 2013. We will then add an LDC in 
the same mall location later this year to form the Istanbul cluster.  
In the spring the Orlando cluster in Florida will open at  
I-Drive 360 on International Drive. This will feature the  
400 foot Orlando Eye observation wheel that we will operate  
as a management contract, together with a SEA LIFE Centre  
and an MT. As well as creating a new cluster of Midway 
attractions in its own right, we also anticipate significant  
marketing opportunities with LEGOLAND Florida.
In the summer we will bring ‘Shrek’s Adventure!’ to the South 
Bank in London, where it will join the Coca-Cola London Eye, 
London Dungeon and SEA LIFE Centre already located there.  
Based on the Shrek series of films, the largest animated franchise 
in history, this entirely new attraction has been developed in 
association with DreamWorks Animation. We have confidence 
that this has the potential to become our sixth Midway brand.
T ogether with SLC Michigan, USA (already opened), and LDC 
Osaka, Japan, this will total seven completely new Midway sites  
in 2015. We are already well advanced with planning for a  
further seven attractions in 2016.
 In the summer of 2015 
we bring Shrek’s Adventure! to 
the South Bank in London
What did  
we do?
We relaunched Busan Aquarium as SEA LIFE Busan Aquarium in July 
2014.  Busan Aquarium was acquired as part of the Living and Leisure 
Australia acquisition in 2012 and we have been gradually rebranding 
one or two aquariums each year to SEA LIFE whilst significantly 
increasing the quality and breadth of the customer experience.
What was 
the result?
The relaunch has achieved revenue increases in line with our 
expectations and supported a significant increase in lead ticket price. 
Despite the price increase, customer satisfaction and ‘value for money’ 
scores have improved, demonstrating effective capital expenditure.  
The rescue and release of the Finless Porpoises is an illustration of 
our conservation and welfare work and positions the brand in a 
very positive manner with our customers.
How did  
we do it?
We redeveloped the whole of the aquarium adding new shipwreck, 
‘bay of rays’, seahorse and ocean tank features, whilst transforming the 
attraction to make it more child friendly, in line with our SEA LIFE 
approach. This included tanks designed with child-sized viewing areas 
for children to discover, a quiz trail and tailored creature descriptions.
Central to the relaunch was the integration of the SEA LIFE 
conservation message of ‘Breed, Rescue and Protect’, where we 
highlight the number of creatures SEA LIFE breeds globally; the 
number and types of creatures that we rescue from distressed marine 
environments; and how we play our part in protecting the broader 
marine environment with hands-on work by our own teams. The  
SEA LIFE Busan Aquarium uniquely features the rescue, rehabilitation 
and release of wonderful Finless Porpoises as part of this programme 
of active marine conservation work. The programme has been created 
in conjunction with the South Korean Government to help save the  
ever increasing numbers of injured porpoises.

During 2014 we have rebranded two recently acquired 
aquariums as SEA LIFE Centres. SEA LIFE Busan Aquarium 
was launched in July with a prominent conservation focus and 
in December we launched SEA LIFE Bangkok Ocean World. 
Both aquariums were part of our acquisition of Living and  
Leisure Australia in 2012 and in both cases we invested  
several million pounds in creating very high quality  
experiences which are befitting of the SEA LIFE brand.

T rading ­performance
The LEGOLAND Parks Operating Group had an exceptional  
year in 2014, due to a continued successful capital investment 
programme and the impact of ‘The LEGO Movie’. A 9.8% 
growth in visitors converted into revenue growth of 15.7% 
and underlying operating profit growth of 21.1%, both on a 
constant currency basis, with reported numbers adversely 
affected by movements in foreign exchange rates. The flow 
through of incremental revenues to profit is tempered by the 
mix of revenues, variable trading and labour costs, as well as 
unexpected remedial costs at the LEGOLAND Windsor hotel. 
Existing ­estate­ and­capital­investment
In 2014, the highlight of the LEGOLAND parks capital  
investment cycle was the ‘high-year’ LEGO CHIMA water park  
at LEGOLAND California. This investment almost doubled the 
size of the existing water park and has been extremely popular 
with visitors. These factors, together with the launch of ‘The 
LEGO Movie’ at this attraction and generally good weather, 
helped secure the best summer ever at this resort. 
In LEGOLAND Billund, Denmark, we had a ‘medium-year’ 
investment, comprising the ‘Ghost -The Haunted House’ 
attraction and drop ride experience. This has performed  
well in attracting additional visitors to the resort.  
All the LEGOLAND Parks, especially the two North American 
sites, benefited significantly in 2014 from ‘The LEGO Movie’.  
Launched at LEGOLAND California in February, the film was  
a major blockbuster hit especially in the USA and the UK.  
This drove consumer demand for the LEGO product and 
visitation to all our LEGOLAND sites. Guests were able to 
visit the actual film set at LEGOLAND California, and across 
all the parks we reaped the rewards of strong marketing and  
promotional campaigns. 
We also benefited from more favourable weather in 2014 in the 
European parks, especially at Easter where the 2013 comparative 
period had been extremely challenging.
R esort ­positioning
The repositioning of the parks as short break destinations continues 
to be very popular with guests, driving higher satisfaction scores, 
higher spends and an increase in pre-booked business. In 2014, 
we opened the 68 bedroom King’s Castle hotel at LEGOLAND 
Deutschland Holiday Village which had an average occupancy 
rate of over 95% during the peak summer months. This augments 
the smaller Knight’s Castle hotel that opened the previous year.
Elsewhere we re-themed the Holiday Village at LEGOLAND 
Billund, which we took over at the start of 2013, and  
expanded the LEGOLAND Billund hotel with 24 highly  
themed new bedrooms.

Developing ­ new­LEGOLAND­Parks
We made significant progress in 2014 in our strategy to add at 
least one new LEGOLAND Park every three years, always with 
an unerring focus on the returns that can be generated from the 
three different financing and development models that we follow.
Operated and leased sites
In June 2014 we announced our plans for LEGOLAND Japan in 
Nagoya, scheduled for opening in 2017. Nagoya sits in the centre 
of Japan which is the second largest theme park market in the 
world. The development of the park will be supported by the 
City of Nagoya through the development of the local travel 
infrastructure including a 5,000 space car park. The site will 
have the potential both for future park expansion and on-site, 
themed accommodation. It will be developed under our ‘operated 
and leased’ model, where Merlin has an operating company that 
contributes a portion of total park investment and leases the 
balance of the assets from a third party; in this case from a 
company owned by KIRKBI (a shareholder in Merlin and a 
major shareholder in the LEGO Company).
In November 2014 we announced LEGOLAND Korea. This is 
also scheduled for a 2017 opening and is financed under a similar 
model to LEGOLAND Japan, in this case funded by a property 
company owned by a consortium of local public and private 
investors. This park will be situated on a picturesque island 
setting in Chuncheon, located approximately one hour from 
Seoul, South Korea, and within a two hour drive time for nearly 
24 million residents. National and regional governments and 
Chuncheon City will between them fund transportation 
and wider infrastructure support.
Management contracts
LEGOLAND Malaysia was developed under a ‘management 
contract’ model and this has been operating successfully since its 
opening in September 2012. We expect, with our local partners, 
to open LEGOLAND Dubai as the first LEGOLAND Park in 
the Middle East in 2016. Furthermore, we continue to pursue 
opportunities and may in time see one or more parks under  
this model in China.
Operated and owned
This is how the first five LEGOLAND Parks were developed,  
and we expect to identify more locations where this model  
can be applied. Specifically, we are exploring some encouraging 
opportunities for a third park in North America.
Customer ­satisfaction
Alongside the commercial performance and resort expansion, 
it is particularly pleasing to report that we have increased our 
already high customer satisfaction score across the LEGOLAND 
Parks Operating Group as a whole.
Looking ­forwar d
Alongside our longer term LEGOLAND Parks development 
programme, we continue to invest in capital projects both for 
new rides and accommodation offerings.
2015 will see a ‘high-year’ capital investment in a brand new 
LEGO Friends area at LEGOLAND Windsor along with similar 
smaller investments in California and Florida. Cinemas in all our 
LEGOLAND Parks and LEGOLAND Discovery Centres will 
benefit from an exclusive short 4D movie experience based 
on ‘The LEGO Movie’ and containing exciting new content.
In terms of accommodation, construction is on schedule for the 
opening of our second LEGOLAND hotel in the USA at the park 
entrance to LEGOLAND Florida in late spring 2015. This will 
combine with marketing opportunities from the opening of our 
other Midway attractions in Orlando this year. Plans are also in 
progress for further additions to our existing hotels and  
Holiday Villages for the years to come.
The LEGO product remains hugely popular and our 
co-operation with the LEGO Company and KIRKBI remains 
excellent, resulting in many initiatives which benefited our 
business in 2014 and will continue to do so in the future. This 
collaborative approach covers both tactical and strategic matters, 
with our teams meeting at least once a year to plan for future 
developments to our mutual benefit. Tactical collaboration occurs 
in all markets around events and promotional activities. On the 
strategic level we are well integrated into the long term product 
programmes of the LEGO Company and are seeing the results 
of this collaboration in such things as our planned new LEGO  
Friends areas in three LEGOLAND Parks for 2015.

What did 
we do?
In April we continued our programme of transforming our 
theme parks into destination resorts when we opened our second 
LEGOLAND Castle hotel at the LEGOLAND Deutschland Holiday 
Village in Bavaria in southern Germany. The 68 bedroom King’s  
Castle hotel is a follow-up to the Knight’s Castle we opened in 2013.  
The hotel represented an investment of approximately £9 million  
and has been financed entirely from Merlin’s cash flow.
What was 
the result?
The project was delivered on time and on budget. Financial 
performance has been stronger than expected, outperforming the 
business case for developing the hotel without cannibalising our 
existing offers in the Holiday Village. Guest satisfaction scores have 
been very high and, in line with our experience in other resorts, even 
higher than for day visitors. Over 60% of visitors to the Holiday Village 
come from outside Germany; a trend that is increasing. This all 
continues to underpin the strategy of repositioning the parks as  
short break destinations.
How did 
we do it?
Merlin’s expert hotel team, combined with local architects and the 
local LEGOLAND Deutschland management team, were responsible 
for developing the product on the basis of the very successful smaller 
Knight’s Castle launched in 2013. The development and operational 
set up worked very well, leveraging the expertise that has been 
built up across the Group.

T rading ­performance ­ and­capital­investment
Trading performance for the Resort Theme Parks (RTP) 
Operating Group overall in 2014 built on the good performance 
of 2013 to show continued growth in visitor numbers, revenue 
and profit. Growth in visitors of 7.2% resulted in growth in 
revenue of 8.4% and underlying operating profit of 16.4%,  
both converted on a constant currency basis.
The strategic focus for RTP continues to be to create a 
portfolio of differentiated short break destinations based at 
unique theme park locations. Once again 2014 saw the launch 
of new compelling experiences at each of the RTP resorts, 
in accordance with our established capital investment cycles.  
The successful launch of each of these was key to ensuring 
revenue growth at every one of the six RTP resorts. 
The ‘high-year’ capital investment in RTP was the launch of a 
major new roller coaster ‘Flight of the Demons’ at Heide Park 
Resort in Germany, targeting the thrill-seeker market. In addition,  
Alton T owers introduced ‘CBeebies Land’ in association with BBC 
Worldwide. Based on the TV channel of the same name, this 
successfully attracted a wider demographic to the resort of 
families with children under the age of six. Thorpe Park also 
introduced a strong and internationally known Intellectual 
Property (IP) based attraction with ‘Angry Birds Land’, including 
a new and exclusive 4D movie experience developed in 
association with Rovio, the owner of the Angry Birds IP . The 
successful introduction of a lower priced Thorpe Park season 
pass, together with a new web/mobile booking platform and 
pricing structure, also helped to deliver growth in a challenging  
economic environment for the resort’s core 16-24 age group. 
Chessington World of Adventures launched ‘Scorpion Express’, 
the reinvigoration of an existing ride complete with new theming, 
fire effects and near misses, to cost-effectively deliver a new ride 
experience for the resort. Gardaland introduced ‘Prezzemolo 
Land’, a new wet and dry play area based on the park’s famous 
character mascot and targeted at younger children. In Italy the 
economic and political landscape continued to be difficult but 
despite this Gardaland has seen modest revenue and EBITDA 
growth. This was driven by the key management initiatives of 
increasing penetration of international tourists visiting Lake Garda; 
launching a successful ‘value for money’ season pass initiative for 
both the resident and tourist market; and further targeted 
cost saving initiatives to improve operational efficiency.  
Finally, Warwick Castle extended its ‘Horrible Histories Foul  
Fayre’ across the full operating season.
R esort ­positioning
A key future growth driver for RTP is increased investment in 
unique accommodation offerings to drive increased additional 
short break visitation, multi-day stays and pre-booked visits. 
In 2014 we successfully introduced the new 90 bedroom 
‘THORPE SHARK’ hotel at Thorpe Park and extended and 
improved the accommodation offering at Warwick Castle 
including the addition of two luxury ‘T ower Suites’ within the 
Castle itself. Later in the year we launched the 69 bedroom 
‘Azteca’ hotel at Chessington World of Adventures alongside 
the relaunch of the existing hotel as the ‘Safari’ themed hotel.
Strategic ­synergies
RTP both contributes to and benefits from the wider Merlin 
Group in terms of strategic synergies, with the continued 
success of customer promotions and the development of the 
Merlin Annual Pass. The problem of queues impacting customer 
satisfaction remains a key challenge for the theme park industry 
generally and a number of initiatives to alleviate the impact of 
queues were trialled in 2014. These included the introduction 
of mobile apps and electronic screens showing queue times and 
providing tips to avoid queues. We also trialled an online ticketing 
platform and a mobile based ‘Reserve and Ride’ virtual queuing 
system at Thorpe Park. Further initiatives and trials will continue 
in 2015 in this area.
Customer ­ satisfaction
With the uplift in visitor numbers to our attractions in 2014 it 
was vital that we maintained focus on our key KPI of customer 
satisfaction. It is a testament to the great teams across the RTP 
resorts that all sites increased their scores year on year.
Looking ­forwar d
Gardaland will have the ‘high-year’ capital investment in 2015 which 
will be ‘Oblivion’, a major roller coaster drop ride. Our longer term 
aim is to transform Gardaland into a major European short break 
destination for both Italians and international visitors alike so this 
will be an important step on that journey, as will the launch of a 
new highly themed ‘Adventure’ hotel planned for 2016. Work 
is also underway at Alton T owers on the 2015 launch of the  
‘Enchanted Village’ including both lodges and luxury tree-houses.

Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 4 Main Contents CASE STUDY
What did  
we do?
We introduced a new highly recognisable land to an existing area 
of the theme park. This was aimed primarily at families with young 
children, a previously under-represented demographic at Alton T owers, 
for whom a short break is considered an attractive proposition.
What was 
the result?
In 2014 Alton T owers saw a 10% increase in visitors driven by 
CBeebies Land, as well as an 8% increase in leisure room nights 
booked at the hotels. Research confirmed that 17% of visitors 
to CBeebies Land were new visitors to Alton T owers.  
How did  
we do it?
Having identified the potential of the target demographic, our 
attraction and creative teams identified CBeebies as a strong and 
compelling Intellectual Property (IP) asset that could deliver increased 
park visitation and short break visits to the resort. The team from 
Merlin Magic Making negotiated a licence deal with BBC Worldwide 
(who own the rights to CBeebies). The creative teams then worked 
closely with the BBC to develop a compelling experience that would 
transform an existing under-utilised area of the park with attractions 
and rides featuring famous CBeebies characters and shows such as 
‘Postman Pat’, ‘Charlie and Lola’, ‘In the Night Garden’, ‘Tree Fu T om’ 
and ‘Justin’s House’.

 FINDING  THE MAGIC
‘SITES ALREADY SECURED IN CHINA FOR 2016’
After a successful delivery of the 2014 pipeline things are looking 
very positive for 2015, with all sites secured and design and build 
programmes underway.
2016 is also shaping up to be in line with our strategic plans, with 
two sites already secured in China, as well as a number of other 
site opportunities in progress.
We have strengthened the team in North America with our first ever 
Site Search Director based full time in the USA, meaning we now have 
in-house Merlin influence in all our major development geographies.     
  CREATING  THE MAGIC
‘WE CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOME VERY 
STRONG INTELLECTUAL PROPERTY 
RELATIONSHIPS’
It is never quiet when it comes to looking at the creative and 
innovative ways that we are able to drive the business forward. 
2014 has been no exception, with a host of new and exciting 
projects coming to fruition.
Our Midway roll out programme continued during 2014, 
including our first Dungeon foray outside of Europe, with the 
launch of the San Francisco Dungeon, in the USA; three Madame 
Tussauds launches (our most ever!) including our first business 
in Beijing; as well as a LEGOLAND Discovery Centre and a  
SEA LIFE Centre.
Things were no less impressive in our existing businesses  
whether it was ‘scaring the beegeebies’ out of you in our new 
haunted house concept in LEGOLAND Billund; confronting the 
wing coaster ‘Flug Der Dämonen’ at Heide Park; riding the rapids 
in our new ‘LEGO CHIMA’ water park in LEGOLAND California;  
or just taking a well earned rest in our new Azteca hotel at 
Chessington World of Adventures Resort.
We continue to develop some very strong Intellectual Property 
(IP) relationships with the BBC, Rovio and Marvel as evidenced 
by our most recent openings of the amazing ‘CBeebies Land’ 
at Alton T owers; ‘Angry Birds Land’ at Thorpe Park; and our  
‘Marvel Super Heroes 4D’ film at Madame Tussauds.
2015 will see IP relationships developed even further. We will 
introduce a Star Wars exhibition in the Madame T ussauds attractions 
in London and Berlin (see Case Study on page 37). In Midway our 
drive to introduce new brands continues at pace, so most exciting 
of all will be the launch in London in the summer of the world’s  
first Shrek Midway attraction ‘Shrek’s Adventure!’, created in  
close collaboration with the DreamWorks Animation team.
  PRODUCING  THE MAGIC
‘FANTASTIC LEGO MODELS…RECORD 
NUMBERS OF MADAME TUSSAUDS FIGURES…’
When reporting last year we thought that our production teams 
had scaled unbelievable new heights BUT we are excited to say 
that we have been even more productive in 2014.
Our five LEGO model facilities across the USA, UK, Denmark, 
Germany and Malaysia have again been able to deliver fantastic 
LEGO models to new accommodation in LEGOLAND 
Deutschland and our new (and best ever!) LEGOLAND 
Discovery Centre in Boston, as well as over 20 assignments  
in our existing businesses. 
Madame Tussauds figure production has again been at its highest 
ever, with over 230 wax figures produced for new openings in 
Singapore, Beijing, San Francisco and globally across the existing 
estate of attractions.

‘WE AGAIN PLAYED A CENTRAL ROLE IN 
THE WIDER AQUARIUM COMMUNITY’
It has been a very busy year for Merlin’s Animal Welfare and 
Development team, with a whole host of projects centred 
around the welfare and wellbeing of our creatures.
Early on in the year we successfully moved a group of captive 
bred penguins from our New Zealand SEA LIFE Centre to our 
National SEA LIFE Centre in Birmingham in the UK, a story  
which was followed on UK national television by BBC2, for  
their ‘Penguins on a Plane’ mini-series.
We again played our part in the wider aquarium community, with 
leading roles on a number of BIAZA (British & Irish Association 
of Zoos and Aquariums) Committees and active participation  
in a number of industry conferences, think tanks and meetings.  
Core to this wider community strategy has been our continued 
work on a number of projects with the SEA LIFE Trust.
Innovation has also been a key activity in 2014, with a number  
of trials taking place with technology aimed at enhancing the  
SEA LIFE visitor experience, be it transparent touch screens;  
the development of Remote Operated  
Vehicles giving unique underwater views;  
or new low energy lighting systems for  
our aquarium displays. 
 DELIVERING  THE MAGIC
‘WELL PLACED TO MEET THE  
NEXT SET OF CHALLENGES’
Another record breaking year in project management has seen us 
working on 49 major projects in eleven countries during the year, 
with the projects in total representing a capital investment of  
over £230 million.
We delivered new accommodation offerings across five different 
sites to support our resort strategy; opened three new Madame 
Tussauds as part of our six Midway roll outs (including our first 
ever Madame Tussauds boat ride!); introduced The Dungeons to 
the USA (our first outside of Europe); developed fantastic projects 
with Intellectual Property partners, the BBC and Rovio at two  
of our parks; launched our third (!) winged coaster at another; 
brought LEGO Duplo and CHIMA Worlds and water parks  
into the LEGOLAND Parks; launched and relaunched SEA LIFE 
Centres and a LEGOLAND Discovery Centre; expanded a 
Madame Tussauds… and brought penguins to the heart of England!  
Innovative thinking across the whole of Merlin Magic Making 
remains our guiding philosophy. This, as well as delivering 
compelling propositions to entice our customers to come 
and visit, along with our aim to drive great value from 
everything we produce, means that we are well placed to 
meet the next set of challenges… so bring on the fun!  
What are  
we doing?
We have teamed up directly with the Lucasfilm team and put together 
the first ever Star Wars Madame Tussauds exhibition, ready for launch 
in the 2015 season. Two separate exhibitions are being produced, one 
in the Madame Tussands flagship attraction in London and one in our 
hugely successful Madame Tussauds in Berlin. Initially for a five year 
period, the success of the Star Wars intellectual property is set to  
go from strength to strength with the launch of a new series of  
films over the next few years.
Our creative teams have been working hard to produce a series 
of realistic sets which depict the epic Star Wars story. They will be 
brought to life with original music from the films, special sound effects, 
lighting, props and even smells, enabling our guests to feel like they are 
right in the middle of the action. The heroes of the sets, of course, will 
be the world famous Madame Tussauds figures, representing some of 
the most iconic characters ever to be produced.
What will the 
results be?
We will have produced a unique chronological story, through both the 
prequels and the original trilogy, which will allow guests to immerse 
themselves in the amazing story of Star Wars. Visitors will be able to 
stage a ’Lightsaber’ duel with Anakin Skywalker; feel like they are 
piloting the Millennium Falcon with Chewbacca; or recreate the iconic 
‘I am your father’ moment with Darth Vader. The scene is set for this 
to be one of the best Madame Tussauds exhibitions ever undertaken! 
How are  
we doing it?

WE DESCRIBE OUR COMPANY’S CULTURE AS ‘THE MERLIN WAY’. IT CAPTURES 
THE ESSENCE OF HOW OUR EMPLOYEES ARE ALIGNED WITH OUR ONE 
ULTIMATE GOAL OF DELIVERING MEMORABLE EXPERIENCES TO OUR 
GUESTS. OUR PEOPLE STRATEGY IS SUPPORTED BY THREE PILLARS: EMPLOYEE 
ENGAGEMENT; TALENT AND DEVELOPMENT; AND COMPENSATION AND 
BENEFITS. OUR STRATEGY DRIVES US TOWARDS OUR AMBITIONS: TO BE 
THE BEST COMPANY TO WORK FOR IN OUR INDUSTRY; TO NURTURE OUR 
GLOBAL LEADERS; AND TO REWARD PERFORMANCE. WE MEASURE OUR 
SUCCESS THROUGH THE OUTSTANDING EMPLOYEE ENGAGEMENT SCORES 
WE CONTINUE TO RECORD IN OUR ANNUAL EMPLOYEE SURVEY . 
Employee­engagement
We believe that our people lie at the heart of all we do and 
are committed to being the best company to work for in our 
industry. Whether permanent or temporary, full or part time, 
based in Germany or Singapore (or anywhere else in the world), 
we want to attract people from all walks of life and make  
sure they have a truly great experience working for us.  
Our employment policies, amongst many other things, are 
testament to this and include Equal Opportunities, Global 
Whistleblowing and Global Study Support.
‘The Wizard Wants to Know’
Our annual online employee survey, 
‘The Wizard Wants to Know’,  
went out in the summer to all  
our employees across the globe.  
 This survey is our chance to find 
out how engaged our people are 
and to hear what it’s like to work 
for this magical Company of  
ours. We are excited that 97% 
completed the survey and thrilled 
that 95% said that they enjoy 
working here. We think these  
are truly awesome scores!
Our overall staff engagement score is one of Merlin’s key 
performance indicators and is derived from the responses to  
a number of key questions within the survey. We are delighted 
that our staff engagement score was exceptionally high once 
again. It was way above our 80% target, something that we  
are all very proud of. The largest driver of this, we believe, is  
‘The Merlin Way’, our spell of values that wins the hearts  
and minds of our employees to deliver the most magical,  
memorable experiences to our guests.   
Diversity
We believe that our people are the single biggest reason behind 
the Company’s success, so we always strive to make life at Merlin 
better for all of them, with diversity being an important part of 
this. We have designed our strategy to give us the best people  
for all roles, regardless of gender, race, disability, sexual orientation 
or any other factor. Our aim is to ensure that everyone has equal 
access to all opportunities wherever possible. Further details  
of our disability agenda are outlined in our Corporate Social 
Responsibility section on page 58. In terms of gender diversity, 
we have launched the Women at Merlin (W@M) programme 
to help us give women the chances and support they need 
to achieve their ambitions and develop into senior roles.
Throughout 2014 W@M activities included a number of  
different events, workshops and webinars. Our diversity  
strategy was recognised when we won the ‘Women 1st’  
Large Business Award this year. That was incredibly gratifying  
and a strong indication that we are doing the right things.
Women now work at every level within Merlin including the 
Board and the Executive Committee. 107 or around 35% of all 
our senior leaders are women as are 4,065 or approximately 
50% of our permanent colleagues globally.
Other engagement initiatives
We encourage all of our attractions to use the Merlin intranet  
to publish newsfeeds of interesting information and developments 
at their sites, as well as providing further regular communications 
through the more traditional routes of newsletters, team briefs 
and noticeboards.  
In addition, all our employees can be actively involved themselves 
through a number of popular initiatives. These include:
• STAR - our online global recognition scheme that saw more  
 than 90,000 ’Stars’ sent out worldwide in 2014, in recognition  
 of an outstanding contribution or as a simple ‘Thank Y ou’ for a  
 job well done.  
• Spark an idea - an online portal for colleagues to share their  
 ideas, big or small. We have received hundreds of ideas since  
 we launched this scheme in 2012 and lots have already been  
 put into practice in our attractions. We never cease to be  
 amazed by all the fabulous ideas that our people come 
 up with.
• The Merlin Way film competition - run every year to give our  
 people everywhere the chance to make a two minute video  
 clip demonstrating just how they make The Merlin Way come  
 to life. They can be so good that we show these inspirational  
 films when we are looking to attract new recruits to come  
 and join us at Team Merlin.

T alent ­ and­ development
It is essential to Merlin’s future growth that we recruit and 
develop the ‘Team Merlin’ of the future. We are an entertainment 
company, dedicated to providing memorable experiences to our 
guests, so we seek out the people who have a love of fun and 
a natural ability to inject some magic into the lives of our guests 
when they come and visit one of our attractions. Once recruited, 
we then nurture their talents and support their development 
throughout their careers with us.
Recruitment
We use technology more and 
more in our hiring strategy to 
improve the application process, 
with social media a big part of 
this approach. We work on 
building relationships in developing  
markets to improve our campaigns  
there and make us as appealing  
as possible to local candidates. 
Our recruiters need to be experts 
in choosing Merlin people with 
the right skills and attitudes, so 
we have online tools to help them 
share best practice, as well as 
videos with opinions and ideas 
from our senior leaders.
XLR8 
We have a well-established fast track graduate programme in 
place for marketing and general management positions, which  
we call XLR8. Roles on the programme are always tailored to the 
individuals who are supported through their career every step of 
the way. The success of this can be seen through our 2012 intake, 
all of whom have progressed to permanent roles in 2014. We 
have also promoted lots of our previous XLR8 alumni into senior 
positions across the Group during the past year. The 2014 intake 
included fun-loving, talented recruits from across the UK, North 
America, Germany, China and Australia.
Leadership development programmes
We have many superb leadership development programmes in 
place, including our flagship ‘Xcalibre’ course, run with Kingston 
University in the UK and aimed at leaders who have bags of 
potential. We also have the Merlin leadership programme, which 
we run across the globe. In addition, during the course of last 
year we introduced some ‘Bootcamps’, which are development 
centres specifically for our general management, finance and  
HR team members. These courses include a combination  
of personal development and 
competency assessment to help  
us identify and nurture talent. 
Merlin employee exchange programme
The Merlin Employee Exchange Programme helps our people  
via a ‘job swap’ in another attraction (that can be anywhere in  
the world) to help them develop new skills, experiences, and 
relationships, positioning them for their next step in their 
professional journey.
And finally, at any time our teams can access Merlin’s School
of Magic, our online training resource run in conjunction with  
the renowned Ashridge Business School. 
Compensation ­ and ­ benefits
When you rely on your people as much as we do, we believe it  
is essential to provide compensation and benefit programmes 
which are competitive and which support our business  
and culture.
Share plans
This year we made good progress towards our goal of helping  
as many of our colleagues as possible to take an equity stake in 
Merlin. We call this ‘owning a piece of the magic’, and we believe 
it is an important way of making Team Merlin even more 
committed to our success.
Following our Listing in November 2013, we launched our  
first Employee Sharesave plan in January 2014 to give all our 
permanent colleagues the chance to save money over a three 
year period to buy Merlin shares. This was communicated 
internally with a comprehensive, multi-media campaign that 
included videos from our CEO, webinars, face to face briefings, 
intranet updates, posters and ‘table-top teasers’. Overall, almost 
30% of permanent staff took up the opportunity to start saving 
to buy shares. In the UK, the take-up rate was 40%, with some 
teams having more than 80% of their people taking part.  
We have also continued to roll out the other long term incentive 
plans that we launched last year, making grants to more than 50 
colleagues who joined Merlin or were promoted to senior 
management grades during the year. 
Other benefits initiatives
We run a number of programmes to support our teams  
and continue to harmonise our local benefit structures on  
a territory by territory basis.
With our rapid growth, 2014 has seen a big step up in the 
number of colleagues moving to new countries to support  
our business growth. Our international mobility programme is 
therefore proving invaluable in helping us move our talent  
safely, securely and comfortably.  
We offer an external, confidential Employee Assistance 
Programme to support our staff when they need it. We also  
offer reduced-cost gym memberships at a number of sites  
and have various wellness initiatives around the Group.

RISKS
and uncertainties
MERLIN HAS A PROACTIVE APPROACH TO THE MANAGEMENT OF POTENTIAL 
RISKS AND UNCERTAINTIES WHICH COULD AFFECT THE HEALTH AND SAFETY OF 
GUESTS, STAFF OR OUR ANIMALS OR HAVE A MATERIAL IMPACT ON THE GROUP’S 
BUSINESS PERFORMANCE, DELIVERY OF ITS STRATEGY OR THE INTEGRITY OF ITS 
FINANCIAL REPORTING. IT IS AN INTEGRATED ‘BOTTOM UP’ AND ‘TOP DOWN’ 
APPROACH, WITH BUSINESS RISKS IDENTIFIED, EVALUATED, CONTROLLED AND 
MONITORED BY BOTH OUR ATTRACTION AND CORPORATE MANAGEMENT 
TEAMS, OVERSEEN BY THE BOARD AND ITS COMMITTEES.
Overview­of­Merlin ’ s­risk­management­appr oach
Evolution in approach
During the course of 2014, Merlin has reviewed its overall 
risk management approach to further align it to the management 
of the business and the Board Committee structure. 
Prior to this change in approach, risks were categorised into: 
health and safety matters; current trading and future expansion 
risks. All matters were overseen by a Corporate Risk Management 
Committee which reported to the Executive Committee and, 
through the CEO, to the Board. In addition, there was a dedicated 
Health, Safety and Security Committee of the Board chaired by 
the Chairman to oversee all health and safety matters.
In the latter part of 2014, an amended approach to risk 
management has been implemented. The Group has now 
separated risk management into three components to reflect 
the varying functions and committees that manage and oversee 
such risks on an ongoing basis. The three components are:
• Health, safety and security risk.
• Commercial and strategic risk.
• Financial process risk.
Whilst the Board retains overall responsibility, specific 
Committees are appointed by the Board to oversee the 
management of the risks in each category:
• The Health, Safety and Security Committee and the Audit   
 Committee comprise Board members to oversee health,   
 safety and security matters and financial process risks respectively.
• The Group’s Executive Committee, a non-Board committee,   
 oversees commercial and strategic risk through a Commercial and  
 Strategic Risk Management Committee made up of members of the  
 Executive Committee and other relevant senior managers. It reports  
 quarterly to the Board on such matters, through the CFO.
Risk appetite
The Board has defined the Group’s risk appetite 
(tolerance of risk) according to whether a risk is pure 
or speculative.
Pure risk refers to situations where there is clear regulatory 
guidance and matters are strictly defined, such as ride safety, 
accounting practices or food hygiene. The Group has a very 
low appetite for pure risk. In practice this means that wilful 
breach of any national or local legislation is unacceptable.
Speculative risk relates to decisions for which acceptance of a risk 
can bring commercial benefit. The Group has a greater appetite 
for speculative risk, which it assesses based on an appropriate 
analysis of threats and opportunities, along with appropriate 
decision-making authority levels. Factors such as the scale of 
possible commercial upside, the potential market size, the 
quantum of downside risk and timescales involved may all  
be relevant to speculative risk decisions.
Risk management
Each attraction and central function maintains a risk register, being 
a record of the material risks it faces categorised into the three 
components of risk as identified above. The registers include 
a rating of each risk, based on an assessment of the likelihood 
and impact after taking into account existing mitigating control 
measures. Where this assessment indicates a high residual risk, 
additional actions are considered to further mitigate the risk. In 
respect of financial risks, such actions may include the use of 
hedging instruments to protect against movements in foreign 
exchange and interest rates, following an assessment of the 
perceived risks in each case. Risk registers provide the basis 
for ongoing risk management and all are formally reviewed 
at least once a year. 
In addition to the ongoing risk management processes, periodic 
detailed reviews of specific risk issues are also undertaken. This 
review process, together with structured audit programmes 
covering both financial processes and health, safety and security 
controls across the Group, allow the Board to gain assurance 
over the robustness of risk management systems.
Health, ­ safety­ and ­ security­ risks
Integral to Merlin’s strategic vision is our absolute commitment 
to continuously achieve high standards of health, safety and 
security (HSS). Merlin’s number one priority is delivering safe 
and memorable experiences to guests. Our unequivocal focus 
is on ensuring that our operations are as safe as possible at all 
times, thereby honouring the trust that our guests, employees 
and shareholders place in us. Our ultimate aim is to proactively  
and continuously improve HSS performance.
HSS management
Responsibility for the management of HSS resides with the 
Board, with day to day management delegated, via the Executive 
Committee, to the relevant management teams throughout the 
Group with local HSS committees in place at both Operating 
Group and attraction levels.
Merlin’s HSS Policy and health and safety management 
system together set mandatory obligations for standards and 
performance across all our operations. Our approach, which is 
well embedded across the Group, incorporates the requirements 
contained within the UK official guidance on the safe practice of 
fairgrounds and amusement parks (HS(G)175), as endorsed by 
the UK Health and Safety Executive. Similar guidance, including 
in respect of robust independent inspection regimes, is applied 
in all territories in which we operate.
HSS assurance
Merlin conducted 78 HSS audits during 2014 to assess compliance 
with our HSS policy and manual, which are reported to the HSS 
Committee. These audits are in addition to the regional and
attraction based self-inspections that also take place throughout 
the year. In addition, thorough in-service annual inspections were 
conducted on all our rides during the reporting period, meeting 
UK requirements (or other national equivalents) as a minimum. 
These are typically performed by accredited independent third 
party inspectors.
All attractions that prepare and serve food and beverages are 
subject to half-yearly or annual food safety audits, performed 
by specialist independent third party inspectors, to verify 
compliance with Merlin’s comprehensive food safety policy. 
 Risk registers provide the 
basis for ongoing risk management 
and all are formally reviewed at 
least once a year
 Our unequivocal focus is on 
ensuring that our operations are 
as safe as possible at all times, 
thereby honouring the trust that 
our guests, employees and 
shareholders place in us

Health and safety is one of Merlin’s  
Key Performance Indicators. 
A serious accident to a guest or staff member  
on a ride or at an attraction could cause harm  
to an individual and impact confidence in the 
Group’s brands.
•  Proactive ownership of HSS risks by line management   
   based on the provision and adoption of HSS policies,  
   Codes of Practice and guidance notes.
•  Competent and trained operational and engineering staff,  
   backed up by professional HSS teams supporting,   
   monitoring and inspecting attractions.
•  Utilisation of HSS systems to support the management of  
   risks with annual risk register and action planning   
   processes by each attraction.
•  Regular internal and annual independent external  
   auditing regimes.
•  Regular review of performance as well as key policies  
   and procedures.
Stable
Contractor 
management
The delivery of new attractions and experiences, 
which often involve work by sub-contractors. 
Poor standard of work or unreliable delivery 
could impact the Group’s safety and  
growth expectations.
•  Contractor approval procedures.
•  Major contracts are managed by qualified project   
   managers and are subject to strict tendering processes.
•  Contractor performance is managed by in-house project 
   management teams.
Stable
Macro event A material macro event such as the spread of 
a worldwide pandemic or malicious attempt 
to sabotage a ride or attraction could 
impact visitation.
•  Detailed security protocols.
•  Regularly tested major incident management plans.

Commer cial ­ and ­strategic­risks
Commercial and strategic risk management is delegated from 
the Board, via the CEO and the Executive Committee, to 
the Commercial and Strategic Risk Management Committee 
(CSRMC). This latter Committee comprises, the CFO, who is 
a member of the Board, relevant members of the Executive 
Committee and other relevant senior managers and is chaired by 
the CFO. It meets four times per year with matters arising being 
reported to both the Executive Committee and the Board on 
a quarterly basis by the CFO. T o provide the Non-executive 
Directors with sufficient information to gain assurance over the 
process of commercial and strategic risk management, a fuller 
document is provided annually detailing the items discussed and 
output of the CSRMC. Furthermore, in 2015 the minutes of  
each meeting will be issued to the Non-executive Directors.
The management of commercial and strategic risk is embedded 
across the Group through normal business review processes. In 
addition, from 2014 onwards, each attraction and central function is 
required to perform a full risk assessment workshop on an annual 
basis. The purpose of this process is to review any material changes 
in the external commercial landscape and to assess whether recent 
trading trends may require an alternative risk management 
approach. These annual assessments are incorporated into the 
commercial and strategic section of the risk register for each 
Operating Group and are aggregated at Group level.
Financial ­ pr ocess ­ risk
Financial processes within the Group are led and co-ordinated 
by the central finance function. Financial process risks are 
managed by that team through an ongoing assessment of 
external regulatory changes, the quality and timeliness of internal 
financial reporting and other financial risk areas such as taxation 
and treasury. Key issues are reviewed on a quarterly basis by 
a senior finance team within Merlin.
Further assurance is gained from both the internal and external 
audit processes. In 2014 the internal audit function, based on an 
annual assessment of risk, provided audit coverage of material 
central functions and attractions covering over 70% of revenue 
generated, identifying procedural weaknesses and providing a 
structure to assess management’s response. The Group is also 
subject to external audit. Matters arising from both audit 
functions are reported to the Audit Committee.
Business ­ continuity ­ planning
Disaster recovery plans are in place at all attractions, incorporating 
escalation procedures and crisis management protocols that 
are regularly updated on a groupwide basis. More broadly, 
business continuity plans exist to allow the attractions to recover 
performance in the event of various adverse incidents. Examples 
of such incidents could include prolonged power failure, major IT 
failure or life support system failure within a SEA LIFE attraction. It 
is recognised that only limited contingency planning can be made 
against natural disasters such as major flooding or earthquakes, 
however the Group’s geographic diversity provides protection 
against the financial impact of such occurrences.
The tables on the following pages highlight the main risks that have 
been identified through the Group’s risk assessment processes and 
that have the potential to impact on our strategic development. 
The tables show whether, in the opinion of the Board, such risks are 
increasing, stable or decreasing based on management assessment, 
review of available data and after taking account of the mitigating 
factors identified.

Customer 
satisfaction
Customer satisfaction is one of Merlin’s  
Key Performance Indicators.
A downturn in customer enjoyment of our 
attractions could impact repeat visitation. 
Similarly subsequent adverse social media 
feedback could adversely affect customer 
likelihood to visit.
•  Regular and detailed customer feedback collected at  
   every location. Data analysed against challenging   
   satisfaction targets and actions taken accordingly.
•  Ongoing investment in our attractions continually   
   refreshes the experiences for customers.
Stable
People 
availability and 
expertise
Staff engagement is one of Merlin’s  
Key Performance Indicators. 
Merlin is a people business. The inability to 
attract and retain motivated, customer service 
orientated staff could impact guest satisfaction 
and future expansion.
•  Personal development plans in place at all levels of the   
   business to encourage long term employment stability.
•  Succession planning processes embedded across the 
   Group and proactively managed.
Increasing
Animal welfare Growth would be impacted if animals were lost 
to disease or other welfare issues.
•  External Zoo Licence audits ensure appropriate  
   animal care.
•  Internal ethics committee and the Merlin Animal Welfare  
   and Development team ensure the ethical treatment of 
   animals in our care.
Stable
Availability and 
delivery of new 
sites and 
attractions
The Midway and LEGOLAND Parks growth 
strategy is predicated on the availability of 
suitable sites. A decline in the pipeline of  
suitable and economically viable sites could  
inhibit this growth. 
Planning permission is often required for new 
rides and attractions so growth could be 
impacted if planning permission were not  
able to be obtained.
•  Experienced site search and business development teams,   
   working several years in advance to maintain a strong  
   pipeline of expansion opportunities.
•  In 2014 the LEGOLAND development and site search  
   teams have been expanded to support the development 
   of new parks and other sites.
•  Sites regularly update their development masterplans  
   and teams work closely on fostering links with their  
   local communities.
Stable
Competition Competition for leisure time and new entrants to 
the market could reduce opportunities for growth.
•  Diversification to reduce reliance on individual  
   attractions or locations.
•  Ongoing investment in sites to ensure continued  
   appeal to visitors.
Increasing
IT robustness, 
technological 
developments 
and cyber 
security
The Group has grown in the past both organically 
and through acquisition and as a consequence  
has varied IT systems across its portfolio.
Such systems are integral to the Group’s 
operations and financial reporting integrity.
The Group is conscious of the increasing  
threat of cyber crime.
•  IT strategy focused on ensuring the long term stability of  
   operating systems and data security, whilst keeping pace  
   with the changing face of consumer IT expectations.
•  Significant 2014 investment to ensure the Group remains  
   compliant with payment card industry standards.
•  Additional measures put in place to mitigate the 
   increasing threat of cyber security risk.
•  Regular updates to the Board on the progress of the  
   IT strategy.
Increasing
Weather / 
seasonality
Individual attractions performance can be  
affected by particularly adverse weather at  
key trading periods.
•  Increased portfolio hedging as the proportion of  
   revenue generated from Asia Pacific and North America   
   regions increases.
•  Healthy mix of indoor and outdoor attractions.
•  Strategy to drive an increased percentage of 
   pre-booked business.

Financial­pr ocess
Anti-bribery and 
corruption
An incident of bribery or corruption could lead 
to prosecution and fines and could cause 
reputational damage to the Company.
Merlin’s business model is lower risk relative to 
other industries as the majority of transactions 
are of low value and to individual customers.
Merlin has a well embedded culture across the 
Group in which fraud and bribery at any level  
are not tolerated. Merlin does however operate 
globally and increasingly within territories with  
a historically higher propensity to bribery  
and corruption.
•  Global fraud and bribery training programme in place  
   alongside a fraud policy sign off for all staff.
•  Regular assessment of bribery exposure, and in  
   2014 performed an assessment workshop to reassess 
   risks across the Group.
•  Robust financial and contractual controls with regard to  
   procurement activities. Internal audit monitors purchasing 
   processes on a rotational basis.
•  A separate profit protection team monitors for theft or 
   other criminal activity across the Group and ensures best 
   practice for protection is shared between sites.
•  A whistleblowing policy is in place together with an  
   independently operated employee hotline.
Stable
Credit risk Merlin has relationships with a number of  
banks and is therefore inherently exposed  
to some credit risk.
Merlin has very limited credit risk with its 
customers, the vast majority of whom pay in 
advance or at the time of their visit.
•  Counterparty credit ratings are regularly monitored and      
   there is no significant concentration of credit risk with    
   any single counterparty.
Stable
Foreign 
exchange risk
Merlin has its main borrowings and revenues  
in Sterling, Euros, US Dollars and Australian  
Dollars so is inherently exposed to exchange  
rate fluctuations which could impact on 
financial performance. 
Merlin reports its results in Sterling and as such  
is subject to translation risk in reporting its 
consolidated results.
•  Broad match of borrowings in the currencies of  
   underlying revenues.
•  Treasury policies in place and reviewed annually with     
   regular reviews of currency exposures.
•  Currency exposures hedged where appropriate. 
•  The Group presents constant currency figures where   
   appropriate to show the underlying results of the  
   Group excluding the impact of foreign exchange rate   
   translation differences.
Increasing
Interest  
rate risk
Merlin continues to finance its operations 
through a combination of predominantly floating 
rate debt, and equity. It is therefore inherently 
exposed to interest rate fluctuations which  
could impact on financial performance.
•  Interest rate swap arrangements in place to fix the  
   majority of the debt and substantially all of these are 
   hedge accounted.
•  Group policies in place in terms of counterparty  
   relationships and minimum credit rating criteria.
Stable
Liquidity / Cash 
flow risk
Many of Merlin’s businesses are seasonal in 
nature, generating cash in peak trading periods 
and utilising cash out of season, when capital 
investments are undertaken and fixed  
costs continue to be incurred.
Merlin’s growth plans include both the roll out  
of existing Midway and LEGOLAND brands, as 
well as strategic acquisitions when appropriate 
opportunities present themselves. The Group 
needs to have sufficient cash to fund  
these activities.
Lack of liquidity and changes to the global credit 
market could impact the Group’s long term 
ability to meet current growth targets.
•  Short term cash flow forecasts are updated frequently in  
   order to ensure liquidity for business operations on an 
   ongoing basis.
•  Forecasts look forward for at least three years and are 
   reviewed regularly to ensure sufficient financial headroom 
   exists and to meet the covenant tests set out in the 
   Group’s banking facilities.
•  Merlin maintains strong relationships with a number  
   of lenders and keeps the debt markets under review in 
   order to ensure that funding is obtained at the right time 
   and at the right price to ensure the availability of funds to 
   meet its strategic growth plans.

T rading ­performance
Like for like revenue grew by 7.1% in 2014. When combined with 
the contribution from new attractions and accommodation, total 
revenue grew by 9.6% also on a constant currency basis. However,  
the reported revenue growth was suppressed by significant 
unfavourable movements in foreign exchange rates, resulting in 
4.8% reported growth to £1,249 million. Further detail on the 
impact of foreign exchange movements is provided overleaf.
Visitor numbers grew by 4.9% during the year, reflecting a 
combination of underlying growth in the existing estate of 
attractions, as well as the addition of six new Midway attractions.
The existing estate benefited from good weather across all of  
the main trading periods in Europe; the phenomenal success 
of ‘The LEGO Movie’ with its consequent impact on LEGO 
brand awareness and our ability to successfully leverage specific 
promotional activities; and a strong performance across Resort 
Theme Parks. Our Midway businesses delivered a solid year with 
specific challenges in Bangkok, which suffered from political unrest; 
whilst our North American Midways were adversely impacted  
by the extremely cold weather early in the year which reduced 
visitation and had a knock-on effect on school holiday periods.
Revenue per capita (RPC) was £18.15, in line with the prior year 
(2013: 	 £18.14). This was driven by general underlying increases 
and a positive mix impact with proportionally higher visitation in 
the LEGOLAND Parks which bring higher average spend levels.  
This was however offset by adverse foreign exchange impacts. 
The Company’s focus continues to be on revenue maximisation 
rather than specific volume or RPC targets.
Over the past four years, the Company has reported growth 
in revenue at a compound annual growth rate of 11.8% and 
average like for like revenue growth of 4.8%.
Underlying EBITDA grew by £21 million, or 5.3% to £411 
million, despite the significant unfavourable foreign exchange 
movements. Underlying growth was 7.8% on a like for like basis, 
increasing to 11.0% with the contribution of new attractions and 
accommodation, on a constant currency basis. The reported  
compound annual growth rate in EBITDA over the past four 
years was 12.6%. 
Merlin’s operating model is such that increased revenues at 
existing attractions will flow through to operating profit, subject 
to expenditure on a number of incremental variable costs, such 
as direct cost of sales, incremental labour costs and variable rents. 
Operating margins are also impacted by the mix of revenues across 
attractions, including the impact of foreign exchange translation, as 
well as the nature of additional revenues generated by each site. In 
2014, the growth in EBITDA as a percentage of revenue reflected 
a healthy conversion of revenue into profit, tempered by increases 
in variable trading costs, new share-based remuneration and 
corporate costs as a result of the IPO in 2013, along with 
certain remedial costs to the hotel at LEGOLAND Windsor.
Underlying operating profit growth of £21 million and 7.1% was 
driven by the growth in EBITDA. The reported depreciation and 
amortisation charge remained flat year on year at £100 million 
reflecting underlying increases offset by the impact of  
foreign exchange movements.

Finance­costs
Net underlying finance costs of £62 million represented a 
reduction of £42 million (2013: 	 £104	million). During 2013 facility 
amendments were made which reduced the margins payable 
on the Group’s debt facilities; there was a restructuring of the 
interest rate swaps portfolio; and borrowings were repaid  
from the net proceeds of the IPO. During 2014 further  
debt repayments of £70 million were made.
T axation
An underlying tax charge of £70 million is equivalent to an 
effective tax rate of 28.0% (2013: 	 12.7%) of underlying profit 
before tax. The difference between the reported effective tax 
rate and the UK standard weighted tax rate of 21.5% is mainly 
due to the different tax rates that apply in the various 
jurisdictions we operate in around the world.
The charge in 2013 reflected similar differences in tax rates  
offset by the recognition of deferred tax assets in the UK.  
This UK deferred tax asset recognition came as a result of the  
Group’s financing changes in that year that resulted both in lower 
underlying interest charges and lower levels of debt, and hence 
greater certainty of tax becoming payable in the future.
Further detail is provided in note 2.3 to the financial statements.
Exceptional ­items
There were no exceptional costs impacting EBITDA or operating 
profit in 2014 (2013: 	 £30	 million 	in	 respect	of	costs	 associated 	 
with 	the 	IPO	and	acquisition	related	activities).
Exceptional finance costs before tax of £23 million were recorded 
to accelerate the expected amortisation rate of previous loan 
issuance costs. This arose as a result of the Board’s assessment at 
the end of 2014 that a more reliable estimate of the timeframe 
for refinancing would be some time during 2015. Further details 
are provided in the financial statements on page 131.
In 2013 net exceptional finance income of £16 million before  
tax was recorded in relation to gains and losses on derivative  
financial instruments which were not hedge accounted.
Tax on exceptional items amounted to a credit of £6 million 
(2013: 	 char ge 	of	£3	million).
For eign ­exchange­rate ­sensitivity
Merlin is exposed to fluctuations in foreign currency exchange 
rates, principally on the translation of the results of our overseas 
operations. The table below shows the impact on 2013 revenues 
of re-translating them at 2014 foreign exchange (FX) rates. 
Operating profits would be similarly impacted.
Dividend
As previously announced, the Company intends to adopt a 
progressive dividend policy within an initial target range of  
payout of 35-40% of underlying profit after tax, so as to  
maintain an appropriate level of dividend cover whilst retaining 
sufficient capital in the Group to fund continued investment 
across our six growth drivers.
In September 2014 we paid our first interim dividend of  
2.0 pence per share and we are proposing a final dividend  
of 4.2 pence per share. This equates to a full year dividend  
of 6.2 pence per share.

Merlin continues to be highly cash generative.
The Group generated a net operating cash flow after tax of 
£357 million (2013: 	 £365 	 million). This primarily reflects underlying 
EBITDA, offset by tax payments of £54 million. These tax payments 
have increased in 2014 as a result of higher profits together with

Loan­facilities
Under the existing bank facilities, Merlin has a revolving facility of 
£150 million (2013: 	 £150	million). This facility is in addition to the 
term debt and is available to finance working capital requirements 
and for general corporate purposes. As at 27 December 2014, 
£nil had been drawn down from the revolving facility (2013: 	£nil).  
Merlin is required to comply with certain financial and non-
financial covenants, including a requirement to maintain certain 
ratios of EBITDA to both net interest payable and net debt. The 
existing facility is secured by fixed charges over the shares in 
certain Group companies and certain intra-Group receivables.
The Group’s loan facilities remained unchanged throughout 2014 
following the amendments made during 2013 that secured 
financing out to 2019. Following the IPO and reflecting the 
Group’s subsequent progress, it is pleasing to note that we have 
now secured a new £1,300 million banking facility that, once 
drawn, will replace the existing debt facilities. The Company 
will continue to explore opportunities to diversify sources of 
funding and extend maturities. 
The new senior unsecured facilities will comprise circa £1,000 
million in floating rate term debt, with maturities in 2018 and 
2020, along with an increased £300 million revolving credit facility. 
The reduction in drawn term debt will be funded through the 
use of circa £130 million of the Group’s existing cash balance. 
The increased revolving credit line will ensure that the Group has 
adequate committed liquidity facilities to support our seasonality 
and strategic growth objectives. Under the new facilities we 
will be required to comply with certain financial and 
non-financial covenants.  
Overall, the new financing arrangements are more suitable for  
a company of our size and profile. They will provide further 
flexibility for the Group and, through lower average margins,  
will reduce the cost of debt finance.
Net ­ assets
Net assets increased by £119 million from £944 million in  
2013 to £1,063 million in 2014.
This reflects £162 million profit for the year, offset by 
£27 million of other comprehensive income, primarily 
exchange losses arising on the retranslation of net assets 
denominated in foreign currencies, together with movements 
in the valuation of hedge accounted derivatives. In addition we 
incurred an expense of £4 million in respect of share-based 
payments and paid an interim dividend of £20 million. 
The consolidated statement of financial position on page 
106 shows an increase in property, plant and equipment of  
£89 million from £1,321 million to £1,410 million, primarily  
reflecting the capital additions referred to previously offset by 
depreciation charges, together with the retranslation of those 
assets at different foreign exchange rates. Foreign exchange 
translation differences also account for the majority of the 
reported reduction in intangible assets from £961 million to  
£942 million. Working capital has remained broadly flat and  
net debt has reduced as a result of the financing activities 
referred to previously. The net pensions liability remained  
broadly flat at £5 million (2013: 	 £4 	 million). 
Further detail is provided in the notes to the financial 
statements on pages 109 to 156.
In February 2014 we completed a capital reduction process, 
whereby £3,183 million of share premium was converted into 
profit and loss reserves. This conversion had no effect on the 
overall net asset position but increased distributable reserves  
by an equivalent amount. 
R eturn ­on­capital­ employed ­(R OCE)
The Board considers ROCE to be an important metric for 
appraising financial performance and uses it, along with EPS, in  
the remuneration of senior executives. The profit measure used 
in calculating ROCE is based on underlying operating profit after 
taking account of a normalised long term tax rate. The capital 
employed element of the calculation is based on net operating 
assets which include all net assets other than deferred tax, 
financial assets and liabilities, and net debt. ROCE in 2014 
was 10.6% (2013: 	 10.2%).
Capital expenditure and investing activities of £195 million 
in aggregate was incurred in order to invest in both the existing 
estate businesses (£107 million) and new attractions and 
accommodation (£88 million, including early stage spend  
on new LEGOLAND Park developments). 
In line with our strategy, Merlin’s capital investment programme 
creates new rides and features for the existing businesses, 
following the specific investment cycles laid down for each 
Operating Group. In addition, during 2014 we continued to  
invest significantly in new accommodation offerings across our 
theme park resorts. All major capital projects are appraised  
both operationally and financially and Merlin sets clear  
project return targets to assist in assessing the viability  
and prioritisation of capital investment projects.
Within the £88 million of new development capital expenditure 
noted above, the Group invested £49 million in expanding the 
Midway portfolio. Six new attractions were opened in 2014

with the stability and flexibility of our bank facilities give an 
appropriate financial platform on which we can pursue our 
growth strategy based around our six strategic growth drivers.

Leverage on net debt at the year end equates to 2.3x  
underlying EBITDA (2013: 	 2.6x), recognising both the growth  
in EBITDA and the reduction in net debt as a result of the 
strong cash generation.

Social Responsibility
A KEY ELEMENT OF OUR MERLIN WAY CULTURE IS THAT WE CARE  
ABOUT OUR PEOPLE, OUR VISITORS, THE CREATURES IN OUR CHARGE  
AND THE COMMUNITIES AND ENVIRONMENT IN WHICH WE OPERATE. WE 
CALL THIS ‘BEING A FORCE FOR GOOD’ AND FOCUS OUR EFFORTS IN THE 
FOLLOWING KEY AREAS: SUSTAINABILITY AND THE ENVIRONMENT; ANIMAL 
WELFARE; MERLIN’S MAGIC WAND CHILDREN’S CHARITY; AND BECOMING 
THE COMPANY OF CHOICE FOR VISITORS AND STAFF WITH A DISABILITY .

Strategy and governance
Merlin’s strategy on sustainability and the environment is  
to manage resources responsibly. Ultimate responsibility for  
the implementation of this strategy rests with the CEO,  
with management teams responsible for implementation  
at local and regional levels.
Environmental policy
Merlin recognises that its operations impact upon the 
environment and that effective management of this impact  
is essential for sustainable business success. We are committed  
to monitoring and reviewing our activities and identifying 
opportunities for sustainable environmental improvement, in  
line with our business goals, in order to minimise the potentially 
harmful effects of such activity, wherever and whenever 
practicable. In particular we will:
• Comply with all relevant legislation and where appropriate  
 and practicable, exceed these requirements and apply  
 best practice.
• Promote a culture of environmental responsibility and   
 awareness through leadership, communication and training  
 for customers, employees, contractors and suppliers.
• Further develop our excellent standards of animal husbandry  
 and welfare, applying best practice across the Group’s  
 animal collections.
• Consult with relevant stakeholders to meet the Group’s   
 environmental commitments.
• Consider and plan for practical and cost-effective control   
 measures in order to minimise environmental impacts   
 associated with the Group’s operations including energy   
 conservation, water reduction, pollution prevention, waste  
 reduction, recycling and disposal.
• Encourage regular investments in environmental initiatives   
 such as low carbon and renewable technologies, improved  
 water management and diversion of waste from landfill.
• Strive to continually improve our environmental performance  
 and minimise the social impact of activities by periodically   
 reviewing our environmental policy in light of our current  
 and planned future activities.
Environment and energy management
We have specific budgets set aside to test and implement 
environmentally focused initiatives and an annual ‘Environmental 
Award’ to motivate our sites in this area. We have developed 
groupwide sustainability management and carbon reduction plans 
and a number of water and waste management initiatives that 
have been developed to encourage sites and build on examples 
of best practice across the Group, through 2015 and beyond.
We participate in the UK Carbon Reduction Commitment 
(CRC) energy efficiency scheme and other applicable 
environmental regulations globally.
Greenhouse gas (GHG) reporting
The Company is required to annually report its carbon  
dioxide emissions in tonnes emitted.  From 2014 Merlin has been 
collecting the global data necessary, both to meet these reporting 
requirements and more importantly to drive our long term  
aim of reducing our emissions intensity by 2% annually.

Animal­welfar e
As well as being the leading global operator of aquariums through 
our SEA LIFE brand, Merlin also runs zoos at the Chessington 
World of Adventures Resort in the UK along with WILD LIFE 
Sydney Zoo and WILD LIFE Hamilton Island in Australia.  
The Company has an excellent reputation for the ethical and 
responsible care, preservation and conservation of animals 
and the marine environment. This reputation is widely 
acknowledged by expert organisations around the world. 
In 2012, Merlin acquired Shanghai Chang Feng Ocean World, 
which has three Beluga Whales on display. In line with our publicly 
stated policy on cetaceans in captivity, we are working hard with 
Whale and Dolphin Conservation (WDC) to find and develop a 
more natural environment for these animals. Whilst a number of 
solutions are explored, their welfare is our top priority and we 
have adapted their daily routine to focus on natural behaviour 
and keep them sufficiently stimulated and healthy.
Breed, Rescue, Protect
Merlin actively engages our guests and employees in our 
conservation and welfare work through our global ‘Breed, Rescue, 
Protect’ initiative and promotes the protection of wildlife across 
the globe by supporting projects and campaigns which make  
a real difference.
SEA LIFE
Breed
2014 was another great year for the successful breeding of many 
marine species across the SEA LIFE network with 65 different species 
and 7,737 individual animals bred including a baby Gentoo Penguin, 
christened Elsa, at the SEA LIFE London Aquarium and a Black Tip 
Reef Shark in Günzburg, Germany amongst many other species.
Rescue
As part of our ‘Rescue Rehabilitation Release Programme’ we 
have rescued many animals through our SEA LIFE network this 
year. Our focus on releasing these where possible continued 
with 108 seals and 43 turtles being released through the year. 
As part of its ongoing rescue and release programme, in May  
SEA LIFE Busan Aquarium rescued a Finless Porpoise, which is in 
rehabilitation with the view to being released back to the wild. 
Protect
In its first full year of operation, the SEA LIFE Trust has benefited 
greatly from the support of SEA LIFE staff and guests around the 
globe. The Trust launched its first public campaign in June, ‘Wipe 
out Whaling’, a joint initiative with WDC calling for the EU to end 
the transport of whale meat through European ports. With the 
support of SEA LIFE, the Trust is gathering many thousands of 
signatures to help bring an end to this unacceptable practice.
During 2014 the Trust committed funding to campaigns working 
to develop a simple test to determine the illegal use of poison 
to catch fish; and a project studying the undulate ray that will 
help sustainable breeding and conservation of the species 
(see Case Study on page 57).
We have raised significant funds across the globe in 2014 to 
support future projects, and in 2015 the Trust will launch a new 
global campaign focused on protecting marine habitats. 
WILD LIFE
Chessington World of Adventures Resort continues its successful 
breeding programmes with two Scimitar Horned Oryx, two Gentle 
Lemurs, two Golden Headed T amarins, one Saki Monkey, two Bolivian 
Squirrel Monkeys and twelve Black-cheeked Lovebirds all being bred 
during 2014. Our troop of Gentle Lemurs at Chessington represents 
over 10% of the entire European collection, a critically endangered 
species found in the wild in a shrinking area in Madagascar.
The Chessington Conservation Fund (CCF) also committed 
to a number of projects:
• In partnership with the World Land Trust, CCF now sponsor  
 a ranger to protect the 128 acres of Ecuadorian rainforest  
 (equivalent in size to the Chessington Resort and purchased  
 in 2012) from illegal logging and the bush meat trade.
• CCF funded the purchase of an X-ray machine to help Ape  
 Action Africa in their efforts to rehabilitate orphaned gorillas  
 back to the wild. A case study of the importance of this   
 diagnostic health equipment was showcased on the BBC   
 programme ‘Operation Wild’ with Shufai the Gorilla. 
• CCF worked with a new organisation in Zimbabwe, the   
 Dambari Wildlife Trust, providing identification equipment  
 including cameras to the rangers who actively patrol the  
 area which is frequented by both the threatened White  
 and Black Rhino.
WILD LIFE Sydney Zoo have supported a number of 
conservation activities:
• A project with Sydney University to address a disease that  
 threatens the survival of the iconic Tasmanian Devil.
• Providing direct support in Queensland to charitable  
 wombat breeding facilities.
• Directly supporting the Rainforest Rescue 
 programme in northern Queensland’s 
 Daintree rainforest. 
CASE STUDY
How are we 
doing it?
By taking a wide variety of samples from undulate ray populations, including 
from the wild, we test their genetic makeup. The rays are DNA sampled 
much like you would see a ‘suspect’ being swabbed on an episode of ‘CSI’!  
All the creatures are then released unharmed and the DNA information 
we have collected is held in a database. This complex data is then analysed 
so we can effectively create a large ‘family tree’ of the UK captive undulate 
ray population. This will aid a deeper understanding of their genetic 
structure and guide us in our mission to constructively influence the 
species’ successful survival.
What will the  
results be?
We will be the first in the world to have mapped the genetic makeup 
of the species. The knowledge gained will be freely available for use across 
the globe by fisheries management teams and Non-Governmental 
Organisations. This will assist the management of wild populations 
and help protect the long term future of this amazing creature.
What’s this 
all about?
The undulate ray is a European species of skate which lives in coastal 
waters from southern UK to the Mediterranean. There has been a sharp 
decline in the wild population over the last decade, caused primarily by 
overfishing, being caught as by-catch and habitat destruction. The undulate 
ray is now classified as ‘Endangered’ and commercial fishing of the species 
is now banned in the EU.
What are 
we doing?
Our Animal Welfare and Development department has been leading a 
breeding programme for the undulate ray over the last four years. In 2014 
Merlin teamed up with the University of Manchester to research the 
genetic picture of undulate rays in aquariums across the UK. We plan to 
extend this essential activity across Europe, to understand how these 
genetic pictures vary from area to area, both in captivity and in the wild.

Merlin ’ s ­Magic­W and
Merlin’s Magic Wand (MMW) forms a key element of Merlin’s 
Corporate Social Responsibility commitment. Our very own 
children’s charity delivers magical experiences around the world 
to children who are disadvantaged through sickness and disability. 
The charity arranges great days out at our attractions. For those 
children faced with conditions and circumstances that prevent 
them from having a day out, the charity delivers ‘Taking the  
Magic to the Children’ projects, which are local outreach  
initiatives designed to take Merlin’s Magic to severely ill 
children that live within the localities of Merlin attractions.
Merlin’s support for the charity continues through providing 
tickets free of charge (which had a retail value of over  
£1 million in 2014) and supporting the small charity team  
by providing office accommodation, IT and HR support. 
2014 was another record breaking year for MMW, providing over 
64,500 memorable experiences to children and families around 
the world. In 2014 every Merlin attraction that had been open 
for more than four months welcomed children through MMW.   
We are very proud of the 97% satisfaction rating we received  
for their experience.
MMW completed six new projects in 2014 at children’s hospitals, 
hospices and schools in the UK, Germany and Australia. We have 
many more planned for 2015 including a LEGOLAND themed 
play area for a children’s therapy centre in Chicago.
Disability
Our long term aspiration is to be seen as the company of choice 
for visitors and staff with disability. We see this as an important 
element of our ‘Being a Force for Good’ strategy and aim to drive 
continuous improvements in this area. Our plan is to exceed  
the legislative requirements in place in the various locations in 
which we operate and, in the longer term, provide what will 
be considered industry leading facilities and experiences.  
T o support our aims we are able to utilise valuable feedback  
from our MMW visitors in order to deliver improvements and 
inform future developments to our attractions and resorts.  
We carry out a comprehensive annual survey of our MMW 
guests and will be expanding this further in 2015.  
All aspects of accessibility are being explored including 
‘Changing Places’ toilet facilities, which are much larger facilities 
with specialist equipment to accommodate the more severely 
disabled. We have the first one of these facilities within a UK 
theme park at the Chessington World of Adventures Resort. 
We are also training front-line staff (including World Host 
accreditation) and are making improvements to signage and 
other communication in the attractions. In order to ensure  
we are applying best practice we are taking advice from  
other organisations including ‘Re-vitalise’ and ‘Whizz Kidz’.   
Merlin makes no differentiation between able bodied and 
disabled persons in terms of recruitment, training and career 
progression. Furthermore, we make every effort to continue  
the employment and training of those persons who become 
disabled while employed by the Group.
Community ­ R elations
Our attractions continue to forge partnerships with local 
charities and other groups supporting disadvantaged people.
Some examples of these local initiatives are:
• Sites in the UK and USA offer opportunities through   
 programmes such as the Prince’s Trust and other local   
 initiatives for young, often disadvantaged people to gain work  
 experience and skills training with Merlin. The LEGOLAND
 Windsor programme is run with the award winning ‘Ways  
 to Work’ organisation with the local council and provides   
 supported employment to individuals with learning difficulties.
• Madame Tussauds Hong Kong tickets were donated to Yan Oi  
 T ong, Yan Chai Hospital and the Hong Kong Federation of  
 Handicapped Y outh in 2014. 
• LEGOLAND Florida works with the charities ‘Give Kids the  
 World’ and the ‘Sunshine Foundation’s Dream Village’ which  
 both bring thousands of sick, disabled and underprivileged  
 children to Central Florida’s Theme Parks. In addition it is  
 very engaged with its immediate community, supporting  
 and sponsoring local events, free school trips for local  
 school children, Chambers of Commerce activities and   
 corporate fundraising.
• With the relaunch of Busan Aquarium as a SEA LIFE, we   
 collected all 1,163 of our former Busan Aquarium uniforms  
 and donated them to ‘OTCAN’ Charity (www.otcan.org), a  
 local non-profit organisation that distributes donated clothes  
 to children in need all over the world. 
•  The Christmas Carols Concert is a community event that  
 has taken place at Warwick Castle for the past 43 years.  
 The concert, which is regularly attended by over 2,500 local  
 residents raises money for three local charities. The Castle  
 provides the venue at no cost, sells tickets to the event  
 and gives significant operational support.  
Other­ ar eas
Procurement and sourcing
We recognise the responsibility we have to the workers in  
our supply chain and seek to ensure our products are made in 
an appropriate environment and the products we source are 
produced in accordance with international laws and legislation.
We require all of our suppliers to sign the Merlin
Entertainments Standard Terms and Conditions of Purchase. 
We will independently audit certain categories of suppliers, who 
produce Merlin Entertainments branded products, against the 
Merlin Social Audit Report. We commit to working with these 
suppliers to ensure they achieve our standards. Strict sanctions 
are applied when standards are not met.
We will enter into rebate and volume discount arrangements 
with suppliers where appropriate but do not require suppliers 
to make loyalty or ‘pay to stay’ type payments to the Group. 
Our payment terms vary in different territories; standard 
payment terms are 45 days.  
Human Rights
Merlin has implemented a Human Rights Policy that sets out our 
approach in this area. We are guided in this by the International 
Labour Organisation Declaration on Fundamental Principles and 
Rights at Work; and the OECD Guidelines for Multinational 
Enterprises. The Policy notes that:
•  We value diversity and have a commitment to equal   
 opportunity and intolerance of discrimination and harassment.
•  We will not engage in child labour.
• We will not use forced or compulsory labour and have   
 policies in place regarding non-excessive working hours.
• We respect employees’ right to join, form or not to join  
 a labour union without fear of reprisal, intimidation or   
 harassment and will act in good faith when legally required  
 to enter into collective bargaining agreements.
• We operate in full compliance with local labour laws regarding  
 wages, benefits, holidays and rest breaks.
• We are committed to maintain a safe, secure and healthy   
 workplace for our employees.
• We will comply with all relevant legislation and where   
 appropriate and practicable, exceed these requirements  
 and apply best practice.

visitors around the world have also got behind the charity, 
donating their change at attractions and joining in with events. 
Corporate partners have shown their support for the charity this 
year, raising over £110,000 at our gala dinner and annual cricket 
day. We also continue to benefit from support from our major 
shareholder base. Blackstone, the LEGO Foundation and CVC 
have all contributed via events, partnership activity and/or 
financial grants, and we are grateful in particular to CVC  
for their ongoing support for the charity.

Nick has over 24 years’ experience  
in the visitor attractions industry and  
was appointed Chief Executive Officer 
of Merlin Entertainments in 1999.  
He has been a Director of the 
Company throughout the year and 
continues in this role as at the date  
of this report.
Prior to Merlin, Nick was Managing
Director of Vardon Attractions and a 
main board director of Vardon plc. In 
1999 Nick led the management buyout 
of Vardon Attractions to form Merlin 
Entertainments. In 2005 he initiated  
the process which led to its acquisition 
by Blackstone and subsequent rapid 
expansion, taking the Company to  
its 2013 Listing on the London  
Stock Exchange.
Before joining Vardon Attractions,  
Nick held senior positions within  
The Tussauds Group (part of Pearson

FMCG marketing first with Rowntree  
and then Reckitt & Colman.
Andrew Carr,
Chief 	 Financial 	 Officer
Andrew is a qualified chartered 
accountant and was appointed  
Chief Financial Officer of Merlin 
Entertainments in 1999. He has
been a Director of the Company
throughout the year and continues in 
this role as at the date of this report.
Prior to Merlin, Andrew was Financial
Director of Vardon Attractions and 
played a key role in the management 
buyout of Vardon Attractions to form 
Merlin Entertainments in 1999 and in 
the subsequent business, including  
two follow-on buyouts, the acquisitions 
of LEGOLAND, Gardaland and  
The Tussauds Group and the Listing  
of Merlin Entertainments on the 
London Stock Exchange.
Before joining Vardon Attractions, 
Andrew trained, and was subsequently 
head of a regional Corporate Finance 
Department, at KPMG.
The members of the Board during the year and at the date of this report are as follows:
The effectiveness reviews concluded that the Board and its 
Committees were functioning well and that each participant 
brought an independent perspective to the Board’s deliberations 
with no individual or group of individuals exercising undue 
influence. The reviews further concluded that the transition from 
the private to public environment had gone smoothly, partly due 
to the fact that Merlin had operated for a number of years prior 
to IPO under a corporate governance structure which was 
more aligned to that of a listed plc. The reviews recognised that 
the composition of the Board was not settled and that further 
changes were likely, both to reflect the reducing shareholdings 
of Blackstone and CVC (two of the pre-IPO major shareholders) 
and to ensure that the range of experience on the Board 
remained aligned with the needs of the Group’s business as it 
continued to develop. The reviews recommended a number 
of ways in which the effectiveness of the Board could be 
improved and these are being implemented.
Investor ­ r elations
The Company communicates with institutional and private 
shareholders in a number of ways and has a dedicated investor 
relations team to facilitate the exchange of information and 
feedback between shareholders and shareholder representative 
bodies and the Company. Details of major shareholders are

Main Contents CORPORATE Governance Report
CORPORATE
Governance Report
Boar d­membership­and­ UK­corporate ­ governance­code
Except as otherwise stated, as at the date of this Annual Report 
the Company complies and the Company intends to continue  
to comply with the Code. The Board will also take account of 
institutional shareholder governance rules and guidance on 
disclosure and shareholder authorisation of corporate events.
The Code recommends that a UK listed company’s Chairman be 
independent on appointment. The Chairman was appointed in 
December 2009. The Board considers that the Chairman was 
independent on appointment and remains so. The Board does 
not consider the subsequent introduction of CVC (to whom the 
Chairman is an adviser) as a shareholder in July 2010 affected the 
independence of the Chairman for the purposes of the Code. 
The Chairman’s role is to ensure good corporate governance.
The Code recommends that at least half the members of the 
Board of Directors (excluding the Chairman) of a UK listed 
company should be independent in character and judgement  
and free from relationships or circumstances which are likely 
to affect, or could appear to affect, their judgement.
The Board has concluded that, for the purposes of the Code, 
Charles Gurassa, Ken Hydon, Miguel Ko and Fru Hazlitt should  
be regarded as independent Non-executive Directors and that 
their appointments were in the best interests of shareholders. 
Although Mr Gurassa previously served on the board of Tragus 
Group Limited (previously a Blackstone portfolio company) 
and Mr Ko served during the year on the board of Formula 
One (Delta T opco Limited), a CVC portfolio company, the other 
Directors have concluded that the judgement, experience and 
challenging approach of each of them ensured that they made 
a significant contribution to the work of the Board and its 
Committees. Their contributions during the year have, in 
the opinion of the other Directors, amply demonstrated 
their independence. 
Blackstone and CVC, along with KIRKBI, were the pre-IPO major 
shareholders of Merlin and remain major shareholders. KIRKBI has 
maintained its shareholding following the IPO and presently holds 
29.89% of the issued share capital of the Company. Blackstone and 
CVC have sold part of their holdings in the Company during the 
year and, as at the date of this Annual Report, hold 9.35% and 
5.50% of the issued share capital respectively.
The Non-executive Directors representing KIRKBI (Søren Thorup 
Sørensen), Blackstone (Dr. Gerry Murphy) and CVC (Rob Lucas) 
are not regarded as independent for the purposes of the Code.
On this basis, the Board considers that although during 2014 
it did not comply with the recommendation of the Code 
concerning the balance of independent Non-executive Directors 
on the Board, in practice the Board had an appropriate balance of 
Directors and operated independently of any of its shareholders.
At the beginning of February 2015 Miguel Ko notified the 
Company that he will not be standing for re-election at the 
forthcoming Annual General Meeting. The Board intends that 
Merlin will be fully compliant with the recommendations of the 
Code (including in relation to Board composition) from the  
date of the 2015 AGM.
R elationship ­ agr eements
The Company has entered into Relationship Agreements with 
each of KIRKBI, Blackstone and CVC. Under these agreements:
• Each of these shareholders is entitled to appoint one Director  
 to the Board. In addition, while KIRKBI holds at least 10% of  
 the Company’s issued share capital, it may also appoint an  
 observer (in addition to a Non-executive Director) to the  
 Board (with the right to attend and speak but not vote).
• Each may appoint an observer (with the right to attend   
 and speak but not vote) to each of the Audit Committee,  
 Remuneration Committee and Nomination Committee for so  
 long as they (together with their respective affiliates) hold at  
 least 10% of the Company’s ordinary shares.
Underwriting­ agr eement
Under an Underwriting Agreement entered into as part 
of the IPO, KIRKBI, Blackstone and CVC agreed, subject to 
certain customary exceptions, not to dispose of any shares in the 
Company for a period of 180 days following the IPO. Under the 
same agreement each of the Executive Directors, Non-executive 
Directors and Merlin Entertainments Share Plan Nominee 
Limited (on behalf of senior management shareholders) agreed, 
subject to certain customary exceptions, not to dispose of any 
shares in the Company for a period of 360 days following Listing.
These restrictions expired during the year and none of the 
pre-IPO major shareholders are presently under any obligation 
to the Company restricting their ability to dispose of shares in 
the Company.
Major­shar eholdings
As at 24 February 2015, the latest practicable date prior to the 
date of this Annual Report, the Company had been notified 
pursuant to DTR5 of the following interests in 3% or more  
of the Company’s total voting rights: 
Boar d ­ and­its ­Committees
The Chairman is responsible for the effective running of the 
Board and for communications with all Board and Committee 
members and shareholders. He ensures that the Board receives 
sufficient information on financial, trading and corporate issues 
prior to Board meetings. 
The Board has established Audit, Remuneration, Nomination and 
Health, Safety and Security Committees with formally delegated 
duties and responsibilities and written terms of reference. In 
addition, from time to time, separate Committees may be set up 
by the Board to consider specific issues when the need arises.
The Chief Executive Officer is responsible for day-to-day 
operations and the development of strategic plans for 
consideration by the Board. He is assisted in this by an 
Executive Committee of senior managers. The Executive 
Committee is not a formal committee of the Board.
The terms of reference of each of the Board and its 
Committees are available on the Company’s corporate 
website www.merlinentertainments.biz
The Directors of all Group companies, as well as the Board 
and each of its Committees, also have access to the advice and 
services of the Group Legal Director and Company Secretary 
and other senior management, as well as external advice on, 
inter alia, legal, accounting, remuneration, health and safety 
and corporate governance matters. Appropriate induction 
and subsequent training is provided to new members of 
the Board and its Committees.
The table below sets out the membership of the Board and 
its Committees during the year, together with the number 
of meetings held and each member’s attendance. The tables

and its Committees covering their respective responsibilities,

Main Contents AUDIT Committee Report
AUDIT
Committee Report
Dear Shareholder
This report describes how the Audit Committee discharged its 
duties during 2014. It is divided into the following four sections:
• How the Audit Committee operates.
• Risk management and the control environment.
• Where we focused in 2014.
• Responsibilities in respect of internal and external audit.
How ­the­ Audit ­Committee­ operates­
The first part of the report focuses on how the Committee 
operates under its terms of reference, which are available on  
our website. In line with these terms, the Committee created  
and delivered an annual plan that met all of the Committee’s 
annual obligations.
Risk ­management­and­the ­ contr ol ­envir onment
The second part of the report presents our view of risk 
management and the control environment, in particular how 
we assess the overall structure of internal controls and risk 
management within the organisation. Our terms of reference 
include reviewing the Company’s overall risk management 
systems and we are satisfied the Board has received regular 
reports that covered all areas of risk.
Wher e ­we­focused­in ­ 2014
The third part of the report explains the key areas we have 
focused on in 2014, including determining the appropriateness 
of significant or complex accounting matters that require the 
greatest scrutiny. In finalising the annual financial statements we 
focused in particular on the valuation of assets and impairment 
and revenue recognition policies and processes. In addition we 
considered treasury accounting matters. We have concluded 
that the treatment in the accounts is appropriate, at all 
times evaluating matters in the context of whether their 
presentation is fair, balanced and understandable.
R esponsibilities­in­r espect ­of ­ internal­and­ external­audit
The final section of the report explains the Committee’s 
obligations in relation to audit, both internal and external. We 
are satisfied with the internal audit team’s performance and 
that they focused on the key accounting and financial control 
matters around the Group, achieving a material coverage of 
the Company’s revenue and assets.
We are also satisfied that management has responded well to 
the auditors’ recommendations. Since writing my 2013 report we 
have conducted an effectiveness review of the internal audit function 
which contributed to our assessment that the function is effective.
An effectiveness review of the external auditors was completed 
covering the quality of their work and independence which 
resulted in positive feedback with some minor points to be 
addressed. During 2014 the FRC, as part of its annual review of a 
sample of audits by the main audit firms, reviewed certain aspects 
of KPMG’s 2013 audit of Merlin. The FRC has provided a copy 
of the report to me and I note it concluded that there were no 
matters it wished to formally report on. In light of these reviews 
and the Committee’s interactions with KPMG throughout the 
year, we recommend they be reappointed at the AGM.  
We have continued to keep abreast of guidance in relation to 
audit retendering and rotation which has been subject to ongoing 
changes. The UK authorities have recently requested comments 
on their proposals on how the EU regulation should be adopted 
and the UK Competitions and Markets Authority (CMA) has also 
recently issued its requirements for mandatory audit tendering. 
We are committed to ensuring the audit is tendered in line with 
the UK’s regulations when they are finalised, probably requiring a 
tender by 2023. Depending on how the UK chooses to adopt the 
regulations, which have various options and reliefs, KPMG may 
or may not be eligible to participate.
Our KPMG lead audit partner, Mark Summerfield, has reached 
the end of his permitted tenure and is being replaced as Senior 
Statutory Auditor by Hugh Green. We participated fully in Hugh’s 
selection and believe he has substantial, relevant experience. 
I would like to express my thanks to Mark for his significant 
contribution over the years.
It has been a good year during which we have appreciated 
the enthusiastic support of management.
K en ­ Hydon
Chairman ­ of­ the ­ Audit ­ Committee
25 February 2015 
STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE AUDIT COMMITTEE
How­ the ­ Audit­Committee­ operates
The Role of the Audit Committee
The Audit Committee has received delegated authority from  
the Board set out in its written terms of reference. The primary 
purposes of the Audit Committee are:
•  T o monitor the integrity of the financial statements of the  
 Company and report to the Board on significant financial   
 reporting issues and judgements.
• T o review and report on the effectiveness of the Company’s  
 internal controls and its overall risk management systems.
• T o review the Company’s arrangements for its employees to  
 raise concerns through its whistleblowing and fraud policies.
• T o monitor and review the effectiveness of the Company’s  
 internal audit function, and its material findings, in the context  
 of the Company’s overall risk management system.
• T o oversee the work of the external auditor’s performance  
 and independence.
• T o report formally to the Board and make recommendations  
 where it is deemed necessary on matters within its terms of  
 reference, including a formal report to the Board on how it  
 has discharged its responsibilities.
The above obligations form the basis of an annual plan that  
is agreed before the start of the year and reviewed at each 
meeting. All elements of this plan were covered during the  
course of the year.
These terms of reference were subject to a review in 2014
which resulted in the following minor changes:
• Confirmation of the Audit Committee’s role in relation to the  
 review and/or approval of the Group’s public statements.
• Amendments to reflect the Audit Committee’s obligations in  
 respect of risk management, following the changes made to  
 the internal risk management process in 2014 as described  
 in the Risks and uncertainties section on page 42.
Membership and meetings
Details of the membership and frequency and attendance at 
meetings are outlined in the Corporate Governance Report on 
pages 64 to 67. In addition to the permanent members, the CFO 
and other key members of management routinely attend. The 
Chairman and the CEO also frequently attend meetings and 
others are invited to attend from time to time depending on the 
matters under discussion. Private meetings are routinely held with 
internal audit and KPMG. The Committee also meets privately.
Risk­management ­and­the­contr ol ­envir onment
The Board retains overall responsibility for the Company’s 
internal controls and has overseen some evolution of the 
Company’s risk management processes in 2014, building on the 
thorough reviews and audits that took place in preparation for 
the Listing in 2013.
As outlined in the Risks and uncertainties section on pages 
42 to 47, the Group has separated risk management into three 
components: Health, safety and security risk; Commercial and 
strategic risk; and Financial process risk. The Board has delegated 
direct responsibility for Financial process risk to the Committee.
The Audit Committee has a dual role in relation to internal 
controls and risk management.
In assessing internal controls, the Committee first has an 
obligation to assess the overall process of risk management in 
place during the year. It considered the evolution of the process 
described above during the first half of the year and towards the 
end of 2014 it reviewed the overall process of risk management. 
The Committee is satisfied that the Company has systems and 
procedures in place to identify, evaluate and manage material  
risks to the business.
Second, the Committee directly monitors the management of 
the financial process risk of the Company. Management remain 
responsible for establishing and maintaining adequate internal 
controls over financial reporting. Such controls are designed to 
manage, rather than eliminate, the risk of failure to achieve its 
business objectives through the following structure:
• The first level of internal control comprises the delegated  
 authority limits and purchasing and sale price approval levels  
 in place across the Company.
• The second level of internal control is the frequent and   
 regular review processes the Company undertakes on its   
 trading performance along with its detailed capital investment  
 and strategic planning processes.
• The third level of assurance is gained from audit and self-  
 assessment, including quarterly self-certification by the heads  
 of finance of each of the business units; periodic internal audit  
 reviews, with the support of specialist experts as appropriate;  
 and the findings of the external auditors on the control   
 environment and financial statements. The outcomes of these  
 assurance activities are reviewed by management, the Audit  
 Committee and the Board.

Audit plans and outcomes
The internal audit annual plan is developed in conjunction with 
management and by assessing various risk factors before being 
reviewed and approved by the Audit Committee ahead of the 
start of each year.
The material findings of internal audit are reviewed by 
management. Internal audit results and management responses 
are presented at each meeting, with significant findings discussed 
in more detail and challenged where appropriate. During 
2014 our processes have been expanded such that the Audit 
Committee now reviews management’s response to any ‘Priority 
one’ internal audit points raised. Priority one matters relate to 
findings where controls are found to be absent or inadequate 
in areas which are considered susceptible to fraud or material 
misstatement (at a local level); where there is any evidence of 
deliberate falsification of documents; or where there is a 
perceived risk of harm to guests or staff.
KPMG also present their view of Merlin’s control environment 
at the December meeting, following their audit of such processes 
in the fourth quarter.
These measures, combined with an assessment of discussions 
with relevant stakeholders of the internal control systems, 
satisfied the Committee in 2014 that a thorough process exists 
within Merlin to assess the internal control environment, and 
that financial process controls are in place to mitigate the risk
of a significant loss or fraud occurring.
Wher e ­we­focused­in ­ 2014
As noted above the Committee operates to its annual work plan, 
developed from its terms of reference. This plan is reviewed at 
each meeting to account for any further items that may need to 
be included as a response to matters arising. In addition we have 
kept abreast of any updates in governance, legislation or guidance.
The detail below highlights some of the main areas that the 
Committee focused on in 2014 and we are pleased to report 
that the Committee had no cause for major disagreements 
with management during the year.
Immersion in the business and operations
As part of the Board meeting calendar the Committee members 
have had the opportunity in 2014 to visit several of the Group’s 
major attractions across Europe and spend time with the local 
management teams. We also undertook ‘deep dives’ into three 
areas during the year: reviewing treasury operations; reviewing 
tax operations; and reviewing how internal audit reports are 
actioned across the Group.
Consideration of significant accounting matters
Following discussion with both management and the external 
auditors, the Committee determined that the areas of most 
significant judgement, which could give rise to misstatement
of the Group’s financial statements were:
•  The valuation of assets and impairment.
•  Revenue recognition.
These items were considered by the Audit Committee, at the 
time they agreed the external auditor’s plan, when reviewing 
the external auditor’s final audit findings, and in discussion with 
relevant members of management. In addition, the Committee 
considered treasury accounting matters, in the context of the 
Group’s review of financing options during the year.
The valuation of assets and impairment is an important area of 
significant judgement given that Merlin’s business involves opening 
attractions in new and, to some degree, unproven locations. In 
addition the Group operates existing businesses in geographically 
and politically diverse areas. The Group has also made material 
acquisitions in the past in various countries.
The Group has accumulated experience of opening many attractions 
globally, but inevitably the performance of additional attractions, 
particularly in new markets, can be difficult to predict accurately. 
The exposure of existing attractions to macro-economic volatility 
may indicate a need for an impairment assessment.
These factors make forecasts in the existing estate and acquired 
businesses similarly uncertain. Valuations are performed by Merlin 
based on discounted future cash forecasts and other market data. 
They are complex to perform, include judgemental information 
such as market discount rates, and are based almost entirely  
upon forward looking estimates of future cash flows. 
Management provided a detailed paper to the Audit Committee, 
explaining the methodology and judgements applied in order to 
test the value of assets to determine if impairment is required. 
Specifically the paper examined the basis by which the discount 
rate was determined, before being applied to forecast cash flows. 
Similarly the judgements made in order to calculate an asset’s 
terminal value were also assessed in the paper. A combination 
of discount rate, terminal value and forecast cash flows are 
used to calculate the ‘value in use’.
Management also provided the detail of each Operating Group’s 
valuation both in terms of value in use, as described above, 
and fair value less cost to sell. In accordance with accounting 
standards, comparing the higher of these two valuations to their 
carrying values determines whether any impairment is required.
Having reviewed the basis of management’s calculations and 
the findings of the external audit on the valuation of assets and
impairment, the Committee is satisfied with the appropriateness 
of the presentation in the financial statements and that no 
impairment is required.
Revenue recognition was considered specifically during 2014 
primarily in order to consider the potential impact of IFRS 15,  
the new accounting standard on revenue from contracts with 
customers, which will become effective from the 2017 
accounting period.
Merlin’s revenue is generated by high volumes of low  
value transactions across numerous jurisdictions globally.  
Whilst there is limited judgement required in Merlin’s revenue 
accounting policies compared to other sectors, the accuracy  
of financial reporting requires robust internal controls over 
cash reconciliations and the accurate cut-off of revenue at 
the balance sheet date in the instance of advanced sales 
or payment in arrears by trade customers.
There have been no material changes in revenue streams or 
processes during 2014 and, as in previous years, the Audit 
Committee has considered the internal controls in place, 
including those over its revenue streams, and concludes 
that they remain effective.
The Committee has further concluded that IFRS 15 is not 
expected to materially alter the Company’s financial results.
Treasury accounting was examined by the Committee in the 
context of management considering that there was an increasing 
likelihood of refinancing the Group’s debt before the contractual 
end date of the Group’s existing lending facility. Accordingly, the 
amortisation of issue costs was accelerated. The Committee 
reviewed analysis in respect of the contemplated refinancing 
and management’s accounting paper, explaining the calculation  
of the accelerated issue cost amortisation.
Following consideration of this analysis the Committee was 
satisfied with the accounting for and disclosure of this matter.
Accounting, tax and financial reporting
In addition to considering the material judgement areas, the 
Committee assessed the main financial statements presented by 
the Company during the year as well as items that they believe 
are material to the integrity of the financial processes and output.
The Committee:
• Considered the half year and full year financial statements.
• Considered the liquidity of the Group, in particular in relation  
 to any covenants in place.
• Considered the appropriateness of preparing the half year and  
 full year accounts on a going concern basis.
• Reviewed disclosure in the Annual Report and Accounts in  
 relation to internal control, risk management process and the  
 work of the Committee.
• Reviewed and assessed the liability in relation to the   
 Company’s defined benefit pension schemes.
• Received technical updates, in particular in relation to the   
 requirements and changes to the Code, and assessed the   
 Audit Committee’s report in the context of the Code’s   
 requirement for ‘fair, balanced and understandable’ reporting.
During the year an effectiveness review of the Audit Committee 
was undertaken. This was based on a questionnaire sent to 
Committee members, all other attendees and the Board on 
a broad range of matters including the Committee’s scope; 
organisation and meetings; quality of debate and challenge and 
leadership of the Committee. The results showed a broad 
consensus that the Committee has been effective.
Whistleblowing systems and fraud mitigation
The Committee receives regular updates on whistleblowing, 
including the quantity, source and nature of incidents reported. 
Information is also provided on how matters are resolved.
Efforts have been made in 2014 to increase the awareness  
of the Company’s whistleblowing procedures across the Group.  
The Company has a good culture of encouraging its staff to 
report incidents of poor practice, as evidenced by 71% of the 
employees who completed the staff survey stating that they were 
aware of the whistleblowing process. In order to enhance and 
embed this culture further, an independent third party hotline 
provider has been appointed and the hotline will be rolled out 
across the Group by the middle of 2015. It will provide more 
detailed reporting and highlight any trends that emerge.
The Company has had a fraud policy in place for some time.  
This includes the provision of mandatory training for those staff 
who are considered the most likely to be exposed to fraud risk. 
In addition, there is a formal policy review and sign off process 
undertaken by a wider community, including senior executives 
and middle management. This process has been updated and 
revised in 2014 following a periodic review of the fraud and 
bribery risk register, with refresher training provided to  
relevant staff.

Misstatements
Management reported to the Committee that they were not 
aware of any material misstatements made intentionally to achieve 
a particular presentation. The auditors reported to the Committee 
any misstatements that they had found in the course of their work 
and no material adjustments were required. The Committee 
confirmed that it was satisfied that the auditors had fulfilled  
their responsibilities with diligence and professional scepticism.
After reviewing the presentations and reports from management 
and consulting where necessary with the auditors, the Committee 
was satisfied that the financial statements appropriately addressed 
the significant judgements and key estimates both in respect to 
the amounts reported and the disclosures. The Committee was 
also satisfied that the significant assumptions used for determining 
the value of assets and liabilities had been appropriately 
scrutinised and challenged and were sufficiently robust.
R esponsibilities ­in­r espect ­of ­ internal­and­ external­audit
As noted above the internal and external audit functions 
represent an important part of the third level of assurance in 
terms of maintenance of an effective internal control environment 
within the Company. The Committee oversees both internal 
and external audit to ensure they are independent and effective, 
and further information is provided in the following sections as 
to how the Committee satisfies itself of this independence 
and effectiveness.
Internal audit
The Company has an internal audit function led by the Group 
Internal Audit and Risk Management Director who is a member 
of the Institute of Chartered Accountants in England and Wales. 
He reports jointly to the Chairman of the Audit Committee 
and the CFO. With 13 years’ experience in both finance and 
operational roles within the Group, the Committee consider 
him to have the appropriate experience to lead the function.
The internal audit function comprises a further four in-house 
auditors, all of whom hold professional accounting qualifications. 
This team will be expanded by one in 2015 in order to reflect 
the increasing scale of the Company’s operations.
The internal audit function uses external support where 
necessary, for example PricewaterhouseCoopers (PwC) has 
provided specialist support to aid the audit of more complex 
and technical areas, where the internal team did not have the 
relevant skills. In 2014 PwC supported the audits of the 
Group’s IT and treasury functions.
The Committee received and approved a presentation of the 
audits planned to be performed in 2014 at the start of the year, 
including an assessment of the risk approach taken in formulating 
the priorities. Factors such as size of business, history of audit, 
competence and stability of local management, material changes 
to a business and relevance to the Group’s strategy were 
factored into this prioritisation.
During the year, audits have been undertaken providing 
coverage of approximately 70% of the Group’s revenue. In 2014, 
in addition to the revenue generating locations, internal audits 
were performed on the central IT function, treasury function, 
central purchasing functions, centralised payroll processes, retail 
product buying and procurement functions. This coverage is in 
line with the plan approved by the Committee.
The internal audit reports are reviewed by management with 
significant findings also reviewed by the Company’s Executive 
Committee. Any such findings are also discussed at the Audit 
Committee, along with recommendations. In 2014 an increased 
focus has been placed on the level of progress made by  
relevant management on audit findings.
A review of the effectiveness of internal audit was undertaken 
based on a questionnaire at the end of 2014, the results of which 
were presented to the Committee in February 2015. Members 
and attendees of the Audit Committee meetings, along with the 
senior finance community of the Company, were questioned on 
a range of subjects including the governance and organisation 
of the internal audit function, the approach of audit and the 
effectiveness of their reports and conclusions. The survey results 
showed that the internal audit function is considered professional 
and diligent and its internal audits appropriately detailed.
Having considered comments made by management, external 
auditors, the survey results and the quality of the internal audit 
reporting and findings, the Committee concluded that the 
internal audit function was effective.
External audit
KPMG LLP acted as the external auditors to the Company 
throughout the year. The Committee is responsible for overseeing 
the external auditors, including considering the scope of planned 
work and the assessment of risk and materiality on which it is 
based and, on behalf of the Board, approving the audit fee and 
ensuring their independence.
Appointment and governance of the external auditors
The Committee is responsible for recommending the appointment, 
reappointment or removal of the external auditors to the Board, 
together with their remuneration and terms of their engagement.
Throughout 2014 the Company was also bound by a Facilities 
Agreement which stipulated that if any newly appointed auditor 
were not to be one of the ‘Big Four’ accounting firms, the 
proposed firm would need to be approved by the majority 
of the Company’s lenders.
Having performed the role of Senior Statutory Auditor for five years, 
Mark Summerfield will step down from this role at the conclusion 
of the 2014 reporting cycle as part of KPMG’s rules in respect of 
the maximum duration that one partner can perform in such a  
role. The Committee has been involved in the selection of the new 
KPMG partner and has approved the appointment of Hugh Green 
to act in this position with effect from the 2015 financial year.
In recommending the reappointment of external auditors at 
the AGM, the Committee has considered the CMA Order, EU 
Regulation and the UK Corporate Governance Code. These 
regulations are at different stages of adoption and have several 
important differences in how they are to be applied. We 
understand that clarity on how the EU Regulations will be 
implemented in the UK and therefore how they apply to 
Merlin will be available during 2015.  
Whilst the EU regulations and developments in the UK 
Corporate Governance Code will set the maximum term for 
the Company’s auditor, the Committee will continue to consider 
if a shorter term would be appropriate as part of the annual 
recommendation to the Board on the appointment of the 
external auditors.
Remuneration and independence of external auditors
The auditors are eligible for selection to provide non-audit 
services only to the extent that their skills and experience 
make them a competitive and most appropriate supplier of 
these services. Non-audit services are subject to market tenders 
or tests and are awarded to the most appropriate provider. 
Non-audit services that are awarded to the auditors are normally 
limited to assignments that are closely related to the annual 
audit or where the work is of such a nature that a detailed 
understanding of the Group is necessary. The principle followed 
with regard to non-audit services is that the auditors may not 
provide a service which:
• Places them in a position to audit their own work.
• Impacts their independence by creating a shared interest.
• Results in the auditors developing close personal 
 relationships with Merlin employees.
• Results in the auditors functioning as a manager or  
 employee of Merlin.
• Puts the auditors in the role of advocate for Merlin.
The Committee granted the CFO authority to approve the 
following without prior approval:
• Work which a third party requires to be carried out by  
 the Company’s auditors.
•  Tax compliance work where the external auditor is  
 most appropriate.
• Any other work up to a value of £100,000 where the  
 external auditor is best placed to undertake the work.
Management provides the Committee with reports on audit, 
audit-related and non-audit expenditure, together with proposals 
of any material non-audit related assignments. The Committee 
regularly reviews and, where necessary, challenges management to 
ensure that auditor objectivity and independence is not impaired. 
Fees for non-audit services during the year amounted to £0.8 
million (2013: 	 £4.2 	 million). The 2013 figure was significantly 
higher because of the incremental work performed by KPMG 
in relation to the IPO process. Details of the fees paid for audit 
services, audit-related services and non-audit services can be 
found in note 2.1 to the financial statements.
The Committee is satisfied that the overall levels of audit-related 
and non-audit fees, and the nature of services provided, are not 
such that would compromise the objectivity and independence  
of the external auditors.
Assessment of the work of the external auditors
The Committee has evaluated the performance, independence 
and objectivity of KPMG and also reviewed their effectiveness as 
external auditors. The assessment of their effectiveness was partly 
by way of a survey initiated by the Committee on their 2013 
audit, issued to Audit Committee members and other attendees, 
along with senior finance personnel both at Merlin’s attractions 
and at its head office. The survey covered 27 different aspects 
of the audit and respondents were asked to award one of five 
ratings against each aspect and provide additional comments.
The survey indicated widespread satisfaction with the services 
provided by KPMG and the Committee were satisfied with 
KPMG’s responses to points raised in the survey.  
In addition, the effectiveness of the 2014 audit was assessed 
over the year by reference to the following factors:
• The lead audit partner engagement, including the support  
 provided to the Audit Committee.
• The planning and scope of the audit including identification 
 of areas of audit risk and communication of any changes to  
 the plan, including changes in perceived audit risks.
• The quality of communication with the Committee, including  
 the regular reports on accounting and governance matters.
• The skills and experience of the wider audit team and their  
 execution of the audit, including the way they handled the key  
 accounting and audit judgements and communication of the  
 same with management and the Committee.
• Their reputation and standing, including their independence  
 and objectivity and their internal quality procedures.
• The quality of the formal report to shareholders.
We also considered the FRC’s Audit Quality Inspections Annual 
Report 2013/14 and Public Report on the 2013 inspection of 
KPMG. During 2014, the FRC undertook a review of certain 
aspects of KPMG’s 2013 audit of Merlin. We discussed the 
review with KPMG and noted that the report issued by the 
FRC at the end of the review concluded there were no 
significant findings to be formally reported. 
After taking into account all of the above factors, the Committee 
concluded that the external auditors were effective.

DIRECTORS’
Remuneration Report
Dear Shareholder
This year’s Remuneration Report is split into two sections:
• Statement from the Chairman of the Remuneration   
 Committee contains details of our remuneration principles  
 and of the key decisions reached by the Committee  
 during 2014.
• The Annual Report on Remuneration contains details of  
 pay received by Directors in 2014 and full details of how we  
 intend to implement our pay policy during 2015. The Annual  
 Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory  
 vote at the 2015 AGM.
For the reference of shareholders, an Annex to the Remuneration 
Report contains the current Directors’ Remuneration Policy 
(Policy) that was approved by a binding shareholder vote at the 
2014 AGM in the exact form that it was included in the 2013 
Remuneration Report. This Policy remains effective for the 
forthcoming year.
R emuneration ­principles
A series of key principles underpin the Merlin remuneration structure 
such that it should be: payments based on results and performance; 
aligned to the long term success of the Company; consistent with  
best practice; and incorporate widespread share ownership.
Performance orientated
• Rewarding performance is a core part of our ethos. About  
 75% of our permanent employees participate in a bonus plan  
 and over 300 employees receive regular share awards or   
 share option grants.
• T o reinforce the link between performance and pay, most  
 employees are rewarded for the performance of their   
 particular attraction. Only the senior executives (the Executive  
 Committee and their direct reports) and employees of  
 central functions are rewarded for the performance of the  
 overall Group.
• For senior executives, including the Executive Directors,   
 performance related pay, based on stretching short term and  
 longer term targets, forms a significant part of their potential  
 pay packages.
Aligned to the long term success of the Company
Our pay structure encourages strong alignment between  
the interests of our senior executives and the interests  
of our shareholders.
• Senior executives receive regular awards of shares under the  
 Performance Share Plan (PSP) which are subject to the   
 achievement of challenging EPS and ROCE performance   
 targets. EPS and ROCE are key performance indicators  
 aligned to the Company’s strategic priorities. 
• The business continues to see many global opportunities for  
 the successful deployment of capital and these measures are  
 designed to ensure that this is done in the most effective   
 manner to generate sustainable long term returns.
• For senior executives, there is greater emphasis on rewards  
 for delivery of longer term performance targets than   
 short term performance targets.
• Members of the Executive Committee are required to  
 build up and retain a significant holding of Merlin shares.  
 For Executive Directors, the requirement is to build a  
 holding of shares worth 200% of salary.
Consistent with best practice
• Salaries are set at competitive, but not excessive, levels   
 compared to peers and other companies of an equivalent  
 size and complexity.
• There is potential for market competitive levels of total pay  
 but only if stretching business targets are delivered.
• For our employees, we have a high degree of    
 simplicity in our pay model.
Widespread share ownership
• Widespread share ownership is an integral part of Merlin’s     
 culture. We operate all-employee share plans that enable all of  
 our permanent employees to purchase a stake in our Company.
• These plans supplement the discretionary share plans for   
 senior executives (Deferred Bonus Plan and PSP) and  
 the Company Share Option Plan (CSOP) for 
 middle management. 
STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE REMUNERATION COMMITTEE
P erformance ­ in­2014
The financial and operating performance of Merlin in 2014  
is set out on pages 2 to 59 in the Strategic Report.
2014 was another successful year for Merlin. The Company grew 
revenues by 4.8% (9.6% on a constant currency basis), driving an 
increase in underlying EBITDA of 5.3% and generating operating 
cash flow of £357 million.  The Group continued to de-lever as a 
result of its earnings growth and strong cash flow generation.
Performance exceeded expectations and hence profit related 
bonuses became payable for those attractions that outperformed 
and for the central functions. When combined with individual 
performance measures this has resulted in a bonus of 100% 
of maximum entitlement to the CEO and 95% to the CFO.
Pay ­ decisions­for­2015
The proposed pay structure for our Executive Directors for  
2015 is outlined on pages 76 to 77. Key decisions made by the 
Committee in relation to 2015 include:
• The award of a basic 2.0% salary increase for the Executive  
 Directors. This is consistent with the average increase   
 awarded to the Merlin UK workforce.
• The Committee have agreed the same basic structure to the  
 bonus plan as 2014 with individual objectives for the Executive  
 Directors appropriately reflecting Company priorities.
The Committee regularly reviews the existing remuneration 
arrangements in light of evolving market and best practice. 
As part of this process, during 2015, we will be reviewing the 
impact of the revised UK Corporate Governance Code (2014). 
In particular, we intend to undertake a detailed appraisal of 
how withholding and recovery of incentive awards (‘malus’ 
and ‘clawback’ provisions) should be most effectively 
incorporated in our incentive plans for the future.
I hope you will find this report to be clear and helpful in 
understanding our remuneration practices and that you will be 
supportive of the resolution relating to remuneration at the AGM. 
As ever, the Committee welcomes any questions or comments 
from shareholders.

The Annual Report on Remuneration will be subject to an advisory shareholder vote at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.
UNAUDITED INFORMATION
Implementation­of­r emuneration ­policy­in­2015
This section provides an overview of how the Committee is proposing to implement our remuneration policy (as set out in the Annex 
to this Remuneration Report) in 2015.
Base salary
An annual salary review was carried out by the Committee in September 2014. Following that review, the Committee approved  
a basic 2% increase in Executive Director salaries effective from 1 October 2014. This increase is consistent with the average salary 
increase awarded to the Company’s UK workforce for 2014/15.

Pension and benefits
As in 2014, the Executive Directors will receive a Company contribution worth 25% of salary. Nick Varney will receive this contribution 
as a cash allowance and Andrew Carr will receive a contribution to the Group Pension Plan up to the Annual Allowance and a cash 
allowance in respect of the balance. They will also receive a standard package of other benefits consistent with those received in 2014.
Annual bonus
Key features of the annual bonus plan for 2015 remain consistent with the 2014 plan as follows:
• The maximum annual bonus potential will be 150% of salary for the CEO and 135% of salary for the CFO.
• One third of any bonus earned will be deferred into shares for three years under The Merlin Entertainments plc Deferred Bonus Plan.
• Deferred shares will be subject to potential withholding during the deferral period in exceptional circumstances including evidence
coming to light of misconduct justifying summary dismissal or of a material misstatement of the financial accounts.
The annual bonus for 2015 for Executive Directors will be determined as detailed below:
Payment under the non-financial elements of the bonus will be scaled back to the extent that Group underlying operating profit targets 
are not fully met. This means that if there is no payment under the Group underlying operating profit element of the bonus scheme, 
there will also be no payment under this element of the bonus irrespective of performance against the aforementioned individual 
measures. The targets themselves, as they relate to the financial year 2015, are deemed to be commercially sensitive. However, 
retrospective disclosure of the targets and performance against them will be provided in next year’s remuneration report to the
extent that they do not remain commercially sensitive at that time.
Performance Share Plan
Performance Share Plan (PSP) awards are granted over Merlin shares with the number of shares under award determined by reference 
to a percentage of base salary. Vesting of the awards is conditional upon satisfaction of performance conditions and is usually also 
conditional upon continued employment until the awards vest.
The CEO and CFO will be amongst the participants in the PSP award to be granted in April 2015. Awards will be over shares worth, 
at the date of grant, 250% of salary and 225% of salary for the CEO and CFO respectively.
Vesting of these awards will be subject to satisfaction of the following performance conditions measured over the three financial 
years to December 2017. 
• EPS performance condition - 10% of the award will vest for achieving a threshold growth target increasing to 50% vesting
for achieving a maximum growth target.
• ROCE performance condition - 12.5% of the award will vest for achieving a threshold level of average ROCE increasing
to 50% vesting for achieving a maximum level of average ROCE.
As explained elsewhere in this Annual Report, the Company has just secured new finance facilities that, once drawn, will replace the 
existing facilities. Accordingly, the Remuneration Committee has elected to delay the setting of the specific threshold and maximum 
EPS and ROCE targets until closer to the date of grant in April, in order to ensure that the targets are based on the most appropriate 
business plan forecasts (adjusting for the impact of the new finance facilities) available to the Committee at that time.  
The same principles as in the previous grant will apply and it is our intention to communicate the revised targets and their rationale 
to shareholders once the impact of the new financing arrangements is clear.
The Committee will ensure that the agreed EPS and ROCE targets are detailed in the announcement to the Stock Exchange at the 
time that the awards are granted.
Employee Share Plan
The first invitation to UK employees (including Executive Directors) to participate in the Employee Sharesave Plan (UK Sharesave Plan) 
was issued in early 2014. Similar invitations were issued to relevant employees under the US Employee Stock Purchase Plan and the 
Overseas Sharesave Plan.
Invitations for the second award under each of these plans have commenced in February 2015.
Non-executive Director remuneration
The table below shows the fee structure for Independent Non-executive Directors for 2015 which is unchanged from 2014. 
Independent Non-executive Director fees are determined by the full Board except for the fee for the Chairman of the Board 
which is determined by the Remuneration Committee.
2015
Basic Non-executive fee £50,000
Senior Independent Director additional fee £10,000
Audit Committee Chairman additional fee £10,000
Remuneration Committee Chairman additional fee £10,000
Chairman of the Board all-inclusive fee £250,000
There are no fees paid for membership of Board Committees nor to the shareholder representative Non-executive Directors.

Annual bonus
Executive Directors are participants in the central bonus plan. The maximum annual bonus opportunity for the Executive Directors for 
2014 was 150% of salary for the CEO and 135% of salary for the CFO. One third of any bonus earned is deferred into shares for three 
years under The Merlin Entertainments plc Deferred Bonus Plan.
The maximum potential annual bonus that could be paid to Executive Directors in respect of 2014 performance was determined by 
underlying operating profit performance. 20% of that potential bonus was additionally subject to satisfaction of individual objectives. 
Performance measures and targets applying to the 2014 annual bonus are set out below.

UK Sharesave awards
The Executive Directors participated in the 7 February 2014 grant of options under the Sharesave Plan on the same terms as other  
UK employees. Details relating to their participation in this grant are set out below. No performance conditions apply to these options. 
Each option is exercisable at an exercise price of £2.9635. The option exercise price represents a 20% discount to the average 
closing price of a share (£3.7043) on the three dealing days prior to the invitation to participate in the Company’s Plan which was 
13 January 2014. The face value of options in the above table is based on the aforementioned share price.

Statement ­of­ Dir ectors ’ ­ shar eholding ­and ­shar e ­inter ests
A shareholding requirement of 200% of base salary applies to the Executive Directors. Both of the current Executive Directors had a 
shareholding that surpassed that requirement at 27 December 2014.
Executive Directors are expected to achieve the shareholding requirement primarily by retaining at least 50% of any share awards that 
vest under the PSP and the Deferred Bonus Plan (after selling sufficient shares to satisfy tax liabilities). Individuals are expected to be 
compliant with their shareholding requirement within five years of that individual becoming subject to the requirement. The Committee 
reviews ongoing individual performance against the shareholding requirement at the end of each financial year.
Current shareholding requirements and the number of shares held by Directors are set out in the table below.

P er centage­change ­in­r emuneration­of­ the ­ CEO
Prior to November 2013, Merlin was a private company and its remuneration structure, particularly for senior executives, was 
significantly different to the structure adopted since Admission.
Given this change in structure during 2013, the Committee does not believe 2013 CEO and employee remuneration is comparable with 
2014 CEO and employee remuneration. However, for information purposes, the accompanying table reflects the key changes in CEO  
and employee remuneration since Admission.

ANNEX TO THE REMUNERATION REPORT - POLICY REPORT
For the reference of shareholders, this Annex to the Remuneration Report sets out our Directors’ Remuneration Policy (Policy) that  
was approved by a binding shareholder vote at the 2014 AGM in the exact form that it was included in the 2013 Remuneration Report. 
This Policy applies to payments made from 15 May 2014. The information provided in this section of the Remuneration Report is  
not subject to audit.
P olicy ­table
The following table sets out details of each component of the Executive Director remuneration package. Our aim is to provide pay 
packages that will:
• Motivate and retain our industry leading employees.
• Attract high quality individuals to join us.
• Encourage and support a high performance culture.
• Reward delivery of our business plan and key strategic goals.
• Align our employees with the interests of shareholders and other external stakeholders.

Fixed­pay
Base­salary
T o appropriately recognise 
responsibilities and attract  
and retain talent by ensuring 
salaries are market 
competitive.
Generally reviewed annually with any 
increase normally taking effect from  
1 October although the Committee may 
award increases at other times of the 
year if it considers it appropriate.
The review takes into consideration a 
number of factors, including (but not 
limited to):
•  The individual Director’s role,   
   experience and performance.
•  Business performance.
•  Market data for comparable roles in 
   appropriate pay comparators.
•  Pay and conditions elsewhere in  
   the Group.
No absolute maximum has been set  
for Executive Director base salaries. 
Current Executive Director salaries  
are set out in the Annual Report on 
Remuneration section of this 
Remuneration Report.
Any annual increase in salaries is at the 
discretion of the Committee taking into 
account the factors stated in this table 
and the following principles:
•  Salaries would typically be increased at  
   a rate consistent with the average  
   salary increase (in percentage of salary 
   terms) for permanent employees.
•  Larger increases may be considered  
   appropriate in certain circumstances 
   (including, but not limited to, a change 
   in an individual’s responsibilities or in 
   the scale of their role or in the size 
   and complexity of the Group).
•  Larger increases may also be 
   considered appropriate if a Director 
   has been initially appointed to the 
   Board at a lower than typical salary.

Benefits
T o provide market 
competitive benefits.
Benefits are role specific and take into 
account local market practice.
Benefits currently include a company car 
or car allowance, phone costs, income 
protection insurance, an annual medical, 
private medical insurance and life 
assurance of four times annual salary. 
The Committee has discretion, in the 
event of the appointment of a Director 
based overseas or in exceptional 
circumstances, to add to or remove 
benefits provided to Executive Directors.
There is no overall maximum as the 
level of benefits depends on the annual 
cost of providing individual items in the 
relevant local market and the individual’s 
specific role.

The Committee has been chaired throughout the year by Charles Gurassa. The Committee has comprised the Chairman of the Board 
and the independent Non-executive Directors.
The Committee met three times during 2014. The CEO, Group HR Director, Group Compensation & Benefits Director and the 
Group Legal Director (in his role as secretary to the Committee) were also present at some of these meetings by invitation.
The Committee is responsible for determining all aspects of Executive Director pay. It also monitors pay arrangements for other senior 
executives and oversees the operation of all share plans. Full terms of reference of the Committee are available on our website under 
Investor Relations - Corporate Governance.
Deloitte LLP was appointed by the Company in 2013 to provide advice on executive remuneration matters. During the year, the 
Committee received independent and objective advice from Deloitte principally on the drafting of the remuneration report, shareholder 
consultation and market practice. Deloitte was paid £45,595 in fees during 2014 for these services (charged on a time plus expenses 
basis). Deloitte is a founding member of the Remuneration Consultants Group and as such, voluntarily operates under the code of 
conduct in relation to executive remuneration consulting in the UK. In addition, other practices of Deloitte, separate from the  
executive remuneration practice, have provided tax advice to the Company during the year.
Shar eholder ­ voting ­ on ­ 2013 ­ r emuneration ­ r eport
At the 2014 Annual General Meeting, strong shareholder support was received for our resolutions on remuneration as summarised below. 
External­boar d ­appointments
Executive Directors are normally entitled to accept external appointments outside the Company with the consent of the Board.  
Any fees received may be retained by the Director.
As at the date of this report, neither of the Executive Directors held an external appointment for which they received a fee.
Annual­General­Meeting
The Annual Report on Remuneration section of this Remuneration Report will be submitted for an advisory shareholder vote  
at our Annual General Meeting to be held on 14 May 2015.

(3), (4)
T o link reward to key business 
targets for the longer term 
and to retain executives. 
Awards are usually granted annually 
under the PSP to Executive Directors 
and other selected senior executives.
Individual award levels and performance 
conditions on which vesting will be 
dependent are reviewed annually by 
the Remuneration Committee.
Awards may be granted as conditional 
awards of shares, nil-cost options or 
forfeitable share awards (or, if 
appropriate, as cash-settled equivalents).
Awards normally vest at the end of a 
period of at least three years following 
grant although may vest early on leaving 
employment or on a change of control 
(see later sections).
An additional payment (in the form of 
cash or shares) may be made in respect 
of shares which vest under PSP awards 
to reflect the value of dividends which 
would have been paid on those shares 
during the vesting period (this payment 
may assume that dividends had been 
reinvested in Company shares on a 
cumulative basis).
The maximum annual award permitted 
under the PSP is shares with a market 
value (as determined by the Committee) 
of 350% of salary.
Each year the Remuneration Committee 
determines the actual award level for 
individual Executive Directors within 
this limit.
Vesting of PSP awards is 
dependent on measures 
of Group earnings 
and return on total 
investment with the 
precise measures 
and weighting of the 
measures determined by 
the Committee ahead of 
each award. These details 
are disclosed in the 
Annual Report on 
Remuneration section 
of this Remuneration 
Report.
Performance will usually 
be measured over a 
three year performance 
period. For achieving a 
‘threshold’ level of 
performance against a 
performance measure, 
no more than 25% of the 
portion of the PSP 
award determined by 
that measure will vest. 
Vesting then increases on 
a sliding scale to 100% 
for achieving a stretching 
maximum performance 
target.

Individuals who are 
promoted to the Board 
may have outstanding 
awards under this plan.
The CSOP permits grants of share 
options with an exercise price of not 
less than the market value of a share  
(as determined by the Committee)  
at the time of grant.
Options are usually exercisable between 
three and ten years following grant 
although may have a different exercise 
period on leaving employment or on a 
change of control (see later sections).
Options that are HMRC unapproved 
may, if appropriate, be settled in cash 
or be net-settled.
Annual awards of options over shares 
worth up to 100% of salary at grant  
(or, if the Remuneration Committee 
determines that special circumstances 
exist, 200% of salary).
If CSOP awards 
were, in exceptional 
circumstances, granted 
to an Executive Director, 
they would be subject 
to an appropriate 
performance condition 
as determined by 
the Committee.
An individual promoted 
to the Board may have 
outstanding CSOP 
awards (granted prior to 
their promotion) that 
have no performance 
conditions attached 
to them.

The Executive Directors are participants 
in the central bonus plan which is 
reviewed annually to ensure bonus 
opportunity, performance measures  
and targets are appropriate and 
supportive of the business strategy.
T wo thirds of an Executive Director’s 
annual bonus is delivered in cash 
following the release of audited results 
and the remaining third is deferred into 
an award over Company shares under 
The Merlin Entertainments plc  
Deferred Bonus Plan.
• Deferred awards are usually granted in
   the form of conditional share awards 
   or nil-cost options (and may also be 
   settled in cash).
• Deferred awards usually vest three
   years after award although may vest 
   early on leaving employment or on a 
   change of control (see later sections).
• An additional payment (in the form of
   cash or shares) may be made in 
   respect of shares which vest under 
   deferred awards to reflect the value of 
   dividends which would have been paid 
   on those shares during the vesting 
   period (this payment may assume that 
   dividends had been reinvested in 
 Company shares on a cumulative basis).
• Deferred awards will be subject to
   withholding at the Remuneration 
   Committee’s discretion during the 
   deferral period in exceptional 
   circumstances where the Committee 
   finds that the Executive Director has 
   engaged in misconduct justifying 
   summary dismissal or there has been a 
   material misstatement of the financial 
   accounts relating to the relevant bonus 
   year which has led to an overpayment 
   of bonus.
The maximum award that can be made 
under the central bonus plan is 150%  
of salary.
Each year the Remuneration Committee 
determines the maximum bonus 
opportunity for individual Executive 
Directors within this limit.
The bonus is based on 
performance assessed 
over one year using 
appropriate financial, 
strategic and individual 
performance measures.
The majority of the 
bonus will be determined 
by measure(s) of Group 
financial performance. 
The selected measure(s) 
for the next financial 
year are set out in  
the Annual Report on 
Remuneration section  
of this Remuneration 
Report.
A sliding scale of targets 
is set for each Group 
financial measure with 
payout at zero for 
threshold financial 
performance increasing 
to 50% for meeting 
expectations and  
100% for maximum 
performance.
The remainder of the 
bonus will be based  
on financial, strategic or 
operational measures 
appropriate to the 
individual Director.  
The selected measures 
for the next financial 
year are set out in the 
Annual Report on 
Remuneration section  
of this Remuneration 
Report.
Any bonus payout is 
ultimately at the 
discretion of the 
Committee.

Differ ences ­in ­policy­fr om­br oader­employee ­population
There are differences in the precise components within the pay policy for Executive Directors and for our employees generally and a 
greater proportion of Executive Directors’ pay is ‘at risk’ and determined by performance than for our employees generally. However, as 
outlined in the Committee Chairman’s statement, common principles underlie the pay policy through the Company including for the 
Executive Directors. In particular, we place great emphasis throughout the Company on reward being linked to performance (either 
Group performance or of an employee’s particular attraction) and on encouraging share ownership (through participation in the PSP , 
CSOP or the All Employee Share Plan).
Non- executive ­Dir ectors
Purpose­and­link­to ­strategy Operation Opportunity
Non- executive ­Dir ector ­(NED) ­fees
T o appropriately recognise responsibilities 
by ensuring fees are market competitive.
NED fees (other than NEDs whose 
appointment is in respect of their position 
as representatives of the pre-IPO major 
shareholders) comprise payment of an annual 
basic fee and additional fees for further 
Board responsibilities such as:
• Senior Independent Director.
• Audit Committee Chairman.
• Remuneration Committee Chairman.
The Chairman of the Board receives an 
all-inclusive fee.
No NED participates in the Group’s incentive 
arrangements or pension plan or receives any 
other benefits other than where travel to the 
Company’s registered office is recognised as a 
taxable benefit in which case a NED may receive 
the grossed-up costs of travel as a benefit.
Fees are generally reviewed annually.
NEDs whose appointment is in respect of 
their position as shareholder representatives 
do not receive a fee.
Fees are set at an appropriate level that is 
market competitive and reflective of the 
responsibilities and time commitment  
associated with specific roles.
No absolute maximum has been set for 
individual NED fees. Current fee levels are  
set out in the Annual Report on Remuneration 
section of this Remuneration Report.
The Company’s Articles of Association provide 
that the total aggregate fees paid to the 
Chairman and NEDs will not exceed 
£1,000,000.

Service ­contracts
Key terms of the current Executive Directors’ service agreements and Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment (other than 
Non-executive Directors whose appointment is in respect of their position as representatives of the pre-IPO major shareholders) are 
summarised in the table below. It is envisaged that any future appointments would have equivalent contractual arrangements unless 
otherwise stated in this Policy Report. 
Each of the Non-executive Directors nominated by the pre-IPO major shareholders are appointed pursuant to the relevant Relationship 
Agreement with their nominating shareholder and do not have individual letters of appointment with the Company. These Relationship 
Agreements provide for the aforementioned shareholders to maintain a Non-executive Director as a shareholder representative for so 
long as they hold 10% of the Company’s share capital. The Company has the right to remove these Directors should the relevant 
shareholding fall below 10% and no fees or termination payments are payable.
Each Director will retire and put themselves forward for re-election at the first Annual General Meeting of the Company.
All Executive Directors’ service agreements and Non-executive Directors’ letters of appointment are available for inspection at the 
Company’s registered office at 3 Market Close, Poole, Dorset BH15 1NQ.
P olicy ­on­payment­for­loss­ of­office
As outlined above, there are no contractual obligations to make any payments to Executive Directors in relation to loss of office and any 
termination payment would be subject to negotiation although would not be expected in normal circumstances to exceed salary, 
pension and benefits in relation to the individual’s outstanding notice period.
In relation to payments under non-contractual incentive schemes, the Committee would take the following factors into account:
• The Committee may determine that the Executive Director is eligible to receive a bonus in respect of the financial year in which they
cease employment. This bonus would usually be time apportioned. In determining the level of bonus to be paid, the Committee may, 
at its discretion, take into account performance up to the date of cessation or over the financial year as a whole.
• The treatment of outstanding share awards is governed by the relevant share plan rules.
The table overleaf summarises the treatment of share awards for leavers and on a change of control in share plans under which 
Executive Directors could hold awards.
Consideration ­of­ employment ­conditions ­elsewher e ­ in­the­Gr oup
The Committee does not formally consult with employees as part of its process when determining Executive Director pay. However the 
Committee is kept informed of general decisions made in relation to employee pay and related issues by the Group HR Director and is 
conscious of the importance of ensuring that its pay decisions for Executive Directors are regarded as fair and reasonable within the 
business. As outlined in the Policy Table, pay and conditions in the Group are one of the specific considerations taken into account 
when the Committee is determining salary levels for the Executive Directors.
Consideration ­of­ shar eholders ’ ­ views
The Company’s three major shareholders each had a representative on the Committee in the pre-Listing period and, accordingly, the 
structure of our post-Listing remuneration policy has been subject to significant consultation with them. In addition we have sought the 
views of our largest institutional shareholders and leading advisory bodies post Listing. 
Pr ovision P olicy
Notice period Executive Directors - twelve months’ notice by either the Company or the Executive Director.
Non-executive Directors - three months’ notice by either the Company or the Non-executive Director or 
no notice period if terminated by shareholders.
T ermination payment There is no payment in lieu of notice clause in the Executive Directors’ service agreements. Any payments of 
compensation on termination would be subject to negotiation in line with general principles which include a 
duty for the individual to mitigate loss.
Non-executive Directors are entitled to receive any fee accruing in respect of their notice period.
Expiry date Executive Directors have rolling twelve months’ notice periods so have no fixed expiry date.
All Non-executive Directors have rolling three months’ notice periods so have no fixed expiry date.
Appr oach­to­r ecruitment­r emuneration
Principles
In determining remuneration arrangements for new 
appointments to the Board (including internal promotions),  
the Committee applies the following principles:
• The Committee takes into consideration all relevant factors,
including the calibre of the individual, market data and existing
arrangements for other Executive Directors, with a view that
any arrangements should be in the best interests of Merlin
and our shareholders, without paying more than is necessary.
• Typically, the new appointment will have (or be transitioned
onto) the same package structure as the other Executive
Directors, in line with the Policy Table presented above.
• Where an Executive Director is appointed from within the
organisation, the normal policy of the Company is that any
legacy arrangements would be honoured in line with the
original terms and conditions. Similarly, if an Executive Director
is appointed following the Company’s acquisition of or
merger with another company or business, legacy terms
and conditions would be honoured.
• Upon appointment, the Committee may consider it
appropriate to offer additional remuneration arrangements
in order to secure the appointment. In particular, the
Committee may consider it appropriate to ‘buy out’ terms
or remuneration arrangements forfeited on leaving a
previous employer (discussed below).
• The Committee may provide costs and support if the
recruitment requires relocation of the individual.
Maximum level of variable pay
The maximum level of variable remuneration which may be 
granted to new Executive Directors in respect of recruitment 
shall be limited to the maximum permitted in the Policy Table, 
namely 500% of their annual salary. This limit excludes any 
payments or awards that may be made to buy out the Director 
for terms, awards or other compensation forfeited from their 
previous employer (discussed below).
Buy outs
T o facilitate recruitment, the Remuneration Committee may  
make a one-off award to buy out terms, incentives and any other 
compensation arrangements forfeited on leaving a previous 
employer. In doing so, the Committee will take account of all 
relevant factors, including any performance conditions attached to 
incentive awards, the likelihood of those conditions being met, the 
proportion of the vesting/performance period remaining and the 
form of the award (e.g. cash or shares). The overriding principle 
will be that any replacement buy out award should be of 
comparable commercial value to the terms, incentives and other 
compensation which have been forfeited. However such awards 
would only be considered where there is a strong commercial 
rationale to do so. 
Components and approach
The remuneration package offered to new appointments may 
include any element listed in the Policy Table above, or any other 
element which the Committee considers is appropriate given the 
particular circumstances, with due regard to the best interests of 
shareholders subject to the limits on variable pay set out above.
In considering which elements to include, and in determining the 
approach for all relevant elements, the Committee will take into 
account a number of different factors, including (but not limited 
to) market practice, existing arrangements for other Executive 
Directors and internal relativities. If appropriate, different targets 
may be applied to a new appointee’s annual bonus in their year 
of joining.
The Committee would seek to structure buyout and variable 
pay awards on recruitment to be in line with the Company’s 
remuneration framework so far as practical but, if necessary, 
the Committee may also grant such awards outside of that 
framework as permitted under Listing Rule 9.4.2 subject to 
the limits on variable pay set out above. The exact terms of any 
such awards (e.g. the form of the award, timeframe, performance 
conditions, and leaver provisions) would vary depending upon 
the specific commercial circumstances.
Recruitment of Non-executive Directors
In the event of the appointment of a new Non-executive 
Director, remuneration arrangements will normally be in line 
with the structure set out in the Policy Table for Non-executive 
Directors. However the Committee (or the Board as 
appropriate) may include any element listed in the Policy  
Table above, or any other element which the Committee 
considers is appropriate given the particular circumstances,  
with due regard to the best interests of shareholders.

Main Contents Dear Shareholder
This report describes the activities of the Nomination Committee 
during 2014. The Committee met three times during the year 
and we focused our attention on Board appointments, succession 
planning and diversity.
Boar d ­appointments
One of the primary objectives of the Nomination Committee 
during the year has been to address the final elements of the 
composition of the Board arising from its transition from 
private to public markets.
Early in the year the Committee confirmed the previously 
announced appointment of Fru Hazlitt who joined the Company 
in April 2014. Her extensive experience in the entertainment 
industry is a valuable addition to our Board and will bring a 
diversity of knowledge and perspective to our deliberations.
We have also continued to focus on the process of recruiting 
further independent Non-executive Directors. This is intended to 
ensure full Code compliance by the time of the Annual General 
Meeting (AGM) in May 2015, and also takes into account the 
reduction in shareholdings of Blackstone and CVC in the period 
following the IPO with the consequential potential impact on 
the future composition of the Board.  
T o assist us we have engaged Spencer Stuart, an independent 
executive search consultancy already familiar with Merlin and 
our strategic intentions. Reflecting our ambitions for growth,  
our search has an Asian and North American geographical 
emphasis and will ensure we benefit from first-hand leisure 
industry experience to develop a Board with a wider skill set  
and appropriate leaders for each of our Committees.
Shortly after the year end Miguel Ko confirmed that he will  
step down as a Non-executive Director and will not put himself 
forward for re-election at the 2015 AGM, having taken a full time 
executive position in Asia. Miguel joined the Board shortly before 
Merlin’s IPO in November 2013 and has made a wise and 
valuable contribution to Merlin, in particular through his 
knowledgeable insights into the Asian leisure markets. On 
behalf of the Board, I would like to express our thanks.  
STATEMENT FROM THE CHAIRMAN OF THE NOMINATION COMMITTEE
Succession­planning
The Board and Nomination Committee have undertaken detailed 
succession planning reviews during 2014, focused on Executive 
Director positions as well as other senior manager roles 
within the Group. This has identified key individuals already 
in the Group, for whom high level training and development 
opportunities have been established and implemented. We  
have also discussed the Group’s senior management structure 
and how that might evolve as Merlin continues its international 
expansion. The Group has already recruited well during 2014 
in specific senior management roles to enhance certain 
activities and build the future talent pipeline.
As a result of the work undertaken during 2014, the Board and 
Nomination Committee have a clear line of sight on what issues 
need to be addressed and of the plans management has in place.  
We are encouraged by the depth of talent available within the 
Group as cover for all our key positions.
Diversity
Merlin’s policy is for our leaders to have a diversity of thinking, 
experience, gender, country of origin and cultural background. 
We believe a diverse Board and management team is more in 
touch with our customers, employees and investors. While we 
have not established diversity targets or measures at this time this 
policy is reflected in the approach we are taking to recruitment 
at senior manager and Board level.

over the full performance period.
However, in the event of death,

the Committee’s determination of  
the extent to which any relevant

Dir ectors
The names of the persons who, at any time during the financial 
year, were Directors of the Company are: 
Dir ectors ’ ­indemnities ­ and­insurance
The Articles of Association of the Company permit it to 
indemnify the Directors of the Company or any Group 
company against liabilities arising from or in connection with 
the execution of their duties or powers to the extent permitted 
by law. The Company has not given any specific indemnity in 
favour of the Directors during the year but the Company has 
purchased Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance during the 
year, which provides cover for liabilities incurred by Directors 
in the performance of their duties or powers.
No amount was paid under any Director’s indemnity or the 
Directors’ and Officers’ Liability Insurance during the year 
other than the applicable insurance premiums.
Appointment ­and­ r emoval­of­ Dir ectors
A Director may be appointed by an ordinary resolution of 
shareholders in a general meeting following nomination by the 
Board or a member (or members) entitled to vote at such a 
meeting, or following retirement by rotation if the Director 
chooses to seek re-election at a general meeting.
In addition, the Directors may appoint a Director to fill a vacancy 
or as an additional Director, provided that the individual retires at 
the next AGM. A Director may be removed by the Company in 
certain circumstances set out in the Company’s Articles of 
Association or by a special resolution of the Company. 
All Directors will stand for re-election on an annual basis, 
in line with the recommendations of the Code.
Specific details relating to KIRKBI, Blackstone and CVC and their 
rights to appoint Directors are set out in the Corporate 
Governance section of this report on page 64.
Shar e ­ capital­and­r elated ­matters
The Articles of Association do not contain any restrictions on  
the transfer of shares in the Company other than customary 
restrictions applicable where any amount is unpaid on a share  
(all the issued share capital of the Company as at the date of this 
Annual Report is fully paid). Each ordinary share in the capital of 
the Company ranks equally in all respects. No shareholder  
holds shares carrying special rights relating to the control  
of the Company.
Specific details under an Underwriting Agreement that relate  
to KIRKBI; Blackstone; the Executive Directors; Non-executive 
Directors; and Merlin Entertainments Share Plan Nominee Limited

Amendment ­ to­the­Company’ s ­ Articles­of­ Association
The Company’s Articles of Association may only be amended 
by a special resolution of its shareholders passed at a general 
meeting of its shareholders.
P ower ­of­Dir ectors­in ­r espect ­ of­ shar e ­ capital
The Directors may exercise all the powers of the Company 
(including, subject to obtaining the required authority from the 
shareholders in general meeting, the power to authorise the 
issue of new shares and the purchase of the Company’s shares).
Since its shares were listed on the London Stock Exchange on  
13 November 2013, the Directors have not exercised any of 
the powers to issue or purchase shares in the Company.
R elated ­parties
The only material agreements with related parties during the 
year are as follows:
• LEGOLAND Licence and Co-operation Agreement (LCA): 
This agreement was entered into on 24 August 2005 with
KIRKBI and sets out the rights granted to the Group to use
the LEGO and LEGOLAND brands in connection with the
development, operation and promotion of the Group’s
present and future LEGOLAND businesses. It includes
certain requirements for the Group to develop LEGOLAND
attractions, certain operational requirements for those
attractions, and the nature of royalties due to KIRKBI for
the use of the rights. The LCA includes rights for KIRKBI to
terminate the LCA on a change of control of Merlin but only
if this would result in a Licensee (as defined in the LCA) being
controlled by a LEGO competitor or an inappropriate party. 
The LCA defines an inappropriate party as any person or
entity (other than a financial institution) where one third of its
revenue is derived from the manufacture and sale of tobacco, 
armaments and/or pornographic material.

Change­of­contr ol
The only other significant agreement to which the Company is 
a party that takes effect, alters or terminates upon a change of 
control of the Company following a takeover bid, is a Facilities 
Agreement entered into by the Group with Unicredit Group 
as facility agent, originally dated 4 March 2007 and amended 
and restated on 28 June 2013. This includes provisions in 
relation to a change of control or the sale of all or substantially 
all of the Group’s assets, the occurrence of which will give the 
lenders under the Agreement the right to accelerate outstanding 
loans, terminate commitments and enforce their security. 
As described below, subsequent to the year end the Group 
secured a new £1,300 million banking facility that, once drawn, 
will replace the existing debt facilities. The new unsecured 
facilities also contain similar change of control provisions. 
Further details on the Group’s banking facilities are shown 
in note 5.2 to the financial statements. 
The Company does not have agreements with any Director 
or employee that would provide compensation for loss of  
office or employment resulting from a change of control.
Branches ­outside ­the ­UK
The Company has no branches outside the UK.
Dividend
An interim dividend of 2.0 pence per share was paid on 
25 September 2014 to shareholders on the Register on 
29 August 2014. A final dividend for the year ended 
27 December 2014 of 4.2 pence per share will be 
recommended for payment to shareholders. The final 
dividend will be proposed to shareholders for approval 
at the next Annual General Meeting of the Company. 
P olitical ­donations
No political donations were made during the year.
R eduction ­of­capital
On 26 February 2014 the Company reduced its share capital 
by means of a court sanctioned reduction of capital. The effect 
of the reduction of capital was to increase available reserves 
for distribution by way of dividends to shareholders in the 
amount of £3,183 million.
Subsequent ­ events
Subsequent to the year end, the Group has secured a new 
£1,300 million banking facility that, once drawn, will replace 
the existing debt facilities. 
Dir ectors ’ ­r esponsibilities­ statement
The Directors are responsible for preparing the Annual Report 
and the Group and Company financial statements in accordance 
with applicable law and regulations.
The Directors are required to prepare Group and Parent 
Company financial statements for each financial year. For this 
purpose, the Company is the Parent Company of the Group.  
The Group financial statements are required to be prepared in 
accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards as 
adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRS) and applicable law. However, 
the Directors are permitted to, and have elected to, prepare  
the Company financial statements in accordance with generally 
accepted accounting principles in the UK (UK GAAP). 
The Directors must not approve the financial statements unless 
they are satisfied that they give a true and fair view of the state of 
affairs of the Group and Company and of the profit or loss of the 
Group and Company for that period. In preparing each of the 
Group and Company financial statements, the Directors 
are required to:
• Select suitable accounting policies and then apply
them consistently.
• Make judgements and estimates that are reasonable
and prudent.
• For the Group financial statements, state whether they have
been prepared in accordance with Adopted IFRS.
• For the Company financial statements, state whether
applicable UK Accounting Standards have been followed, 
subject to any material departures disclosed and explained
in the Company financial statements.
• Prepare the financial statements on the going concern basis
unless it is inappropriate to presume that the Group and the
Company will continue in business.
The Directors are responsible for keeping adequate accounting 
records that are sufficient to show and explain the Company’s 
transactions and disclose with reasonable accuracy at any time 
the financial position of the Company and enable them to ensure 
that its financial statements comply with the Companies Act 
2006. They have general responsibility for taking such steps as  
are reasonably open to them to safeguard the assets of the 
Group and to prevent and detect fraud and other irregularities.
The Directors are responsible for the maintenance and integrity 
of the corporate and financial information included on the 
Company’s website.
The new senior unsecured facilities will comprise circa £1,000 
million in floating rate term debt, with maturities in 2018 and 
2020, along with an increased £300 million revolving credit facility. 
The reduction in drawn term debt will be funded through the 
use of circa £130 million of the Group’s existing cash balance. 
The increased revolving credit line will ensure that the Group has 
adequate committed liquidity facilities to support our seasonality 
and strategic growth objectives. Under the new facilities we  
will be required to comply with certain financial and 
non-financial covenants.
Going ­ concern
The Directors consider that the Group has adequate financial 
resources to continue operating for the foreseeable future and 
that it is therefore appropriate to adopt the going concern basis 
in preparing the financial statements.
The Directors have satisfied themselves that the Group is in 
a sound financial position and that it has access to sufficient cash 
funds and borrowing facilities and can reasonably expect those 
facilities to be available to meet the Group’s foreseeable  
cash requirements.
Audit ­ information
So far as the Directors are aware, there is no relevant audit 
information of which the auditors are unaware. The Directors 
have taken all reasonable steps to ascertain any relevant 
audit information and ensure the auditors are aware of  
such information.
R e-appointment ­of ­auditors
As recommended by the Audit Committee, a resolution for the 
re-appointment of KPMG LLP as auditors to the Company will 
be proposed at the 2015 Annual General Meeting.
Appr oval ­ of­ annual ­ r eport
The Strategic Report, Corporate Governance Statement and 
Report and the Directors’ Report were approved by the  
Board on 25 February 2015.

The Directors are also responsible for preparing a Strategic 
Report, Directors’ Report, Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and Corporate Governance Statement.
Having taken advice from the Audit Committee, the 
Remuneration Committee and the Health, Safety and Security 
Committee as well as from its legal and other professional 
advisers, the Board considers the Annual Report and  
Financial Statements, taken as a whole, to be fair, balanced 
and understandable and that it provides the information 
necessary for shareholders to assess the Company’s 
performance, business model and strategy.
Neither the Company nor the Directors accept (and they hereby 
exclude) any liability to any person in relation to this Report 
except to the extent that such liability is imposed by law and  
may not be validly excluded.
The Board confirms to the best of its knowledge that:
• The Group financial statements contained in this Report
(which have been prepared in accordance with IFRSs as
adopted by the EU), when taken as a whole, give a true and
fair view of the assets, liabilities, financial position and profit or
loss of the Group.
• The Company financial statements (which have been
prepared in accordance with applicable UK GAAP), give a true
and fair view of the state of affairs of the Company.
• The Directors’ Report and the other sections of this Report
referred to therein together represent a fair review of the
strategy, development and performance of the business and
the position of the Group together with a description of the
principal risks and uncertainties that it faces.

OUR AUDIT APPROACH
Opinions and conclusions arising from our audit
1 Our opinion on the financial statements is unmodified
We have audited the financial statements of Merlin 
Entertainments plc for the 52 week period ended 27 December 
2014 set out on pages 104 to 161. In our opinion: 
• the financial statements give a true and fair view of the state
of the Group’s and of the parent Company’s affairs as at
27 December 2014 and of the Group’s profit for the 52
week period then ended;
• the Group financial statements have been properly prepared
in accordance with International Financial Reporting Standards
as adopted by the European Union (IFRSs as adopted by
the EU);
• the parent Company financial statements have been properly
prepared in accordance with UK Accounting Standards; and
• the financial statements have been prepared in accordance
with the requirements of the Companies Act 2006 and, as
regards the Group financial statements, Article 4 of the
IAS Regulation.
2 Our assessment of risks of material misstatement
In arriving at our audit opinion above on the financial statements 
the risks of material misstatement that had the greatest effect on 
our audit were as follows.  
Carrying value of non-current assets £2,414 million
(2013: £2,344 million)
Refer to pages 70 to 71 (Audit Committee Report) and pages 
125 to 126 (accounting policy and financial disclosures).
• The risk - A history of business combinations and the capital
intensive nature of the business model means that the Group
has significant balances of goodwill, intangible assets and
property, plant and equipment. There is a risk the future
performance of the assets may not lead to their carrying
values being recoverable in full. 
This risk is prevalent as there is inherent uncertainty in   
estimating their recoverable value, principally arising in the  
inputs used in both forecasting (for example the expected  
change in visitation and revenues arising from new projects)  
and discounting future cash flows, and assessing an 
appropriate earnings multiple (for use in the estimation  
of Fair Value less Costs to Sell and sensitivity assessments). 
This uncertainty arises partly due to the unpredictable impact 
of factors such as competition, the weather, and the political  
and economic environment on trading performance; but  
also as the Group’s new attractions are often in  
unproven locations. 
A combination of the significance of the asset balances and 
the inherent uncertainty in the assumptions supporting the 
valuations of goodwill, brands and any assets showing   
impairment indicators, means that an assessment of the   
carrying value of non-current assets is one of the key   
judgemental areas that our audit concentrated on.
• Our response - Our audit procedures included, among
others, an analysis of the Group’s previous ability to forecast
cash flows accurately and challenging the reasonableness of
current forecasts. These current forecasts include assumptions
such as the expected change in visitation and revenues arising
from new projects. Our challenge included an assessment
of the Group’s assumed effect of such projects, including a
comparison of this expected change against the past results of
similar projects carried out by the Group at other attractions; 
thereby allowing us to assess the level of the risk inherent in
the current cash flow forecasts. 
The data used by the Group to determine its earnings   
multiple and calculate its discount rates was benchmarked  
against market data, including publicly available analysts’ reports 
and peer comparisons. We performed a sensitivity analysis  
of the earnings multiple, discount rates and forecast cash  
flows to show the effect of possible downside scenarios and  
considered the resulting headroom across the valuations, as  
well as the appropriateness of the related disclosures. We also 
assessed whether the Group’s disclosures about the sensitivity 
of the outcome of the impairment assessment to changes in  
key assumptions appropriately reflected the risks inherent 
in the valuation of non-current assets.
Revenue recognition £1,249 million (2013: £1,192 million)
Refer to page 71 (Audit Committee Report) and page 
112 (accounting policy).
• The risk - Merlin’s revenues come from a number of different
channels, such as admissions ticketing income, spend in
attractions on items such as food and drink, annual passes and
hotel revenues. These revenues arise across a large estate of
sites that due to the different jurisdictions in which the Group
operates, and the Group’s decentralised nature, use a number
of different revenue systems or system configurations, many
of which require manual processes to transfer data to the
main finance system.
Manual, rather than automated, processes across multiple   
decentralised income systems increase the risk of error.  
Such errors could arise through the under or over recording  
from outputs from these systems, or due to the need for 
the separate recording and appropriately timed release of  
deferred revenue, which arises when tickets are either bought 
in advance or bought to allow access to multiple attractions.   
Although the low value of individual transactions mean 
an individual error would be both difficult to detect  
and insignificant, the high volume of transactions mean 
systemic failure could lead to errors that aggregate 
into material balances. 
• Our response - As described in ‘Our application of materiality
and an overview of the scope of our audit’ we selected sites
for audit to ensure appropriate coverage of key financial
measures, including revenue.
At certain sites we performed testing of the general IT control 
environment of the systems used to record revenue, followed  
by testing of the processes to assess the completeness and  
accuracy of revenue entries arising from these systems.    
Alternatively, at other sites, we performed testing of the 
design, implementation and operating effectiveness of 
manual controls supporting these systems, including  
reconciliations of till records to revenue entries in the 
accounting records.
This controls testing was supported by substantive  
audit procedures including, amongst others, performing   
reconciliations of total cash received to revenue recorded,  
predictive analytical procedures (taking into account factors  
such as trends in seasonality, changes in pricing and visitation),  
confirmation of the appropriate timing of sales cut-off through 
journals testing; and substantive testing of deferred and   
accrued revenue balances through testing back to ticketing  
system records, corroboration of ticket usage terms to   
underlying contracts and predictive analytical procedures   
based on revenue movements.
In 2013 we reported on certain risks that arose as a result of the 
Group’s IPO. Without the recurrence of these risks, our focus on 
revenue recognition was a proportionately larger part of our 
work for 2014 and so is reported here, despite the nature of 
the revenue streams and the inherent risks associated with 
them not changing significantly from the previous year.

3 Our application of materiality and an overview of the scope of our audit
Scope of our work
Materiality of the Group Financial Statements
The materiality for the Group financial statements as a whole  
was set at £15,500,000 for 2014. This was determined with 
reference to a benchmark of profit before tax, of which it 
represents 6.9%. In 2013, materiality was determined with 
reference to a benchmark of revenue. Following the Group’s  
IPO at the end of 2013, which led to a significant reduction in  
the level of debt and therefore the amount of interest paid, we 
consider that profit before tax better aligns with the principal 
considerations of the shareholders of the Company, so for 2014 
we changed our benchmark measure accordingly.  
We agreed with the Audit Committee that we would report all 
corrected and uncorrected misstatements identified through our 
audit with a value in excess of £775,000, in addition to other 
audit misstatements below that threshold that we believe 
warranted reporting on qualitative grounds.
We audited 84% of the total profits and losses that made up 
Group profit before tax, 70% of total Group revenue and 67% 
of total Group assets. This included the audit, for group reporting 
purposes, of the financial information of certain components, 
audit procedures on certain total Group account balances that 
present individual risks, specifically interest expenses, and assets 
arising on consolidation. The components containing these Group 
account balances were not individually financially significant and 
therefore did not require an audit for group reporting purposes.  
Audits for group reporting purposes, including those performed 
by the Group audit team, were performed at components in the 
following locations: UK, USA, Australia, Denmark, Germany, Italy 
and Hong Kong. 
The remaining 16% of total profits and losses that made up 
Group profit before tax, 30% of total Group revenue and 33%  
of total Group assets was represented by a large number of 
smaller reporting components, as the majority of attractions sit 
within their own statutory entity and there are a large number  
of intermediary holding companies. None of these components 
individually represent more than 3.2% of any of the total profits 
or losses that made up Group profit before tax, total Group 
revenue or total Group assets. We obtained further coverage 
by performing specified risk-focused audit procedures over the 
reasonableness over the financial result and position at 15 of 
these reporting components. For the remaining components, 
analysis at an aggregated level was performed to re-examine 
our assessment that there were no significant risks of material 
misstatement within these.
The Group audit team carried out audits for group reporting 
purposes of the financial information of components covering 
47% of the total profits and losses that made up Group profit 
before tax, including the only individually financially significant 
component, Merlin Attractions Operations Limited. The Group 
audit team also undertook all audit procedures of certain total 
Group account balances as mentioned above, gaining coverage 
over a further 15% of the total profits and losses that made up 
Group profit before tax. The largest component audited by a 
component audit team represented 8% of the total profits 
and losses that made up Group profit before tax. 
The audits undertaken for group reporting purposes at the 
key reporting components of the Group were all performed 
to local materiality levels. These local materiality levels were  
set individually for each component by the Group audit  
team and ranged from £750,000 to £4,000,000.
Detailed audit and specified procedure instructions were sent 
to key component auditors. These instructions covered the 
significant audit areas that should be addressed by these audits, 
which included the relevant risks of material misstatement 
detailed above, and set out the information required to be 
reported back to the Group audit team. The Group audit team 
visited three key component locations in Italy, Hong Kong and 
Florida, which included assessing the audit risk and strategy.  
Teleconferences were also held with these component auditors 
and all key reporting components that were not visited. During 
these meetings, the findings reported to the Group audit 
team were discussed in more detail; with any further work 
required by the Group audit team then performed by 
the component auditor.

5 We have nothing to report in respect of the matters on 
which we are required to report by exception 
Under ISAs (UK and Ireland) we are required to report to you if, 
based on the knowledge we acquired during our audit, we have 
identified other information in the annual report that contains a 
material inconsistency with either that knowledge or the financial 
statements, a material misstatement of fact, or that is otherwise 
misleading. 
In particular, we are required to report to you if: 
• we have identified material inconsistencies between the
knowledge we acquired during our audit and the Directors’ 
statement that they consider that the annual report and
financial statements taken as a whole is fair, balanced and
understandable and provides the information necessary for
shareholders to assess the Group’s performance, business
model and strategy; or
• the section of the annual report describing the work of the
Audit Committee does not appropriately address matters
communicated by us to the Audit Committee.
Under the Companies Act 2006 we are required to report 
to you if, in our opinion:  
• adequate accounting records have not been kept by the
parent Company, or returns adequate for our audit have
not been received from branches not visited by us; or
• the parent Company financial statements and the part of
the Directors’ Remuneration Report to be audited are not
in agreement with the accounting records and returns; or
• certain disclosures of Directors’ remuneration specified by
law are not made; or
• we have not received all the information and explanations
we require for our audit; or
• a Corporate Governance Statement has not been
prepared by the Company.
Under the Listing Rules we are required to review:  
• the Directors’ statement, set out on page 96, in relation to
going concern; and
• the part of the Corporate Governance Statement on page 60
relating to the Company’s compliance with the ten provisions
of the 2012 UK Corporate Governance Code specified for
our review.
We have nothing to report in respect of the above responsibilities.
Scope and responsibilities 
As explained more fully in the Directors’ Responsibilities 
Statement set out on page 97, the Directors are responsible 
for the preparation of the financial statements and for being 
satisfied that they give a true and fair view. This report is 
made solely to the Company’s members as a body and is 
subject to important explanations and disclaimers regarding 
our responsibilities, published on our website at 
www.kpmg.com/uk/auditscopeukco2014a, which are 
incorporated into this report as if set out in full and should 
be read to provide an understanding of the purpose of this 
report, the work we have undertaken and the basis of 
our opinions.

CONSOLIDATED STATEMENT OF CASH FLOWS 
For the 52 weeks ended 27 December 2014 (2013: 52 weeks ended 28 December 2013)
SECTION 1 BASIS OF PREPARATION
52 weeks ended 27 December 2014
1.1  Basis of preparation
Merlin Entertainments plc (the Company) is a company incorporated in the United Kingdom and its registered office is 3 Market Close, 
Poole, Dorset, BH15 1NQ. 
The consolidated financial statements have been prepared and approved by the Directors in accordance with International Financial 
Reporting Standards as adopted by the EU (Adopted IFRS) and with those parts of the Companies Act 2006 applicable to companies 
reporting under IFRS. 
The Company has elected to prepare its parent company financial statements in accordance with UK GAAP . 
The accounting policies set out in the sections below have, unless otherwise stated, been applied consistently to all periods presented in 
these consolidated financial statements and have been applied consistently by all subsidiaries and joint ventures.
The Group prepares its annual consolidated financial statements on a 52 or 53 week basis. These consolidated financial statements have 
been prepared for the 52 weeks ended 27 December 2014 (2013: 52 weeks ended 28 December 2013). The consolidated financial 
statements are prepared on the historical cost basis except for derivative financial instruments and certain investments which are 
measured at their fair value.
Additional analysis of other operating expenses has been provided in the consolidated income statement. This has not resulted in any 
restatement of the 2013 consolidated income statement. 
The consolidated financial statements are presented in Sterling. 
All values are stated in £ million (£m) except where otherwise indicated.
Going concern
The Group continues to trade profitably reporting a profit for the year of £162 million (2013: £145 million) and continues to 
generate cash with operating cash inflows of £357 million (2013: £365 million). As highlighted in note 5.2, the Group is funded by 
a bank loan facility, due for renewal in 2019. Subsequent to the year end, the Group has secured a new £1,300 million banking facility 
that, once drawn, will replace the existing debt facilities (see note 6.7). The Group’s forecasts show that it is expected to be able to 
operate within the terms of both the existing and proposed facilities.
After reviewing the Group’s cash flow forecasts and trading budgets and making appropriate enquiries, the Directors believe the Group 
to be operationally and financially robust and that it will generate sufficient cash to meet its borrowing requirements for the next twelve 
months. The Directors therefore have a reasonable expectation that the Group has adequate resources to continue in operational 
existence for the foreseeable future and, accordingly, the Group continues to adopt the going concern basis in preparing its 
consolidated financial statements.
Basis of consolidation
The consolidated financial statements comprise the financial statements of Merlin Entertainments plc and its subsidiaries and branches 
at the end of each reporting period and include its share of its joint ventures’ results using the equity method.
Subsidiaries are entities controlled by the Group. The Group controls an entity when it is exposed to, or has rights to, variable returns 
through its involvement with the entity and has the ability to affect those returns through its power over the entity. The financial 
statements of subsidiaries are included in the consolidated financial statements from the date that control commences until the 
date that control ceases.
All intercompany balances and transactions, including unrealised profits arising from intra-group transactions, have been eliminated.
Where subsidiaries enter into financial guarantee contracts to guarantee the indebtedness of other companies within the Group, these 
are considered to be insurance arrangements and accounted for as such. In this respect, the subsidiary concerned treats the guarantee 
contract as a contingent liability until such time as it becomes probable that it will be required to make a payment under the guarantee.

Segmental information
An operating segment is a component of the Group that engages in business activities from which it may earn revenues and incur 
expenses. The Group is managed through its three Operating Groups, which form the operating segments on which the information 
shown below is prepared. The Group determines and presents operating segments based on the information that is provided internally 
to the Chief Executive Officer (CEO), who is the Group’s chief operating decision maker. An operating segment’s results are reviewed 
regularly by the CEO to make decisions about resources to be allocated to the segment and assess its performance, and for which 
discrete financial information is available. Performance is measured based on segment EBITDA, as included in internal management 
reports. Segment operating profit is included below for information purposes.
Information regarding the results of each operating segment is included below.

 Other items include Merlin Magic Making, head office costs and various other costs, which cannot be directly attributable to the   
 reportable segments.

1.1  Basis of preparation (continued)
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year 
end exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the income statement, 
except when deferred in equity as qualifying net investment hedges.
The results and financial position of those Group companies that do not have a Sterling functional currency are translated into 
Sterling as follows:
• Assets and liabilities are translated at the closing rate at the end of the reporting period.
• Income and expenses are translated at average exchange rates during the year.
• All resulting exchange differences are recognised in equity in the translation reserve.
Classification of financial instruments issued by the Group
Financial instruments often consist of a combination of debt and equity and the Group has to decide how to attribute values to each. 
They are treated as equity only to the extent that they meet the following two conditions: 
(i) they include no contractual obligations upon the Group to deliver cash or other financial assets or to exchange financial assets or  
 financial liabilities with another party under conditions that are potentially unfavourable to the Group; and 
(ii) where the instrument will or may be settled in the Group’s own equity instruments, it is either a non-derivative that includes no   
 obligation to deliver a variable number of the Group’s own equity instruments or is a derivative that will be settled by the Group   
 exchanging a fixed amount of cash or other financial assets for a fixed number of its own equity instruments. 
T o the extent that this definition is not met, the proceeds of issue are classified as a financial liability, and where such an instrument takes 
the legal form of the Company’s own shares, the amounts presented in these financial statements for called up share capital and share 
premium account exclude amounts in relation to those shares.  
Finance payments associated with financial liabilities are dealt with as part of finance costs. Finance payments associated with financial 
instruments that are classified in equity are dividends and are recorded directly in equity.
Judgements and estimates
The preparation of financial statements requires management to exercise judgement in applying the Group’s accounting policies. It also 
requires the use of estimates and assumptions that affect the reported amounts of assets, liabilities, income and expenses. Actual results 
may differ from these estimates.
On an ongoing basis the following area involves a higher degree of judgement or complexity and is explained in more detail in the 
related note:
• Impairment testing (note 4.3).
During the year the following specific item also involved a higher degree of judgement or complexity:
• Treasury accounting - consideration of the likelihood of refinancing the Group’s debt before the contractual end date of the 
 Group’s existing lending facility (note 5.2).
New standards and interpretations
A full list of new accounting standards and interpretations that have been implemented in the year or will be implemented next year, 
and which have no significant impact, can be found in note 6.5.

Geographical areas
While each Operating Group is managed on a worldwide basis, part of our strategy is to diversify geographically across the four regions 
shown below. The information presented is based on the geographical locations of the visitor attractions concerned. 
Geographical information
2.1  Profit before tax (continued)
Cost of sales
Cost of sales of £181 million (2013: £170 million) represents variable expenses (excluding VAT and similar taxes) incurred from revenue 
generating activity. Retail inventory and food and beverage consumables are the principal expenses included under this category.
Operating expenses
Staff numbers and costs
The average number of persons employed by the Group (including Directors) during the year, analysed by category, was as follows: 
Revenue
Revenue arises from the operation of visitor attractions and theme park resorts. Revenue represents the amounts (excluding VAT and 
similar taxes) received from customers for admissions tickets, accommodation revenue, retail, food and beverage sales and sponsorship. 
Revenue from the sale of annual passes is deferred and then recognised over the period that the pass is valid. Ticket revenue is 
recognised at point of entry. 
From time to time, the Group enters into service contracts for attraction development and revenue is recognised under these 
contracts on a percentage completion basis. Service contract revenue in the year is not material.

2.3  Taxation 
Accounting policies
Tax on the profit or loss for the year comprises current and deferred tax. Tax is recognised in the income statement unless it relates to 
items recognised directly in equity, when it is recognised directly in equity, or when it relates to items recognised in other comprehensive 
income, when it is recognised through the statement of comprehensive income.
Current tax is the expected tax payable on the taxable income for the year, using tax rates enacted at the end of the reporting period, 
and any adjustment to tax payable in respect of previous periods.
Deferred tax is provided on certain temporary differences between the carrying amounts of assets and liabilities for financial reporting 
purposes and taxation purposes respectively. The following temporary differences are not provided for: the initial recognition 
of goodwill; the initial recognition of assets or liabilities that affect neither accounting nor taxable profit other than in a business 
combination; and differences relating to investments in subsidiaries and joint ventures to the extent that they will probably not reverse 
in the foreseeable future. The amount of deferred tax provided is based on the expected manner of realisation or settlement of 
the carrying amount of assets and liabilities, using tax rates enacted or substantively enacted at the end of the reporting period.
After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be 
available against which those assets can be utilised.

During 2013 a number of financing changes occurred which lowered the Group’s ongoing finance cost. These included the restructuring 
of debt facilities, the settlement of interest rate swaps and the repayment of debt following the IPO, which led to an increased certainty 
over the availability of future taxable profits in the UK. This resulted in the recognition of deferred tax assets in the UK arising largely 
from unclaimed capital allowances. 
Sensitivity analysis was performed when the assets were recognised. This showed that no reasonably foreseeable changes in the future 
taxable profits of the UK operations or the forecast capital spend would result in non-utilisation of the deferred tax assets. No significant 
sensitivities were noted in respect of the deferred tax assets recognised during 2014.
The effective tax rate (ETR) in 2014 and in particular 2013 was affected by the recognition of deferred tax assets, referred to above.  
Excluding the effect of this recognition, the ETR would be 30.4% (2013: 32.6%). This ETR has reduced from 2013 to 2014 due to a 
reduction in tax due in overseas jurisdictions. The ETR based on underlying trading, excluding exceptional items, was 28.0% in 2014 
(2013: 12.7%).
Recognised directly in equity through the statement of other comprehensive income
Within other comprehensive income a tax charge totalling £nil (2013: £1 million) has been recognised relating to foreign exchange 
differences relating to the net investment in foreign operations.
Other short term temporary differences primarily relate to financial assets and liabilities and various accruals and prepayments.
Set-off tax is separately presented to show deferred tax assets and liabilities by category before the effect of offsetting these  
amounts in the statement of financial position where the Group has the right and intention to offset these amounts.
Movement in deferred tax during the current year 
In 2014 movements in net deferred tax liabilities recognised in income in respect of property, plant and equipment were principally  
due to tax allowances utilised in the UK and USA. Net deferred tax asset movements in other short term temporary differences  
were primarily due to increases in financial assets and liabilities, principally in the UK.

2.4  Earnings per share
Basic earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period. 
Diluted earnings per share is calculated by dividing the net profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders by the weighted 
average number of ordinary shares in issue during the period plus the weighted average number of ordinary shares that would be 
issued on the conversion of all dilutive potential ordinary shares into ordinary shares.
Adjusted earnings per share is calculated in the same way except that the profit for the period attributable to ordinary shareholders 
is adjusted for exceptional items (see note 2.2).
The following reflects the income and share data used in the basic and diluted earnings per share computations:

SECTION 2 RESULTS FOR THE YEAR (continued)
52 weeks ended 27 December 2014
In 2013 net deferred tax liabilities in respect of property, plant and equipment decreased because previously unrecognised deferred tax 
assets were recognised in the year, offset by amounts utilised in the period. The previously unrecognised deferred tax assets related 
primarily to unclaimed capital allowances on UK property, plant and equipment where their recoverability was reassessed based on 
expected profitability of the business given the financing changes which occurred during the year. The movement in net deferred tax 
assets in respect of other short term temporary differences primarily related to movements in various accruals and prepayments.  
The movement in deferred tax assets due to losses was as a result of the use of losses in the USA.
Unrecognised deferred tax assets 
The unrecognised deferred tax assets relating to loss carry-forwards include £1 million (2013: £nil) which expire within five years and 
£nil (2013: £1 million) which expire within ten years. The remaining losses and other timing differences do not expire under current  
tax legislation. 
The tax losses arose in jurisdictions which are not expected to generate taxable profits in the foreseeable future and therefore there  
is currently no expectation that the losses will be recognised.
Share incentive schemes (see note 5.8) are treated as dilutive to earnings per share when, at the balance sheet date, the awards are 
both ‘in the money’ and would be issuable had the performance period ended at that date. Accordingly, the PSP has a dilutive effect as 
the performance measures have been partially achieved, whereas the DBP is not dilutive as the awards have not yet been issued, and 
the CSOP is not dilutive as the options are ‘out of the money’ after accounting for the value of services rendered in addition to the 
option price.
For 2013, the PSP performance period had not commenced and the CSOP was ‘out of the money’, therefore no awards were 
treated as dilutive.

Main Contents Financial Statements Contents 3.1  Business combinations 
Accounting policies
When a business combination takes place, the Directors consider the rights and intentions of the directors of both entities and 
the overall controlling parties before and after acquisition to determine who the acquiring party is, and then account for business 
combinations by applying the purchase method. Having determined the acquiring party, any individually identifiable assets, liabilities and 
contingent liabilities acquired are valued. These include the property, plant and equipment and any intangible assets which can be sold 
separately or which arise from legal rights regardless of whether those rights are separable, with any remaining balance being 
assigned to goodwill.
Given the specialised nature of the property, plant and equipment acquired, fair values are calculated on a depreciated replacement 
cost basis. The key estimates are the replacement cost, where industry specific indices are used to restate original historic cost; and 
depreciation, where the total and remaining economic useful lives are considered, together with the residual value of each asset.  
The total estimated lives applied are consistent with those set out in note 4.1. Residual values are based on industry specific indices.
2014
The Group undertook no business combinations during 2014.
2013
Rays Ski Shop
On 9 January 2013 the Group acquired Rays Ski Shop in Victoria, Australia for the consideration of £1 million settled in cash. The net 
assets acquired were £nil. Goodwill arose on this acquisition as it provided an opportunity for the Group to expand its offering to 
customers visiting the Hotham and Falls Creek Ski Resorts.
T urkuazoo Aquarium
On 19 September 2013 the Group acquired the Turkuazoo Aquarium in Istanbul, Turkey for the consideration of £1 million settled in 
cash for 100% of the share capital of Istanbul Sualti Dunyasi Turizm Ticaret A.S. The net assets acquired were £1 million. No goodwill 
arose on this acquisition.
Iconic Images
On 3 December 2013 the Group acquired Iconic Images International Limited for the consideration of £4 million settled in cash. 
The net assets acquired were £nil. Goodwill arose on this acquisition as it provided an opportunity for the Group to expand its retail 
offering on the South Bank, where the London Eye, SEA LIFE London Aquarium and the London Dungeon are all located.
These acquisitions had the following combined effect on the Group’s assets and liabilities: 
4.1  Property, plant and equipment
Accounting policies
Property, plant and equipment (PPE) are stated at cost less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Where components of an item of PPE have different useful lives, they are accounted for separately.
The initial cost of PPE includes all costs incurred in bringing the asset into use and includes external costs for the acquisition, 
construction and commissioning of the asset, internal project costs (primarily staff expenses) and capitalised borrowing costs.  
New sites
Capital expenditure on new attractions includes all the costs of bringing the items of PPE within that attraction into use ready for 
the opening of the attraction. Pre-opening costs are only capitalised to the extent they are required to bring PPE into its working 
condition. Other pre-opening costs are expensed as incurred.
On inception of a lease for a new site, the estimated cost of decommissioning any additions is included within PPE and depreciated 
over the lease term. A corresponding provision is set up as disclosed in note 4.5.
Existing sites
Subsequent expenditure on items of PPE in our existing estate can be broadly split into two categories:
• Capital expenditure which adds new items of PPE to an attraction or which extends the useful life of, or enhances existing items of  
 PPE is accounted for as an addition to PPE. Examples of such expenditure include new rides or displays and enhancements to rides  
 or displays, which increase the appeal of our attractions to visitors.
• Expenditure which is incurred to maintain the items of PPE in a safe and useable state and to maintain the useful life of items of PPE  
 is charged to the income statement as incurred. Examples of such expenditure include regular servicing and maintenance of   
 buildings, rides and displays and ongoing repairs to items of PPE.
Depreciation is charged to the income statement on a straight-line basis over the estimated useful lives of each part of an item of PPE. 
Land is not depreciated. Assets under construction are not depreciated until they come into use, when they are transferred to buildings 
or plant and equipment as appropriate.
The estimated useful lives are as follows:

The goodwill on these transactions was not deductible for tax purposes.
In the period to 28 December 2013 these acquisitions contributed £1 million to the consolidated revenue and a profit of £nil to the 
consolidated underlying operating profit of the Group. Had the acquisitions occurred on 30 December 2012, the estimated Group revenue 
to 28 December 2013 would have been £1,196 million and the estimated underlying operating profit would have been £290 million.

PPE was tested for impairment in accordance with the Group’s accounting policy, as referred to in note 4.3. No impairment charges 
have been made in the current or prior year. No residual values are typically considered.
The Group leases buildings and plant and equipment under finance lease agreements secured on those assets. At 27 December 2014 
the net carrying amount of leased buildings was £18 million (2013: £19 million) and the net carrying amount of leased plant and 
machinery was £34 million (2013: £37 million). Further details in respect of leases and lease obligations are provided in note 5.3.
Capital commitments
At the year end the Group has a number of outstanding capital commitments amounting to £50 million (2013: £35 million), for which 
no provision has been made. These commitments are expected to be settled within two financial years of the reporting date.
In addition to the contractual commitments disclosed above, the Group intends to invest circa £53 million in LEGOLAND Japan 
and circa £57 million in LEGOLAND Korea over the period from 2014 to 2017, as previously announced.
4.2  Goodwill and intangible assets
Accounting policies
Goodwill represents the difference between the cost of an acquisition and the fair value of the net identifiable assets acquired and any 
contingent liabilities assumed. Goodwill is stated at cost less any accumulated impairment losses. Goodwill is allocated to groups of 
cash-generating units and is not amortised but is tested annually for impairment. In respect of joint ventures, the carrying amount of 
goodwill is included in the carrying amount of the investment in the joint venture.
Where they arise on acquisition, brands have been valued based on discounted future cash flows using the relief from royalty method, 
including amounts into perpetuity. Currently all such brands held are regarded as having indefinite useful economic lives. This is based 
upon the strong historical performance of the brands over a number of economic cycles, the demonstrable ‘chaining’ of brands, and the 
Directors’ intentions regarding the future use of brands. The Directors feel this is a suitable policy for a brands business which invests in 
and maintains the brands, and foresee no technological developments or competitor actions which would put a definite life on the 
brands. The brands are tested annually for impairment.
Expenditure on internally generated goodwill and brands is recognised in the income statement as an expense as incurred.
Other intangible assets comprise software licences, sponsorship rights and other contract based intangible assets. They are 
amortised on a straight-line basis from the date they are available for use. They are stated at cost less accumulated amortisation 
and impairment losses. 
The estimated useful lives of other intangible assets are as follows:

4.3  Impairment testing
Accounting policies
The carrying amounts of the Group’s goodwill, intangible assets and PPE are reviewed annually to determine whether there is any 
indication of impairment. If any such indication exists or if the asset has an indefinite life, the asset’s recoverable amount is estimated. 
The process of impairment testing is to estimate the recoverable amount of the assets concerned, and recognise an impairment loss 
whenever the carrying amount of those assets exceeds the recoverable amount.
The level at which the assets concerned are reviewed varies as follows:
Merlin Entertainments plc Annual Report and Accounts 201 4
125 124
Main Contents Financial Statements Contents 4.3  Impairment testing (continued) 
For assets that do not generate largely independent cash inflows, the recoverable amount is determined for the CGU to which 
the assets belong.
Impairment losses are recognised in the income statement. They are allocated first to reduce the carrying amount of goodwill, 
and then to reduce the carrying amount of other intangible assets and other assets on a pro rata basis.
Calculation of recoverable amount
In accordance with accounting standards the recoverable amount of an asset is the greater of its value in use and its fair value less costs 
to sell. T o assess value in use, estimated future cash flows are discounted to their present value using an appropriate pre-tax discount 
rate. The Group uses a multiple of EBITDA to estimate fair value. This multiple is based on the Group’s average market capitalisation 
as a multiple of the Group’s underlying EBITDA. The Group’s internally approved five year business plans are used as the basis for 
these calculations, with cash flows beyond the five year business plan horizon then extrapolated using a long term growth rate. 
Common assumptions have been adopted for the purpose of testing goodwill across the business and for testing brand values as their 
risk profiles are similar. The key assumptions and estimates used when calculating the net present value of future cash flows from the 
Group’s businesses are as follows: 
4.4  Working capital 
Accounting policies
Inventories
Inventories are stated at the lower of cost and net realisable value. Cost is measured using the first-in first-out principle and 
includes expenditure incurred in acquiring the inventories and bringing them to their present location and condition. 
Trade and other receivables
Trade receivables are recognised and carried at the original invoice amount less an allowance for any amounts considered by 
management to be uncollectible. Bad debts are written off when identified. Other receivables are stated at their amortised cost 
less impairment losses. 
Inventories 
SECTION 4 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (continued)  
52 weeks ended 27 December 2014
SECTION 4 OPERATING ASSETS AND LIABILITIES (continued)
52 weeks ended 27 December 2014
Projecting future growth involves a degree of judgement and uncertainty. The Group operates in geographically and politically 
diverse areas and although the Group has attained knowledge from the past performance of opening new attractions, inevitably 
the performance of new attractions, particularly in new markets, can be difficult to accurately predict. Similarly, the exposure of 
certain attractions to macro-economic volatility can give rise to uncertainties in these projections.
No impairment losses were recorded in 2014 or 2013. The Directors consider that no reasonably foreseeable change in any of the 
above key assumptions, in particular the discount rate and growth rate assumptions used, would significantly alter the outcome of 
the Group’s impairment testing.
Estimate
Future cash flows Assumed to be equivalent to the operating cash flows of the businesses less the cash flows in respect of capital 
expenditure. The Group uses EBITDA as a proxy for the operating cash flows of its attractions as they are not 
significantly impacted by movements in working capital.
Growth in EBITDA EBITDA is forecast by an analysis of both projected revenues and costs. Visitor numbers and revenue 
projections are based on market analysis, including the total available market, historic trends, competition 
and site development activity, both in terms of capital expenditure on rides and attractions as well as marketing 
activity. Operating costs projections are based on historical data, adjusted for variations in visitor numbers 
and planned expansion of site activities as well as general market conditions.
Timing and quantum of future 
capital and maintenance 
expenditure
Projections are based on the attractions’ long term development plans, taking into account the capital investment 
necessary to maintain and sustain the performance of the attractions’ assets.
Long term growth rates A growth rate of 2.5% (2013: 2.5%) was determined based on management’s long term expectations, taking account 
of historical averages and future expected trends in both market development and market share growth.
Discount rates to reflect  
the risks involved
Based on the estimated weighted average cost of capital of a ‘market participant’ within the main geographical 
regions where the Group operates, these are drawn from market data and businesses in similar sectors, and 
adjusted for asset specific risks. The key assumptions of the ‘market participant’ include the ratio of debt to equity 
financing, risk free rates and the medium term risks associated with equity investments. Net present values are 
calculated using an appropriate pre-tax discount rate of between 9.4% and 13.1% (2013: 9.4% and 12.6%), derived 
from the Group’s post-tax weighted average cost of capital of between 7.4% and 9.7% (2013: 7.4% and 9.3%).
Sensitivity analysis Impairment reviews and calculation of recoverable amounts are typically sensitive to changes in key assumptions, 
particularly relating to discount rates and EBITDA growth. At 27 December 2014 if the estimated EBITDA  
levels used in the value in use calculations had been 1% lower or the discount rate used been 0.1% higher  
no impairment charges would have arisen.

4.5  Provisions 
Accounting policy
Provisions are recognised when the Group has legal or constructive obligations as a result of past events and it is probable that 
expenditure will be required to settle those obligations. They are measured at the Directors’ best estimates, after taking account 
of information available and different possible outcomes.
If the effect is material, provisions are determined by discounting the expected future cash flows at a pre-tax rate that reflects 
current market assessments of the time value of money and, where appropriate, the risks specific to the liability.
Provisions 
Accruals 
Accruals comprises balances in relation to both operating and capital costs incurred at the balance sheet date but for which an 
invoice has not been received and payment has not yet been made.
Deferred income
Deferred income comprises revenues received or invoiced at the balance sheet date which relate to future periods. The main 
components of deferred income relate to advanced ticket revenues in respect of online bookings and annual pass purchases; 
pre-booked accommodation; and certain sponsorship and similar arrangements.

Asset retirement provisions
Certain attractions operate on leasehold sites and these provisions relate to the anticipated costs of removing assets and restoring 
the sites concerned at the end of the lease term. These leases are typically of a duration of between ten and 60 years.
They are established on inception and discounted back to present value with the discount then being unwound through the 
income statement as part of finance costs. They are reviewed at least annually.
Other 
Other provisions largely relate to the estimated cost arising from open insurance claims, tax matters and legal issues. As a result of 
changes in circumstances during the year, certain provisions were reclassified from current to non-current. 
There are no anticipated future events that would be expected to cause a material change in the timing or amount of outflows 
associated with the provisions.

5.1  Net debt 
Analysis of net debt
Net debt is the total amount of cash and cash equivalents less interest-bearing loans and borrowings and finance lease liabilities. Cash 
and cash equivalents comprise cash balances, call deposits and other short term liquid investments such as money market funds which 
are subject to an insignificant risk of a change in value. 
5.2  Borrowings (continued) 
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Restricted funds of £6 million (2013: £6 million) are included in cash and cash equivalents. 
5.2  Borrowings
Accounting policy
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings
Interest-bearing loans and borrowings are initially recognised at fair value, being consideration received less any directly attributable 
transaction costs. Thereafter, interest-bearing loans and borrowings are stated at amortised cost with any difference between cost 
and redemption value being recognised in the income statement over the period of the borrowings on an effective interest rate basis. 
T o calculate this effective interest rate the Group estimates the expected future gearing during the life of the facility based on the 
Group’s business plans and forecasts, and expected future interest rates. This includes the amortisation of all transaction costs over 
the same period. The Group assesses whether the terms of the borrowings provide a clear commercial incentive or a contractual 
commitment to repay them over a specific period that is shorter than the contractual life of the facility, or if the Group’s current plans 
or forecasts suggest an early repayment or refinancing is probable. If this is the case the Group will adopt that as the period used for the 
purposes of the effective interest rate calculations. If neither of these conditions exists the Group calculates its effective interest rate and 
hence amortises transaction costs based on the contractual term of the facility. If the Group determines that a different date should 
be adopted for the purposes of the effective interest rate calculations, the resulting adjustment is recognised as a gain or loss on 
re-measurement and presented separately in the income statement.
If the Group modifies its debt arrangements, it considers how substantive the change is in determining the appropriate accounting. 
This includes both qualitative analysis, and quantitative analysis of the level of change in the cash flows of the new and old arrangements.

Terms and debt repayment schedule
This table provides information about the contractual terms of the Group’s interest-bearing loans and borrowings. The principal value 
is the amount of debt owing at the end of the accounting period. The carrying value is measured at amortised cost, and presents the 
principal value as adjusted for any prepaid loan issue costs that are being amortised over the term of the facility.  
In 2013 the Group entered into an amendment of its existing bank facility that extended the contractual date of repayment from July 
2017 to July 2019. The Group accounted for this amendment on a continuation basis, reflecting management’s judgement that this 
was a non-substantive change to the existing facility. The terms of the Group’s borrowings provided no clear commercial incentive or 
contractual commitment to repay them over a specific period that was shorter than the contractual life of the facility. Accordingly, the 
Group calculated its effective interest rate and estimated the period for amortisation of financing costs based on that contractual term. 
The Group determined at 27 December 2014 that a more reliable estimate could be formed of the likelihood and timeframe for an 
earlier refinancing. This was determined following reviews undertaken by management and external advisors of refinancing options. 
As a result the Group has accelerated the amortisation of financing costs and the resulting adjustment has been recognised as a loss 
on re-measurement and separately presented in the income statement as an exceptional charge of £23 million (see note 2.2).   
Subsequent to the year end, the Group has secured a new banking facility that, once drawn, will replace the existing debt facilities 
(see note 6.7).
The existing loans are secured by fixed charges over the shares in certain Group companies and certain intra-group receivables. The 
nominal interest rate for secured bank loans in the table above represents the floating interest rate, including applicable margin, which 
prevailed at the reporting date. The Group uses interest rate swaps to hedge its interest rate exposure and these are described in note 5.4.

5.3  Lease obligations
Accounting policies
Leases in which the Group assumes substantially all the risks and rewards of ownership of the leased asset are classified as finance 
leases. All other leases are classified as operating leases. Where land and buildings are held under finance leases the accounting 
treatment of the land is considered separately from that of the buildings. Leased assets acquired by way of finance lease are stated 
at an amount equal to the lower of their fair value and the present value of the minimum lease payments at inception of the lease, 
less accumulated depreciation and impairment losses.
Finance lease payments
Minimum lease payments are apportioned between the finance charge and the reduction of the outstanding liability. The finance charge 
is allocated during the lease term so as to produce a constant periodic rate of interest on the remaining balance of the liability.
Operating lease payments
Payments made under operating leases are recognised in the income statement on a straight-line basis over the term of the lease. Lease 
incentives received and predetermined non-contingent rent increases are recognised in the income statement as an integral part of the 
total lease expense over the lease term. This therefore excludes the potential impact of future performance or rent increases based on 
inflationary indices.
Lease arrangements
The Group’s most significant lease arrangements relate to a sale and leaseback transaction undertaken during 2007, involving the 
property, plant and equipment of certain attractions within the Midway Attractions and Resort Theme Parks Operating Groups.   
The leases are accounted for as finance or operating leases depending on the specific circumstances of each lease and the nature of 
the attraction. For certain of the sites an individual lease agreement is split for accounting purposes as a combination of finance and 
operating leases, reflecting the varied nature of assets at the attraction. During 2012 the Group undertook a further sale and 
leaseback transaction of the LEGOLAND Windsor Hotel. This is being accounted for as an operating lease.
Each of these sale and lease back agreements runs for a period of 35 years from inception and allows for annual rent increases based 
on the inflationary index in the United Kingdom and fixed increases in Continental Europe. The Group has the option, but is not 
contractually required, to extend each of the lease agreements individually for two further terms of 35 years, subject to an 
adjustment to market rates at that time.  
The Group also enters into operating leases for sites within the Midway Attractions Operating Group and central areas. These are 
typically of a duration between ten and 60 years, with rent increases determined based on local market practice. In addition to a fixed 
rental element, rents within the Midway Attractions Operating Group can also contain a performance related element, typically based on 
turnover at the site concerned. Options to renew leases exist at these sites in line with local market practice in the territories concerned. 
The key contractual terms in relation to each lease are considered when calculating the rental charge over the lease term. The potential 
impact on rent charges of future performance or increases based on inflationary indices are each excluded from these calculations.
There are no significant operating restrictions placed on the Group as a result of its lease arrangements.
Lease costs and commitments
During 2014 £86 million (2013: £83 million) was recognised as an expense in the income statement in respect of operating leases. 
Of this £12 million (2013: £11 million) was contingent on performance.
The lease commitments in the following tables run to the end of the respective lease term and do not include possible lease renewals.  
Where relevant, the lease commitments noted do not include the potential impact of future performance or rent increases based on 
inflationary indices.
5.3  Lease obligations (continued)
The tables below set out the total future lease obligations of the Group:
Finance leases
These tables provide information about the future minimum lease payments and contractual terms of the Group’s finance lease 
liabilities, as follows: 
The nominal interest rate for finance leases in the table above represents the weighted average effective interest rate. This is used 
because the table above aggregates finance leases with the same maturity date and currency.  
Operating leases
The minimum rentals payable as lessee under non-cancellable operating leases are as follows: 
The Group has also entered into lease agreements as part of the developments of LEGOLAND Japan and LEGOLAND Korea which 
are being developed under the Group’s ‘operated and leased’ model. Following the opening of the parks in 2017, the Group’s local 
operating company in each territory will lease the site and park infrastructure from each of the development partners for a period 
of 50 years. The leases will be accounted for as finance or operating leases depending on the specific circumstances of each lease 
and the nature of the assets at the attractions.

5.4  Derivative financial instruments
Accounting policies
The Group holds derivative financial instruments primarily to hedge its foreign currency and interest rate exposures.
Interest rate swaps and foreign exchange contracts 
Derivatives are recognised initially at fair value and attributable transaction costs are recognised in profit or loss as incurred. Thereafter 
changes in fair value are recognised immediately in the income statement, except where the Group adopts hedge accounting as 
described below.
The fair value of interest rate swaps is determined by reference to market rates at the end of the accounting period. It is the estimated 
amount that the Group would receive or pay to exit the swap at the end of the reporting period, taking into account current interest 
rates, credit risks and bid/ask spreads.  
The fair value of foreign exchange contracts is the present value of future cash flows and is determined by reference to market rates 
at the end of the accounting period.
Hedge accounting
The Group has designated its interest rate swaps as hedges against variable cash flows resulting from fluctuations in interest rates. 
On initial designation of the hedge, the Group formally documents the relationship between the hedging instruments and hedged items, 
including the risk management objectives and strategy in undertaking the hedge transaction, and the methods that will be used to assess 
the effectiveness of the hedging relationship. The Group makes an assessment, both at the inception of the hedge relationship as well as 
on an ongoing basis, as to whether the hedging instruments are expected to be ‘highly effective’ in offsetting the changes in the fair value 
or cash flows of the respective hedged items during the period for which the hedge is designated, and whether the actual results of 
each hedge are within a range of 80-125%. Effectiveness testing is performed using regression analysis at inception and on a regular 
basis thereafter.
The effective portion of changes in fair value of the derivative is recognised in other comprehensive income and presented in the 
hedging reserve in equity. Any ineffective portion of changes in the fair value of the derivative is recognised immediately in profit or loss. 
The amount recognised in other comprehensive income is removed and included in profit or loss in the same period as the hedged 
cash flows affect profit or loss, and under the same line item in the statement of comprehensive income as the hedged item.
If the hedging instrument no longer meets the criteria for hedge accounting, cumulative gains or losses previously recognised in other 
comprehensive income would be recognised immediately in profit or loss.

5.5  Finance income and costs
Accounting policies
Income and costs
Finance income comprises interest income, applicable foreign exchange gains and gains on hedging instruments that are recognised in 
the income statement. Finance costs comprise interest expense, finance charges on finance leases, applicable foreign exchange losses and 
losses on hedging instruments that are recognised in the income statement. Interest income and interest expense are recognised as they 
accrue, using the effective interest method. 
Capitalisation of borrowing costs
The Group capitalises borrowing costs directly attributable to the acquisition, construction or production of assets taking a substantial 
period of time to get ready for their intended use as part of the cost of that asset. 
Net investment in foreign entities
On consolidation, exchange differences arising from the translation of the net investment in foreign entities, and of borrowings and 
other currency instruments designated as hedges of such investments, are taken to equity. The Group treats specific intercompany loan 
balances, which are not intended to be repaid in the foreseeable future, as part of its net investment. In the event of a foreign entity 
being sold or a hedging item being extinguished, such exchange differences would be recognised in the income statement as part of 
the gain or loss on sale.

5.6  Financial risk factors and fair value analysis (continued)
Interest rate swaps have a fixed leg and a floating leg; they have been classified as fixed rate financial liabilities in the table above as 
the fair value of the swaps is dependent on the fixed rate.  
Fair value sensitivity analysis 
This analysis shows the Group’s sensitivity to changes in interest rates. It is calculated by measuring the impact on profit and loss or 
equity of a change in the present value of interest rate swaps. This assumes a shift in the yield curve of +/- 50 basis points (bp) 
(2013: 50bp).
If interest rates had been 50bp higher/lower and all other variables were held constant, the impact would be as follows: 
Capitalised borrowing costs amounted to £2 million in 2014 (2013: £2 million), with a capitalisation rate of 4.2% (2013: 6.8%). 
Tax relief on capitalised borrowing costs amounted to £1 million in 2014 (2013: £1 million).
Recognised in consolidated statement of other comprehensive income
Foreign currency translation differences relating to the net investment in foreign operations amounted to a profit of £7 million in 2014 
(2013: loss of £8 million). They are stated before attributable income tax (note 2.3).
5.6  Financial risk factors and fair value analysis
Interest rate risk
Interest rate risk is the risk that the Group is impacted by changes in interest rates. At 27 December 2014 the Group had floating rate 
debt in Sterling, Euros, US Dollars and Australian Dollars.
The Group hedges its cash flow exposure to its floating rate loans with interest rate swaps. At the reporting date, over the next three 
years an average of 55% (2013: 70%) of the secured bank loans were hedged in this way.

Cash flow sensitivity analysis
This analysis shows the sensitivity of the Group’s cash flows to changes in interest rates by comparing the expected annual interest 
expense/income which would apply to year end balances at year end interest rates, to the annual expense/income which would arise 
had interest rates been 50bp higher. 
This analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
A decrease of 50bp would result in a loss of £1 million (2013: loss of £1 million).
Liquidity risk
Liquidity risk is the risk that the Group would not have sufficient funds to meet its financial obligations as they fall due. The Group’s 
Treasury Department produces short term and long term cash forecasts to identify liquidity requirements and headroom, which are 
reviewed by the Group’s Chief Financial Officer. Surplus cash is actively managed across Group bank accounts to cover local shortfalls 
or invested in bank deposits or liquidity funds. In some jurisdictions bank cash pooling arrangements are in place to optimise the use 
of cash. As at the balance sheet date the Group had access to a revolving credit facility of £150 million (2013: £150 million) in addition 
to its existing borrowings to meet any shortfalls.  
At 27 December 2014, the Group had cash and cash equivalents of £285 million (2013: £264 million) together with this revolving credit 
facility, which can be used to meet its contractual cash flows.

Foreign currency risk
The Group operates internationally with its operating assets, revenues and costs denominated primarily in the functional currencies of 
the relevant local territories. The Group is exposed to foreign currency risk on cash flows that are not denominated in an entity’s local 
currency and to the translation of non-Sterling earnings. Net foreign exchange cash flow exposures, where material, are hedged by 
foreign exchange transactions. 
The translation exposures to foreign currency earnings are hedged by bank debt denominated in the Group’s principal currencies in 
ratios intended to provide a match between funding requirements and the cash generation capabilities of the Group’s operations in 
each of its locations. The principal currencies are Sterling, Euros, US Dollars and Australian Dollars.
The Group’s financial instruments are set out by currency on the following page.
The Group treats certain external and intercompany loans as net investment hedging instruments. These hedge the impact of foreign 
exchange movements that would otherwise occur on both external and intercompany borrowings where the balance is not in the 
currency of the individual entity concerned. At 27 December 2014 the Group had hedged the following loans: 
Translation movements on these loans are shown in other comprehensive income, see note 5.5.
Foreign currency sensitivity analysis
The following tables show the sensitivity to a 10% strengthening/weakening of Sterling against all foreign currencies at the reporting date. 
The Group’s sensitivity to foreign exchange rates is calculated by retranslating monetary assets and liabilities which are held in currencies 
other than the functional currencies of the reporting entities using exchange rates which have been flexed by +/- 10% from the Sterling 
exchange rates existing at the end of the reporting period. Where the Group has designated specific monetary assets or liabilities as 
hedging instruments that are hedging underlying foreign exchange exposures, this has been taken account of. The sensitivity analysis for 
forward foreign exchange contracts uses a discounted cash flow technique applying a 10% strengthening/weakening of Sterling against 
foreign currencies to which the group is exposed. The analysis assumes that all other variables remain constant.
The following table sets out the contractual maturities of financial liabilities, including interest payments and excluding the impact of 
netting agreements. This analysis assumes that interest rates prevailing at the reporting date remain constant.

SECTION 5 CAPITAL STRUCTURE AND FINANCING (continued)
52 weeks ended 27 December 2014
A 10% strengthening/weakening of Sterling would have no impact on the hedging reserve.
Certain financial assets and liabilities of the Group are held by entities operating with a functional currency other than Sterling and do 
not have a base in local functional currency or Sterling. Accordingly, these instruments are sensitive to movements in foreign exchange 
rates but are not impacted by a strengthening or weakening of Sterling as presented above. The impact on profit/(loss) would be a loss 
of £4 million following a 10% strengthening of the relevant functional currency and would be a profit of £3 million following 10% 
weakening of the relevant functional currency.
Credit risk
Credit risk is the risk of financial loss to the Group if a customer or counterparty to a financial instrument fails to meet its contractual 
obligations. Credit risk is limited to the carrying value of the Group’s monetary assets. The Group has very limited credit risk with its 
customers, the vast majority of whom pay in advance or at the time of their visit, however there are credit policies in place with regard 
to its trade receivables. Credit evaluations are performed on customers requiring credit over a certain amount. 
The Group manages credit exposures in connection with financing and treasury activities including exposures arising from bank deposits, 
cash held at banks and financial and derivative transactions, by appraisal, formal approval and ongoing monitoring of the credit position of 
counterparties. Counterparty exposures are measured against a formal transaction limit appropriate to that counterparty’s credit position. 
Fair values
Basis for determining fair values
Derivatives
Derivatives are carried at fair value, as defined in note 5.4.
Non-derivative financial assets
The fair value of trade and other receivables is estimated as the present value of future cash flows, discounted at the market rate of 
interest at the reporting date.
Non-derivative financial liabilities
Market values have been used to determine the fair values of secured bank loans. Where market values are not available, or are not 
reliable, fair values have been calculated by discounting cash flows at prevailing interest rates. For finance leases the market rate of 
interest is determined by reference to similar lease agreements.

are as follows:
5.7  Equity and capital management
Capital management
The capital structure of the Group consists of debt which includes borrowings (see note 5.2), cash and cash equivalents and equity 
attributable to equity holders of the parent company, as disclosed below. The Group’s objective when managing capital is to maintain 
a strong capital base so as to maintain investor and creditor confidence and to sustain future development of the business; to provide 
returns for shareholders; and to optimise the capital structure to reduce the cost of capital. There are no externally imposed capital 
requirements on the Group.
T o enable the Group to meet its objective, the Directors monitor returns on capital through constant review of earnings generated 
from the Group’s capital investment programme and through regular budgeting and planning processes, manage capital in a manner 
so as to ensure that sufficient funds for capital investment and working capital are available, and the requirements of the Group’s 
debt covenants are met.
The Group does not routinely make additional issues of capital, other than for the purpose of raising finance to fund significant 
acquisitions or developments intended to increase the overall value of the Group.
Share schemes have been created to allow employees of the Group to participate in the ownership of the Group’s equity instruments, 
in order to ensure employees are focused on growing the value of the Group to achieve the aims of all the shareholders.

Fair value hierarchy
The Group analyses financial instruments carried at fair value by utilising one of the three following valuation methods:
• Level 1: quoted prices (unadjusted) in active markets for identical assets or liabilities.
• Level 2: inputs other than quoted prices included within Level 1 that are observable for assets or liabilities, either directly  
 (i.e. as prices) or indirectly (i.e. derived from prices).
• Level 3: inputs for assets or liabilities that are not based on observable market data (unobservable inputs).
At 27 December 2014 the Group had £11 million (2013: £3 million) of derivative financial liabilities classified as Level 2. 
At 27 December 2014 the Group had £6 million (2013: £3 million) of investments classified as Level 3. These are a £3 million investment 
made in 2014 in the consortium company developing LEGOLAND Korea and an investment in IDR Resorts Sdn. Bhd (IDR) acquired 
for £3 million in 2013, as disclosed in note 6.1. IDR and its subsidiaries are deemed to be related parties as the Group is committed to 
subscribing for share capital in IDR which together with its subsidiaries owns LEGOLAND Malaysia (see note 6.3).
There have been no transfers between levels in 2014 (2013: nil). No other financial instruments are held at fair value. If the secured 
bank loans were held at fair value they would be classified as Level 1.
Issue of new shares
2014
There was no issuance of new shares in 2014.

On 13 November 2013 the Company became listed on the London Stock Exchange and the issue of 63,492,064 ordinary shares for a 
total consideration of £200 million became unconditional. £7 million of directly attributable costs were recorded in equity in retained 
earnings. Costs not directly attributable to the issue of new shares were charged to the income statement.
On 13 November 2013 the Company issued 253,968 ordinary shares to certain Non-executive Directors for consideration of £1 million.
Ordinary shares
The holders of ordinary shares are entitled to receive dividends as declared from time to time and are entitled to one vote per share at 
general meetings of the Company.
Each ordinary share in the capital of the Company ranks equally in all respects. No shareholder holds shares carrying special rights 
relating to the control of the Company. However, the Company has entered into Relationship Agreements with each of the pre-IPO 
major shareholders, KIRKBI, Blackstone and CVC in connection with the exercise of their rights as major shareholders in the 
Company and their right to appoint Directors to the Board.
The nominal value of shares in issue is shown in share capital, with any additional consideration for those shares shown in share premium.
An interim dividend of 2.0 pence per share was paid on 25 September 2014 (2013: nil). The Directors of the Company propose a final 
dividend of 4.2 pence per share for the year ended 27 December 2014 (2013: nil).  
Capital reserve
Balances arose in the capital reserve when the Group’s previous parent company, Merlin Entertainments S.à r.l. arranged its own 
acquisition by Merlin Entertainments plc, a new legal parent. The balances represented the difference between the value of the equity 
structure of the previous and new parent companies. 
On 26 February 2014 the Company reduced its share capital by means of a court sanctioned reduction of capital, which resulted in an 
increase in available reserves for distribution by way of dividends to shareholders in the amount of £3,183 million. When the capital 
position of the parent company was rearranged the capital reserve was adjusted appropriately such that the equity balances presented 
in the Group accounts best reflect the underlying structure of the Group’s capital base.
Translation reserve
The translation reserve comprises all foreign exchange differences arising from the translation of the financial statements of foreign operations.
Hedging reserve
The hedging reserve comprises the effective portion of the cumulative net change in the fair value of cash flow hedging instruments 
related to hedged transactions that have not yet occurred.
5.8  Share-based payment transactions
Accounting policy
The fair value of equity-settled share-based payments is recognised as an employee expense with a corresponding increase in equity. 
The fair value is measured at grant date and charged as the employees become unconditionally entitled to the rights.
The Group’s equity-settled share plans are settled either by the issue of shares by Merlin Entertainments plc or by the purchase of 
shares in the market. The fair value of the share plans is recognised as an expense over the expected vesting period net of deferred tax 
with a corresponding entry to retained earnings. The fair value of the share plans is determined at the date of grant. Non-market based 
vesting conditions (i.e. earnings per share and return on capital employed targets) are taken into account in estimating the number of 
awards likely to vest. The estimate of the number of awards likely to vest is reviewed at each accounting date up to the vesting date, at 
which point the estimate is adjusted to reflect the actual awards issued. No adjustment is made after the vesting date even if the awards 
are forfeited or are not exercised.
The Group operates cash-settled versions of the employee incentive schemes for employees in certain territories. The issues and 
resulting charges of these schemes are not material to the financial statements. 
5.8  Share-based payment transactions (continued) 
Equity-settled schemes
The Group operates four employee share incentive schemes: the Performance Share Plan (PSP), the Company Share Option Plan 
(CSOP), the All Employee Sharesave Plan (AESP) and the Deferred Bonus Plan (DBP) as set out in the Directors’ Remuneration Report 
and the tables below. A summary of the rules for the schemes and the performance conditions attaching to the PSP are given in the 
Directors’ Remuneration Report.

A description of the key assumptions used in calculating the share-based payments is as follows:
• The binomial valuation methodology is used for the PSP and CSOP schemes. The Black-Scholes model is used to value the AESP . 
• Due to insufficient trading history in the Group’s shares, the expected volatility is based on a portfolio of comparator companies.
• The risk free rate is equal to the prevailing UK Gilts rate at grant date, which is commensurate with the expected term.
• Expected forfeiture rates are based on recent experience of staff turnover levels.
• Behavioural expectations have been estimated in estimating the award life.
• The charge is spread over the vesting period on a straight-line basis.
Equity-settled schemes (closed)
The Group previously operated equity-settled schemes that enabled certain senior employees to acquire B class ordinary shares in 
Merlin Entertainments S.à r.l. at market value. Market value was determined based on an analysis of profit multiples in the Group’s 
industry sector. At the discretion of the CEO further shares could also be granted in recognition of long service and/or 
outstanding contribution. These shares vested on the IPO of the Company in November 2013.

6.2  Employee benefits
Accounting policies
Defined contribution pension schemes
In the case of defined contribution schemes, the Group pays fixed contributions into a separate fund on behalf of the employee and has 
no further obligations to employees. The risks and rewards associated with this type of scheme are assumed by the members rather 
than the employer. Obligations for contributions to defined contribution pension schemes are recognised as an expense in the income 
statement as incurred. 
Defined benefit pension schemes
A defined benefit scheme is a post-employment benefit scheme other than a defined contribution scheme. The Group’s net obligation 
is calculated for each scheme by estimating the amount of future benefit that employees have earned in return for their service in the 
current and prior periods. That benefit is discounted to determine its present value and offset by the fair value of any scheme assets. 
The calculation is performed by a qualified actuary using the projected unit credit method.
All actuarial gains and losses are recognised in the period they occur directly in equity through other comprehensive income.
Defined contribution pension schemes
The Group operates a number of defined contribution pension schemes and the total expense relating to those schemes in the current 
year was £10 million (2013: £10 million).
Defined benefit pension schemes
The principal scheme that the Group operates is a closed scheme for certain former UK employees of The Tussauds Group, which was 
acquired in 2007. The scheme entitles retired employees to receive an annual payment based on a percentage of final salary for each 
year of service that the employee provided. The pension schemes have not directly invested in any of the Group’s own financial 
instruments or in properties or other assets used by the Group.
The most recent full actuarial valuation of the scheme was carried out as at 1 January 2013. As a result, the Group agreed to pay deficit 
reduction contributions of £455,500 per annum until 2018, together with an additional one-off payment of £350,000 to be paid before 
1 March 2014.
The Group expects £1 million in contributions to be paid to its defined benefit schemes in 2015. The weighted average duration of  
the defined benefit obligation at 27 December 2014 was 22 years.

income was a loss of £2 million (2013: £nil). 
The closed Tussauds Group scheme operated a defined contribution section underpinned by a minimum level of benefit. Recent 
experience has indicated that this minimum level of benefit is now giving rise to a deficit; consequently the assets and liabilities 
of the defined contribution section of the scheme have been recognised in the year.

actuarial table used is S1PA. The mortality assumption adopted predicts that a current 65 year old male would have a life expectancy 
to age 85 and a female would have a life expectancy to age 88.

6.5  New standards and interpretations 
The following standards and interpretations, issued by the International Accounting Standards Board (IASB) or the International Financial 
Reporting Interpretations Committee, have been adopted by the Group with no significant impact on its consolidated financial statements:
• IFRS 10 ‘Consolidated financial statements’.
• IFRS 11 ‘Joint arrangements’.
• IFRS 12 ‘Disclosure of interests in other entities’.
• IAS 27 ‘Separate financial statements’.
• IAS 28 ‘Investments in associates and joint ventures’.
• IAS 32 (Amendment) ‘Financial instruments: presentation’ - offsetting financial assets and financial liabilities.
EU endorsed IFRS and interpretations with effective dates after 27 December 2014 relevant to the Group will be implemented in the 
financial year when the standards become effective.
The IASB has issued the following standards, amendments to standards and interpretations that will be effective for the Group as from  
1 January 2015 or after. The Group does not expect any significant impact on its consolidated financial statements from these amendments.
• IAS 19 (Amendment) ‘Employee benefits’ - defined benefit plans: employee contributions.
• IFRS 2 (Amendment) ‘Share-based payment’ - definition of ‘vesting condition’.
• IFRS 3 (Amendment) ‘Business combinations’ - classification and measurement of contingent consideration and scope exclusion  
 for the formation of joint arrangements.
• IFRS 8 (Amendment) ‘Operating segments’ - disclosures on the aggregation of operating segments.
• IFRS 13 (Amendment) ‘Fair value measurement’ - measurement of short term receivables and payables and scope of  
 portfolio exception.
• IAS 16 (Amendment) ‘Property, plant and equipment’ and IAS 38 (Amendment) ‘Intangible assets’ - restatement of accumulated   
 depreciation (amortisation) on revaluation.
• IAS 24 (Amendment) ‘Related party disclosures’ - definition of ‘related party’.
During the year the IASB issued IFRS 15 ‘Revenue from contracts with customers’, which will become effective from the 2017 
accounting period. The Group’s revenue is generated by high volumes of low value transactions, thereby requiring limited judgement 
on accounting for revenue compared to other industry sectors. The Group considers that the implementation of this new standard 
will not have any significant impact on the consolidated financial statements.
6.6  Ultimate parent company information
The largest group in which the results of the Company are consolidated is that headed by Merlin Entertainments plc, incorporated in 
the United Kingdom. No other group financial statements include the results of the Company. 
6.7  Subsequent events
Subsequent to the year end, the Group has secured a new £1,300 million banking facility that, once drawn, will replace the existing debt facilities. 
 
The new senior unsecured facilities will comprise circa £1,000 million in floating rate term debt, with maturities in 2018 and 2020, 
along with an increased £300 million revolving credit facility and lower average margins. The reduction in drawn term debt will be 
funded through the use of circa £130 million of the Group’s existing cash balance. The increased revolving credit line will ensure that 
the Group has adequate committed liquidity facilities to support our seasonality and strategic growth objectives. Under the new 
facilities we will be required to comply with certain financial and non-financial covenants.
6.3  Related party transactions (continued)  
As members of a banking syndicate, certain shareholders (or other parties related to those shareholders) are owners of elements 
of the Group’s bank loan portfolio as described in note 5.2. Balances outstanding at 27 December 2014 are: parties related to KIRKBI 
Invest A/S £49 million (2013: £56 million); funds advised by parties related to Blackstone Capital Partners £33 million (2013: £36 million); 
and funds advised by parties related to CVC Capital Partners £10 million (2013: £31 million). 
Interest is paid and accrued on the same terms as the rest of the banking syndicate as described in note 5.2.
Transactions with key management personnel
Key management of the Group, being the Executive and Non-executive Directors of the Board, the members of the Executive 
Committee and their immediate relatives control 2.1% (2013: 2.6%) of the voting shares of the Company.
The compensation of key management was as follows: 
The comparative figures for 2013 reflect the fact that the Group was under private ownership until the Listing in November of that 
year. Consequently they are not directly comparable with the 2014 figures. In particular, the Board structure changed on Listing with 
a number of new Non-executive Director positions put in place. In addition the reward structure changed, with a different balance 
between ongoing salary and share-based long term incentive plans.
Transactions with other related parties
As part of the agreement for the development and operation of LEGOLAND Malaysia, the Group is committed to subscribing for 
share capital in IDR Resorts Sdn. Bhd. (IDR) which together with its subsidiaries owns the park. On this basis, IDR and its subsidiaries are 
deemed to be related parties. At 27 December 2014 and 28 December 2013 the Group had subscribed for 16,350,300 shares in IDR. 
Transactions entered into, including the purchase and sale of goods, payment of fees and trading balances outstanding at

The Directors have taken advantage of the exemption available under s408 of the Companies Act 2006 and have not presented a profit 
and loss account of the Company.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 1 ‘Cash Flow Statements’ and has not presented a cash flow statement.  
The cash flows of the Company are included in the consolidated financial statements of Merlin Entertainments plc.
The Company has taken advantage of the exemption under FRS 8 ‘Related Party Transactions’ from disclosing transactions with wholly 
owned subsidiaries that are part of the group headed by Merlin Entertainments plc.
A summary of the Company’s significant accounting policies is set out below.
Investments in subsidiaries
Investments in subsidiaries are stated at cost, less provision for impairment. The carrying amount of the Company’s investments in 
subsidiaries is reviewed annually to determine whether there is any indication of impairment. If any such indication exists the investment’s 
recoverable amount is estimated. If the carrying value of the investment exceeds the recoverable amount, the investment is considered 
to be impaired and is written down to the recoverable amount. The impairment loss is recognised in the profit and loss account.
Foreign currency
Foreign currency transactions are translated into the functional currency using the exchange rates prevailing at the dates of the 
transactions. Foreign exchange gains and losses resulting from the settlement of such transactions and from the translation at year end 
exchange rates of monetary assets and liabilities denominated in foreign currencies are recognised in the profit and loss account.
Share-based payments
The fair value of employee share option plans is calculated at the date of grant using the binomial valuation methodology. The resulting 
cost is charged to the parent Company profit and loss account over the vesting period of the schemes. The value of the charge is 
adjusted to reflect the actual and expected levels of vesting of the schemes. Where the Company awards options to employees of 
subsidiary companies, this is treated as a capital contribution.
Debtors
Debtors are recognised initially at fair value and subsequently at amortised cost using the effective interest rate method, less provision 
for impairment.
Financial liabilities and equity instruments
Financial instruments and equity liabilities are classified according to the substance of the arrangements that have been entered into.  
Equity instruments issued by the Company are recorded as the proceeds received net of the direct costs of issuance.
Taxation
Corporation tax is provided on the taxable profit for the period, using the tax rates that have been enacted at the balance sheet date.
Deferred tax is recognised in respect of all timing differences that have originated but not reversed at the balance sheet date and 
would give rise to an obligation to pay more or less tax in the future. After considering forecast future profits, deferred tax assets 
are recognised where it is probable that future taxable profits will be available against which those assets can be utilised. Deferred 
tax is measured on a non-discounted basis at the tax rates that are expected to apply in the periods in which the timing differences 
are expected to reverse, based on the tax rates that have been substantively enacted at the balance sheet date.
Dividends
Dividends are recognised through equity on the earlier of their approval by the Company’s shareholders or their payment.
ii  Employees 
The average number of employees of the Company during the period was seven (2013: six). All employees were Directors 
of the Company.
The employment costs of the Directors of the Company have been borne by Merlin Entertainments Group Limited for their services  
to the Group as a whole. The costs related to these Directors are included within the Directors’ Remuneration Report on pages  
74 to 92. Two Directors accrued benefits under defined contribution schemes during the year (2013: two).
iii  Investment in subsidiary undertaking
Where subsidiary undertakings incur charges for share-based payments in respect of share options and awards granted by the Company, 
a capital contribution in the same amount is recognised as an investment in subsidiary undertakings with a corresponding credit to 
shareholders’ equity.
The subsidiary undertaking at the period end is as follows: 
A full list of Group companies is included in note 6.8. 
iv  Amounts owed by group undertakings
Amounts owed by group undertakings comprise funds loaned by the Company to fellow group undertakings.  
These funds are repayable on demand.
